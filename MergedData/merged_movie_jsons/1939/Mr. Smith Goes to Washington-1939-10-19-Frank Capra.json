One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film.  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na\u00efve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft.  Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies.  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions.  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp.  When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft.  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.This film is wonderful in so many ways.  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil.  In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope.  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.  I was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity.  This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule. Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history.  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power.  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.Jean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies.  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency.  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.This film is a national treasure.  It is in my top 50 list of all time.  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today.

James Stewart plays the innocence and naivety required for the role to perfection while you can genuinely believe that Jean Arthur has actually fallen for him for real. The great Claude Reins fills the boots of the corrupt senator with aplomb while Edward Arnold reminds us of a few of his type that are still around today.

Why Not Filibuster?", "content": "The media and those in Washington, D.C. cringed in 1939 when Frank Capra (Oscar-nominated for directing) come out with \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\". Capra, fresh off amazing successes like \"Lady for a Day\", \"It Happened One Night\", \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", \"Lost Horizon\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\", used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful medium---the motion picture. The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians, but cheers from critics and the audience. As with society, the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way. A U.S. Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma. Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart (Oscar-nominated) is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he won't rock the boat. Stewart, the leader of the Boy Rangers (a local camp association for youngsters), gets blind-sided by many high-ranking officials who have alterior motives (Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular) when his idea for a national boys' camp goes by the wayside. Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own game---creating a filibuster (a never-ending governmental argument for his cause). Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters (love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players) are all terrific throughout. The Oscar-winning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy, drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences. 5 stars out of 5.", "review_date": "2004-04-30", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Capra & Stewart Make It Work Very Well", "content": "Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite, and making it into a satisfying, worthwhile movie. In \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\", they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, and Edward Arnold. It's not quite on the level of \"It's a Wonderful Life\", but it is as good as almost anything else of its kind.Stewart's performance is important right from the beginning - hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure. Even his wide-eyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably. As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further, Stewart is even better.The secondary characters are also important, because the story itself is a rather stylized, though still worthwhile, statement about politics. The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments. Rains contributes a lot as Stewart's troubled colleague, and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role. Arnold plays his devious character well. Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship, keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation.", "review_date": "2004-09-27", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Sure It's Cheesy, But Also Oh So Aspirational", "content": "Critics of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" will call it cheesy, saccharine, and over-the-top in its character portrayals. Truth be told, I really can't call those critiques \"wrong\". But the thing is, this is such an endearing, aspirational film that I'm always able to look past the cheese-factor and enjoy the performances and overall message.For a very basic overview, 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" tells the story of Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a wide-eyed, aww-shucks, country boy rube who gets nominated for a U. S. Senate seat in large part to be a straight-ticket voter for the political machine of Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains). Once in Washington, however, both get a rude awakening: Smith discovers the graft in politics, while Paine begins to realize--to his horror--that Smith isn't just going to \"tow the party line\".This movie remains an all-time classic for me because of the earnestness of its message. It isn't quite as perfect as Capra's more famous \"It's A Wonderful Life\", but I do see similarities between the two pictures. Here, the story strikes such a simple--yet highly emotional--chord. Though deep down I think we all realize that corruption and compromise are likely unavoidable aspects of politics, we like to cling to ideals of honesty and supreme integrity. That is precisely the journey that Smith takes viewers on. This isn't \"politics as it is\", but rather \"politics as we want it to be\", and I think there is equal room for both in politically-minded films.Of course, casting Stewart is the cherry on top of all this. I'm not sure there has been a better individual born to play the Jefferson Smith role. His stuttering, stammering, \"golly gee whiz\" routine is perfect, yet when the chips are down he delivers a filibuster monologue almost guaranteed to have you in tears. Rains is fine as the corrupt Senator and Jean Arthur has a nice sidekick supporting role, but \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" is memorable because of Stewart. I very much liken his performance here to that of Henry Fonda's in \"12 Angry Men\". It's what we all wish we could be like--but know we'll probably never quite get there.The only reason I can't give this a full 10 stars? It was made in 1939--or back when Hollywood didn't really know how to properly end movies other than an emotional flourish and a fade to black. With a less-rushed, more nuanced endgame, this one could have ascended even higher.Overall, though, I consider this to be one of my favorite political films of all time. Make all the gritty, tough governmental thrillers you want (I love some of those too!), but I hold steady that a more aspirational, positive-minded effort like this isn't out-of-date or irrelevant simply because of that nature.", "review_date": "2017-03-04", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Shining a light on corruption", "content": "Frank Capra was an idealist for sure, but he certainly was clear-eyed in seeing some of the darkest problems with humanity and its institutions. At the beginning of this film, he shows us politicians who are firmly in the pocket of special interests, the degree to which is startling. A state governor (Guy Kibbee) is in charge of picking a new senator after one of the two serving for his state has passed away, but it's immediately clear that he operates as a puppet for a big businessman (Edward Arnold), a guy whose clout got the governor his position, and now who expects to call the shots as payback. We see it as one of the fundamental problems of representative government in 1939, just as it is today, so the film is highly, highly relevant.Now it's laughable that the governor would go rogue and put the head of the Boy Rangers, Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart), in there instead, based on the pleading of his children and a coin flip that lands on its edge, but that's the premise of the film. It's an obvious call to clean up Washington, and get decent, upright people in there as representatives, and in delivering this message, Capra does not attempt subtlety or realism. And I may as well say it now before I blab on, it's laughable how the kids play the role they do later in the film too, and how the other senator (Claude Rains) behaves in the end. Maybe the film is pointing out that progress will always depend more on the next generation, and that ultimately it will require those in power to summon their sense of decency and stand up for what's right.One thing I love is just how reverentially Smith treats the job he's about to undertake. First of all, he knows it's not about him. He's also not sure how well he'll do, but says \"I can promise you one thing: I'll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senator.\" After dropping off his crateful of pigeons (lol), we then see him wide-eyed as he tours the landmarks of Washington DC. The shot Capra gets of him beneath the giant statue of Lincoln perfectly captures his humility, and others the deep respect he has for the institution he's going to serve. We get a heavy dose of the ideals the country aspires to, with shots of Lincoln's second inaugural address (\"With malice toward none, with charity for all\") and a recitation of a part of the Gettysburg address by a young boy, while his grandfather and an African-American man look on. It's quite flowery and may have the lip curling of every cynic who sees the film, thinking of all of the times America has done evil in the world, but just about to head into WWII was not one of those times, and regardless, I can't help but admire this scene. If only all of America's representatives went with a reverence for these ideals, respected the institutions from their hearts, and felt real humility and a need to not let down his or her constituents, or the leaders who came before them.Everyone else is aware of how the system in Washington actually works though, including the other senator (Rains), his handler (Eugene Pallette), and his secretary (Jean Arthur). Heck, even the young page who shows him to his seat is savvier. Smith says to the boy, \"I'm just going to sit around and listen,\" meaning that he feels he has a lot to learn and shouldn't go in with guns blazing. The kid answers \"That's the way to get re-elected,\" reflecting how deep the cynicism of the process runs. Later it's parenthetically said that \"You can't count on people voting. Half the time they don't vote.\" These little bits are pointing out the same thing, that while we may decry the state of government, at the same time, to make it better we need to be active participants in it.Stewart is fantastic in the film, with lots of memorable moments, such as when he nervously reads his proposal for a boys camp on the senate floor, and then later when his eyes are opened to deep corruption, which includes his father's friend and mentor, Rains's character. When he takes the Senate floor to filibuster and angrily yells \"No, sir, I will not yield!\" it's a fine, fiery moment, with palpable tension between the two men. I also love the softer scene with Arthur where he channels Walt Whitman in quoting his father, a man who died fighting for the little guy and the free press: \"My dad had the right idea. He had it all worked out. He said: 'Son, don't miss the wonders that surround you. Every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature.' He said, 'Have you ever noticed how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long dark tunnel? Well,' he said, 'always try to see life as if you'd just come out of a tunnel.'\"Arthur turns in a solid performance with her character, who is also inspiring. She knows how congress operates, giving Stewart (and the viewer) a little tutorial, and then coaching him from the balcony. We see that her character is jaded, but that there is still a glimmer of idealism in her, and also a healthy amount of disgust for politics. \"You're half-way decent, you don't belong here,\" she tells Stewart. We see both of these characters go through the inevitable response to the ugliness of politics - considering leaving the aggravation and frustration of it all, because it's the fight of an underdog to try to change it, or to stay and fight, because that's the only way anything will ever change, and what great leaders have had to do too as well. As this is a Capra film, you can guess which one of these paths they take.It's certainly an arduous path, as the political boss is incredibly powerful. There is real evil, greed, and corruption here, and Arnold plays his part perfectly. The scene where he tries to get Smith to play ball is reminiscent of Potter calling George Bailey into his office in 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and has a similar outcome. When Smith stands up in revulsion, the boss immediately turns to Plan B, which is crush him. He does what corrupt and deceitful people in politics have always done - he drums up charges of the very same things he is guilty of against those who oppose them. He also uses his power over the press to wage a misinformation and propaganda war. Maybe you'll recognize these patterns from the present day.The ending is a little messy, and I would have liked it more had Smith somehow been shown swaying the other senators with arguments and reason. How does one reach across the aisle and bridge such a gap of disagreement and entrenched special interests? However, I have to give the film credit for shining a light on corruption in politics, and I loved how its truthful message was so powerful that many offended politicians branded the film as communist propaganda. As Smith says, what's needed in politics is \"plain, ordinary, everyday kindness. And a little looking out for the other fellow too.\" Indeed.", "review_date": "2019-06-30", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Brilliant", "content": "Through a series of fortunate, and unfortunate, events, an unsophisticated local hero, Jefferson Smith, is appointed a US Senator. The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans, some of which aren't entirely ethical, or legal. However, a well-intentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events, a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues, with the shadowy, bullying powerbrokers and with the entire Senate.Brilliant movie from Frank Capra. While Capra also gave us such great movies as It's A Wonderful Life, Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night, this is his greatest work. A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted, told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism. Considering how politics has even further degenerated since 1939, even more relevant today than when it was released in 1939.Clever, engaging plot that doesn't waiver for a second. Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie - every scene is perfect and important. Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals. Wonderful themes and morals too, as you would expect from Frank Capra.Add in some excellent performances, especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders. Both received Oscar nominations, as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the Senate.In all, Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one, for best original screenplay.

And I think that's the way Frank Capra wanted it, in a sense. Perhaps in the time of 1939 America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Government's due (though according to the trivia, it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy \"works\"). But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie, of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings 8-to-80 years olds in attendance. What had me interested throughout, particularly in that climactic, rousing twenty-minute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewart's constant, un-faltering filibuster, is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen. Here is how it SHOULD be done, to an extreme perhaps, in getting things done in government. But at the same time, Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony, keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says. \"Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!\" This is a kind of talent that I'm sure few other filmmakers at the time, or even after, could have pulled off.The rest of the film isn't just Stewart's struggle to be heard as a young, new-in-town senator. It's also a witty, more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should. Basically, the core of the story is the fish-out-of-water type, where Stewart's Jefferson Smith (one of his better Hollywood performances), leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state. He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator (Claude Rains, terrific as always). And there's even a woman (Jean Arthur) in the mix that's growing an interest in him, at first dubious. But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold, as skilled a character actor as could be asked for), Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster, which includes a reading from the Constitution, in-and-out cheers from the Boy Rangers, and general guffaws from the other senators. In other words, it's really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that 'Mr. Smith' is working in, and even at its cheesiest and sometimes most-dated moments, it's a very successful picture for what it wants to do. It's really an equal-opportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical, and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course.", "review_date": "2006-05-20", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "It works in a way no other movie could, THERE IS PROOF", "content": "Now, I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films.

Ironically, Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.\nAs a bumbling, naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington, D.C., Stewart does a fabulous job--although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he's the real thing.All of the supporting players are excellent--especially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him, and Harry Carey (the western actor) as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots, grinning and sometimes stifling a grin, say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.But, as usual in a Capra film, you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending (when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time) is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he'd gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality (such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she'd find him), is hard to swallow until you remind yourself that--hey, this is Capra-corn. Nevertheless, despite some flaws, it's the kind of comedy-drama about Washington, D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed, as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia. It's also a nice lesson in how the Senate works, how bills have to go through committees, the rules of behavior, filibustering, etc. It will leave you with a warm glow--somewhat like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in that respect.Summing up: It's Stewart's show all the way.

I do find it difficult to pick out the best film out of the dozens of classics released in 1939, but of those 50 or 60, \"Mr. Smith\" remains the most prestigious with a message that resonates today. Like the dozens of classics in 1939, this has dozens of moments that are considered among the great scenes in film history. As good as best actor winner Robert Donat was as \"Mr. Chips\", James Stewart is simply far better, going from naive country bumpkin handed a senate seat, his slow education to the corruption, his determination to accomplish something, the crooked obstacles he faces, and the explosion that opens his eyes to the evils standing in his way. Stewart displays many different sides to his character, but one thing is clear: he isn't going to fall down and go boom without fighting. This features an ensemble that rivals 1939's best picture winner, \"Gone With the Wind\", starting with Jean Arthur as his initially cynical assistant, Claude Rains as his long time mentor, Edward Arnold as the power hungry money man (identical to his powerful Nazi like autocrat in \"Meet John Doe\", Guy Kibbee as the governor of Stewart's home state, and Beulah Bondi (in a role she would play many times) as Stewart's mother. Ruth Donnelly as Kibbee's no nonsense wife, Charles Lane as a nosy reporter and Thomas Mitchell as Arthur's confidante are also quite good. The surprise for me is Harry Carey as the speaker of the house who says more with a bang of his gavel and all knowing grin than the rest of the cast does with Robert Riskin's brilliant words. Director Frank Capra has been nicknamed the inventor of \"Capra Corn\", a description of the stories of Cinderella men who rose above their naivete to fight injustice. Rains is described as a villain in this, but he's a villain with a soul, one who forgot why he got into public service in the first place, allowing himself to be manipulated and controlled at the expense of his soul. Stewart's desire to have a boy's camp funded blocks pending bills of Rains and several others, and this results in some violently shocking actions, culminating in the famous filibuster sequence.I believe in fighting for lost causes, so this film means a lot for me. This film means more to me now than it did upon my first viewing of it some 30 years ago. Memories of a family trip to Washington D.C. when I was a boy and a return for a march for a supposed lost cause make the big eyed grins of the young pages and visiting boy scouts all the more emotional.

But there isn't anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith, which are different from what is being expressed today.Is anyone today as idealistic as Mr. Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money, I sadly have to answer that I don't think so.

Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes. Have they?

Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films. Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.This was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do. Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography. He was always great at playing an every-man and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him. Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.Having wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better. Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate. It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care. Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released. But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here.

He wants to do what is best for his constituents. He soon learns that in Washington this is not to be the case. Corruption, patronage et al are alive and well and functioning.Edward Arnold, in a supporting role, is fabulous as the old style political boss. The Stewart character represents what we need as leaders to run this great nation of ours. Some real scene stealing is done by Claude Rains as the other state's senator who has become corrupt. His temperament is perfect for the part. His seething by guilt and his denunciation of his fellow senator shows depth in acting. His outburst at the end of the film is totally memorable. He claims that he has compromised to get what he wants. How far from the truth this really is! Jean Arthur, as the secretary in the know, is truly fabulous as well. Newspapers can learn from this film. They should. Censorship still exists in 2006.Remember that great filibuster scene? Stewart acted his heart out. Though he lost the coveted Oscar here, the Academy rewarded him the following year for the comedy \"The Philadelphia Story.\"This film should be a definite pre-requisite for students in political science classes.", "review_date": "2006-03-07", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Required viewing for anyone elected or appointed for public office.", "content": "Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based).  There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term \"Capra-esque\" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message.  His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic.  And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.A Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor.  They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate.  After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process.  After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC.  Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders.  Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.Although the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt.  The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self.  A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief.  The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact.  There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score.  The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.Obviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was.  The movie showed an ideal, a supposed \"lost cause\" of truth in government.  And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards.  If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches.  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.

Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors, Capra manages to reach into each of our chests, and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings.Jefferson Smith (James Stewart, 'It's A Wonderful Life'), is a young, enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state, but is known throughout it (most especially by the young boys of the region) as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers, Smith has a love of his country and of nature, once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire single-handedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge, Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children, awarding the job to Smith.Smith arrives in Washington, excited and idealistic, no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains, 'Notorious'), a highly-esteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith, however, Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals, seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make \"certain compromises.\" Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek, which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty, the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality, an act that will serve nobody but the power-hungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), informs Smith of these plans, he determinedly attempts to speak his mind, only to be quashed by the almighty \"Taylor Machine.\"Frank Capra, who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners ('It Happened One Night,' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You,' 1938), once again proved his undeniable genius, something he would continue to do throughout his film-making career. One often-cited example involves the romantically-awkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Rather than focusing on faces, as would be the typical style for such a scene, Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat, as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers, frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial close-up ever could!Finally, James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young, idealistic Smith, in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine, despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film, Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse, an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith, ragged and exhausted, determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members, we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much, much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate, but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us.

Unfortunately Mr. Smith is something they've rarely seen and are utterly incapable of understanding: a good and honest man. And a boy scout to boot.The film is corny and filled with pathos.

Such people inevitably do far more to further disenchantment with political causes than do the out and out crooks, if only because they are far more numerous. The story's major weakness in my view is that such an experienced type would use far more subtle tactics to take down and discredit an opponent. The ownership and control of the popular press to stampede the public and smear an individual is another time-honoured occurrence.There is plenty of light relief too with James Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Thomas Mitchell particularly effective.

Chief problem is that there is too much talking, especially in the middle of the film where Capra is content to capture the dialogue in long, static takes.

The great strength of this movie is James Stewart in the role of the newly appointed (much to his surprise) Senator Jefferson Smith, sent to Washington by his unnamed state's governor to fill a vacancy created by the death of the incumbent. Of course, Smith wasn't really appointed by the Governor. The Governor (and Smith's senior Senator) were just tools of the state political machine - a role Smith is expected to fulfil. But he's ill suited to the job. Jefferson was the leader of the Boy Rangers, who's spent his adulthood instilling into the boys pride in America and democracy and who isn't about to give in when he stumbles across corruption being planned by the machine, which then sets out to destroy him as quickly as it made him.Stewart was great in this role. His wide-eyed wonder at seeing Washington for the first time; his social awkwardness and shyness; his genuine humility (not believing that he belongs in the Senate); and finally his growing contempt for the corrupt system he discovers - these are all portrayed absolutely perfectly by Stewart. The movie is his, backed by a strong supporting cast - but it's his.The mix of naivete and cynicism might seem an awkward fit, but it worked surprisingly well. The portrayal of life on the floor of the Senate was also interestingly shown. The \"scandal\" Smith gets embroiled in (as he's framed by the machine) plays out far too quickly to be believable, and yet you feel his anguish and despair over his reputation being attacked and his honesty called into question. In an age in which attack-style politics is now the accepted norm, it was nice to see the decent, honest guy who just wants to do what's right triumph against the corrupt mud-slingers.

When the director Frank Kapra is mentioned, the first thing to come to mind is the successful participation of Stuart and Capra in It's a wonderful life. Indeed, these two films can be associated with each other to stay in the memory of all lovers of classical art. .\nThe story is about Jefferson Smith, a good-hearted, honest-hearted man in his life, who is nominated to serve as a senator in the US Senate to replace the former senator who died. When nominated by power men in America, they expected him to be docile. Be more than a grab in the face of their corrupt exploitative schemes. But Mr. Smith discovers corruption everywhere, putting every man in the Senate under the control of a few of the greedy, big-assed, greedy, despotic men who are unsatisfied with the looting of the country and the exploitation of all the people's resources and projects to serve their own despicable personal interests. So Mr. Smith has to face a whole system of fossilized minds and men to prove that he is right before being overthrown in a dirty way worthy of the malevolence of men who have taken over everything in the country. The story of the film despite its power, but it is very simple and not complicated We are used to it in films described as political and all you do is to waste the viewer in swirls that you might not understand anything about. In this film, the situation is quite the opposite. The issue may not concern many, but it is capable of gaining respect for the viewer from the beginning of the film and drawing it into an extraordinary story, the hero of which can be considered a man of the general public. The excellent script that combines power and simplicity can not be forgotten. It respects the professional cinematic scenes, while simplifying things for those who want fun only. The film's output is really wonderful and may surpass all the films produced in the 1930s. From the existence of a few minor errors in the editing and editing where some of the clips where the pieces are not correct for the viewer, but this does not reduce the technical value of the film, especially we are witnessing in this work crystallize the real classic cinema. James Stewart's performance was at the top, and he gave a performance that could not be described in a few words.\nHe was able to give us an accurate picture of Mr. Smith's simple, intelligent and intelligent personality, at the same time humble, generous and soft-tempered, and not happy to see a mistake without correcting it. The importance of the big film comes from the power of the ideas he poses in his own way, as he cries out against the corruption that has spread everywhere to extend to all the men of power, and even the press and media who have become obedient For the orders of a few people they spread their influence over everything, and did not like the voice of truth to leak out of the Senate chamber.\nBut if we think more, the thing that makes the film much more powerful is that its message transcends Washington and the whole of America, or any particular country because the message of the work is universal and can be seen everywhere. In any country in the world, exploitation can be seen by a small group, and the masses are silenced and blinded to remain like the herds that do not know anything, and all this is managed from the seats of power, newspapers and the media and everything that would prevent the collapse of any corrupt system exploits everything he can to fill \"At the end of the film Mr. Smith stood up after delivering a three-day speech in the Senate exposing the practices of every corrupt man in power and reminding officials of their duties to the citizens and the country. Then came the piles of messages from the citizens, approached Mr. \"Smith\" from these piles, opened a letter, discovered fraud, and saw with his eyes the killing of freedom and repression of the honorable, looked around him and saw corrupt officials are laughing around him .. No one with him .. Even the friend of his father Betrayed them .. look at them a recent look, and then fell to the ground .. A scene actually translated summarize the real happenings in front of us every day, but we manage her necks, and look away and go as if nothing was .. The right always in a war with corruption and injustice, and perhaps tired He demanded the truth and wished without finding anyone to help him. But in the end, the truth must prevail as it did at the end of the film.

He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country, and, even more so, his people. In Jefferson Smith, we see everything that is good and wholesome in America. One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal.James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong, while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity (a feat that I feel he accomplishes). The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film, and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie, not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance, but because it has quite a bit to say.

At first Smith does just that, but then his plans to build a boy's camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress, makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylor's business.  A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level, Smith takes action, but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being anti-American in it's depiction of congressmen as anything except honest, God fearing men of the people.  Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as `in bed with business' or `remote from the people' makes it look like a fantasy.  But it is a fantasy \u0096 an ode to the American Dream.  Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress, holds to it's ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is `un-American'. As a story it works well in a sappy type of way.  For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory.  The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified, and the final 20-odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping for.Stewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work.  Jean Arthur is good as the `tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm' and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells.  Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote.  The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder \u0096 good, but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rights.Overall this is a good film.  Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way.  It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples.  Where `it's a wonderful life' was uplifting because it was about human nature, this didn't have the same impact because I don't believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway (watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie).

Bribery, corruption, conspiracy, lies and deceit. It is all here. Shady deals, ulterior motives. In other words, politics. In case it was not already obvious, I am not very political. But guess what? In all the above ways, yes, this is like all those other films. But it the most important ways, it is not. What makes it different? In one word, Stewart. Sure, the clever writing, the directing, the supporting cast are all assets to the film. But he makes this film. His character's name is in the title, after all. Through his heartfelt performance as Jefferson Smith, the audience is inspired; even the most cynical of us might find ourselves beginning to really like this country, appreciate what we have today that our ancestors did not, and maybe even believe that we can make a difference by getting involved in politics. His naivet\u00e9 is practically excruciating at times. His first glance at the White House can be compared to a little kid in a candy store. His first evening exploring all the monuments along and around the National Mall is shown in montage form with patriotic backgrounds music. Cheesy, yes. But somehow it was not as bad as it sounds. As he, an everyday man, tries to acclimate himself in the world of politics, each blunder brings new laughs. His awkwardness in palpable and his character lovable. Eventually, of course, he must learn the truth- that it does not really exist in the government. We all cheer for this everyday Smith as he tries to pave the way for all the little guys. As far as high school or even grade school education goes, this should be on a list of required viewings. Along with School House Rock's classic \"How a Bill Becomes a Law\", of course. I would have loved to learn about government, the Senate, bills, and filibusters this way. **** Spoilers **** Sadly, it was the ending that brought the greatest disappointment. It was extremely sudden and cheap. After all that determination and rallying from Smith; after how far Paine was willing to go to condemn the man he supposedly felt was \"like a son\" to him, after all his stubbornness to do the right thing, he gives up and confesses everything on the Senate floor?

Smith collides head-on with these forces and must fight to save himself and his values from destruction in the public arena.\"Mr. Smith,\" directed by Frank Capra, is not meant to be very realistic. The basic plot and characters of Mr. Smith are borderline ridiculous. Smith goes beyond naive, to the point of appearing ignorant and lacking in common sense at times. He seems to have the civics education of a 2nd-grader. Everything in the movie is exaggerated to the extremes.Capra's D.C. is likewise a caricature. The U.S. Senate is a united front of entrenched cronyism. They move as one nonpartisan mass, always supporting each other in their mutual corruption. The media is easily herded into line, an interpretation that probably strikes closer to truth, although that system today has been undermined by the Internet.Still, if the true Washington is not quite as fraudulent as Copra's version, there's no doubt that it is probably perceived that way by many Americans today. The film touches upon real issues that affect modern politics. It's amazing how relevant certain lines and scenes remain after all these years, perhaps more so today.What did bug me about the film was its shamelessly idealistic view of small-town American heroes like Mr. Smith.

It rails against the elitism and special interest of Washington, a popular sentiment today.This might not bother me so much except that this country is just coming off an extended experiment of putting a \"commoner\" in a government seat of critical importance and things didn't turn out so hot. As nasty, cold, and dirty as it may seem to place a compromising politician into DC, that may be preferable to putting an \"oh shucks, well, golly gee, I dunno\" kinda guy into a position of major responsibility.This country has a low tolerance for corruption.

Nowadays far too many films are time based. If it's old we like it because it's a \"classic\" and if it's new we like it because it's recent and a \"modern classic\". So when I first put this on, I admit I wasn't expecting too much. People had raved about it and said how good it was, but ultimately I had this strong feeling it would be over-rated and adored simply for being old. How wrong I was.In \"Mr Smith Goes To Washington\", Jimmy Stewart puts in one of the most amazing acting performances you are likely to ever see. People rave about him in Capra's other masterpiece (\"It's A Wonderful Life\"), but in that film he is nothing compared to the performance he provides in this one. Stewart plays Jefferson Smith, naive country boy who comes to Washington with an ideology of a democratic system of liberty and freedom where every man would look out for each other. Instead he faces a corrupt Government in which his ideology falls flat.This film moved me, which I confess isn't hard for any truly good film to do, but it moved me in a way different to usual. \"Mr Smith Goes To Washington\" brought intense sweating as it played out, it brought nerves, it felt desperation for Jimmy Stewart to succeed, it even brought a sense of pride. I'm not American, I never have been, and it's very rare for me to even consider wanting to visit the place, yet alone be American. This film made me passionate about America though. As I watched this film, past the slightly slow start, and through to the tense finale, I found myself feeling a sense of Pride in the American Institution of Freedom. It made me want to stand up, shout hooray for America and sing the Star Spangled Banner. Not many films can do this, especially not to me. It's weird since for a film so built on Liberty, it feels almost two years too early. At the time this film was released most of Europe was entering the Second World War, but America wasn't involved yet. This film was (and is) wonderful propaganda for America and if Capra planned it as such, did he know America would enter the war?In my summary, I commented that I also felt disgust in this movie. It's not hard to see why when you watch really. As well as the previously mentioned intense pride, the corruption of the Government and the obsession with a few men earning money brings disgust. It hits home especially since events in the world over recent years imply that nothing has changed. I hope this isn't true. I hope that we truly do have liberty and freedom in the Western world, somehow though, this would feel naive.\"Mr Smith Goes To Washington\" is a cinematic masterpiece.

Books have been written on the subject. And 1939 contains five Mitchell films that represent the art of Hollywood moviemaking at its very peak. Four of them are bona fide classics (Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Gone With The Wind and Hunchback Of Notre Dame), and one of them (Stagecoach) earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor of 1939. Only Angels Have Wings may have been a notch below the other 1939 Mitchell films simply because there should be a quantifiable difference between the rankings of \"Excellent\" and \"Outstanding.\"In Mt. Smith Goes To Washington, Thomas Mitchell revisits the pal/buddy role he played so effectively in Only Angels Have Wings. This time, his friend is Jean Arthur rather than Cary Grant, and the relationship is less emotional and accordingly more subdued. Mitchell is advisor, confidant, chum and platonic lover of Ms. Arthur. But out of a profound sense of personal decency and fairness, he shares his affections equally with the Mr. Smith character of James Stewart. In doing so, Mitchell supports the logic and honorable outcome of the story's final resolution. Wouldn't all of us like to have a real honest to goodness friend like reporter Diz Moore? No wonder that Frank Capra liked working with him so much.Mitchell was able to create five very different superlative roles in these five fine 1939 films from Hollywood's Greatest Year.

Congress proposed a bill that would hike the minimum wage for the first time in almost ten years. (Meanwhile, Congress had voted itself almost ten raises in the same period.) Enemies of the minimum wage hike tacked on a repeal of the estate tax for the mega-wealthy, so the bill flunked.I just give that as an example of how some things worked during this past year, a period in which Congress worked for 93 days. (They gave themselves two weeks off for St. Patty's day alone.) Anyone who follows the news knows as much as I've just written, and in fact I may have added some misleading details out of ignorance.How can such things happen? If a bill is designed to raise the minimum wage, period, how can an explosive device like a repeal of the estate tax be buried in it? How, exactly, does a bill get \"hung up in committee\"? WHAT committee, and why? And how come the House Ways and Means Committee is always described in the press as \"powerful\"? What makes it so damned powerful? All these kinds of issues are raised and answered in a five-minute lecture given by Saunders (Jean Arthur) to Honorary Senator Jeff Smith (Jimmy Stewart). It's not really as complicated as it sounds. I learned more from Saunders' little explanation than I did during months of civics in the fifth grade. So much for your class, Mrs. Greene. You never liked me anyway, and to tell you the truth I always found you a little overbearing. And I didn't care for that business of whacking people with the ruler either.The movie, as a movie, is informative but sterile. The villains are really villainous -- except for Claude Raines, the bad guy who turns good. The issue in this case is hardly one involving life and death. It's not about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or abortion or capital punishment. It's about a kind of Boy Scout camp that Stewart wants to build on some unused acres in his home state, land that will be paid for by the Boy Scouts themselves by sending in their nickels and dimes. (\"No more than ten cents apiece,\" says Stewart.) As in many of Capra's populist and popular entertainments there are shady shenanigans going on behind all the public nobility displayed. A bad guy (Edward Arnold) intends to build a lucrative dam on that land and discredits Stewart, who is humiliated and scorned by his former admirers. The format is familiar and undemanding.And of course no one in Washington is as naive as Stewart. The Boy Scouts? Dimes? Are you kidding? But it is SO simple that, like a fairy tale, it becomes gripping. We watch as Hansel and Gretl are prepared to be popped into the oven.If it were any more realistic, aimed at a more sophisticated audience, it wouldn't work. The characters and their motives have to be clear and pure. That's the whole point of the movie. The simplicity leads us step by step through the political process, as an army training film might tell you how to dismantle an M-16.What realism the film has disappears almost entirely at the end, when Stewart collapses on the Senate floor but is saved by Claude Raines who has just undergone some sort of epiphany. Man, does Stewart suffer through his lone filibuster, his voice shot, two days without sleep, disheveled and shaky, only to be redeemed at the end by Raines. No need to get into religion here but that epiphany and that suffering for all our sakes is suggestive.I watched it last night after not having seen it for years and expected to be bored, but wasn't.

Frank Capra's heroes and villains are starkly contrasted in his populist films. This film with its powerful performance by James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, interim appointee to the United States Senate from an unnamed western state, is now such a part of Americana that criticism of it is almost sacrilegious. The performance is great, but the premise behind the film needs some examination.Having a national boy's camp seems like a fine idea, who could be against it. But having it be at Willett Creek in his state, was that truly necessary? Granted that the proposed dam is piece of pork barrel legislation that a few are going to make a killing on. Quite realistically the dam is a rider on an appropriations bill that Capra names the \"deficiency bill\" which is a bill for further relief to the citizens of 1939 USA which was still in the Depression. Stewart is by his filibuster, holding up relief for a whole nation. Here's where compromise comes in. The seasoned politician or even a novice trying to learn would ask himself, just what are my priorities? Isn't getting that boy's camp my goal, how do I achieve that goal? In the end Stewart might get that boy's camp, but I certainly hope if he did stay in the Senate he didn't develop any other goals that halted the nation's business.Give and take, that's what it's all about folks.Jean Arthur is a fine Capra heroine. Women in Capra films can certainly be independent and have careers, but their main function is to support the hero, especially when he's down. Her best moments in this film and in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is when the hero seems beaten and all is lost, she provides the spark that gets him up before the bell counts him out.Capra rounds the cast out with a whole crew of familiar players who you look to as old friends whenever you see one of his films. One of Capra's great attributes was an intuitive sense of casting, just like John Ford. Whenever you see Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee, Thomas Mitchell, you know immediately the kind of part they will be playing and you welcome them as old friends.Claude Rains plays the other Senator from Stewart's state, a well respected man who's being talked of for the White House. It's Rains's only Capra film and as always he gives a great performance. He's the mouthpiece of Edward Arnold's political machine in the Senate and has been there a few terms. He's also an old friend of Stewart's late father. It's only an appeal to Rains by Stewart on a personal basis that breaks things open during that famous filibuster scene. Capra had to have that in the story because other than that, Stewart would have been dealt with by his colleagues summarily despite his last stand heroics.Ego is something that has to be put aside occasionally.

Together they take on the Taylor machine and Washington's corruptness.Earnest, sentimental classic from the master of the sentimental, Frank Capra. Stewart gives a tour-de-force performance, particularly in the second half. He's helped ably by Arthur, Arnold, and the venerable Claude Rains as an elder statesman who gave in to corruption long ago. It really is a terrific cast from top to bottom. Worthy of singling out among the support though are Thomas Mitchell and Harry Carey, Sr. Mitchell is great as Arthur's reporter friend. This, of course, would not be the last film he made with Capra and Stewart. Harry Carey almost steals the movie and he's only in it here and there. His total screen time doesn't amount to much but in every scene he's amazing with subtle facial expressions and a knowingness in his performance that comes with experience. This is really a phenomenal film. Patriotic and unabashedly so. They don't make 'em like this anymore.

This reviewer absolutely loved this movie and wishes she could run out and buy it right now.   It definitely grabs the audience's attention and keeps it there.  While watching this movie, this reviewer was laughing, smiling, getting really, really angry, learning, and even getting a little teary-eyed.  How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great, or even spectacular!  `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! It's still interesting!While watching this movie, the audience might be thinking that the acting isn't half bad and is actually quite realistic.  They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in.  This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that it's really a shame that it did.  At the very end of the movie Saunders, played by                 , stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells `Stop Jeff! Stop!' and then falls to the floor.  The line and the way       says it is very, very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at.  That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking.  James Stewart was, of course, phenomenal.  He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time.  He's awesome!The only other not so great thing about `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is the ending.  It's a happy ending but, well, it just ends.  It's an abrupt ending.  It ends so abruptly that the audience isn't even expecting it to end when it does.  It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening, they just aren't shown happening. This reviewer doesn't really care for those kind, it is much better when you get to see the things carried out.

This we know to be fact.So what makes anyone think the idealistic Mr. Smith in MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON would not buckle at the knees and subscribe to the corruption inherent in the system, were his career drawn out long enough? Alan Grayson, the real life Democratic Florida senator in the 2009 Health Care Reform battle, is being called Mr. Smith. He swoops into a fray where his own party has exhibited such gutlessness, that by simply by telling the truth, he is being called an \"idealist.\" Director Frank Capra's MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is a paean to idealists. If it weren't for Mr. Grayson illustrating that idealists still skulk the dread halls of Congress, MR SMITH would look like pure fantasy...No sex, no violence, no swearing, we wonder whether this is a tale involving congress at all. Then we see how a spineless governor is forced into appointing a junior senator to be a puppet of the Senate and we see that politics back in 1939 (before they invented sex, violence and swearing) worked a lot like it does these days.When we see how the spineless governor appoints the junior senator - through a coin toss - we realize it's *exactly* how politics works these days.James Stewart is Jefferson Smith, the young, naive senator. When Smith arrives in Washington D.C., it's Idealism City, as he goes tramping through a montage, visiting the landmarks: the Liberty Bell, the Capitol Building, the Constitution, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial with its inspiring words carved into a wall, that mean absolutely nothing to modern politicians. Patriotic themes, American flags superimposed flying proudly over the montage...Smith's reaction is that of a mildly retarded yokel, and when he is skewered in the newspapers for his naivete, he goes around punching out all the offending reporters. Frank Capra may be a renowned director, but how childish is this cringe-tastic scene? Not one of the reporters who smeared Smith thinks to further smear him for his lunatic reaction of spending all day hunting them out in pubs and punching them.Idealistic Smith meets his secretary, the smug Saunders (Jean Arthur), who educates him in the cynical ways of Washington. This is probably the only film where discussing how a bill goes through congress is foreplay. After Saunders describes the near impossibility of shepherding a bill through congress (like then, as now), Smith is idealistic/stupid enough to reply, \"Shall we start writing it now or after dinner?\" His cause becomes lobbying for funding for a Boy's Camp - unlike today, the politicians who lobbied for underage boys back then were never caught with their hands down those boys' pants.Saunders does dissuade Smith for a moment - until he gives her Obama Speech Number 21 (that inspiring one) and she goes into soft focus so much the filmstock nearly deteriorated, until they started working on that sexy bill, bodies writhing in sensual penmanship.Of course, bills do get passed in Congress - for idealistic reasons or otherwise (usually otherwise) - but Smith annoyingly insists on being so Luke Skywalker about it. Which is understandable, as Smith's character is an much a fantasy as Skywalker's. (But there's that Alan Grayson thing...) Smith discovers his hero and mentor, Senator Paine, is part of the corrupt system that he rails against, and is so crushed he goes into idealism overdrive for his Boys Camp funding. Until Paine double-crosses him and Swiftboats him before Swiftboating was invented.When Smith sees 50,000 letters protesting him, his overacting goes into orbit to combat the corruption. To combat Smith's overacting, Paine steps up his own overacting, storming into Congress and shouting a confession at the top of his voice on the \"rotten political corruption of the state.\" You have more chance of destroying a Death Star by firing into a vent no bigger than a womp rat than of hearing an American congressman calling himself and the system corrupt.MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is lauded as one of the great American films. But it is embarrassing idealistic idiocy. Without any solutions. It relies on the age-old tactic of being a drama queen to get through the armor of corrupt politicians. But real world politicians do not ignore laypeople because they are too busy or too corrupt or even because they hold laypeople beneath their contempt. Laypeople appeal to ideals and morals and ethics that politicians had to shunt aside to get to their positions in the first place. You appeal to qualities and virtues that are not in the politician's vocabulary any more. They are bereft of those ideals laypeople appeal to. THAT is why they do not listen to you - you are speaking antelope, and they are speaking lion.Let me tell you one more thing about Alan Grayson: They're calling him \"Mr. Smith\" - as an insult.

A face and music can be more powerful than a fuzzy frame.All in all a great film, though perhaps a bit long for some people's tastes.

It's probably the first really powerful film to take on the deal making and graft that went on in upper echelon politics. We are so naive as a nation when it comes to this kind of stuff. As I write this review, a new law concerning the accepting of gifts just hit the books. But it didn't include add on amendments to feather the nests of political districts. Of course not. You can do without the two martini lunch, but not the bridge to nowhere. This movie is about what happens to a man when he has high ideals. First of all, it's doubtful he would even be elected today. He would have to have millions and tell a whole string of lies to get there. Once there, he would have to see which backs to pat and butts to you-know-what. Still, Stewart does play a man of honor, one who thinks there is hope, and he gets his shirt tails caught in the machinery. The bad guys know that they may lose this battle, but it goes on to this day. All the cards are already stacked. Stewart's performance is masterful. He brings passion and commitment to the role. I like to think that he is something like the guy he plays. Frank Capra did a lot of work for the government and must have seen the ugly side. Some say his work is too simplistic. If the rest of America is collapsing around us, we should look to some of the optimism of the Capra films. Even if they stretch realism, they should make us think of the way things should be. I'm sure that were he alive today, some humorless knucklehead would be tapping his phone lines and screaming subversive.The movie shows that there was polarization back then (1939) and the corruption in government had to be addressed.

In this movie a senator dies and a replacement is needed, namely somebody who will be nothing more than a stooge. They have a few names in mind, but at dinner, the governor asks his kids and they all suggest Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a local Boy Rangers leader. So suddenly this innocent man's life is changed as he goes from a humble Boy Ranger to a United States Senator.The movie is about the corruption that flows through the government. The government was angered at this movie, claiming that it would spoil the reputation of the nation, but it does serve to destroy the naivety that people have about what really goes on in the government. Jefferson Smith is a yes man, and would have played along nicely, visiting Memorials and generally having a huge amount of faith in the system, except that he puts forth a bill which clashes with a dam that is being built. He quickly learns that his colleague and an number of other congressmen are being controlled by a business man from his state. He controls everything in the state and uses his power to get what he wants. Quickly Smith learns that there is little freedom in Washington, but rather a group of elected stooges that are controlled by corporate giants.The movie quickly becomes a battle between this lowly senator and the industrial machine. His few days in Washington quickly bring him out of his naivety to make a stand for his beliefs. Jefferson Smith is an honest man and honourable man. He refuses to bow to the pressure of the industrial machine. When they try to destroy him by creating lies about him, they learn that Smith will not go out silently. Instead he holds the floor of the senate in an effort to bring the truth to the people, yet the industrial machine moves on, trying to destroy him. In the end it is the morality of his colleague that allows him to win through. Thus what we see by the end of this movie is that even though the industrial machine controls the state, a vigilant man has the ability to bring it down.Mr Smith goes to Washington is one of Capra's left wing movies. It is one that criticises the industrial machine and how it seeks to smash over the individual. It is not a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but rather a government controlled by the industrial machine. It has no care for the person but rather for the increased profit of the corporate bosses. It is a movie that calls out to us to see what the government has become and seek to change it.

The film is also one of his most optimistic, and this blend of attitudes have led to many other Hollywood movies being labelled in his honour as 'Capraesque', one of the most misunderstood and overused labels in cinema.'Capraesque' is commonly lumped upon movies with an overbearing sense of positivity, with the little man, or woman, ultimately overcoming overwhelming odds to triumph over whatever conglomerate or institution trying to stamp all over them. But what the labellers forget is the skill required to convincingly build up the struggle of the hero, making the climax all the more poignant and satisfying in the process. When Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the small-town head of the Boy Rangers, is invited to join the U.S. Senate, he accepts the role with humility and a determination to prove himself worthy. What he doesn't know is that fellow senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) intends for Smith to be a stooge while he and his boss Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) go about their dodgy business.Initially, his \"aw, shucks!\" persona is met with ridicule by the press, and is seen as a naive idiot by his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur). However, his patriotism soon endears him to Saunders, who witnesses his peers and superiors begin to tear him to shreds as he uncovers a scheme to buy up land. As Smith, Stewart is perfect, embodying the kind of American ideals that the country prides itself upon but rarely follows, stubbornly holding court while he fights for his reputation in a riveting climax. It's a Wonderful Life (1946) is commonly labelled as Capra's finest moment but, in my humble opinion, Mr. Smith is his crowning achievement, a movie of such substance and social insight that it more than transcends its now-routine formula and reaffirms a belief in good overcoming evil.", "review_date": "2016-03-25", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "What Can I Say?

But he soon learns that the senate is not as honest or honorable as he thought. Shocker right?\nHe then must overcome these obstacles to make a difference. It's a story often imitated, never duplicated.Jimmy Stewart couldn't have been more perfect for the role. He was someone that nearly anyone can identify with no matter their background. We've all faced adversity in our lives and Stewart as Jefferson Smith is one of the most understandable and likable characters he ever played. He's so brilliant here I'd dare say it was his best performance. His journey from a naive country loving man, to defeated Everyman, to courageous representative of the people is believable and great to watch. Don't forget the supporting cast. Jean Arthur plays Stewart's physical representation of his booster shot of reality. She's fun to watch here and plays a great foil to him. Of course there is also Claude Rains, one of the best supporting actors ever. Need I say more? He's brilliant here, moving on.The story is both dramatic, funny and thought provoking. It was a brilliant satire of the US government to where congressmen from all over the country tried to stop its release. Thankfully they failed and everyone got to see this wonderful film.Most Capra movies never feel that dated. I think this movie has aged amazingly well. Smith's plea to the Senate to actually listen to the people, hear their concerns, try to improve their quality of life and preserve their rights is timeless. Their job is to represent and act, not just sit around trading insults all day.Even 80 years later, this movie is still relevant in many ways.

Forget all the patriotic war films or political biopics, \"Mr. Smith\" is the most American film of all time because it reminds us what it means to have a government for the people, by the people.What's most impressive about what is arguably '30s and '40s master Frank Capra's greatest cinematic achievement is that despite not identifying the state Senator Jefferson Smith (Stewart) represents or identifying any political parties, the film is still able to make a profound statement about the complacency among politicians for corruption within government. No one is implicated in this film and no political bias could possibly sway a viewer's opinion -- it's one hundred percent about how in a democracy, people must stand up to their government, opinions and beliefs aside.\"Mr. Smith\" does it by creating a protagonist in Jeff Smith that represents the typical youthful, idealistic American. When a senator dies, the governor of his state feels caught between the people's choice for a replacement and that of an influential businessman named Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). He decides to appear as if he isn't favoring either influence by appointing Smith, a boy scout leader -- a choice that shocks everyone. At the very least, the governor figures Smith will be so overwhelmed by Washington that he'll stay quiet in the Senate and allow Taylor's hush-hush controversial dam to be passed.Smith arrives in Washington and is awe-struck by the monuments and the buildings, not unlike a young American seeing D.C for the first time. All he's known his whole life are the ideals America stands for, not the inner-workings of the political system. We are in his same shoes and much like the film corrupts this idealism for Smith, it corrupts it for us. Stewart, who officially breaks out in this role, is perfect. He has charm, but he's rather nervous and clueless. He is phenomenal at being nervous and uncertain despite speaking with strong conviction -- he's easy to relate to as he fights for what he believes in as the film progresses.Smiths' emotions are our emotions through the film and that's where \"Mr. Smith\" draws its true power as a film. Between Capra's work building up Washington and then exposing it and Stewart's ability to demonstrate this same idea through his reactions to it, we want to give up when Smith wants to give up. We're even surprisingly convinced ourselves by Jean Arthur's -- who plays Smith's assistant -- passionate speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, pleading Smith to keep fighting. As he continues the fight, we support him, pity him and much more. It's his fire to keep the purity of American ideals that is truly inspiring.Essentially, Smith is any one of us, a well-respected American, who happens to find his way into a role where he can make a difference, and he single-handedly tries to do what every American wishes he or she could: stand up for what he believes in and never give up, no matter the cost, because it's what's right.

It's interesting to view this picture when the U.S. itself seems to be at the tipping point, with a majority of hard working, tax paying citizens virtually held in contempt by a ruling elite composed of both political parties. Maybe what the country needs right now is a Mr. Smith who can simply boil things down to what's right and wrong, someone with common sense who believes in honesty and integrity instead of one who can gain the most advantage through slick wheeling and dealing.

Smith's a local celebrity in his hometown, a proponent of boy's healthful living, the founder of Boy Rangers whose mission it is to prepare the male youth of today to take their place as the patriotic cheerleaders for the American Way in the world of tomorrow. The senior Senator Joseph Paine admirably played by that fine actor Claude Rains, and his puppet master, corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor, in the person of actor Edward Arnold, are convinced the newbie Smith is na\u00efve enough and malleable enough not to disrupt their dirty program of graft and shady dealings so that business can be carried on as usual. Arnold, virtually typecast by Hollywood as the venal, power hungry businessman really puts this character across with all its hallmark, villainous trappings. Jean Arthur as Clarissa Saunders is tasked with a real thorny assignment. She's Smith administrative assistant, a Washington-wise veteran of the savvy, cynical breed who takes him in hand, steering him and cheering him on. So refreshing, and pathetically unspoiled is the new Senator, Saunders can't but help taking him under her wing and---ultimately falling in love with this touching, earnest sap.

The complacency of pork barreling was something that the political spectrum wanted to keep covert... Here is where the very wet behind the ears Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) becomes astounded by the ulterior motives of the actual Washington DC, and not the one which he revered all his young adult life!! The film \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" makes filibustering a form of heroics, and translates the desires of the American people to the dogged tenacity of Jimmy Stewart to overcome graft!! Such a resilient assertion of democracy garnered an auspicious reaction from the American moviegoer!! \"Mr Smith Goes To Washington\" has become a legend in the movie world!! Such a charisma is largely due in part to the acting, and the directing in this movie!! At the same time, this film's strongest feature is the overall premise that graft can be overcome by a freshman senator, this powerful element to this movie ultimately cultivated a camaraderie with the American people!! If you have never seen this film before, I strongly recommend that you do!! When the phenomena of the White House and stars and stripes forever become relegated to a citadel of disillusionment, it takes the vigor of a magnanimous maverick politician like Mr Smith (Jimmy Stewart) to set things right!! Jimmy Stewart has always been the Mr squeaky clean baseball, apple pie, and mom type anyway!! He is perfectly cast for this movie!! Frank Capra, who has a virtual myriad of accolades in the world of Hollywood, does a tremendous job at directing this movie!! All in all, I think that \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\" is a definite American movie legend!!", "review_date": "2007-11-14", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Somehow, this movie manages to take the seemingly boring source material and tell a gripping story.", "content": "There are so many masterfully done scenes, like the sightseeing montage sequence, and the conclusive filibuster scene, I guess, is a classic for all times.", "review_date": "2020-06-30", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "An essential political comedy drama", "content": "Produced and directed by Frank Capra, with a story by Lewis R. Foster and a screenplay by Sidney Buchman, this essential political comedy drama features James Stewart in the title role, as Jefferson Smith (AFI's #11 hero), who's appointed to the Senate by his state's Governor Hubert 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee), on the advice of his children (the Watson brothers), when one of their Senators dies. The state's senior Senator Joseph Harrison Paine is played by Claude Rains.Stewart's character is a young, idealistic boys' club (like the Boy Scouts) leader and a patriot, who's far too naive to fair very well among the alligators in Washington, D.C.. This fact is quickly recognized by everyone, especially the former Senator's streetwise secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who helps Smith navigate the treacherous waters of our nation's capital (and capitol building) and eventually (and obviously) falls in love with him.Edward Arnold plays media magnate Jim Taylor, who controls the state's political party and \"owns\" several (if not all) of its politicians. At the time of Smith's appointment, Taylor is in the midst of having his civil servants put through some pork barrel legislation (a dam project) for his own financial real estate benefit. Once the junior Senator catches wind of what's going on, Taylor utilizes Paine et al against Smith, who famously incorporates a one man filibuster, in a symbolic fight against the other politicians' corruption.Thomas Mitchell, Eugene Palette, Beulah Bondi as Ma Smith, H.B. Warner as the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Carey as the Vice President, Grant Mitchell and Porter Hall as senators, Charles Lane as a newsman named Nosey, William Demarest, and Dick Elliott are among those also in the cast.Capra earned two Academy Award nominations, Best Picture and Best Director; Foster won the film's only statuette for his original story, and Buchman's screenplay was Oscar nominated. Stewart received his first Best Actor nomination; supporting actors Rains (his first) and Carey (his only) were also nominated, as was Lionel Banks' Art Direction, Dimitri Tiomkin's Score, John Livadary's Sound, and its Editing (Gene Havlick's last nomination, Al Clark's second).

They believe he will do anything they tell him but soon they realize that they've selected the wrong man. Smith is someone who loves the country and the power that it has to help people so when he sees the dirty stuff going on he decides to fight the big guys.Frank Capra's MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is a rather landmark film that comes from a year that many consider to be the greatest ever for motion pictures. There were way too many classic films made that year to name off here but it's amazing to see how well this film has held up over the years as its heart is still in the right place and the things normal people fight are still very valid. Seeing this movie in 2017, it's almost scary to see the political stance this movie takes and how very little has changed since it's release.There are many great things that could be said about this film but for my money the greatest are the performances. Everyone knows the now legendary ending packs on terrific punch and there's no question that Stewart deserves a lot of the praise and it's easy to see why he shot to stardom thanks to this role. That \"simple man\" mode of Stewart's was perfect for a role like this and the actor really hit a grand slam. He is perfect as the naive person and he's just as great as he takes every ounce of energy to fight off the bad people. This here is pure magic from Stewart and he really delivers.The supporting cast is just as great with many great character actors doing a terrific job. You've got the likes of Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee and Eugene Palette doing what they do best. You've got Thomas Mitchell doing a great job as a reporter and then there's great stuff from Grant Mitchell, Harry Carey, H.B. Warner and of course Jean Arthur. Arthur plays what's basically a love interest but she's simply divine here and brings a real splash to the screen. Then there's Claude Rains as the crooked politician. He's never fully gotten the credit he deserves for the great actor he was but his final showdown with Stewart is beyond perfection.The film is very honest about its political feelings and one could argue that the film is very much a fantasy. Especially when you consider that not too much has changed about the money men holding government people hostage. It's funny to watch this movie today and see what Capra was going for.

It's about Jefferson Smith who is an all-American \"Boy Scout\" who fully believes in the Constitution and all the myths of American democracy. He's chosen to replace a U.S. Senator who has died, and because of his spotless reputation in the community and inexperience in politics, the Governor, controlled by capitalist interests, chooses to name him Senator thinking they could easily manipulate him. Once he arrives in the Senate, he quickly discovers that his idealistic (and naive) belief in the American system to reflect the will of the people does match up with reality. He's smeared by the corporate media (the Washington Press Club denounced the film as un-American after the world premiere) and his efforts to pass a bill to establish a local camp are sabotaged by the corporate political machine because it interferes with plans to build a dam on the same land. Seeing Smith as a liability, the corporate state goes into full character assassination mode, while Smith embarks on a filibuster in the Senate with the goal of exposing the corruption of the system. The brilliance of the film is that it shows how capitalist interests own and control the political system (a system that is set up as a distraction from that fact), and yet it doesn't allow Smith to be completely triumphant, which would have reinforced his idealism and proved the system can \"work\" if only good people are elected.

In this movie, he goes against the Washington establishment, political hacks and powers behind the throne. The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed. Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith, played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance. The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra. Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known, but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person. And because he is not real and the story is not reality. If this movie was considered a comedy, so be it, but critics have had 60 plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil. Stewart's character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not \"the best candidate\" for the job. Nothing unbelievable in that, , but Smith's character is stretched beyond belief. To become a US Senator, you must be at least 30 years old. Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a 15 year old. With no wife, no girl friend; he acts like a 15 year old when introduced to mature women. Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others, is also the behavior of an adolescent. Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty. It is not. Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dope.Somehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all.

However, my kid did use a term to describe the film that it very appropriate. She used the phrase \"sledgehammer symbolism\" to describe how sometimes Frank Capra (the director) used too much strong symbolism and that because of this the movie sometimes lacked subtlety. Some good examples are the name of the main character, the idealistic Mr. Smith. \"Smith\" was used as an obvious symbol of the common person and his first name, \"Jefferson\", was lifted straight from the American founding fathers.However, despite this and a few mildly \"schmaltzy\" moments, the film was incredibly uplifting and unforgettable in so many wonderful ways. The acting was astoundingly good. Not only does this movie have perhaps the greatest set of supporting actors in movie history in the same film (perhaps only rivaled by the original TWELVE ANGRY MEN), but Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart were absolutely perfect. I just can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Stewart played a naive but decent guy who is initially overwhelmed by Washington and by the fact that he was appointed Senator. He then, when the chips were down, morphed into a mountain of previously untapped strength and did an absolutely mesmerizing job when he fought for the truth in the last half of the movie. Arthur was also great as the cynical and worldly-wise assistant. While I knew her as a sweet type of actress due to her many other roles as a \"swell dame\" or \"girl next door\", my daughter found Arthur's performance so realistic that she simply couldn't believe me that this was NOT a typical role for Arthur!

In that sense, the hero is entirely at home in the movie, though an outsider in Washington; we feel that through Jefferson Smith, we are experiencing the real America.  Stewart is wonderful from starry-eyed beginning to exhausted, verge-of-a-breakdown end; he is a hero we can whole-heartedly cheer for.  Claude Rains is superb as the fallen \"silver knight\" Joe Paine; it is clear throughout that we are looking at the ruins of a great man, and we share his humiliation when we see him in the degrading company of the triumphant press tycoon.

For him it is, as this movie plainly shows, a matter of the heart. In my opinion, that is bad. Parliamentary democracy spells COMPROMISE. It is a matter of reason. Or else it would not work. That's what is wrong with this movie, it muddles the issue in a dangerous way.The protagonists are a young inexperienced Senator (James Stewart) and the big meddler and, so to speak, unofficial King of the Senator's state (Edward Arnold).

If others, not least the population of the concerned state, will also profit in one way or the other from the dam, does not interest anybody. Least the Senator. Because he has his own pet project, a camp for Boy Scouts which he envisions - what a coincidence! - on the very spot on which the aforementioned dam is planned. No wonder he is dead set against it.So, is it all about that goddamn dam? I'm afraid it is. For the sake of the two pet projects the legislative process of a whole nation is brought to a complete standstill while the Senator is filibustering - apparently the greatest achievement of American parliamentary democracy.

I just saw Mr. Smith goes to Washington and I have some thoughts. Don't consider this to be a proper review. It's not. I don't even think I should assign a rating to this or any other classic film. Not to say I couldn't. But it's moot. The point of star ratings and the like is to convince people whether or not they should see a film. But any film that has stood the test of time, like this one has, deserves to be watched regardless of what anyone like me thinks of it. With that out of the way, let me say a hundred words' worth about the film.If you are looking for artistry in film, this is not the movie you're looking for. There are some nice scenes, particularly those with the American flag and the Lincoln Monument and the like. But that's not the purpose of the film. It wants to win you over with its message more than anything.Should you watch this film is you are not American? Hm... Well let me think... would I watch a film like this about Sweden or France or what may you? Yes, I would. But I'm a film and history buff. Watch it if you feel like being submerged in a pure, passionate representation of Americana.This is the best Capra film. If you haven't watched a one of his movies before, this one is a good place to start. And you should watch at least some of his films; he may not be as 'good' as a lot of other directors, but he nonetheless shaped a good portion of American cinema. If I were teaching a history class on the first five decades of film, he would be one of the names I would make sure everyone knew. Fair warning though: if you are watching one of his movies for the first time, you may be thrown off-guard by his optimism. Even this, one of the more pessimistic ones, has all the tropes one may expect.I think I enjoyed this movie more now than I would have a few years ago. There just seems to be so much more cynicism in the air now. Maybe it's the world. Maybe it's the part of it I live in. Maybe it's just me. But the end result is that I felt relieved by the film. It was like a breath of fresh air. A dizzyingly saccharine breath of fresh air. Optimism is more appreciated when it is rare.That is not the only way the film is better appreciated today. Congress has never been liked. Look at their approval rating throughout history. But nowadays, they are despised with a fervor like nothing else. I'm sure you've hear the joke that the only thing Republicans and Democrats agree on is the worthlessness of contemporary Congress. Of course, the Congress portrayed in the film isn't entirely accurate. You see the exaggerations needed to make it work as satire. But there is a lot of truth in the film. It is an early (and very good example) of what we know call dramedies.This film may not change your life. It didn't change mine. But it certainly a film that has moved at least one person. Probably a lot more. And if you cannot pick out at least one moment from the film that moved you, then you are either cold or too politically radical.

Next, he assigns his trusted underling Jean Arthur's Clarissa (pretty name, that) Saunders to distract and discredit Smith. Surely, with all this going against him, this hick from the sticks couldn't cause any trouble, could he...?Capra doesn't take a side in calling out Republican or Democrat and so makes the bigger point that corruption can be red or blue. He pulls out every stop to have you rooting for this Daniel in the lion's den, setting up Stewart for his heroic attempt to save the day by attempting a marathon filibuster to block the graft legislation, even while Taylor ruthlessly suppresses free speech by having all the newspapers he owns denounce Smith and so discredit and ultimately destroy him.One might scoff at Capra's sentimentalised idealism, copied across from his earlier \"Mr Deeds Goes To Town\", their almost identical titles surely not coincidental, but again he pulls it off handsomely. The painstaking recreation of the House Of Representatives only adds to the veracity and of course he cheekily filmed without official permission, Stewart visiting the various symbolic buildings in D. C. for inspiration. He's helped once again by his brilliantly chosen cast, some, like Arthur who previously went to town with Deeds but there are great turns too from Arnold, Rains, Thomas Mitchell as a cynical old reporter who adores Arthur and Harry Carey as the sage Speaker of the House who sees the worth in Smith. Above all though, it's Stewart who seizes the moment to establish himself as an A-list actor by delivering a towering performance to effectively steal Cooper's clothes and so establish himself as the screen's top underdog, if that isn't too much of an oxymoron.It was this film's misfortune to come up against the epic \"Gone With The Wind\" in its year of release (there was a lot of other competition too in that particular golden year) and see its eleven Oscar nominations translate to just one win but the Academy really should have shared out those little statues because this is Golden Age Hollywood storytelling at its brilliant, uplifting best.", "review_date": "2021-06-26", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness", "content": "If anyone asks me why James Stewart is my favourite actor I just say watch the final scene of Mr Smith Goes to Washington. The final scene of this movie is simply of the greatest things I have ever witnessed in any film ever. That may sound like a hyperbole but I'll never forget the very exact feeling of goosebumps I had when first watching it. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is one of a small handful of films I would call life-changing, one of the films which helped to mold the way I think and ultimately turn me into the person I am today. It encouraged me to be more skeptical, not to believe everything you here and stand for what you believe despite great opposition. It's thanks to films like these why cinema is my bible. As much however as Capra is criticised for his films being overly idealist, Mr Smith Goes to Washington does not exactly paint the most glowing picture of the American political system. To quote Thomas Paine (Claude Raines), \"The duty of a true patriot is to protect his country from its government\".One of my favourite scenes in Mr Smith is that in which Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) attempt to explain to Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) the entire procedure of creating a bill and submitting it to Congress. For starters, the scene is incredibly funny with the comedic timing and Stewart's childlike reactions. Secondly, it's a very informative civics lesson and thirdly, this scene shows us how Jefferson Smith acts of the film's ambassador the for the average Joe watching film who's just as confounded by Sauder's lecture as Smith is. The scene lays out in an entertaining manner the political hoo-ha for the politically lay; my knowledge on politics was very limited when I first watched Mr Smith Goes to Washington but that wasn't a barrier to being engrossed in the film's state of affairs.This is as good an opportunity as any to raise the question, why is Jean Arthur such a forgotten actress? Despite working with several big-name directors, co-starring with famous actors and appearing in a number of beloved classics, her presence is incredibly overlooked as the definitive urbanite career woman with her wit, warmth, and innocence. Also, that voice! Her role as Saunders is the opposite of Mr Smith. She is cynical, jaded and knows the ins and outs of the system with its corruption and cronyism. It takes Smith, the Americaphille who appears to know more about American history than the people working in Washington to restore faith in her with his childlike optimism and perseverance.Along with the attack on the American political system, Mr Smith Goes to Washington is just as harsh with its portrayal of the press as a pack of ravenous vultures. The scene in which Smith confronts the reporters in a bar is truly shocking as they flat up tell him about their lack of journalistic ethics as reality hits Smith like a ton of bricks (also among the crowd of reporters if Jack Carson, always a scene-stealer). I just have to question the morals on the part of Smith prior to this scene in which he literally goes around punching reporters in the face although it could be argued this was more of a social norm back then between men.\nAnother striking monologue is that in which Smith's mentor Thomas Paine justifies corruption as a comprise in order to achieve good deeds, a process which has existed since the birth democracy as he puts it. As convincing as he might sound at first, through the course of the film you can tell he's a man who knows he's sold out on is ideals partially from the complete look of shame which bestows Claude Rains' face. Even at the beginning of the film just look at the reaction of Paine's face when Smith declares \"Dad used to tell me Joe Paine was the finest man there ever was\".The relationship between Paine and the business mogul James Taylor (Edward Arnold) is like that of The Emperor and Darth Vader. Taylor hovers above Paine only for his conscious to be put to the ultimate test by the end of the film. Taylor's ability to control the media of Smith's home state and preventing any of his words from the Senate reaching the state is frightening. I can just be glad that in the age of the internet and mass communication that such control of the narrative isn't as easy as it once was.Mr Smith Goes to Washington is very snappy and faced paced; with the culmination of some of Hollywood's finest character, acting talent helps carry the exposition in an entertaining and at times screwball like manner. The final 30 minutes of the film in which Smith filibusters is one of the greatest things ever caught on celluloid with its immense hair-raising build up to an exhausted, out of breath James Stewart declaring that he will fight for this lost cause, even if this room gets filled with lies like these!Like other political films to arise from classic Hollywood, no party is mentioned during the film nor do we know what state Smith is from and which he fights so hard for. Those on the modern right could see Mr Smith as a little guy standing up against big government and the Washington elites. By contrast, those on the left can view Smith as a rebel fighting against corporate, capitalist fat cats like James Taylor. Independents could see Smith as someone who stood alone without backing from any party to fight for his beliefs. Like many of Capra's films, Mr Smith Goes to Washington is hard to place on the political spectrum. Anyone can see what they want to within the film which is part of its enduring power. Really, if I ever met someone in elected office, I will be asking them if they have seen this film. Mr Capra and Mr Stewart, thank you for this film.", "review_date": "2015-10-11", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "A classic gem that hasn't lost its relevance ...", "content": "*** \"An average director is like a traffic cop, a good director does justice to the script, a great director offers to the audience a new vision of the world\" Bette Davis paying tribute during the AFI's 10th Lifetime Achievement Award to one of America's greatest directors: Frank Capra. ***In each film, each frame was speaking his word, showing his vision, inspiring the audience with a feeling so new it would, like for Alfred Hitchcock, inspire its own adjective: Capraesque. And not every director could achieved that in their lifetime.I felt like beginning \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" with these lines because this is certainly, the most Capraesque of all his films. Released in the pivotal year of 1939, it's the picture that crystallized the very values the name Capra stood for, which are all about a certain idea of America, deeply rooted in the heart of this son of illiterate Sicilian emigrants who came to America at the age of 6, who endured poverty, and dreamed of getting through it. Not only he did, but he also became one of the greatest American directors, the one with the most instantly recognizable trademarks, as in both style and content. \"It Happened One Night\", \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" or \"You Can't Take it With You\" made the audience so passionate about his films that his name would be top-billed. A Capra film was an event by itself, a film that would feature the struggle of one man, one ordinary man, against the corruption that gangrenes society. Capra's heroes were the incarnation of his own beliefs because in his own way: Capra incarnated the American Dream.And this American Dream would be immortalized through the most endearing of his heroes: the young Senator Jefferson Smith, played by a strikingly handsome and juvenile-looking James Stewart. The film launched Jimmy Stewart's career and if you see it, it's one point you'll never question. It's so amazing to see Stewart looking so young, especially if you compare with \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (where he was only 38), his features are those of a guy who can be 25 or 26, his cheeks, his awkward smile, his lanky demeanor, his eyes, Jefferson Smith is like a child, and when it comes to politics, like a baby. He's tutored by Miss Saunders, who's played by one of Capra's most familiar faces: Jean Arthur, and with her wised up experience, and cute nasal voice, she'll try to help him swimming among the sharks and not get eaten by the system. Because this is what the film is about, the fight of one young man against political corruption, a man whose heart is pumped up by all the ideals and values of Justice and Equity and finds himself alone in a world that belongs to other forces, forces that have nothing to do with government, forces that control everything. One man against the system, so Capraesque and yet so modern.The real achievement of the film, although it was not necessarily brought that way, is to portray a political system that immediately echoes the ones we're familiar with, and my opinion doesn't target a specific country. Through the antagonist characters: the corrupted Senator Payne (Claude Rains) and Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor, the ruthless tycoon who owns the media and controls the power, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" allows us to revisit the intricacies that still exist today within the political system and how some of the branches involved can lead to spheres that have nothing do with values and ideals. The all-time complicity between the media and politics is highlighted with such boldness that makes us wish we'd had more Jefferson Smiths today. But we don't, because to be elected, one must pledge allegiance to these driving forces: I call them the media, the lobbies, the major corporations. Because money creates more valuable connections than honesty, loyalty and integrity, yes they don't last, but it doesn't matter. In the name of progress, of economy, the big guys take the biggest share of the pie and leave the crumbs for people.But Jefferson Smith will ultimately stand alone against this injustice, he's just a common man, as indicated by his last name, but his first name is patriotically loaded, as if he was the only virgin mind to inherit the purest beliefs that made the dream of his country possible. That's his force, he's as honest as the old man sitting on that big statue in Washington, and he won't let the word 'honesty' have its meaning twisted until it becomes synonym of naivety or lack of pragmatism. That's the virus that pollutes today's spirit, the whole cynical ends- justifies-the-means-thing that reduces gentleness to dumbness while we're more lucid when we believe that everything is crap. Why that's the point, if anything stinks is this world is because of a bunch of people that ought to be fought, and the cynicism of those people is to make believe that they're the one who adapted to a world that can't be changed. Through Jefferson, it's like Capra advocating his own ideas: no, he's not a sentimentalist, no, it's not just about David vs. Goliath, it's about beliefs and emotions.Capra obviously has an emotional relationships with his country, and so does Jefferson. It's something in the heart and Jefferson's fight literally metamorphoses him into a fighter who'd use every weapon to stand against corruption. And the Stewart we meet at the end is a whole new one, courageous, and determined, he lost his political virginity but not his idealism, because they had to triumph, otherwise, America wouldn't be worth living in. \"Mr. Smith\" exemplifies the best that could come from Hollywood's Golden Age, with so many familiar faces, and the greatest compilations of Capra's trademarks, fast- paced editing, jumping shots and the iconic montage of headlines and last but not least, a significance that hasn't been lost.", "review_date": "2012-07-30", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Liberty Is Too Precious A Thing To Be Buried In Books", "content": "Infused with patriotism, exhibiting excellent use of humour & starring James Stewart in the role that instantly propelled the then-young actor into the spotlight, Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is another quality product from the notable filmmaker that skilfully presents its support of democracy & is now counted amongst the great American films of its era.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington follows the political adventures of Jefferson Smith; leader of The Boy Rangers who is appointed by the State Governor to fill a vacancy in the US Senate after the untimely death of the previous Senator. Young, naive & idealistic, Smith discovers an entirely different world on his arrival to Washington & soon decides to stand up against corruption.Directed by Frank Capra, the film was controversial at its time of release for daring to show corruption within the American government which infuriated many back then but with time, that part of its premise has only become more significant. Capra's direction is impressive for the most part, script keeps the plot moving with enthusiastic energy & the entertainment is top-notch.The technical aspects are all finely executed, leaving nothing to complain but it's the acting department which further elevates this brilliant cinema to a higher level for the lead as well as the supporting performances are high-calibre stuff here. James Stewart steals the show as the naive Senator who stages a thrilling battle on the Senate floor but the input by Jean Arthur & Claude Rains is equally commendable.On an overall scale, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington hits the right balance between comedy & political drama to succeed as an intelligently crafted, highly entertaining & mostly satisfying cinema. While the overly-stretched finale coming to an abrupt conclusion wasn't something I was looking forward to, this often hilarious but mostly uplifting take on how one man can affect the politics of a nation is definitely worth your time & money. Don't miss it.", "review_date": "2015-05-09", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "How politicians don't work for democracy.", "content": "In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the legendary Jimmy Stewart plays the naive, and somewhat gullible Mr. Smith who is invited to become a senator by politicians corrupted by self-seeking businessmen, who they perceive is rife for manipulation. As such Stewart's character is a representation of Joe Public, and how politicians manipulate the average voter's views for political gain and moreover the corrupt businessmen (and women) who want to use their clout to pull strings, which promotes their power, and exacerbates their egos. In order to emphasise this the accomplished director Frank Capra needs to contrive sympathy for the highly emotive issue of 'children's welfare' in the form of a boys' camp, here proposed by Senitor Smith. When this is juxtaposed with hard, and emotionally depleted business profit then there is no contest; the children's welfare comes before corporate gain. Arguably, the methods by which corporate gain is achieved, - in this case via corruption - is diluted by Capra's emotive motive of using children's welfare as a tool by which to direct opinion. Nevertheless, it is corporate gain via corrupt methods which tinges the philosophical ideology of existentialism. To explain further, existentialism is concerned with the idea of 'the self'. In other words placing 'the self' at the centre of the universe. As such, 'the self' becomes empowered. In some circumstances this 'self' has the potential to become a self-seeking force. In this film, that self-seeking force is the businessman who endeavours to gain via unethical means, and corruption becomes associated with existentialism by default. Hence, existentialism becomes a negative force when juxtaposed with the utilitarian idea, which champions that of the greatest good, which is as Senitor. Smith views, written into American values, which he naively permits to lead him without questioning the concept. This value of the 'greatest good' is the driving force of his cause for a boys' camp.But, what will bring more benefit to society actually depends on how one interprets the ideas that are utilitarianism and existentialism, which via opinion, inadvertently contrive ideas of what is ethical and unethical which informs the voter of what is democratically acceptable. To explain further, the business venture is viewed in this film as unethical, and thereby will be unacceptable to the voter. Perhaps the narrative of the film should have balanced the viewers' opinions by explaining that the business venture proposed has the potential to provide employment, and spin-off enterprise for individuals. As such, these individuals would have the potential to prosper further and provide further employment, and so on. Meanwhile, the boys' camp would actually contrive a sense of good, and thus instill into them another person's perception of what is ethical. Is such paternalistic contrivance not just as corrupt in the sense of selfishness and self gain as any businessman (or woman) pulling a politicians strings? Further more, Senitor Smith's paternalism would stifle the individual's freedom of thought. Ironically, such stifling of individual thought along with paternalism is what leaves voters, such as that of Senitor Smith - remember here a representation of the average Joe Public - vulnerable like children, open to manipulation by corrupted politicians.Meanwhile Capra utilises emotions, which he purposefully exacerbates as a means of overcoming the otherwise monotonous bureaucracy at the heart of politics. Without such affectation, Capra would have lost his viewers to sheer boredom. This is especially during the filibuster which Jimmy Stewart performs via the implementation of the sentimentality of an underdog, fighting via the democratic process, corruption within politics on behalf of his fellow citizens. This affectation is juxtaposed by Capra in order to further achieve the portrayal of that of a man pleading for mercy after being assumed to be guilty. For his convincing performance in this as the doggedly determined crusader of justice, then Stewart deserves high praise. Kudos also goes to the great Jean Auther, whose implementation of her thespian skills serves to draw attention to her competent acting ability in the part of Clarrisser Saunders, who coerces Senitor Smith's emotions. The accomplished actor Claud Rains was also effective in his role as the politician corrupted by the unacceptable face of business, which is as already suggested, personified as that of 'selfishness'. Sailing so close to the (political) wind here Capra gives one potential reason for implementation and enforcement of the Hays' Code as a justifiable force of stability within the United States film industry. Retrospectively viewed with cynicism, because it is perceived as constraining democracy within the art of film making, the paternalistic Hays' Code was originally written with ethical intention at the time of its implementation, which was during a period of political instability throughout the world. This instability was further exacerbated by the centralisation of the otherwise fringe politics of the far left and far right highlighted through the emergence of fascism and communism, culminating in illiberal dictators in, among other nations, Italy, Germany and the USSR. Hence, the film's reference to dictators, who ironically are used to promote the satirical point that proponents of illiberal politics are fascinated with Western-style democracy, here undermined by Capra's portrayal of it as an essentially corrupt force. The time of the film's production means that there is allot of political incorrectness. An example includes the idea that boys as opposed to girls are the backbone of a nation. But where would have Mr. Smith been without Clarissa Sauners? Business is also highlighted as white, overtly heterosexual, male, middle age, and middle class. But, the question is, have things changed for the better in a world of political correctness? Well, if not, then political correctness is a mere token gesture to the excluded and disaffected voter.In sum, this is an intelligently directed, brilliantly acted, thought provoking film,and arguably a must see!", "review_date": "2007-01-14", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Classic Capra Masterwork Resonates Still as Both Tribute to and Expos\u00e9 of the U.S. Political System", "content": "There are films that are purely formulaic and consequently redundant, and then there are select classics that seem to be inspired by the same formula but in a way that make them feel fresh every time you see them. Such is the case with legendary director Frank Capra's political 1939 masterwork, as he and veteran screenwriter Sidney Buchman tell the story of the underdog who must face seemingly impenetrable obstacles to achieve a greater good. Capra made his reputation on films which conveyed such unbridled idealism like his most famous work, 1946's \"It's Wonderful Life\", but I would argue that this one has a broader sense of resonance since it deals unflinchingly with the corrupted American political structure, a situation that has unfortunately changed little in the nearly seventy years since the film's original release.A young James Stewart is perfectly cast as Jefferson Smith, the na\u00efve leader of a local Boy Scouts-type organization, who is swept into office as his state's junior senator by the all-powerful political machine headed by a Boss Tweed-like figure, media mogul Jim Taylor. In awe of the senior senator, Joseph Paine, Smith follows Paine's advice to push a bill for a national boys' camp back in the home state. A problem arises in the fact that the camp is to be built on the Willets Dam site which Taylor and Paine plan to use for graft. Along the way, Smith wins the support of his initially cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who becomes inspired by Smith's integrity and encourages him to push the bill. This leads to his tenacious efforts to pass the bill, going as far as staging a 23-hour filibuster on the U.S. Senate floor. It's a monumental climax that Stewart turns into one of the most classic scenes in film history.Supporting performances by familiar actors are uniformly strong with the wonderfully acerbic Jean Arthur as Saunders, Edward Arnold in full-bluster mode as Taylor, Harry Carey as the silently supportive Senate president and Claude Rains as the conflicted Paine, with Thomas Mitchell, Guy Kibbee, Eugene Palette, H.B. Warner and Beulah Bondi in smaller roles. The one flaw is the abrupt ending in which one character experiences an instant transformation with little pay-off shown for Smith's efforts. Apparently, Capra unwisely cut these scenes out after preview audiences seemed fidgety at the two-hour mark. Regardless it remains an inspiring piece of American cinema. The 2000 DVD from Columbia fortunately contains a pristine print from the Library of Congress vaults, as well as the original theatrical trailer and a featurette and commentary track from the director's son, Frank Capra, Jr.", "review_date": "2006-08-28", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Simple, yet truthful.", "content": "This film shows the corruption of the goverment, many movies did it better and more intriguing, but it's still a pretty good film.", "review_date": "2020-12-19", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "An imperfect but remarkable movie.", "content": "This is not a perfect movie. (I don't know that there are any.) Jimmy Stewart's character early on is sometimes too naive to be believable for someone raised by a newspaper editor, someone who has studied American history as thoroughly as he has.But when this movie is good, it is as good as any movie ever made, and I do not say that lightly.Much of the power of this movie is in the uncompromisingly negative portrayal of political corruption, embodied in the brilliant performance of Edward Arnold, always a fine character actor, at his very best. His cold-hearted ruthlessness and drive never go over the line into caricature; he is always devastatingly believable, enough to send chills down your spine.Claude Raines, another very fine character actor, gives perhaps the most well-rounded performance in the movie, as a once idealistic politician who has allowed himself to abandon all sense of honesty in the pursuit of personal gratification, only to have his former, almost forgotten self brought back to him by the son of an almost forgotten former friend. Few modern American movies made for the general public would dare to portray such a character as so capable of duplicity for so long.Jean Arthur is good, but her part is perhaps the least natural and most preachy. Eugene Palette actually gets a significant role as another corrupt politico and does a first rate job of it.But then there is Stewart at his best, as well. Once his character, Jefferson Smith, gets shaken out of his naivet\u00e9 and comes to grips with the ugly reality of congressional politics, he delivers a performance as riveting as any I have ever seen on film.This is no cheerfully optimistic Capra movie. In the end, Stewart wins not because the system works - in fact, it completely fails him - but only because one man slips over the edge. Once that happens, the movie ends two minutes later. The rejoicing is brief, because in fact Stewart's character, giving his best, cannot triumph over the Senate's corruption and indifference. Good does not win out over evil because it is better. It therefore left me with a most unpleasant feeling: politics IS as corrupt as we fear in our worst moments.If you have never seen this movie, be sure to catch it. It is not another Capra feel-good movie. It is a masterfully constructed, by no means optimistic, and sometimes bone-chillingly pessimistic view of our democracy.----------------------------I watched this movie again tonight. Once it gets going in the Senate chamber, this movie is riveting, as good as movies get. Stewart's performance is unbeatable, directed magnificently by Capra. But again, as I wrote before, this is not an optimistic, feel-good movie. The Senate is corrupt, and goodness does not win over or change it. It is only because Claude Raines' Sen. Payne breaks down that the tide is turned. The movie ends two minutes later, as if to say that the whole group still smells so bad that Capra does not want to linger and deal with them further. I don't think that Congress is that corrupt today, but this movie is so well made that it still chills me to the bone.============================On yet another viewing: I've changed my mind (2022). Congress is indeed every bit as corrupt as Capra shows. How horrible for us. But how devastatingly perceptive for Capra. He was right: even good men can be brought down by greed for power.

I am proud to be an Englishman but with films around like this promoting all the great things about the U.S.A and the freedom it represents, I suppose a Yank would have been my next choice.Claude Rains is wonderful (again) as the corrupt but guilt ridden Senator Joseph Paine, who, in order to protect the political machine from which he benefits, is forced to denounce Smith as a crook, destroying our hero's morale. After all Senator Paine was like a father figure to the young patriot and was the closest friend of his late father.One of my favourite parts of the film are the scenes featuring the great Harry Carey as the senate President, who despite his obvious job criteria of staying neutral, seems to encourage and favour Smith at every opportunity. At the end of the movie when Senator Smith is faced with almost certain defeat, the encouraging smile given by Carey is for me the most tear inducing moment in the film.An all round feel-good movie, which leaves us all safe and happy in the knowledge that there is always someone decent enough to take up the sword against evil, and who is prepared to fight to the very extremes of their endurance to see that good will prevail.Makes us wish there were more Senator Smith's in the world today.", "review_date": "2004-07-08", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "My brief review of the film", "content": "Perhaps Frank Capra's best directed film, if not necessarily his best overall film, Capra tells the story with an effective visual side, although praise should also be extended to the cinematography and the smart editing, which allows for speedy pacing without confusion, and which features informative montages as part of the editing design. In many ways, the film is similar to 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town', and it is not really better; instead of improving as it approaches the end, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is weakest towards the end. It seems to have a nice, feel-good air to it, so a \"happy\" conclusion is easily predicted, and if that is not enough, the conclusion itself is contrived.

How could director Frank Capra have made a better choice than Stewart for the quintessential gawky, idealistic, innocent, honest, naive, all-American Senator Jefferson Smith? Smith is a true patriot, a man who knows Lincoln and Jefferson by heart, a man who marvels at all the various historical monuments in Washington, and a man who is enthusiastic about being a junior senator representing his state. He even dreams of establishing a national boys' camp for the purpose of uniting boys of all races, creeds, backgrounds, & walks of life and educating them in what it means to live in the land of the free. Unfortunately, life in the Senate seat is not all peaches and cream as Smith had hoped. Before he knows it, the senior Senator Joseph Paine (brilliantly portrayed by Claude Rains), a man Smith admired all his life and who took Smith under his wing like a true mentor would, suddenly turns 180 degrees and convinces the Senate body that Smith's expulsion would be of best interest. It so happens that Paine and party boss/newspaper tycoon Jim Taylor (neatly played by the sinister Edward Arnold) are involved in a crooked irrigation plot that just happens to be where Smith wishes to establish his camp. Smith is dumbfounded to learn that he has been framed and that all kinds of opposition, including newspaper stories, billboard posters, radio announcements, telegrams, etc. are all in favor of his being expelled, and yet he did nothing wrong; everything was doctored up by Taylor and his assorted heavies. Smith is so disheartened that he intends to leave Washington, but it is this chain of events that brings out the better qualities of Smith's feisty secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who encourages him to stay and fight back. He does, and his nearly twenty-four-hour filibuster is filled with memorable quotes and light touches of humor. To me, Jefferson Smith is a true hero because he is an ordinary man faced with overwhelming loads of corrupt opposition, and yet he decides to stick to his guns and fight. He eventually loses his voice and faints, but he still wins the day as Paine rushes back into the Senate and screams that Smith has been telling the truth all along.Here are some of the more memorable sequences of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" Aside from the filibuster, Smith has one other notable scene on the Senate floor, and that is his introduction of the bill to establish his boys' camp; he very nervously reads aloud the text of his bill while his hands shake and the Senators laugh at him. At the gala celebration honoring Smith for his appointment to the Senate, he rises to his feet and remarks, \"Thank you. I - I - I - I can't help feeling that there's been a big mistake somehow.\" (As biographer Gary Fishgall wrote, this is how most average people would react if they suddenly found themselves appointed to the Unites States Senate.) As Saunders helps Smith write his bill for the boys' camp, Smith's sentiments range from strong statements of patriotism, to pleasant marvels of nature, to questions for Saunders about her background. As Smith and Paine chat quietly together on the train, Smith finds it quite comforting to be in the presence of an elder who he believes to be a fine, virtuous gentleman.\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" was quite an outrage for politicians, as they felt it placed them in quite a dim light. But the public loved \"Mr. Smith,\" and James Stewart must have garnered hundreds of congratulatory notices for his role as Jefferson Smith.

James Stewart gives, in my opinion, his finest performance as the naive senator Jefferson Smith, who goes to Washington with the idea that he's going to change the world. He thinks of Washington as the greatest city, and, as a matter of fact, gets lost his first day there. People want to take him to the Senate to show him around, but Jeff wanders over towards the Capitol building and ends up boarding a tour bus. He has a boyish innocence to him that is absolutely charming.My favorite part is when Senator Paine, following big man Jim Taylor's orders, brings in baskets of telegrams saying that Jeff should end his filibuster. Jeff looks at them desperately, and hangs his head, thinking that he almost killed his voice for nothing. But then, Jeff looks at the president of the Senate, who has liked the idealistic young man from the beginning. The President gives Jeff a warm smile, and Jeff smiles back. He realizes that he can continue with his filibuster, and do a good job!\n\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is definitely one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. If you're a Capra fan, or a fan of James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Harry Carey, Edward Arnold, or Thomas Mitchell, I really recommend this.

Basically U.S. Senator Sam Foley, of an unnamed western state, has died, governor Hubert \"Happy\" Hopper (Guy Kibbee) has to find a replacement, his corrupt political boss, media magnate Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), wants a man appointed who will appeal to the people, and will be easy to manipulate. It is after a suggestion from his children that Hopper appoints the head of the Boy Rangers, naive and idealistic Jefferson Smith (Oscar nominated James Stewart), he displays a positive demeanour and does everything possible to gain a good reputation, but the newspapers portray and brand him as a bumpkin. Senator Joseph Paine (Oscar nominated Claude Rains) has a public esteem, but is secretly a crook, he wants Smith to propose a bill, with the help of his secretary Clarissa Saunders (Shane's Jean Arthur), who worked for his predecessor, Smith suggests a bill to authorise a federal government loan to buy land for the national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America, donations pour in immediately. It is when Smith goes to Washington he realises all the manipulation he has been drawn into, the situation gets worse when he realises he has been tricked into a political scandal, and he must appear before the Senate chamber. Smith exhausts himself to probe his innocence, proving himself actually knowledgeable about many subjects others thought he was naive towards, talking non-stop for about 24 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme, until in the end he collapses, and Paine loudly confesses the scheme intentions, proving Smith's innocence. Also starring It's a Wonderful Life's Thomas Mitchell as Diz Moore, Eugene Palette as Chick McGann, It's a Wonderful Life's Beulah Bondi as Ma Smith, H.B.

Stewart won his actor for The Philadelphia Story, he lost out in this film to Robert Donat in Goodbye, Mr. Chips, I agree he could have perhaps won this film, he is an endearing character, the only problem I have is that the politics is a little hard to keep up with, but the plotting by politicians using the leading character as their puppet is interesting, the best scenes are him defending himself in a courtroom style chamber, there were the small amusing moments as well, I can sort of agree with critics giving this film five stars out of five, it is a worthwhile political comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin.

The death is sudden and unexpected. Far beyond the grieving or sense of loss, it is described in terms of being a newsworthy item, or a bit of bad luck for a Political Machine.Its master plan to extract untold monetary gain from the well intentioned emergency deficiency(federal aid)bill.We are privy to behind the scenes conferencing and to meeting the guys who could be called the 'King Makers' or at least, the powers behind the throne.A conversation between the un-named State's surviving Senator, Joseph Paine(Claude Reins)and Political Boss, James Taylor(Edward Arnold)concerning the importance of their getting things done post haste! The selection of an appointment to fill out the unexpired term of the now expired Law Maker. Qualities like ability, integrity, devotion to duty education and background do not make it into the conversation.The new Senator must know how to keep his lip buttoned and to take orders from the Political Machine, as conveyed to him by his senior cohort, Senator Paine. It will be the Governor's(Guy Kibbee)duty under law to make the selection. This is a much more complicated chore than it would seem. For the Gov is totally in the pocket of Boss Taylor.Governor 'Happy' Hopper has not only Taylor to contend with, but also an amalgam of citizens, representing a cross section of the electorate, who have a grass-roots reformer in mind for the post. The Gov cannot find peace, even in his own household, where his wife and large number of offspring are all very astute of the back room political world that Daddy inhabits.But it is through the kids that 'Hap' learns of the Hero, Youth Leader, one Jefferson Smith(Jimmy Stewart). Smith is honest,hard working, knowledgeable, and a super student of American History. He is also very 'wet behind the ears.' When it comes to pragmatic dealing with real world problems, he has the outlook of a boy.An accidental tangling with Boss Taylor's Boondoggle, an unnecessary damn for the same river canyon that Smith would establish a 'NMational Boys' Camp', Smith is branded as being 'trouble'. Against his better judgment and wishes, Senator Paine has his own daughter, Susan(Astrid Allwin), get Smith away from the Senate and any knowledge of the grafting intent of its one section.Smith is told about the reason for his absence from the Senate and how and why it was orchestrated by Paine and his daughter. Emraged, he starts asking a lot of questions about the Dam project and about Taylor and his control of the Machine.They frame Smith and, well then the big showdown comes into play. The trumped up charges, the move to expel Smith seem too much, but another meeting with his Secretary, \"Saunders\"(Jean Arthur)sets him on the track for the battle in the Senate Chambers.The pivotal occurrences seem to all revolve on Claude Rains' Sen. Paine Character. His character (small 'c') is a highly complex blend of all that is good and bad in mankind. Joe Paine had once been an eager beaver of an innocent, much like his youthful Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Smith. But along the line, Paine started excessively 'playing ball' and 'doing business' with special interests. His role was reduced to that of \"Whore\". And the one scene that seems to break Senator Paine is a short and quiet for Mr. Claude Rains' character. At a sort of 'victory' party given by Taylor celebrating the successful frame job of Smith, Taylor is seen teasing some party girls (obviously some 'Bimbos')about which one would get some little trinkets or money, Paine looks on angry and tormented. The scene strongly reminding him of what he has made of his own daughter.The film's credits list only the 2 names of Jean Arthur and James Stewart as Stars above the title, MR.

We have to pay a special tribute to Harry Carey's portrayal of the Vice President(the President of the Senate). His VP is stern, business like,capable and experienced. Yet he is also a kindly and decent man. He remains impartial while the most serious charges are put on the seemingly guilty Smith. And besides, he looked so much like my Paternal Grandfather & namesake, John T.

MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON oozes with patriotism and idealism, with corruption around the borders.  Jimmy Stewart does not \"belong\" in Washington, but the incredulous \"Jefferson Smith\" will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II.  Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores.  I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in.  Time has told us we can't.  \"Jeff Smith\" would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.Capra's direction is so forward and compelling in showing the once bright-eyed Mr. Smith's realization of what he is up against.  Even in the 1930's, there were \"political machines\" led by mobsters or businessmen. Stewart is the best at showing emotion through his facial gestures.  His weepy breakdown in he and Capra's equally brilliant ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is similar to Mr. Smith's 23 hour filibuster.  He is everyman and isn't that who we wish was passing and signing bills in this country?  Jean Arthur is sweet as \"Saunders\", the hard-nosed, yet sympathetic heroine who helps Smith in his plight.  You can see immediately when she falls in love with Smith in a wonderfully filmed scene where Smith promotes his ideals for the youth of America.  The classical Hollywood close-up is utilized to show her love through happy tears.As in most Capra flicks, the supporting cast is colorful and right to create a slightly comedic and heavily dramatic atmosphere.  You can only imagine how the U.S. government viewed this picture back in the day.  Capra was a maverick who clearly put country and hope first on his list of artistic priorities.  The happenings we see in a film like MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON can only happen in Hollywood films, which is why the system and its classics have endured for so long.  Here is a movie that they should show in the \"Capital Dome\" on a daily basis to the fatcats who sit in office today.  \"Jefferson Smith\" is pure fiction but absolutely possible if only earnestness and honesty were practiced in Washington now.

I've always hated the kind of sentimentality Capra espouses but I cannot deny that he is a great director. There is such sincerity in everything he does that even these themes that reek of over zealous sentimentality can actually feel compelling to an audience that just isn't susceptible to them. For one thing he always casted his films extremely well. 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' is driven by it's excellent performances that turn these characters with motivations that seem so one dimensional into powerful representations of the optimistic world Capra so believed in. This is compelling despite all it's cartoon eccentricities. The fact is this is the most interesting Capra film. It shows a world that is dark and where Jefferson Smith is the only real idealist in it. It is an achievement equally shared by Capra and his brilliant cast headlined by Jimmy Stewart.Jimmy Stewart is really pitch perfect even when he plays seemingly simplistic characters in these type of films Stewart does have an ability to show the motivations and soul behind the nice guy persona and that isn't an easy thing to do. It's hard to remember his talent because the Stewart persona has become so iconic it's almost a parody. I like this representation. He isn't blatant or loud. There's some unspooling to be done with Jefferson Smith. He's a character that changes a great deal of the course of the film and we get to see that through Stewart's performance. His bright eyed idealism is in tune with the Stewart legend but the best moments from Stewart come when Smith begins to lose that hope. My favorite scene in the film is when he revisits the Lincoln Memorial after he learns the truth about the culture of corruption. Stewart is so good in this scene that he almost makes us forget the film we are watching and expect something tragic. This performance is essential in looking and assessing Jimmy Stewart as a an actor.My favorite performance comes from the great Claude Rains as the hardened career politician Senator Paine. This part could have very easily been a conventional villain especially in a black and white Capra world but Rains is brilliant here because we see that this character is more than appearances. He isn't black and white and like many men like him we get the feeling this character has repeated the lies until he believes them. I love the build up on Raines face as he listens to the classic filibuster ending. The writing rightly shows that men like Jefferson Smith come to Washington all the time with idealism but they end up becoming like Paine through compromise. Raines shows this. We can't hate this man. That he finds redemption in the end shows the best qualities about the American ideal that Capra loved. There's a lot of goofy stuff here. It's not a film that hesitates to engage in the most blatant over the top melodrama. It's also undoubtedly a piece of propaganda. The America in this film unfortunately is the concoction of storytellers and myth makers like Capra. Capra makes us believe and hope in it though. It's entertaining and silly but the sincere way it is told and acted captured the attention of a cynic like me.

Here is a character to throw your support behind and root for like the noble prizefighter who just won't lay down. It may be emotion in the rah-rah and flag waving sense, but his commitment and integrity gets the blood pumping. Hopefully it gets people thinking that if Jefferson Smith were a real man then they'd vote for him. It would be a vote for decency - a quality which we tend to find is sadly lacking amongst politicians in general.If he were a fool then he wouldn't have my sympathy, but there's more to this guy than the simple patsy the top brass think they're recruiting... He has a few allies to help stiffen his resolve in the lions den, and one of the great pleasures beside the pure ethics of the tale is the canny way a gradual affection develops between Smith and his strong-willed secretary (Jean Arthur). It's traditional in virtually any setting to have a dash of romance that may well blossom, but don't let the earnest nature of Jefferson fool you into thinking it will be sappy. As the man becomes more confident in his new environment, he begins to get an education in all sorts of other ways, too - tastefully dealt with, of course. We as the audience learn along with him. Remarkably for a document of 1939, even as a basic civics lesson much of it hasn't dated and is disguised in an entertaining manner.It's cleverly set up from the beginning that Jefferson Smith is a reverent and respectful man, so for me the misty-eyed sentimentality that underpins the story never grated in the slightest.

His latest film was met with wide acclaim and at Oscar time it was rewarded with an impressive eleven nominations (winning one). Today, over seventy years later the film is rightly recognized as a classic.The story concerns idealistic senator Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) who is appointed to his position by superiors looking for someone who'll be seen and not heard. However, when Smith attempts to utilize his position for the good of his state's citizens he quickly finds that his proposed bill conflicts with an existing bill that was drafted with less than honourable intentions.The cast is, in a word, excellent. James Stewart's Oscar-nominated performance is the bedrock upon which the film is built. He brings a sense of nobility to the character that could have seemed phony in the hands of another actor. Jean Arthur's world-weary character is similar to the one she played in Capra's \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" and she once again does a fine job. The supporting cast also contains some noteworthy individuals. Claude Rains deservedly landed an Oscar nomination for his standout performance while Thomas Mitchell and Edward Arnold could easily have been similarly honoured. Harry Carey also scooped up an Oscar nomination for his performance though I don't think that it was really that extraordinary.The film's only Oscar win was for the original story. The fact that the plot has the usual Capraesque elements would seem to suggest predictability but the screenwriters do a fine job of getting us invested in what's transpiring on screen. Capra landed an Oscar nomination for his deft direction while the editing, sound and art direction were also awarded nominations. These were all important elements in the film's overall technical appeal, as was Dimitri Tiomkin's stirring score, which was also Oscar nominated.In the end, my only complaint about the film is that it seemed to drag slightly in the latter stages. This is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that the climax takes the form of a contest of endurance.

This film masterfully captures both, a specialty of most Frank Capra classics. They are not fixed to a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. This film released in 1939 has young James Stewart at his very best. It is a political drama/ comedy with elements of patriotism and the usual good vs evil plot. The film has a crowd pleasing element only matched by few.Jeff Smith (James Stewart) believes that children are the future and they should take the values from their great Country. When a senator dies in his state, the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing him the new senator. When Mr. Smith- the true patriot, arrives Washington, he is amazed by all the greatness that Washington possesses. He comes up with idea to propose a Bill that would let kids come together and enjoy the wilderness in a plot in his home town. His colleague Mr. Pain has his own plans with that same land. The film then releases the full fury of what corrupt politicians can do to a truthful man. The U.S. Senate is amazingly detailed.

But I forgot how much I love Jimmy Stewart in \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (one of my all time favorites) and how much I love Frank Capra. Well, obviously I ended up falling in love with this movie, too. Of course, it's not a typical movie like we'd see in theaters today. I'm not sure why people rate it based on that. Old movies should be treated with more respect! They didn't have the technology that we did now, and the most advance things they could do were corny montages. :) Really, I found a lot of things funny in this movie that shouldn't have been. (but I tend to laugh more than anything; life is just better that way) The boys in the entire movie were hilarious. They were just...so strange. And for some reason, it was okay for angry politicians to ram their huge truck into the boys' car. And it was okay for Jimmy-boy to run around the streets punching people. But in the end, I believe those parts made the movie more enjoyable!The music, the acting, the directing..it was all top notch in my opinion. Well, the music was a bit too patriotic at times, but that was very appropriate. Jean Arthur was very cute and played her role quite well. And, for some reason, I fell in love with Claude Rains voice..which means I fell in love with his character. I had to convince myself that there was some good in him, and I was right. The story was just fine. (a lot better than a lot of movies around today! oy!) We went over the corniness...and the plot may have been a bit predictable, but I really wanted it to end well. Good needs to defeat evil in the end. And sure, the ending may seem a bit abrupt, but what can they say after that? All is well! A very good movie.

There is little in the way of flashy editing or dazzling set pieces, only some fine actors delivering a wildly intelligent and sophisticated screenplay. But this shining aspect alone puts Mr. Smith Goes to Washington at a level of grandiose brilliance that has all the same appeal as a sparkling big budget epic. The movie is about Jefferson Smith, played by one of my favorite actors James Stewart. After the senator of his state passes away, Smith is rushed into office to hold the US Senate seat. Smith is naive but has a very big heart with equally big ambition. He pushes for a national boys camps with the best intentions, but when his selfless prospects get in the way of plans for a dam, two other senators, Jim Taylor and Joseph Paine, conspire to get Smith kicked out of office through scandal and corruption. It is a harsh criticism of the American government, but also a wonderfully characterized and extremely captivating underdog story which Stewart plays perfectly.I've already said a lot about the screenplay of this film, but I'm going to keep talking about it because it's just that compelling. The storyline of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is its shining aspect that makes it one of the smartest films of its decade. What begins as a fun little tale about a naive young man getting to play with the big dogs in the Senate becomes a darker and very critical commentary on the US governmental system. It's not to say that the film doesn't also remain lighthearted where it needs to be. It's a very pleasant story in which our protagonist prevails through his own will and determination. But there is a consistent theme of political corruption that only goes as far as a dam construction in the film, but alludes to more serious corruption that has sadly become all the more prevalent since the film was released.One of the most amazing things about this film is just how relevant it is in todays society. Political corruption is a plague and a curse that we can't seem to rid ourselves of in this world. It only seems to grow to darker and more sinister things as the years go by, and at the time Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was made this idea of such corruption was so much smaller than it is today, in a world where under the table bargains are made every day, screwing over the good hearted Jefferson Smiths of the world. It's sad that we still see this corruption today, but at least it still makes Mr. Smith Goes to Washington a socially relevant piece of cinema.But aside from the brooding undercurrent of this film, it really does have a happy message. It shows that through selfless and kind hearted perseverance we can overcome the challenges put forth unto us by the tyrannical fat cats sitting in their ivory towers, thinking they are invincible against the sympathetic little man. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington doesn't end on a dark note and it doesn't force feed us cynical thoughts about American government. Instead it uplifts us and gives up hope that there is good in the world. That's why I think James Stewart was so perfectly cast in this role because of how incredibly likable he is in any role her pursues. The character of Jefferson Smith inadvertently demands empathy, and that isn't difficult to do when he is so empathetically portrayed by James Stewart.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a great little film. It's got a very socially relevant message, one that is transferred excellently from the marvelous script to the screen by exquisite actors. The dialouge in this film keeps you so enthralled in this movie from start to finish and the filibuster at the end of the movie is just as compelling and epic as any final battle sequence in an action movie. This screenplay does with words what other films could and sometimes even couldn't do with guns, swords, or explosions. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a compelling piece of rich cinema that shouldn't be missed.", "review_date": "2010-11-29", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "The world of dirty politics still goes on.", "content": "This film would not have survived in this cynical day and age if it was made only yesterday.

Jefferson Smith fights the big guns with truth and that you have to admire because people of this calibre are few. Another relevant point is the power of one man over the media.

It doesn't hide the fact that there is corruption in politics, but it does say quite clearly that there is a point and a value to standing up to it.As movie quotes go, Jean Arthur's words to Jeff Smith deserve to be remembered: \"Your friend Mr. Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines. So did every other man whoever tried to lift his thought up off the ground. Odds against 'em didn't stop those men. They were fools that way.

Is there anything wrong with being idealistic ? Is what Mr. Smith representing wrong ? No. If he is not wrong in his principals, then why should I think of it as rubbish and corny ? Why should I accept that politicians are going to be corrupt ?...\" And this is the beauty of this film. It shows its viewer that its not wrong to be honest and try to defend and uphold our ideals.

Although the story line is great, some small details i the movie are too unrealistic to ignore. Obviously the actors over-dramatized most of the film to go along with the Capra-esque style(most notably the governor's children at the dinner table), but the main problem is during Smith's filibuster. Why were the boy rangers working in a sweat shop to make Smith's newspaper? How did so many rallies and parades get started in less than 23 hours?

Why did everyone just stand there and watch as a man slapped a kid in the face and walked out with their newspapers? Why were little kids driving a car in the first place?

It tells a story of a country boy, played outstandingly by James Stewart, who gets elected to the Senate out of obvious reasons, as he is totally unfit to be a senator and wouldn't be a problem standing way behind the real people in control - but those people were wrong thinking wrong of him. There is just one flaw in a human being and it is conscience. That's the biggest flaw of Mr. Smith and he shows every side of it to the Senate in order to maintain his position, to speak the truth and to get people to think, to listen.Frank Capra is notorious for being a master in making dramas: just think of \"American Madness\" (1932) and the way he slowly but firmly unravels the story up to the breaking point when the main character seems to have lost a battle - but the war is still raging on. James is perfect in portraying everyday characters with big hearts and great minds; he makes us believe what is happening on screen and his pairing with my favorite Jean Arthur just doubles the enjoyment.

By contrast, I found Stewart annoying. For my taste, his 'I am such a naive and normal guy'-attitude felt terribly overacted. He improves over time and becomes much better towards the end of the film, but still, there are other pictures where I liked him better. Another thing that is satisfying but could have been better is the ending: One of the corrupt senators confesses his misdeeds in a fit of truthfulness.

There is more humor in this movie than a barrel of Boy Rangers. More action than all the Indiana Jones adventures put together. More two-fisted romance than you can shake a Doctor Zhivago at before the Washington Monument. More hair-raising scarifying drama in Washington than even Hamlet saw rotting in Denmark. Lo! The time is '-out of joint! O cursed spite that Jefferson Smith was ever bamboozled into becoming a Senator to set it right!'Now if you accept all of the above at face value, I have some land I would like to sell you near Willard Creek. The point being that a naive 'aw-shucks' nature lover and forest ranger slowly comes to realize that the institutions and people he most admires and worships have cracks and flaws at the seams and in many cases feet of clay. This film has no peer in chronicling how the idealistic illusions of youth can become the disillusions of the experiences of age and finally a reassertion of idealism as a working model in progress always aiming at a perfection that may never be completely attained but still always evolving.The scene that gets me every time is how Jefferson Smith stands before the Lincoln Monument like a character in a James Thurber story, awed by the stern majesty of The Great Emancipator's gaze. This is followed by a scene where Smith is considering beating a hasty retreat out of town after realizing that he has been an unknowing pawn in the machinations of a great political machine. Again he looks to the Lincoln Monument with wounded wonder as though seeking solace once again in the gaze of his favorite stone idol. But the gaze is still stern and unyielding. I can almost hear Honest Abe uttering with a stormy countenance, \"What! Did you think this place was for kids?\" The truth being that Smith can either grow up fast or go back home to mother and practice his bird calls. It is with the help of aide Clarissa Saunders, more than ably played by Jean Arthur, that our Junior Senator comes to realize that Democracy is better represented by ordinary people working hard for the right than by paragons of power displayed in white marble.The memorable moments are too many to count and catalogue, and the D. C. environment is a grand stage for a young actor to go and strut his stuff. I can't remember ever hearing so many witty lines being given by the minor characters, be they young boys or crusty old Senators, as well as supporting characters and the major leads. The cast is huge, but I easily remember them all for some bit of dramatic business that made them stand out in the end. Above and beyond the concept of ensemble, there is a communal spirit at work in these auspicious proceedings that aims to tell a whale of a folksy yarn and deliver a big message that packs an unforgettable wallop. This is director Frank Capra at the top of his game and firing on all cylinders. If you thought Charles Forbin had his work cut out for him in dealing with the allied super computers Colossus and Guardian, check out what Senator Smith has to confront when he takes on a giant political machine fueled by graft armed with nothing more than a filibuster, an apple and a thermos filled with coffee! It can get mighty drafty when you're standing in a vast chamber with hardly anybody to talk to besides the President of the Senate, but you'll see what I mean later.Claude Rains is superb as the once idealistic Senator Joseph Paine, now in the pocket of political boss Jim Taylor, as played by Edward Arnold, among others. Beaulah Bondi as Ma Smith lets the viewers know that this is a game of high stakes where even children's lives are at risk in the bargain. It's also thrilling to see H. B. Warner, who played Christ in Cecil B. DeMille's THE KING OF KINGS (1927), as a Senate Majority Leader leading the pack against Senator Smith. Astrid Allwyn makes a great romantic distraction for Smith, as Susan Paine, while the boys in the smoke-filled back rooms get a little business done, and Harry Carey, the famous silent film Western Star and airplane mechanic from the film AIR FORCE (1943), gently suggests with a smile of encouragement that the young Jefferson Smith just might have the right stuff after all to crusade here in Washington. The cinematography of Joseph Walker is expertly edited by Gene Havlick and Al Clark with a musical sweep almost as inspiring as the actual score of Dimitri Tiomkin.

For me, what makes this film truly remarkable is that it is profoundly patriotic without resulting to the flag waving, \"no questions asked\" attitude taken by many people today.  The movie expresses a real love for the country, but is not afraid of showing the flaws in the government, though admittedly the resolution IS unrealistic, but that just adds to its charm as a political fantasy.

But under many of Capra's superficially simplistic stories lurked a seed of angry bitterness. The desperation of the Great Depression is acutely palpable underneath the screwball romance exterior of \"It Happened One Night,\" and despite its reputation as a heart-warming Christmas film, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" has some very dark moments which effectively illustrate one man quickly approaching the end of his rope.In the world of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" everything of course turns out right, justice prevails, and American government is depicted as a body of men who basically want to do the right thing by their people. But it's also an angry indictment of corruption and the self-interest rampant in our government that existed then and still exists today. Rich politicians want the poor to stay poor (or they at least have no incentive to help the lower classes improve their situations), because it benefits them. This movie was pretty fearless for its time, when anti-government sentiment would not have been popular and would become even less popular as the U.S. entered WWII and patriotic fervor struck the nation.Anchoring this film is James Stewart, who deserves mention along with Jack Lemmon as one of cinema's great everymen.

Expecting a dream come true, he soon finds that he was only selected to be pawn for the powerful and corrupt \"Taylor Machine\" along with his fellow senator Joseph Paine. Rather than back down and follow orders, he decides to stay true to his ideals and stand up against corrupt politics.This film is a landmark in cinema for several reasons. First of all, it was incredibly important too society. It was often frowned upon at the time because it was one of the first films, if not THE first, to paint a somewhat negative picture of American politicians, but it was also banned in several fascist and communist countries because of it's message of democracy, freedom, and the power of one. It was the last American film to be shown in France before the German occupation and no doubt gave hope to the country that freedom was on its way.It is also a very inspiring film. Many claim that Frank Capra's work is all very unrealistic and corny. Several claim more specifically that in real life this film would not have ended the way it would. I disagree with that, but even so, there's not denying that this film is powerful. By the end of it, you feel very uplifted. It makes you believe in the power of your voice, the power of one man, and the importance of having high ideals.It is also just overall an incredibly well-done film. Some of the transitions are very quick, but that just the time period, filmmakers at that time had yet to experiment with flashy camera work and creative transitions and such. Most definitely what was important about films in the 30's and 40's was the content much less than the camera work or the editing, and the content is fantastic. The film has an excellent screenplay, and lovable characters as well as some detestable ones. It's also very informative, containing somewhat of a lesson on the way the legislative system of our government works. but what stands high above everything else in this film is most definitely the acting.James Stewart is absolutely brilliant as the young and naive, yet determined Jefferson Smith. When he gets to Washington he has every appearance of a little boy going to see his favorite baseball team play for the first time. In the first part of the film he's very passive and very vulnerable, but also very kind, but once he starts to stand up for himself, he exudes power with his performance, and you can see the transition completely.Jean Arthur is adorable as the cynical yet sweet Saunders, and while the romance between her and Smith is a little underplayed, it's very captivating. Claude Raines also give a brilliant performance as Senator Joseph Paine. You can see the inner struggle of his character in his expressions and his delivery is impeccable. And Harry Carry's reactions as the President of the Senate are priceless. They're subtle but very amusing.All in all this is a movie that true film buffs absolutely should not miss, as well as anyone who is interested in politics or would like a good lesson in acting.", "review_date": "2009-07-09", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "By God, we need more Mr. Smiths NOW", "content": "IF only we had a Mr. Smith now to uncover the corrupt Bush administration.

It's contemporary significance can be demonstrated by the fact that when the Nazi's in occupied France banned the showing of Hollywood films several French cinemas chose this film as the last one they screened, one for 30 consecutive nights, to act as a lasting beacon for democracy. The film also commented upon corruption in states such as Montana at the time. It's timelessness can easily be demonstrated by the current echoes that the film has with the activities of the Murdoch media empire, their ability to exert major political influence and the ability to subvert public opinion by distorted coverage in the Murdoch press and in his TV empire via channels such as Fox News. The film is another example of Capra's little man against the big machine and it is strange that this consistent theme comes from Capra and Stewart who were both avowed Republicans. The performance by James Stewart was star making but is somewhat histrionic for my taste. However his commitment to the role can be demonstrated by the fact that he took various concoctions to actually give him a very sore throat for the scenes at the end of his \"fillybustering\". Jean Arthur's character and the relationship with Mr Smith seems somewhat unconvincing and some of the humour, such as the drunken scene, seems heavy handed and unsubtle. That is unless you are a fan of such modern starlets as Jeniifer Aniston,then you'll think that characterisation in broad strokes and via a few forced expressions is fine. The supporting cast is wonderful, particularly Claude Rains, but his final dramatic change of heart is unconvincing and is one aspect of the film that won't translate to a modern audience who are used to their politicians being bought and paid for, professional party line hacks. Capra has an ability to deal with big themes through the struggle of a single man and that is his genius. This film is no exception and the United States Film Regulatory board has nominated the film as one that is \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". So why doesn't it work for me? Because I just can't get over the big hole in the plot. If Mr Smith is disgraced because they produce false papers saying he owns the land on which the dam is to be built why doesn't he simply say if I own the land then there won't be a dam and I'll build my Boy Rangers camp there after all. And if Mr Smith does have documents showing that he owns the land how could the evil Jim Taylor then plan to go ahead and build the dam on the land? The film has all of the great themes of anti corruption and stands up for the little man, the benefits of democracy, truth and redemption and a has a dramatic and positive final outcome. However the central narrative thread is flawed and so the drama in the Senate seems a bit hollow to me when a bit of smart thinking by Mr Smith could have saved him 23 plus hours on his feet and a very sore throat.", "review_date": "2011-08-28", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Please Don't wake me up.", "content": "The teacher told this story in the law class, which was a movie that had a great influence on him.Miss Ho is also an idealist herself, and I understand that my romanticism will one day kill me.\nbut.\nShould I give up first?\nHow do I talk to my children in the future?\nI want to tell them the truth or teach them to lie.Everyone will not be what it is at first.

This was literally the first time I have seen it just moments ago and as the first half hour or so passed, I felt a sinking in my stomach. It wasn't grasping me, it wasn't blowing me away like Gone With The Wind did for the first time. Parts of it felt very dated, especially much of the dialogue between the supporting cast members. They all spoke (especially the children in the film) like 1940's gangsters. I know it was almost 1940 but they aren't supposed to be gangsters. Maybe it was a slang style of speech but it was overwhelming and little cheesy. They used the term \"seee\" more than a dozen times I swear. Then Mr. Smith begins to understand the corruption going on, then comes the epic cinematically historical filibuster and I was riveted to my chair while Jimmy Stewart pounds home his message in one of the most powerful scenes in movie history. The first half of the film dragged and didn't draw me in, but the latter half was the meat and potatoes and made this nearly everything I expected it to be. The first half of the film really delves into what is happening but I felt like it perhaps went into too much detail establishing the various characters than was necessary.Jimmy Stewart plays the iconic Mr. Smith. He definitely does not hit his stride with this character until the latter half of the film. He is deserving of his Oscar nomination because of the intense emotion and power he brings to the closing scene. Up until then he lacks something I felt. He was supposed to be a fish way out of water and he does that but without much flare. Jean Arthur is decent in her role, though her performance was one of those ones that felt very dated in her dialogue. Her chemistry with Stewart was good but I think I wanted more closure to their romance that never really blossoms into something else. Claude Rains is excellent in his performance. The chemistry between him and Stewart is terrific and when Mr. Smith discovers Rains' betrayal you literally feel the pain that would have caused. Edward Arnold is perfect as the pompous gangster type man controlling the senators from the unnamed state. He doesn't have a lot of screen time and his character is a little stereotypical but it fits the role fine. Thomas Mitchell has a small but important role as the reporter who fights for Smith's cause behind the scenes. I would have liked to have seen more from his character because he was fun and charismatic in his scenes. The film has an enormous supporting cast basically being all of the senators and the house leaders. They are all good in their roles and very believable at each step of the way. It's A Wonderful Life fans and Capra fans will recognize some of the actors from the iconic Christmas film.This is only the second Frank Capra film I have seen so I can't really speak too much on his style considering the man is a legend. This film is definitely appealing to the people and is chock full of the emotion of hope and determination for the underdog. Certainly he doesn't hide his opinion that Washington is full of corruption and perhaps even has something to say about the way Washington does its business which I don't think has changed all that much in a lot of ways. Many reviews and things I read talk about how Capra made a film for the everyman about Washington and the process and while obviously the success of the film proves that I did think it was actually very complex in some ways. His lack of mentioning parties and the actual state they were from made it a little hard to follow at times but the message still comes home. The film is a legendary classic and I don't presume to tell anyone whats good and bad about it because everyone should watch this type of film. I liked it a lot and the latter half of the movie will just rivet you to you seat.

Of course , much of it seems quaint now  - strangely located somewhere between realism and folksiness: The movie convincingly establishes the silly/Quixotic nature of Stewart's attempt to draft a Senate bill in one night - so when he actually achieves in doing so, it's hard not to see it as an abandonment of seriousness, a surrender to dreaminess. Stewart only wins his cause, after all, through a rather abrupt, bizarre crack-up by Rains - something of a deus ex machina that leaves the corrupt jungle largely unscathed. Of course, it could hardly be otherwise, but the movie might have aged better had it acknowledged the limitations of its story. Maybe that's why the scene where the newsmen gang up on Stewart and mock him as an ineffectual seat-filler has a nastiness and bite exceeding anything else in the film - a rationality that the more contrived, idealistic  plot developments can't push away. The film certainly zips by though, and the evocation of Stewart's patriotic wide-eyed wonderment when he first comes to Washington is still stirring: maybe Capra couldn't grapple in much complexity with the actual status of such idealism in modern government, but then not many movies have managed it since then either.", "review_date": "1999-10-07", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Do the right thing", "content": "My all-time favorite movie because it is, above all, a film about simply doing the right thing. It is not even about Mr. Smith doing the right thing, however, because we know all along that he will. He couldn't be any other way. The real hero of the movie (you may disagree with me here) is Payne. Payne is like us. We are often conflicted about knowing what the right thing is; in denial and rationalizing actions we know are wrong; and weak about doing the right thing when we do know what it is. Jeff Smith only needs Saunders to remind him of what is right, and he will do it. But all is still lost without Payne. For sixty years the biggest criticism of this film has been its abrupt ending. It is often called a contrived ending. But I believe it is the perfect ending. Like Payne, each one of us has to step up, find our humanity, find our conscience and only then can the hero save the day, with our support! The film is brilliantly written with memorable characters and scenes. It is a perfect romance as well, since the attraction between Smith and Saunders is founded completely in their mutual respect and admiration.

SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON,' is an overlooked gem of our time.  Does the senate really treat rookies or newcomers like they way they did in the film? No one really knows except,  for Frank Capra.  He manages to show how even a great man can sometimes be condemned for no apparent reason.In the beginning,  one of the states (no idea which one) has lost one of their senators , and is in a mad scramble looking for a replacement.  The governor has selected Jefferson smith  (James Stewart) To go serve as a senate member in Washington.  But is this a mistake?  Does he know what could possibly go wrong?  Jefferson knew very little about being on the senate, so this serves as a target for criticism, and ridicule from other senators.  The other senate member, of his state is senator Paine, an old friend of his dad's.  Payne is going along with smith on his way to Washington, to help him out. (or as though we think.)  When Jefferson arrives in Washington, he runs off to go look at the natl. capitol, and other places, leaving senn. Payne and others behind.  When Jefferson decides to come back, he is introduced to beautiful young Clarissa Saunders. (Jean Arthur)  Through out most of the movie she tries to help him along, but finds that she is getting nowhere with him.  At the same time Jefferson is trying to propose a bill to the senate, that will create an all boys camp, on government property.  This is where the trouble starts.  While Jefferson is trying to figure this out, sen. Payne, tries to round up some people who can help him get Jefferson out of office.  The next day, when Jefferson is ready to present his bill, he is in for a rude awakening.  He is extremely nervous and scared.  When it comes time for him to present his bill, a lot of the senators are extremely rude to him, and won't even let him speak. This ends up happening because sen. Payne and others lied about him and tried to get him into trouble with the law.  Jefferson finding out the hard way that everyone, (even his own friend) has let him down disgracefully, decides to go sit and weep by the Lincoln memorial.  When who should come along at the right place and time? Miss. Saunders.  She convinces him not to give up, but to have faith in what he believes in.  She takes him back to his office, and decides to stick with him all the way through, so he can not only defend his bill, but also stomp on those who have committed that foolish act against him.  The heat is rising on the floor of the senate house as Jefferson is trying to defend the bill, after hours and hours, of talking he then starts to defend himself against those who hate him.  A few hours later while Jefferson is still arguing with other senators, sen. Payne does something remarkable That can\u0091t be discussed without spoiling the movie.  Even though Payne did a terrible thing to Jefferson, he made up for it by coming clean and doing the right thing.\nYoung good looking James Stewart, and older but not to old Claude Rains, make terrific duo in this film, as not only being friends, but true enemies as well.  The film has many values to it, especially on how far a friend will go to help someone out,  even if his dishonesty towards his friend is apparent.

He is a naive and idealistic and he wants to change everything starting from the building of a camp for children but his plans promptly collide with political corruption and there the true fight starts.I liked this movie because unfortunately shows us the truth that we all know but never want to believe or talk about it, political corruption and how this influence all of us and our lives. Also this movie also shows us the corruption of th press which is just a small part in the whole political corruption and has as a result the influence of people with lies in order for the companies or politicians to have bigger profit. I really liked the plot of this movie because it represents and shows all of the above. The interpretation of James Stewart who played as Jefferson Smith was simply outstanding and also good interpretation made by Jean Arthur who played as Saunders. Another one interpretation that has to be mentioned is Claude Rains who played as Senator Joseph Paine.Finally I have to say that \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" shows the truth about most of the politicians in many countries of the world who just want to earn more and more money. They do not care about anything else except that and have help from the press and media to succeed their goals. Although this movie also shows us also the other part of it, a decent man who believes in something that everyone forgot and fights for his believes until the end and never surrender, that's the true meaning of this movie and this we have to have as an example for our lives.

In Frank Capra's 'Mr.Smith Goes to Washington', you're going to learn a lot about those two things that all humans should strive towards. This is an inspiring film, and an American classic.Smith is a shy man with little confidence when we first meet him. And it was a shock when I first met him. I have only known James Stewart as George Bailey, arguably the swellest guy to ever grace the screen. He, in comparison, is charming and headstrong. So to see Stewart, stumbling over his words was really something. His performance is outstanding. From his humble beginning to drained, heartful end, we see a character transformed by outside forces and inner strength. But the titular character isn't the only standout. In fact, the entire cast is commendable. Jean Arthur is transformed from a cash-minded to a truth-minded person, with a growing liking for Smith like the characters in 'It Happened One Night'. Claude Reins is easy to hate as the political slimeball who thinks of himself more than the good of the people. As said before, the whole cast shines.I'd like to mention the beginning. Many older movies have very slow beginnings. Not this. Instantly we are thrown into the plot, with a series of phone calls and one hilarious \"NO!\" From there, the drama mounts, and the tempo stays high. 'Washington' could've been a dreadfully boring film. But Capra knew what he was doing. He has a thing for inspiration, eh? I would've given this film a low nine, if not for its one fault: the ending. The ending is so rushed. Right until the end, the film is a masterpiece, but then it just ends. The point is served, and we can draw our own conclusion, but 5 minutes of footage should've been added to settle things down. Capra would learn this several years later with his masterpiece, 'It's A Wonderful Life'.Themes of justice, sticking to your guns, corruption and more hit you like a political activist trying to drum up support.

Jean Arthur was surprising, her previous work in \"You Can't Take It with You\" made me irritable but she executes it satisfactorily, her character still suggests the little recognition of women in politics at that time (and that it still is), when she is the brain of Mr Smith and does not take any credit.

First, we have to watch Jimmy Stewart getting schooled by Jean Arthur about the ways our government works. It's hard to believe that even the most naive simpleton did not get some basic civics course in high school, or that he could not go to the local library and look up a few things when he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. The fact of the matter is that Arthur's character, a woman, knows more about the government and its processes than Stewart, a man. Clearly, she is ten times more qualified than him, yet he is the one who gets to be Senator? I know, I know, the goons (played by Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee and Claude Rains) want an idiot in the seat so they can manipulate him. But why doesn't Arthur or the other women like her fight for the job themselves?As if that is not enough, Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin keep hammering the point that Stewart can get a bill passed for a law that would benefit a boys scout-type group. This is repeated several times, and we even see a throng of clean cut all-American boys in the Senate chamber on the day that Stewart is trying to introduce the bill. They, of course, applaud him enthusiastically. Never mind the fact that there are no girls in attendance-- they simply were overlooked or not invited. And why couldn't Stewart introduce a bill that would benefit both boys and girls in America? There are long speeches where he talks about how boys need to know the way our government works. Again, aren't girls allowed to know that, too?The sexism of this movie becomes increasingly apparent when you realize that there are no women on the Senate floor. And none are seen even as extras in crowd scenes involving politicians. Surely Arthur's character cannot be the only woman in the nation's capital. The filmmakers give the impression that a boys club is running Washington while the female sex is back at home preparing dinner.Did you know that the first woman senator was appointed to fill a vacancy just like Stewart's character, back in 1922? And by 1931 a woman from Arkansas named Hattie Caraway became the first fully elected lady senator, a position she held until 1945. Ms. Caraway was not the only female elected to the Senate in the 1930s. The year Columbia Pictures made MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, there were three other women in the Senate. So that's four women who should have been seen in the Senate chamber scenes of this film. But they are not there, not even on the sidelines or in the background. I am not saying this film necessarily had to be called MISS SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, but there is way too much gender bias in this film.

The Capitol is seen with awe and reverence by James Stewart's Senator Jeff Smith, and there's his iconic filibuster within, standing beside his desk once occupied by Daniel Webster, one of the figures from America's past venerated in the picture.To call director Frank Capra's vague populism quaint may be an understatement; as John Cassavetes said, \"Maybe there wasn't an America, maybe there was only Frank Capra.\" \"A consoling myth of national character,\" as Robert Sklar put it. In between the other two films, \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936) and \"Meet John Doe\" (1941), of the director's so-called little-man trilogy, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" is certainly a patriotic American film--excessively so even, from the start with the Columbia Pictures logo, a personification of the United States, to the Capitol dome and though all the national songs, Washington monuments, historical reverence, and Jeff's \"gee-whiz\" idealism and optimism.

Rogin and Kathlee Moran's essay \"Mr. Capra Goes to Washington,\" in particular, provides a good historical overview and analysis. As I sought solace from this picture of the past, it was itself a reaction to real-world criminal activity that pervaded a presidential administration (and on the heels of a pandemic toppling another administration in favor of the opposition party's candidate promising a return to normalcy, but let's not get too carried away with the historical parallels). As Rogin, Moran, and others have pointed out, the Willet Creek dam project in the film for which Smith uncovers graft is based on the Teapot Dome scandal (basically a bribery scheme over oil leases and which was the most scandalous bit of political misconduct in American history before Watergate) of the Harding administration, with Smith, from the unnamed \"that state,\" being a variation on Senator Burton K. Wheeler, Democrat of Montana, who helped to uncover the skullduggery of Harding's cabinet, as well as being the subject of a fraudulent counter-investigation, as is Smith, of being the one profiting from the corruption.The film has also been seen as a product of the current, New Deal, Depression-era and eve-of-war events of its day. Understandably given the depiction of a corrupted Senate, if at odds with subsequent use of the film even at schools for civics lessons, the real U.S. Congress largely panned the film, with some politicians, including Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, suggesting it could inflict anti-American sentiment overseas. Reportedly, President Franklin Roosevelt was fonder of it, including more so than was Senator Wheeler. By the time the film was made, FDR was in conflict with the Senate, even with those like Wheeler from his own party, as well as with the press, over attempts to pack the Supreme Court and, when that failed, to do so to the Senate. Yet, the small-government individualism in the film of Smith holding up an appropriations bill funding such public works as a dam is hardly an endorsement of the New Deal, let alone the Popular Front of the era.As historically interesting as all that is, it risks missing the point of the film's populist patriotism, which, besides, is relatively coherent considering the varying ideologies involved in its production. As Rogin and Moran argue, as did Capra in his transition to such socially-conscious \"important\" films, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" represents the political power of cinema. This is such a well-crafted piece of filmmaking, too--even the montages climaxing with the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument and of a newspaper monopoly extending to police turning water hoses on opponents and to running boy scouts off the road stand out--it's easy to overlook the political confusion beyond the little man standing up against the system.Stewart is very good. Besides Wheeler, his Jeff, short for Jefferson, is part author of the Declaration of Independence, part lanky--\"Honest Abe\"--Lincoln type, traveling to the home of George Washington, and with a last name of Smith that is more everyman in its commonality than \"John Doe.\" He's so boyishly naive that he's literally a scoutmaster, the boys of his troop having pestered the Governor to appoint him to a vacant Senate seat form his only lobbyist constituency. It's pretty funny at times, and I love the business with his awkwardness holding onto his hat. I'm hard pressed to think of another actor who could pull off such corny speechifying and with such appealingly unsophisticated bumpkin awe. His Oscar snub is one of the more infamous in the Academy's history and resulted in him being awarded the subsequent year for an inferior performance in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940) where he arguably wasn't even the best male actor in that film (i.e. Cary Grant is great in it). More importantly, his affable everyman appeal as a romantic, but not sexualized, lead would prove a great foil for his more devastating post-war oeuvre, including Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), but better yet, Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic \"Rear Window\" (1954) and \"Vertigo\" (1958).The supporting cast is uniformly good, too. Capra, exercising unusual control for a Hollywood studio auteur, sure knew how to pick 'em. Jean Arthur as the wise-cracking aide, part the film's surrogate spectator being converted to Jeff's \"lost cause,\" part surrogate director coaching him from the balcony; frog-voiced Eugene Pallette; silent film Western star Harry Carey providing Oscar-nominated reaction faces--reactive characters generally being important to the fine editing here--as the President of the Senate; Edward Arnold continuing a menacing turn as the political boss here after a powerful part as the capitalist boss in Capra's \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938); Thomas Mitchell playing a drunkard again (as he did for an Oscar the same year in \"Stagecoach\"), even if his role merely serves as a springboard for Arthur's; and the greatest perhaps of supporting actors of classical Hollywood, Claude Rains, as the father figure and doing the conflicted character part of is-he-a-villain-or-is-he-redeemable act as well as always.Granted, the picture is so white and male-oriented that such boys have more of a voice in the political process than do women, all of whom except for Arthur's Saunders (complemented by Smith as, \"For a woman, you've done awful well\") are simply relegated to mothers or giggling girls, as African Americans are to servant jobs in this D.C. That's 1939 American politics for you. I mean, this is a film that valorizes the one-man filibuster, for which the only time a senator has really gone an entire day was when Strom Thurmond railed against the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Superficially, too, the debate here is between pork-barrel spending benefiting one constituency against pork-barrel spending benefiting another--but both from the same state and over what to do with the same parcel of land. Even despite Capra being an immigrant himself, as Rogin and Moran mention, the bad handwriting experts in Smith's trial are marked by foreign accents while the good expert spotting the forgery of the signature is American.A product of its times, revering the past, that itself has become a nostalgic classic of cinema. That movie house that Smith dismisses while admiring the Capitol dome lit up becomes a monument of its own and the most powerful form of media. Whether or not the newspapers, the corresponding writing campaigns in telegrams, radio, and even all of those telephone calls are ultimately effective against Smith's oratory within the film, the point is they don't succeed outside of it with movie audiences. It's the same with how he sees the Capitol, cinematically rendered, framed by windows like a film-within-the-film, as a symbol of American democracy.", "review_date": "2021-01-12", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Absolutely delightful with Stewart in a career and legend making role...", "content": "MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is quite easily one of *those* classic films that everyone has heard of but not everyone has seen. It's referenced in everything, from television programmes like The Simpsons through to American Politics textbooks. It's got that glowing word-of-mouth aura about it, kind of like another of Frank Capra and James Stewart's collaborations, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. You know the story even before you see the film: James Stewart plays small-town community hero and full-time Boy Ranger Jefferson Smith, the idealistic naive kind of guy who's an aw-shucks patriot and can quote chunks of Lincoln and Washington off the top of his head. When one of the sitting senators in his state passes away, the massive political machine controlling and choking the state, headed by the ruthless James Taylor (Edward Arnold), goes into action. It's already bought out the senior Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains), and attempts to break Jeff's back when he does finally go to Washington and his idealistic hope of setting up a national boys' camp in his home-state runs smack against a dam-building graft scheme Mr. Taylor is currently hatching. With the help of sassy, worldly Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Jeff sets out to prove not only that he is innocent, but that his faith in his ideals and principles will win him the world and the respect he deserves, all this through an absolutely cracking filibuster that takes up the last fifth or so of the film. There is much to recommend MR SMITH, but I'd like to concentrate on the acting. Three actors deserve special praise for their work showcased in this film, although the supporting cast is also excellent, from the page boys in the Senate Room through to Governor 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee), the sympathetic Senate President (Harry Carey), and of course, Edward Arnold as Jim Taylor is as crusty and mean as ever. However, the three top-billed stars must also take top acting honours. Jean Arthur is excellent as 'Call me Clarissa only if you mean it' Saunders--she's completely believable from first to last, from her initial skepticism about the \"Daniel Boone\" she was going to have to shepherd around, through to her last impassioned fight for and with Jefferson Smith to win through against the Taylor political machine and the Senate. It's easy to believe her when hardboiled city gal Saunders listens to Smith waxing lyrical about nature, about the wonders of the American system and political symbols, and melts--her drunk scene when she keeps promising to marry her buddy Diz Moore (Thomas Mitchell) because she doesn't yet know that she's already in love with Jeff is great to watch. One really cannot help but adore Arthur, always sweet, real, and very much a Capra heroine (see YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN etc.).Claude Rains is, as usual, excellent in his role as Senator Paine: he creates a character who is flawed but essentially good, someone who is so used to 20 years of taking orders from someone else that he can believe he's just 'compromising'. It takes Jefferson Smith, of course, to make Paine realise that there can be no compromising one's ideals without losing something even more important--one's integrity. Paine's final impassioned scene, when he bursts back into the Senate hall, is a fabulous display of deep self-disgust. Rains truly is one of the most undeservedly unknown actors of his generation: a rare chameleon who blends into every role he plays so much so that he's appeared in some of the most famous film classics of all time (aside from MR SMITH, he also plays key roles in CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS, to name just two), and is not only as well-known for it as he should be, but also isn't often recognised from film to film! His performance is MR SMITH is no exception: pitch-perfect and utterly credible.Finally, we come to James Stewart's Jefferson Smith, what must surely be one of the best performances ever committed to film--not just of Stewart's own filmography, but of every screen actor to date. He makes a potentially hokey, foolish character a real person, someone you'd really like to meet some day. By the end of the film you're cheering Smith on without reservation, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that you *believe* Stewart as Smith. From his first stuttery speech down to his final powerful filibuster, Stewart makes the role his. No person, dead or alive, could take on the role and hope to perform anywhere as well as Stewart has done. It would take some doing to keep the Washington sightseeing scenes from being oversentimental, and Capra manages to do so only when Stewart's expressive face is pictured onscreen, marvelling at these symbols of democracy and the American Way. (The flag montage goes on far too long for my taste.) Moreover, his filibuster scene alone could have won him lifetime achievement awards. Whether fired from within or aided by mercury (Stewart requested that his throat be painted with it so that it would be appropriately hoarse while filming the later hours of his marathon filibuster), it's quite a sight to behold. The fact that the Academy Award didn't go to him in this year is a travesty only slightly mitigated by his win in the same category the following year for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. This film, however, truly contains the archetypal James Stewart character--an idealistic everyman-hero who loses confidence in himself but always comes through on top in the end.If it isn't evident enough by now, the performances given in this film by the three top-billed actors is reason enough to watch it. However, MR SMITH also has a great script, fantastic production values, and a wonderful message. It may be Capra-corn, but it's Capra-corn of the first order, and will make you both smile and cry and believe that the world is a much better place than you thought it was.", "review_date": "2002-10-07", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "An inspiring tale of perseverance and righteous vindication.", "content": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\tWith the death of a senator in the opening scene, the puppet masters of the government look for a new yes man to fill the dead senator's shoes.

Jimmy makes the role lovable and he drips with a realism that would make Stanislovsky proud.  He also delivers all his lines with sincerity that envelops the audience into this heroic battle that Mr. Smith is catapulted into.

The story line starts with a medium pace, it then slows a bit in the middle so it can slip in some essential patriotism, then the end steeply climbs up to the satisfying and enthralling conclusion of the story.  To show off the fantastic writing the director (Frank Capra) uses double exposure (a cutting edge editing technique at the time) and he also includes shots of monuments in Washington, D.C. that are exalting to the spirit.  And even though Capra's directing is anything but subtle, in this case, it was appropriate for him to drive the point home. The major themes are patriotism and perseverance, which evoke emotion in anyone with a soul. \tMr. Smith Goes to Washington was and is an American classic.

'Poli,' which is Greek for 'many,' and 'tics,' which are bloodsucking insects.\" Mr Smith Goes to Washinton is such a movie that satirizes how politics work far cry from how it should really work for the benefit of people who elect those who run this system.It's the story of Jefferson Smith, the honest and right-minded leader of the Boy Rangers, who is appointed on a senatorship by the weak-kneed governor of his state when a senator dies before he completes his term of office.When he is sent to Washington he is taken under the protective care of a corrupt and miscreant senator whom he naively idolizes because he was his late father's best and oldest friend.

With practically all his pictures, he attacked corruptness and lack of freedom whether it be in politics, society or regular home-town settings.Very much like his previous Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is about an idealistic young man from a small town who travels to a big city with no notion of what he is about to get into. In both films, Jean Arthur plays the key role; the spunky news reporter/ press girl who finds herself attached to the title character in hopes of helping him make his dreams come true. Arthur is so good in this role because her dry, sardonic humor is wonderfully akin to the type of work environment she finds herself in: rough, lethal, and just plain unlikable at times. One of the keys that prevented Capra from making the same film twice was in casting James Stewart as Jefferson Smith. Stewart, one of the greatest of all American actors, is perfectly realized here; able to capture both the idyllic innocence and the fiery passion required for this role. Also well cast is Senator Joseph Paine, played here by the great Claude Raines who still remains known as Captain Renault of Casablanca, although he did many other films as well.Never before and perhaps never again has a film so thoroughly explored the way in which politics affect our everyday lives, even if we don't vote or read about action in Washington. The way Capra and his faithful writer, Sidney Buchman, establish each side of the spectrum and then lay out all the facts is quite amazing. Here is a young man thought to be a stooge; a nobody but simply able to play the patsy for the bureaucratic structure set up behind him. Unfortunately for them, his idealism and loyalty take over as he soon is poking his nose in places they don't want and asking questions they'd rather not answer. Every single step of the way we cheer for this Jefferson Smith, not necessarily because he is such a great senator but because he believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness- things I'm sure we wished we believe in.In a cynical and corrupt time, the political world needs a Jefferson Smith. However, for every Smith there are at least two James Taylors (Edward Arnold), pragmatic in every sense and ruthless. Another reason this film remains classic is that it cannot date. Its subject material will always be relevant, and for us it is a reminder that there are good people out there with a sense of honesty and humility. It is in these times we need reminded of what our government was originally created for: to help the workingman, the underprivileged, and all those people talked about in speeches but rarely dealt with.Capra knew how to deal with them and later on in his career, he and favorite actor Jimmy Stewart would go on and create another timeless masterpiece that struck notes deeper than just ideal politics or social behavior.

This goes for people used to democratic traditions as well as those who are not. Unfortunately, I find the movie naive in a way similar to Mr. Smith, as it is very narrow-minded. I got the feeling that the movie suggested there was only one way. The American way, the American dream. Now, what kind of liberty and democracy is it when there is just one possible way (not in any way criticizing the American dream, just hoping for more alternatives).

However, he did take it home the following year for his role as a reporter in The Philadelphia Story. However, that performance does not even come close to the subtleness of his performance as Mr. Smith.

A long time coming, but it was well worth the wait.The year 1939 saw some of the greatest of the classic Hollywood period: Gone with the Wind, Wuthering Heights, The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath \u0096 and of course, Mr Smith. Now, having seen this one, I have to say I like it better than the others.And that's strange for me because I don't much like fantasies \u0096 because this story is a fantasy dressed up to look like a believable story. What makes this movie for me is, apart from Capra's directorial skill, the acting: all of the main actors \u0096 James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell, Harry Carey, and H. B. Warner \u0096 give flawless performances aided by a scintillating script from Sidney Buchanan.The story, as most know, revolves around a young man, Jefferson Smith (Stewart) who's pulled from obscurity to appointment to the US Senate, after the incumbent dies in office. Smith goes to Washington, sets up his office, engages a very engaging Clarissa Saunders (Arthur) as his PA, and sets about settling in. In doing so, he unsettles much of the sitting Senate when introducing a Bill for a Boy's Camp, to be built smack dab in the middle of an area where crooked senators had been finagling land sales prior to the construction of a new dam. Damn! They think\u0085especially one Senator Paine (Rains), a real pain in the posterior for Smith as he sets about initiating a filibuster in the Senate to gain approval for the passage of his Boy's Camp Bill.Got all that? It's not so complicated, really, and it's a lot of fun watching the players as they jockey for position, to get the upper hand on the other. There's pathos as Smith staggers about, exhausted, dispirited, almost at wit's end. There's high drama, as Paine denounces Smith as a liar and charlatan. And, there's love, sweet love, as Saunders - chaste Saunders - comes back to help Smith with his filibuster.Today's audience would probably regard the story as so dated. In many ways, it is of course. There is, however, an overarching theme to this narrative that's contained in the US Constitution \u0096 and in other democracies \u0096 having something to do with government of the people, and so on...Some might even argue that it's over the top, and I suppose it is: how can you expect any new senator not to become corrupted by Washington, given the excesses of the last forty years or so? So, that's why Mr Smith is a fantasy: such a story exists only in your wildest dreams. It could never happen in real life. Could it? Well, this is 2008, and look around at what's happening...This is a film for all Capra fans. It's perhaps his best. And, I recommend it for all to see at least once.I also think it's a film that's still as relevant today as it was in 1939.

People think of Frank Capra in an idealistic fashion, but, while this film has a de rigeur happy ending, the story it tells isn't a very cheerful one. The truths that are in the film about politics are truths that are still central to us today.Senator Paine defends himself, \"I've done a thousand good things in the Senate. Our state has the lowest unemployment and the highest Federal grants. I've been a good Senator.\" It is a measure of the man and his philosophy, so central to so many pols then and now, that being a good Senator is identified with by the pork you can bring home to your district, while in the meantime you can sacrifice principles and ideals to get along. Paine compromises, as our Senators do today. When Taylor says to Smith of his congressional colleagues, \"they don't have to worry about being re-elected, they have good lives, they take my advice\", is it Jim Taylor or Jack Abramoff talking? And isn't the willingness of our current Senators to listen to K Street in preference to their constituents the exact same as Paine's willingness to do buddy buddy with Taylor? Nor are the truths this movie tells limited to the politicians alone. We talk a lot these days about media bias. Has this ever been more gracefully delineated than the scene where Saunders' press friend is dictating a piece that starts with, \"The Senate rose as a body and walked out in protest of Senator Smith\" and then, when Saunders rushes up and informs him that \"he has to fight for it\" suddenly the lead is recast, as \"A tremendous David and Goliath story, with a David unarmed even with a slingshot...\" or something close to that. Without even commenting, Capra shows us how the very choice of words used by the press conveys their own bias. Neither Fox News nor Jon Stewart had anything on Capra.Even the notion of idealism, as best represented by the boys in their attempt to get Smith's story out, has the harsh light of truth shone upon it: that force in the service of profit will always triumph over idealism. There is nothing idealistic in the image of boys being run off the road by those uncaring of what the consequences of their use of force might do.These realities may be wrapped up in candy cane wrapper, but they are there for those willing to open their eyes.Nor do I think that Capra is any dummy. The exaggerated denouement is, I think, an exercise in sarcasm, sort of a \"here, this will make the reality of your governance palatable to you, since otherwise you can't 'face the truth' ha ha .\" And by the quality of the comments, I'd say he succeeded in pulling the wool over most of the viewers' eyes.", "review_date": "2009-01-03", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Movie Review Profits", "content": "Play Mr. Smith Goes to Washington!

Mr. Smith absolutely made a fool of himself early on in the movie in several scenes. Capra could have made him na\u00efve, but he looked foolish.3.

A regular, average-joe citizen (Jimmy Stewart) finds himself an emergency appointee in the wake of a senator's death. Even though this average-joe, Jefferson Smith, is a na\u00efve country boy planted by a political machine, he still somehow fights a David and Goliath battle against dishonest businessmen and politicians.This is the state of politics America wanted to be true, then and now. It has a cynical press that first defames Smith, then later sides with him in his epic political fight. It has a well-oiled political machine that first destroys Smith, then is destroyed by him. Time and again throughout the movie, the pure idealism exuded by Smith wins over every one around him (most comically the Vice President himself) and leads him to triumph over his enemies.This idealized view of US politics came at a critical point in US history: in 1939, Hitler was well on his way to conquering Poland and the rest of Europe, sowing the seeds of World War II. Director Frank Capra's congressional refresher course served to remind Americans what separated them from their enemies and made their liberties worth protecting (a concept Capra would revisit in his \"Why We Fight\" series of propaganda films for the US government)If Smith's naivete is played up (especially in a handful of romantic scenes), it is only to further drive home the point that the US system allows for even those such as Mr. Smith to create political change \u0096 at least in the world of the movie.

S senate in hope the political parties ruling the house can manipulate their new colleague due to his kind nature and rose tinted view on the world.What follows is a fairly Hallmark like procedural filled with much talking and hypothesizing as Smith battles to clear his name from fraudulent claims while trying to do good with his new power but the chance of being non-invested or not encouraged by this smile inducing battle against good and evil is only likely to fall on those with the most stone cold of hearts, a sentiment backed by the fact Washington remains well entrenched within countless top films of all time lists.A proud citizen, Capra's love for his country and the political system that is by the people for the people is on display here, while Stewart manages to balance out Smith's na\u00efve nature in a brilliant performance that in the wrong hands could've sunk and sunk quickly as audience's failed to be captured by a figure that surely to goodness couldn't be that blind too what is going on around him.It's impossible to think of a film like Washington coming to play today, with features such as Forrest Gump or even Paddington 2 coming to mind when you try and nail down the type of tone and sentiment the film delivers but coming from a unique time and place and two minds of some of Hollywood's all time great figures ensures this effortlessly likable and fun tale will continue to be a benchmark for feel good affairs long into the future.Final Say -There are some moments that are a little too much to bare but for the most part Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wondrously enjoyable drama that will make you believe in all the good that's in the world, the perfect antidote for the time and place we all find ourselves in at present.4 hoarse voices out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)", "review_date": "2022-01-19", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Jesse Ventura is right, we need fewer professional politicians in politics.", "content": "Frank Capra has an uncanny ability to tug at our base human emotions and elicit direct responses.

There are several scenes throughout the movie that pull on your patriotic strings as you , the viewer, are reminded of what this nation is built on and for, as you connect with Mr. Smith's cause.Not to go unrecognized are Jean Arthur and Claude Rains performances, in which they were also nominated for an Academy Award. Both of these actors were incredible and so well suited for their roles. Rains' performance in the final scene of this film was memorable, as the pressure of Mr. Smith's honesty and integrity start to wear on his conscience.Directed by Frank Capra, who 7 years later directed Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, this film moves along purposefully, as the viewer experiences the ups and downs of Mr. Smith's journey . There are many critics who believe this film to be his best, nominated for an Academy Award Capra lost out to Victor Fleming and Gone With the Wind.Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a movie that pulls at all the right places and pushes at all the right times. The film is about innocence versus corruption, good versus evil, right versus wrong and having hope when facing adversity.

The idealistic young man refuses to be duped by his cynical masters, and in a heroic filibuster speaks out for youth, liberty and the American Way.    This amiable tosh is classic Frank Capra material, with a very young and (it has to be said) somewhat wooden James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, the clean-cut patriotic hero.  Jean Arthur is great as Saunders, the quick-witted factotum who falls in love with Smith during his 'liberty' speech.  \"Do you mind if I give you a rough idea of what you're up against?\" she asks the boyish senator, then pitches in on the side of David against Goliath.  Her knowledge of congressional procedure enables the filibuster to work.    Boss Jim Taylor runs his home state like a personal fiefdom.  The politicians are all in his pocket, from the ineffectual governor 'Happy' Hopper (Guy Kibbee) to Joe Paine the distinguished senator (Claude Raines). When Paine's senatorial partner dies suddenly, the governor is empowered by the constitution to nominate a replacement.  Boss Jim Taylor wants an innocent nobody who won't pry into the lucrative dam-building project that he is setting up.  Young Jefferson Smith, with his youth-leader credentials, seems the perfect fall guy.  \"Keep Smith away from anything that smacks of politics,\" orders Taylor.    Joe Paine was once an honest man.  In his youth he worked with Jeff Smith's father on a campaigning, anti-graft news sheet.  Now he is Boss Taylor's placeman, given the job of steering the Dam Scam through the Senate.  He is also told to 'supervise' the young senator with the high ideals.  When Jeff's broadsheet, \"Boy's Stuff\", is mobilised in defence of liberty, Paine is poignantly reminded of his lost integrity.  Washington has corrupted him.  No wonder that Saunders tells Jeff, \"This is no place for you - you're halfway decent!\"    Is Jeff \"the greatest hero we ever had\"?  Or is he \"the simpleton of all time\"?  Perhaps the two are not incompatible in a film which equates naivety with moral strength and sophistication with sleaze.  The newly-arrived junior senator goes into raptures at the sight of the Capitol, and wanders off in a patriotic daydream, \"lost in the wilds of Washington\".  The Lincoln Memorial is lovingly filmed and the Liberty Bell sequence is stirring, even though it teeters over into sentimentality.  Little wonder that when the newspaper man's woozy head clears, he thinks he has been punched by George Washington.  Jeff has the monolithic righteousness of the First American.    Some aspects of this celebration of American values are hard to swallow. Would a state governor, even a corrupt one, really nominate a callow know-nothing to serve in the Senate?  How come Saunders knows to turn up at the Lincoln Memorial?  The Privileges and Elections Committee investigation is dropped without being resolved, and Joe Paine's abject volte-face is simply ridiculous.  Harry Carey is great as the benign president of the Senate, but his tolerance of the young senator doesn't need to be laboured as clumsily as this.  It is demeaning (and unnecessary) to have him giggling behind his hand.    And yet this tale of \"plain, decent, everyday common rightness\" isn't all lumbering awakwardness.  The photography is actually rather stylish.  We see the grey suits of the state 'machine' making their corrupt deals in the shadows, and the talk between Jeff and Saunders inside the Lincoln Memorial is beautifully shot in almost-darkness, signifying that Jeff's morale is at its lowest ebb.  When Jeff confronts Paine on the floor of the Senate, the young man's face is given the strongest position on the screen (upper right centre) while the old charlatan's head is in the correspondingly weakest spot (lower left centre).    The purpose of the film is to reassure ordinary Americans that their institutions are not infested by graft, and that the little guy, if he is decent and sincere, can defeat the corrupt machine.  All he needs is the courage to stand up and say, \"No sir - I will not yield!\"", "review_date": "2000-02-06", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Couldn't Be Better!", "content": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an excellent movie.

Much as film writers and egotistical filmmakers like to ascribe authorship to one person, in truth cinema is by its very nature a collaborative means of expression. Hollywood, in its golden age, produced many of the greatest pictures ever, because the studios were like well-oiled machines for making the most out of collaborations. Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a great example.Let's look a bit at the history of this picture. Frank Capra, he of the \"name-above-the-title\" had had his biggest successes so far in partnership with a wonderful yet rarely remembered screenwriter called Robert Riskin. The story of Mr Smith Goes to Washington would have been right up Riskin's street, but unfortunately the writer, fed up with working in Capra's shadow, had decided to go his own way. Still Capra and Columbia wanted a picture that could be a loose sequel to Riskin's Mr Deeds Goes to Town, and would say about politics what Deeds and You Can't Take It with You (another Riskin script) said about wealth. A skilled and experienced writer by the name of Sidney Buchman was brought in to adapt a story by Lewis Foster. The result, while neither as witty or as charming as genuine Riskin, nevertheless made up for it with the devastating power of its message.Once you have your A-grade script, you must get the right cast. Nowadays typecasting is looked on as restrictive and unimaginative, but it's part of the beauty of classic era Hollywood. Look at Jimmy Stewart, with his innocent face and frame so spindly it looks like he might blow away in a strong gust of wind. And yet when he gets going he has this boyish enthusiasm that makes you believe in him all the way. Stewart had first come to public attention in the top box office hit You Can't Take It with You, and had had a number of lead roles since then. For audiences of 1939 it would have been like seeing a dear friend step into the senate, and any modern day viewer who has seen a handful of Jimmy's pictures will feel the same. That's how he works in the role, and that in turn makes the whole picture work.It's not just Stewart. Everyone appearing in this picture is perfectly cast, admittedly to type. Jean Arthur as usual plays the sharp-witted tomboy with a good heart, an ideal partner for the honest yet sheepish Stewart. The bulky, pointy-nosed Edward Arnold, in his tiny circular glasses, is the very image of the callous businessmen, and frog-voiced Eugene Palette is just right as his pompous stooge. All told, Mr Smith Goes to Washington contains a treasure trove of familiar character actors \u2013 Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Guy Kibbee\u0085 each doing business as usual, and it is the very acceptability of them as their typical personas that makes this picture feel so immediate.And what about Mr Capra? Let's not play down his contribution, even if it isn't quite worthy of having his name above the title. Capra is like the conductor of the orchestra. Not only does he coax some great performances out of his cast, but he arranges things superbly to give emphasis as and where it's needed. In many of the early shots of Stewart he is shown in long shot in large spaces, like a little boy lost in a world he doesn't understand. In the first few scenes at the senate, Capra pulls a nifty trick with perspective, framing Stewart so that the top corner of the room converges with his head. The effect makes him appear very small, like those optical illusions you can make with two equal lines that appear to be of different sizes. As Smith gains more confidence and his words more resonance, he starts to emerge from this corner. In their quiet and intimate scene at Capitol Dome, Stewart and Arthur are shown against a plain background, so all focus is upon them and nothing will distract us from their words. All these techniques look very simple, but it takes a master craftsman to know when and how to use them.Capra no doubt thought of himself as a Jefferson Smith-type character, a little man standing up and making a big splash through pluck and determination. That's why he fought to get his name above the title, and essentially marketed the \"Capra touch\". But Hollywood is not congress, and even Jefferson Smith couldn't have done it without Saunders. No, this delightful and nearly perfect picture is the work of a wonderful, Tinseltown team.", "review_date": "2009-11-04", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Tropic of Capra-corn", "content": "After reading Director Frank Capra's bio, I was left breathless.

Jimmy Stewart plays a naive, yet gentle-hearted and popular icon named Jefferson Smith who realizes that the political office can be effective and reverent if it operates solely for the people, rather than \"grash\" or entrenched special interests. Selected by Virginia political bigshot Jim Taylor (who influences every affair in state, from the political landscape to the savage press, and in turn Gov. Hubert Hopper) to succeed a perished senator, Mr. Smith goes to Washington oblivious as to the sordid and ruthless operation of Congress, and merely remarks how he is stupefied by the glory of the Capitol Building, enthralled by a visit to the Lincoln Monument, greatly reveres his colleague, Senator Joseph Paine, and wants to perform only the best for the citizens of his state. An exceedingly nervous and modest fellow (perhaps not entirely apt for brutal Senate speech and debate), when he meets Senator Paine's gorgeous daughter, he fondles with his hat and occasionally drops it to the ground, which gives the viewer the distinct idea that if he hasn't the backbone to regularly converse with an attractive woman, then how can he possibly survive the trials and hardships of the United States Senate. His secretary, Clarissa Saunders, initially doesn't believe in his \"superficial modesty\", yet is later captivated by his poetic innocence and honesty and assists him in creating propositions and offering advice, while secretly falling head over heels for him. During his first day in Congress, Smith trembles relentlessly in presenting his case for the construction of a National Boy's Camp, and is scoffed and humiliated by 96 members of the Senate. It turns out that his noble aspirations may be in peril, when it is revealed that a dam will be constructed in the appropriated place of his idea. Thus ensues a heartwarming, hilarious, and incendiary confrontation between the innocuous, noble Mr. Smith and the rest of the corrupted U.S. Senate, including the notorious and sordid Jim Taylor, in a captivating look at how democracy and goodness prevails when honest, tenacious men stand their ground, stand up for their beliefs, and act impervious to any derision of their enterprise. It may be at times overly condescending, sentimental and somewhat politically pretentious and fantastic, but \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" contains a noble statement about democracy and teaches us that it is \"the lost causes that are worth fighting for\". In Jefferson Smith, we see a hero, standing courageously, against all odds, for the honor and good will of representation.

However, Hopper's sons convince him to consider appointing Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), a statewide scout leader, to the post.

Jean Arthur as his secretary, Claude Rains as the senior Senator and James Stewart all give heartfelt, passionate acting performances. When Mr. Smith first comes to Washington, he has a childlike excitement, enthusiasm and idealism about him, that sets him apart from all the other established Senators.

I was impressed with the authenticity and passion of the film.Director Frank Capra had a nickname in Hollywood at the time: \"Capra Corn\".

When released, it created a stir within Washington insiders and around the globe. The movie appeals to the tendencies of Capra as a director using themes such as idealism and hope. But if one looks closely, you can see ideas of pessimism start creeping in the mind of Capra. Regardless, Capra created a film that resonates with all ages and generations. With the idea of the filibuster being in the news lately, the relevance of Capra's picture is still prevalent with Americans in today's day and age. As a film itself, the movie does a great job switching gears from comedy to tense drama. The performances, especially from the great Jimmy Stewart, are all fantastic. I also really loved the ending!Before the film was even in production, Sidney Buchman's screenplay already had Hollywood in a frenzy. Joseph Breen, the head of the Hays Code office, warned studios how explosive the project is and told them it could be an attack on the democratic process, so he suggested some changes. Boy, was he ever right that it would be explosive. The film had a screening in Washington and rumors had it that senators walked out. Regardless, they did not like how they were depicted as corrupt and were heavily involved in breaking up studio theatre chains in the 1940's. The film was banned in Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy because it showed, in their eyes, how democracy is a legitimate form of government that works. Nowadays, many film, history, and political science classes use this movie to compliment the lessons. Despite the film driving politicians crazy, it became a major hit with critics and audiences.As a film itself, it mostly works for me. I thought the film got off to a bit of a slow start but once the plot moves forward, so does the film. Originally, Capra designed his feature as a sequel to his hit Mr. Deeds Goes to Town but thought better of it. Once James Stewart, the everyday idealistic actor that every American loved joined the project, Capra decided to make it a standalone picture.Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed the empty senator vacancy spot after the passing of one of the senators. He is an idealistic, na\u00efve young man who heads The Boy Rangers. Jefferson is eager to use this position to pass a bill involving the Rangers. On the other side of the spectrum, Jefferson is most likely elected due to his lack of political experience and that he could be taken advantage of by other higher-ranking senators. He reunites with the state's lead Senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) who is well-respected...and corrupt. He is under the influence of powerful businessman, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold). Once Jefferson arrives in the nation's capital, it becomes clear that he will be used for a dam bill...that will be in conflict with Paine's bill. Originally seen as a pushover, including from his cynic secretary Saunders (Jean Arthur), will Jefferson have the strength to stand up to these powerful men who could easily destroy his political career if they wanted?Throughout, the performances were excellent. James Stewart has enough of that idealistic charisma to make me believe in his cause. His final scenes are very, very powerful. He also exhibited great chemistry with Jean Arthur. Her character is a cynic at first because she knows how Washington works, but once she understands Jefferson's attitude and ambitions, she starts to believe again. The supporting cast, especially Claude Rains, deliver the goods. Rains really made Paine a nasty piece of work. Like with most of his films, Capra makes clear who the good guys and the bad guys are in his movies-no exception here. For the first time, Capra gives his characters hints of pessimism, but he does not truly leave the idea of hope and being able to believe in one's self too far way.Overall, there is no denying that Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a classic. As a film, it is funny, heartfelt, dramatic, and memorable. It has themes that resonate with all ages and professions. The direction, performances, and script are about as perfect as they can be. The pacing is somewhat slow to begin, but when I was hooked, I was hooked! In terms of the impact it had around the world, the film created domestic and international impacts which is described in above review. 1939 was a gigantic year in film. The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind are flashier pictures, but do not forget about Capra's tour-de-force in a career where he made many of those.

It's the type of performance which makes an actor a star and, sure enough, after making this film Stewart was on his way to becoming an American acting icon. But while Stewart's performance is an undeniable timeless classic there is the nagging sense that the film as a whole isn't quite on par with the performance of its leading man. It's a good film but perhaps it falls just a touch short of excellence.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is another of those uplifting, inspiring stories which director Frank Capra seemed to specialize in. In this case the story revolves around a simple man, Jefferson Smith, thrust into a situation which is anything but simple. Smith's a good, honest, sincere fellow. A typical Capra hero. He is the head of a youth group, the Boy Rangers, and has a real passion for improving the lives of children. And he will take that passion to Washington when, completely out of the blue, he is appointed to the United States Senate to replace a deceased senator. It becomes apparent very quickly that this naive young man, armed only with the best of intentions, is in over his head. But that's part of what makes the character of Jefferson Smith so appealing. His home state's corrupt political machine figures his inexperience will make him easy to control. Boy are they ever in for a surprise.As we watch Jefferson Smith make his way in the seamy world of Washington politics it's very easy to embrace the character. But it is at times somewhat less easy to embrace the film. Everyone remembers the famous final scene. It's powerful and inspiring and brilliantly done. In that scene we get to see both a character, Jefferson Smith, and an actor, James Stewart, really come into their own. It's magnificent. But much of what precedes that scene comes across as rather mundane. The story proceeds at a leisurely pace, at times much too leisurely. Too often there just is not much going on to move the story forward. Stewart is terrific and his two main co-stars, Jean Arthur as Smith's initially jaded assistant and Claude Rains as the less than honest senior senator from Smith's state, are very good as well. So the performances aren't the problem. It's the story, which turns out to be a little too simple to really sustain itself for over two hours. And if the story had a little better pace to it perhaps the film wouldn't have in the end been in such a hurry to finish which, after Stewart's big scene, leaves us with an ending which is jarringly abrupt. Losing some scenes in the middle of the film to leave some more time to better wrap things up at the end would have been a good trade-off. But for whatever little disappointments there may be this still is a very good film, one which features one of Hollywood's most classic performances. James Stewart alone would be enough to make this film worth watching.

Jeff Smith was chosen to be (although he balked) a surefire yes-man, and his senior counterpart was a corrupt tool of the corporate controlled political machine of Taylor.Today George W.

Portrayed beautifully by Jimmy Stewart, Smith embodies the virtues of the just and fair American man who, when called upon to do the right thing, will take a stand in an effort to revive the tenets of the documents we hold dear. Sadly, the brilliance of Frank Capra's film is that it demonstrates that men like Smith are a highly idealized vision of what an elected official (in this case an appointed official) can be. Thus, with the character of Smith, Capra and Stewart attempt to show that despite the special interests and power lobbying in Washington, that there could be men or women like him who simply want to make the best America they can--yet more likely, men like Smith don't exist or perhaps simply cannot exist.While Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is an inspiring film, it is serious about its message that it would really take more than one man with a false hope to change the nature of politics.

Jimmy Stewart plays a naive, yet charitably-hearted and popular icon named Jefferson Smith who realizes that the political office can be effective and reverent if it operates solely for the people, rather than \"grash\" or garish, entrenched special interests. Selected by Virginia political bigshot Jim Taylor, who influences every affair in the state, from the political landscape to the savage press, and in turn Governor Hubert Hopper as well, to succeed a perished senator, Mr. Smith goes to Washington oblivious of the sordid and ruthless nature of American politics, and is merely stupefied by the majesty of the Capitol Building, enthralled by a visit to the Lincolm Monument, greatly reveres his colleague, Senator Joseph Paine, and wants to serve only with the best intentions for the citizens of his state. An exceedingly nervous and modest fellow (hardly the candidate of a record filibuster), when Smith meets Senator Paine's gorgeous daughter, he fumbles with his hat and clumsily drops it to the ground, which gives the viewer the concern that if he hasn't the backbone to regularly converse with an attractive woman, then how can he possibly survive the trials and hardships of the United States Senate? His secretary, Clarissa Saunders, initially dismisses Smith's \"superficial morality\", yet is eventually captivated by his poetic innocence and honesty and assists him in creating propositions and offering advice, while secretly falling head over heels for him. During his first day in Congress, Smith trembles relentlessly in presenting his case for the construction of a National Boy's Camp, and is scoffed, sneered, and humiliated by 96 members of the Senate. It turns out that his noble aspirations may be in peril, when it is revealed that a dam will be constructed in the proposed spot of his camp, of all terrible ironies. Thus ensues a heartwarming, hilarious, and incendiary confrontation between the innocuous, noble Mr. Smith and the rest of the tainted Senate, as well as the imposing \"big shot\" Jim Taylor, in a captivating look at how democracy and goodness should prevail when honest, tenacious men like Jefferson Smith hold their ground, stand up for their beliefs, and act impervious to any derision of their enterprise. It lacks a satisfiable and comprehensive resolution, and it may be at times overly condescending, sugarcoated and sentimental, and somewhat politically pretentious and fantastic, yet \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" is profound, eliciting a noble statement about democracy and teaching us that it is \"the lost causes that are worth fighting for\".

This movie was sweet but a little hard to get excited about; the small, very small, love story is really what kept this reviewer's interest and to say that the plot was riveting, well, would be a bit too much, in all honesty. \t         As stated before Jimmy Stewart  (Jefferson Smith) did what he does best, and that's look handsome, play the part of a confused, yet loveable man and fall in love with the right woman.  Having watched two other films that Stewart has starred in, this character is definitely the most straightforward and easiest to read, not exactly a round character.  This is his early work and really what the story need though, so in this case it's completely acceptable.  His love interest is a very pretty woman (Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur) who most ladies can sympathize with because of the fact that Mr. Smith takes a little while to notice her in the way that she comes to notice him.  The love story is truly a breath of fresh air compared to most today; there are no sex scenes or any inclination of any hanky-panky and that receives a huge applause from this reviewer where it seems that in every movie and every television show that people are `shacking it up' all the time. \t         Besides the love story, the situation at hand is that a senator has suddenly passed away while a very important bill is at a critical point in the senate.  The replacement needs to be a `yes-man', and naively the replacement is chosen to be Mr. Smith.  Which at first seems to be the right one because he is in awe about EVERYTHING that goes on, even the young boys who help in the meetings know more than Mr. Smith does.  Well eventually Mr. Smith gets his bearings with the help of his secretary and he soon discovers a scandal occurring involving his idol and father's best friend and this truly upsets the uncorrupted American patriot that is Mr. Smith and he soon tries all that he can to fix what's going on.  The conclusion unfortunately is so abrupt and after all the time and energy invested in the scenes leading up to it, creates a bit of disappointment to the viewer.  While the viewer really wants to applaud the attempts of Mr. Smith it's a bit of a cheesy ending and a bit unbelievable. \t         However, this really opened the eyes of this reviewer to the means necessary to pass a bill, and how it's not just cut and dry, there has to be a lot of persuasion, not just `this is a good bill because' but more like `if you vote for this bill I'll do you a favor\u0085'.  This concept is really sad because it makes one wonder if that's what the founding fathers wanted congress to look like, if that's how things needed to be accomplished. Knowing that the good guys have honesty and scruples and that they wouldn't do things that way can lead to be really upsetting because they would be the ones to try to pass bills to help the good of the cause. \t         In essence this movie was decent, a `must-see'?; probably not, unless congress and politics really get your engine revving or if you're a big Jimmy Stewart fan.

Jean Arthur is engaging as always and Stewart is, of course, right in his element.  The only real problem is the awkward introduction of Smith.

At the time I felt that it was an inferior version of Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, which I had seen years earlier and loved. I felt, that far from naive, Mr. Smith was hysterical, self-righteous, megalomaniacal, manipulative, humorless, and downright fascist with his intransigent zealot's zeal for cleaning up government corruption and his private army of \"boys\". The casting is certainly typical Hollywood: the good are extremely handsome, the evil are extremely homely, and guess who always wins. Poor Eugene Pallette elicits sympathy just because of his ungainly appearance, and his incessantly demeaning casting as a goon. I still have some of those misgivings after seeing the film recently, but this is a very well-made one, particularly, the cinematography. It is absolutely amazing that Hollywood should have gotten so good, so early, and that such an art should have been lost so long ago. No camera work in the last forty years remotely compares. It is not just the black and white, it is the shades of gray, the contrast, the lighting, pacing, angles, composition, a very sophisticated art. The scene where Smith weeps at the Lincoln Memorial is very moving. I think it would have been more moving if the lady hadn't appeared to console him. But why highlight Lincoln, why not Washington? Indeed, isn't it astonishing, that no movie has ever been made about Washington? (I am not saying it should be made, just wondering why not). Harvey is still my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie. Far more humor in that one. As a movie, on a similar subject, I thought \"Storm Center\" (1956) more satisfying than Mr. Smith: \"dumpy\" woman hero, small town, low key, bolder message. In real life I only saw Jimmy Stewart as a dog-lover. He appeared on TV with his dog on Dinah Shore's pet show. The last time I saw him was on Johnny Carson, reading a poem he wrote about his late dog, and choking up. I felt so sorry for him. A rather inscrutable man, who flew missions not only over Germany, but also over Vietnam. I think his son died in that war.

It stars James Stewart as Jefferson Smith, Jean Arthurs as Clarissa Sanders, and Claude Rains as Sen. Paine. `Mr. Smith goes to Washington,' was a movie purely made for its time, and also was made for the American people. Being that is was a Frank Capra movie, with its heartfelt characters, `let's root for the underdog,' appeal, it truly grabs you and puts you on an emotional roller coaster. The film itself has been so jam packed with political propaganda and `let's all live for the American dream,' sometimes it can feel as if you are being brainwashed. Frank Capra was a man of genius knowing that what Americans like seeing is the underdog going in, being beaten to a pulp, and coming back from absolutely no where and winning his victory. And that is exactly what Mr. Smith is based on. So much so, even though Mr. Smith himself has stood his ground in the lion's den and fought back with all most not gaining anything, you can still tell the outcome, and when it does come you are still relieved, happy, and content with the way the movie ends. That is the mark of a well-made movie. Frank Capra really brings out the sympathy and compassion in people with this film, making people yearn for the political leaders to make the right and just decisions, giving them a sense that, if no one will stand up for justice, `I WILL!' James Stewart does a fantastic job of portraying this ordinary, wholesome man, with a Big American dream, peering up at the Lincoln memorial as if Abe himself were God.

'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a movie about good old-fashioned patriotism and the lack there-of in today's society. This movie was sweet but a little hard to get excited about; the small, very small, love story is really what kept this reviewer's interest and to say that the plot was riveting, well, would be a bit too much, in all honesty. As stated before Jimmy Stewart (Jefferson Smith) did what he does best, and that's look handsome, play the part of a confused, yet lovable man and fall in love with the right woman. Having watched two other films that Stewart has starred in, this character is definitely the most straightforward and easiest to read, not exactly a round character. This is his early work and really what the story need though, so in this case it's completely acceptable. His love interest is a very pretty woman (Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur) who most ladies can sympathize with because of the fact that Mr. Smith takes a little while to notice her in the way that she comes to notice him. The love story is truly a breath of fresh air compared to most today; there are no sex scenes or any inclination of any hanky-panky and that receives a huge applause from this reviewer where it seems that in every movie and every television show that people are 'shacking it up' all the time. Besides the love story, the situation at hand is that a senator has suddenly passed away while a very important bill is at a critical point in the senate. The replacement needs to be a 'yes-man', and naively the replacement is chosen to be Mr. Smith. Which at first seems to be the right one because he is in awe about EVERYTHING that goes on, even the young boys who help in the meetings know more than Mr. Smith does. Well eventually Mr. Smith gets his bearings with the help of his secretary and he soon discovers a scandal occurring involving his idol and father's best friend and this truly upsets the uncorrupted American patriot that is Mr. Smith and he soon tries all that he can to fix what's going on. The conclusion unfortunately is so abrupt and after all the time and energy invested in the scenes leading up to it, creates a bit of disappointment to the viewer. While the viewer really wants to applaud the attempts of Mr. Smith it's a bit of a cheesy ending and a bit unbelievable. However, this really opened the eyes of this reviewer to the means necessary to pass a bill, and how it's not just cut and dry, there has to be a lot of persuasion, not just 'this is a good bill because' but more like 'if you vote for this bill I'll do you a favor\u0085'. This concept is really sad because it makes one wonder if that's what the founding fathers wanted congress to look like, if that's how things needed to be accomplished. Knowing that the good guys have honesty and scruples and that they wouldn't do things that way can lead to be really upsetting because they would be the ones to try to pass bills to help the good of the cause. In essence this movie was decent, a 'must-see'?; probably not, unless congress and politics really get your engine revving or if you're a big Jimmy Stewart fan. The plot is a bit basic and the ending predictable but it's a cute flick.

It so happens that Paine and party boss/newspaper tycoon Jim Taylor (neatly played by the sinister Edward Arnold) are involved in a crooked irrigation plot that just happens to be where Smith wishes to establish his camp. Smith is dumbfounded to learn that he has been framed and that all kinds of opposition, including newspaper stories, billboard posters, radio announcements, telegrams, etc. Are all in favor of his being expelled, and yet he did nothing wrong; everything was doctored up by Taylor and his assorted heavies. Smith is so disheartened that he intends to leave Washington, but it is this chain of events that brings out the better qualities of Smith's feisty secretary Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), who encourages him to stay and fight back. He does, and his nearly twenty-four-hour filibuster is filled with memorable quotes and light touches of humor. To me, Jefferson Smith is a true hero because he is an ordinary man faced with overwhelming loads of corrupt opposition, and yet he decides to stick to his guns and fight.

The beliefs and biases of the film maker, Frank Capra, are clearly shown. We can agree or disagree with what we see and therefore the audience was shown far more respect than what we get from films today. In today's films heavily effected by political correctness most filmmakers will go out of their way to blur the lines, grey out the divisions and seemingly anticipate every possible criticism so that you never know what the movie is really trying to say. I think this is partly a result of the McCarthyist witch hunts in the 1950s which did a lot to silence any kind of honest political culture in American film.The result of this more honest kind of black and white (yes both meanings are intended) film making is that we can really laugh, perhaps maliciously, perhaps sentimentally at Mr. Smith's struggles. I doubt anyone living in the era of Obama Barrack really believes that politicians like Mr. Smith even exist. If Obama isn't Mr. Smith, then who is?

Certainly this was an understandable and in some respects not exactly unreasonable response from the members of the \"world's greatest deliberative body\", also known as the United States Senate.  Capra had been pretty hard on them and their bosses back home, and they felt that they were neither as corrupt as Claude Rains' character nor as gullible (at least initially) as Jimmy Stewart's.  But the senators' objections collapse against Capra's grasp of essential truths: politics is a rough business where an idealist has little or no place and where only the strong survive.  The question Capra poses is where can an idealist find the strength to endure.\nThe Hill credo, articulated by Sam Rayburn, long time Speaker of the House (and personally incorruptible), was \"to get along, go along.\"  Jefferson Smith (Stewart) decides not to go along and soon is fighting for his political life.  Smith's final victory is only what audiences would expect, then or now.  But the real high point of the film, and of Stewart's magnificent performance, is the filibuster sequence,  Smith's fight rather than his triumph.  As the tension builds and the odds mount against him, he proceeds undaunted.  Miraculously, there is not a touch of self-righteousness in Smith, only earnestness born of the deepest conviction in the true greatness and promise of America.  All of this in unbelievably moving, probably the most moving sequence in all of Capra's work.  Here, in a faithless arena, stands a man whose faith is strong and unfailing; it must be because it's all Smith has.  The miracle is that it's enough to see him through to the end, but the true beauty of the film is to see Smith live his faith and achieve his political survival by holding to his ideals, rather than by renouncing them.This leads to a question:  was Jimmy Stewart really acting?   He was, but surely Stewart believed everything Jefferson Smith said in his heroic filibuster.  He was giving more than a performance, he was living his ideals on film.   A few years later the actor was flying a B-24 over Germany and fighting for the beliefs of  Jefferson Smith in the real world.

When this was made in 1939, Hollywood was at its apex, churning out such films as Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind.  This was the final film between Frank Capra and Columbia Pictures.  This was also the film that gave Jimmy Stewart his first Academy Award Nomination.  It is worth noting as you watch this film that when it was made, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was safely ensconced in the White House just a year away from finishing up his second term and running for an unprecedented third term (which he would win and lead America through World War II).  I think the optimism that was beginning to shine through in the waning years of the Great Depression and in the pre-War era can definitely be seen throughout this film.Perhaps the film's greatest moment is towards the very end when Mr. Smith filibusters on the floor of the senate.  This is gripping drama if there ever was any.  Claude Rains gives a stunning performance as the token but vindictive Senator that attempts to destroy Mr. Smith's political goals and aspirations.This film is good tonic for anyone who has doubts about the truth in government and what a meritorious service it is to serve one's country at the highest levels.

Perhaps, but director Frank Capra takes an Oscar winning story by Lewis Foster, combines it with James Stewart's virtuous portrayal of innocent every man Jefferson Smith, and makes audiences once again believe that \"lost causes\" really are \"the causes worth fighting for.\"Yet in the cloakrooms of Washington this positive message was not embraced. The controversy surfaced in the October 5, 1939 edition of Variety featuring the front-page headline, \"Capra's 'Mr. Smith' Goes to Washington and Solons, Seemingly, Can't Take It.\"\"Infamous,\" \"treasonable,\" \"disgusting,\" and \"outrageous,\" were only a few of the sizzling adjectives used by lawmakers to describe the film.The uproar, according to Variety, stemmed from the \"too close to the average lawmaker\" depiction of 'Senator Paine,' a character who mentors freshman Senator Jefferson Smith only to turn on him. It was also reported that the film's virtue-will-triumph approach had no impact on irate congressmen who insisted that the picture reflected poorly on the dignity and integrity of the Senate.Incidentally, this added publicity, along with the film's strong reviews and word of mouth, resulted in bullish box office.

Foster's original screen story, \"the Gentleman from Montana.\"  The studio's ace director Frank Capra, read a one page synopsis and passed on the project.  Columbia then sent the story to Rouben Mamoulian, who agreed to make the film.  Upon hearing this, Capra reread the synopsis, changed his mind, and offered Mamoulian Golden Boy for the property.On August 10, 1938, Columbia announced the project as Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington with Gary Cooper reprising his Longfellow Deeds character. Months later, Samuel Goldwyn, with whom Cooper had an exclusive contract, decided not to loan out the actor to Columbia.  Capra recast the film with his star of You Can't Take It With You, James Stewart.The film was renamed Mr. Smith Goes to Washington on January 26, 1939. Production began on April 3.  While some location work was done in Washington, the majority of the film was done at Columbia's Gower Street studio.  The major set piece was an exact replica of the Senate Floor, built by art director Lionel Banks at a cost of $100,000.  It was here, over the course of four weeks, that Stewart performed the climactic filibuster scene. To give his voice the proper hoarseness, Stewart had his throat painted repeatedly with a mercury solution.  Production was completed on July 7, 1939.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington had its world premiere in the nation's capital on October 19, 1939.  Every senator and representative was invited to the screening, as well as the Washington Press Club.  Depicted as drunks and theives, they denounced the film as un-American.  More controversial was the offer by several sister studios to buy the negative and destroy it, fearful that the Axis powers would use the film for propaganda reasons.  Studio president Harry Cohn refused and proceeded to distribute the film across the country.Although critics and audiences loved Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, it was an extremely expensive film to make ($1.5 million), and only broke even on its intial run.   But Harry Cohn didn't make the film for profit, he made it for prestige.  And that's what Capra gave him. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington recieved eleven Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains, Harry Carey), Best Music, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, and Best Screenplay (original story) --- winning in the latter category.  A timeless populist masterpiece, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is, was and always will be \"one of the best shows of the year.\"Mr rating: 4 stars", "review_date": "2003-05-10", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "One More Take: Mr Smith Goes to Washington", "content": "Who doesn't love Jimmy Stewart? A lanky bumbler who defeats bad guys with the power of morals, he is oddly magnetic and eminently personable in virtually every picture he stars in. My mother, in this vein, calls him the \"Old Hollywood version of Tom Hanks.\" While Stewart had enjoyed a string of roles leading up to this, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is, in retrospect, one of the great standouts of the actor's early era, next to It's a Wonderful Life.Similar to that film, and as a bolstering of my little lead-in, the movie at its core is about a good person winning out, after much tribulation, against forces that seek to oppress and ruin him. This is framed here in a narrative that concerns a young, innocent senator with high-minded classical American ideals (cut to Stewart staring at awe at the pensive, austere statue of Abe Lincoln) doing battle against the forces of government corruption.The film, at the outset, is fully steeped in Stewart's own naivete, so that you could be forgiven for thinking the entire picture might continue rapt in its somewhat corny, apple-pie tonality, but it does not. Instead, and appreciably, it leaves the baseball game running on the TV upstairs, goes down to the cellar, and pokes around in the corners. Which is to say, the idealized vision of America that define both Stewart and the film take a drastic nosedive when within the heart of the cherished governmental system, with all its grandiloquent language of freedom and unimpeachable morality, a seemingly unbeatable cancer is found to lurk. The film thus follows the well-known hero's journey path, resulting, of course, in victory for the little guy, as Smith mounts a heroic filibuster against the forces of greed and corruption.Granted, this is Hollywood. We've had 80 years of evidence since Smith went to Washington in support of the fact that the vast majority of the time, the hyenas and greedheads of the world come out on top, pockets lined with blood money that seems to lose them no sleep. Some might consider this a mark against the film, marking it as an idealization incongruous with reality. I would posit otherwise, however. The fact that things like this do not often happen, but could, even if that window feels more and more diminished as America continues its swan dive into inequality and general horror, is an important gesture towards the concept of holding strong to ideals even as the jaws snap down.But let's back up, before I journey too far into this little minefield. After all, it is not through starry eyes of idealism that I like this movie, but because it's a damn good movie, and what we like about films like this IS the fact that the good guy wins out over, as Hunter Thompson might say, \"the forces of old and evil,\" regardless of realism. To reiterate, it's Hollywood. If you want hardcore fatalism, there are plenty of other movies that will fit the bill, but a feel-good Capital Hill romp with spastic, geeky, affable everyman Jimmy Stewart is not where you want to look. This is not Fight Club (although you should definitely see Fight Club).FINAL TAKE: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is simultaneously a bolstering of the American ideal, and an indictment of those that would take advantage of it. However you view said ideal, however, whether it lives in your heart or you call \"Fraud!\" on the whole damn architecture from the get-go (I tend to fall into the latter category, in all honesty), these things are essentially a backgrounding for a well-done, gripping, and often very funny story of a man who refuses to sacrifice ideals. The filmmaking is superb, the central and supporting cast are just fantastic (special mention to the great Jean Arthur as Stewart's cagey, disillusioned secretary), and it draws your attention from the first frame to the closing credits, leaving you with the gratified sense of a victory well-earned. It may not be the sort of victory we get to enjoy very often in reality, but hey, that's why we have movies, and one of the reasons we love them. In a way, it makes such a sensation even more special. Life is often bleak, ponderous, and wholly cruel, where the payoffs are thin, if they exist at all. A movie needn't submit to this reality, but can give us something different, and, should it choose to do so, something better. And if Jimmy Stewart is stammering and fumbling with his hat?

And Frank Capra's classic Mr. Smith Goes To Washington does the trick!With the country in a deep depression and patriotism at an all time low, the American people needed a boost and this film gave it to them. With its simple plot and strong sense of patriotism, Frank Capra's film helped rebuild the American people's morale and restored their sense of patriotism, by strategically using one of the era's most popular American icons, Jimmy Stewart. His 'boy next door' charisma helped sell the overly patriotic character of Jefferson Smith to the audience. His acting, characterization and delivery was moving and sincere. Capra created a powerful and inspiring story of an all-American boy, tested and criticized by the 'Political Machine', standing up and fighting for the unalienable rights of all human beings. The character of Jeff Smith represented more than the underdog in this film. He represented the average American who was down, but not out for the count. In the film, his character fought hard and was knocked down many times, but with the odds against him and the bid dogs laughing at his face, he rose and stood up to the occasion. He fought 'The Man', and 'The Man' went down. Jeff Smith gave more than entertainment; he gave light at the end of every American's dark tunnel. With his focus on the cruelty and manipulation Jeff Smith faced in the film, Capra provoked the audience to feel angry towards the crooked politicians and sympathetic towards Smith. This brilliant use of propaganda-like technique evokes the patriotism deep inside of the individuals watching until the film's climactic ending where it leaves them sweating red, white and blue. However, many of the characters were one-dimensional as if the actors playing them were just 'acting out' their part. They weren't as intense as Jimmy, of course a lot of them played the straight man or woman, but at least give the people some variety! Their gumby-like facial expressions were a bore and much of the film seemed exaggerated and unrealistic, referring to the scene where Smith goes on a punching rampage, punching every press guy in site! PLLLEEEEASE!!! You can't do that, there's a thing called assault & battery but who cares it's Jimmy Stewart. That guy can do whatever he wants. Punching rampage or not, this movie is great for all the Jimmy Stewart fans out there. It's not his best work, but does outshine the rest of the characters in the movie.

Thankfully I can say that the effort has lived up to its reputation that it has built for the past 60+ years.When speaking of politics in film most things tend to turn towards the political climate of stories and not the political systems/structures themselves. They depict what gets produced and how it affects the individuals but not the workings and conflicts along the way. To toss a man into a twisted game and show his utterly honest attempt at survival was a bit of a fun concept to see unfold. Although I was a bit dissatisfied with how the good versus evil was played out (look no further then the scene where the older politicians prevent newspaper distribution by an absolute cruelty to minors) it is carried out realistically which is what counts. It also should go without mentioning that the entire Filibuster performance is inspiring in the way it was composed.To think that Jefferson Smith's have been crushed by the weight of the U.S. government since this release is a bit saddening. It is interesting to note that this film was labeled as pro-communist upon its release for depicting such a realistic corruption. But despite the trials and tribulations these well spirited people must face as stated by Smith, \"Somebody'll listen to me.\" We have Jeff. We have.", "review_date": "2006-10-17", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"review_title": "Why not call their bluff?", "content": "This is a great movie, inasmuch as its use of the film medium. The script is pretty decent, the cinematography is superb, and the acting is excellent.But there's one plot point that I don't get: why couldn't Smith just call Taylor/Paine's bluff? The frame is that he owns the land, and this is supposedly proved to the Senate committee. Okay, then why doesn't Smith just propose the following, if he indeed owns the land in question: after his inevitable expulsion from the Senate, he will donate the land to the Boy Rangers? After all, according to the accusations, he didn't even pay for it. And if Smith now owns the land, instead of Taylor and his cronies, wouldn't that ruin Taylor's bid to make money by selling that land to the government? It just seems the frame is great for ruining Smith's name, but ruins Taylor's scheme in the process.Anyway, this movie is very relevant for today's America. It should give you a clue as to how real-life politics work (except without the last-minute deus ex machina to save the good guy). By all means, watch this classic film.", "review_date": "2009-11-17", "lang": "en", "source": "imdb"}, {"content": "1939 was one of those insane years for film. A decade plus after The Jazz Singer ushered in talkies, Hollywood found itself in the midst of a Golden Age. It was the tail end of the Great Depression, and World War II was on the horizon. At 23 cents a ticket, the cinema was an escapist treat that the average man could enjoy. \n\n1939 produced at least four of the greatest films ever made. Frank Capra made one of them. John Ford made another. And Victor Fleming made two. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was the 18th talking picture directed by Frank Capra. It's a David and Goliath story set in the world of politics. The Washington DC setting makes the film timeless. The Capital building, Lincoln Memorial, and Senate floor stand today just as they stood in the 1930s.\n\nPolitics has always been entertaining. It's the art of rhetoric that Plato wrote about. Rhetoric is when a speaker tries to inform, persuade, or motivate members of an audience. Mr. Smith has a lot of talking and James Stewart is a force of acting nature in the third act. This is the role that made Jimmy a star and there's a good reason for it.\n\nAs much as I love Capra and Stewart, the main reason that Mr. Smith succeeds is because of Sidney Buchman's screenplay. This is the era of screwball comedy and the film often plays like one. There are stirring speeches, detailed exposition, and amazing dialogue. Jean Arthur gets the best lines as Clarissa Saunders. She's smart, witty, and complicated. She has to help Jefferson Smith and show him the ropes even though it feels like babysitting. \"Look, Senator, I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is.\" \n\nShe's a great female architype. Now Buchman wasn't the only writer. Lewis Foster wrote the story for Mr. Smith and even won an Academy Award for Best Original Story. The story here is somewhat complicated. While proposing a bill to buy land for a national boy's camp, Jeff Smith stumbles upon a corrupt arrangement between Senator Paine and political boss James Taylor (not the singer).\n\nPaine wants government money to build a dam in Willet Creek. Paine tips off Taylor who then buys the land in advanced so he can charge the government an exorbitant price for the property. This is a graft scheme. It's unclear to me if Paine's bill is a straight forward appropriation bill or if Paine is hiding the dam fund in a laundry list of other expenditures. I think it's the latter. The problem isn't whether or not the dam is a good idea. Montana is big enough for a dam and a boy's camp. But when Paine opposes the camp it looks suspicious. \n\nPaine doesn't know how to oppose the bill without revealing his deal with Taylor. Paine and Taylor bribe Smith with any job he wants but Smith refuses. The duo then accuses Smith of already owning the Willet Creek land and thus trying to profit off it. They forge Smith's signature on some documents. This is the only part of the movie that's a stretch. Who did Smith allegedly buy the land from? If Smith does own the 500- acre land can't he just donate it to the boy's camp? \n\nSmith, however, is too distraught by Paine's corruption to ask these questions. Perhaps Paine and Taylor knew that Smith would be too inexperienced to prove them wrong. The Senate meets to discuss Paine's bill and Smith knows that this is his last chance to speak because the next item of discussion will be Smith's termination. Smith decides to filibuster for 24 hours with the hope that Paine will confess to the dam scheme. Now Smith and Taylor are from the same part of Montana. \n\nTaylor, who is well connected and owns all of the newspapers, has ordered the press to report negatively about Smith and never mention the Willet Creek dam. Saunders tries to counter this by getting the Boy Rangers paper to print the truth about Smith but ultimately, they are threatened into silence by Taylor's minions. I apologize for the plot summary but the complexity of the story is a big reason the movie holds up so well. \n\nPaine and Smith's father used to be good friends. Smith admires Paine and looks up to him. Paine tries to use his influence over Smith to persuade his voting. When this doesn't work, Paine betrays him. I guess he's living up to his name. It doesn't take long for the press to see the governor's hiring of Smith for what it is. \"You're not a Senator. You're an honorary stooge,\" proclaims one reporter. The press is right. They know that Smith was hired to be a \"Christmas Tiger\" that nods his head yes and no. \n\nThe shade throwing is relentless. Smith has to earn his seat at the table. This film is about the hero's journey from boy to man. It's a tried and true formula that hits all the major plot points: the rise, the fall, the all-is-lost moment, the return, and the victory. Paine says to Smith, \"You've been living in a boy's world Jeff and for heaven's sake, stay there. This is a man's world. It's a brutal world, Jeff, and you've no place in it.\" Paine is right. In Smith's current naive state, he has no place. \n\nWhen Smith first proposes the bill he's a nervous wreck with a shaky voice. He can hardly get through it. I always enjoy it when great actors are forced to act bad in a scene. It's a good contrast for later on. \"Liberty is too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.\" James Stewart isn't even the secret weapon of the film. He's exactly what he needs to be. The color red doesn't need to know why it's on the painter's brush, it simply needs to produce red when it's called upon. \n\nMr. Smith could have been a dull affair but Capra keeps the film humming with excellent pacing. There's a fast-paced montage of DC scenery and newspaper headlines, and there are smaller character moments. There are no stock characters here, each one is well rounded and has believable motives. Writer John Gautereaux said it best, \"Regardless of one's position in life, Capra made all men and women feel like they could obtain a piece of the American pie, if not bake it.\"", "review_date": "2023-01-07", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Stewart gives an excellent performance as naive Jefferson Smith fighting against the corrupt political system of Congress.", "review_date": "2023-01-07", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "A patriotic film about Congress and how an inexperienced Boy Scout leader has more integrity than the rest of the Senate.", "review_date": "2022-05-22", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "\"Look, when I came here, my eyes were big blue question marks.

Here it is presented as a tool for the common man to fight the powerful, but methinks it would be just as an effective tool for the elite to squelch progress - as in Strom Thurmond's 1957 Filibuster against the Civil Rights act.  \nMel Gibson and Homer Simpson collaborate on a remake to 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' in a season 11 episode of The Simpsons entitled   'Beyond Blunderdome'. \n\nLook for the Australian remake coming soon: Ms Lambie goes to Canberra", "review_date": "2022-01-17", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "James Stewart and Frank Capra. One needn't know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film. Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na\u00efve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart) is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies. He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony, but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) millions. When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington, he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a children's camp. When he tries to stop the project, Taylor's political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft. This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate, where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth out.\n\nThis film is wonderful in so many ways. The story is a classic struggle between good and evil. In typical Capra style, the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. If there is one clear message in Capra's films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope. He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity, and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds.\n\nI was dismayed to see a comment, obviously from a young viewer of this film, that said that the characters weren't realistic because no one used profanity. This is a sad testimonial to our culture, when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule.\n\nStewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington, with its monuments and history. The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that don't compromise their principles to hold on to power. Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the part.\n\nJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics, but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smith's noble homespun philosophies. Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator, who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency. He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out, and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiable.\n\nThis film is a national treasure. It is in my top 50 list of all time.

The razing he received from the media press guys was kind of like his wake up call so that he could realize that the role he now takes on is no joke. That was so unique that whole shot where Jefferson is fumbling around with his hat dropping it when he talks to Paine's daughter. It shows how nervous he is around her. He's the kind of man that needs to be more common in politics. He's going to do great things, he just needs to now what he's going to do in office. \n\nIn a world full of crooked, cynical, underhanded and scheming politicians, Jefferson Smith is the ray of light that everyone can look to for hope. An honest man that's trying to do good in a world that's been overrun by greedy businessmen and leaders that are in it for their own self interest. I admire Smith's courage to stand up for himself when he knows something is out of line, he's no pushover. It's so insane to think how easy it is for someone of power to slander or smear the image of someone who is getting in the way of their own self interest. It was sad to see how torn up he was when all those letters came in telling him to stand down and give up, even though those letters were fabricated lies. \n\nFrank Capra has this way of making you cry whether if it's out of joy or a sentiment towards a character or moment; his movies can be very sentimental at times. I thought it was a very inspiring movie with a great message; don't be afraid to stand up to the machine and crooked greedy big business.

Capra makes the story of one man standing up for what is right into a significant representation of all people in America. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a distinctly patriotic film as it depicts the importance of holding fast to American ideals of a democracy for the people.\n\nJames Stewart is brilliant as the naive youth nominated senator only to fall prey to corporate interests and political undermining. His outstanding speeches during the filibuster sequence is incredible to this day. I think that some of Stewart's finest acting comes when he endears himself to the lovely Jean Arthur in his office as he spouts American history and exceptionalism with a fervent patriotism. He is so real and looks like he really believed every word.\n\nClaude Rains is so interesting as a senator bought by a special interest, who must convince Stewart's senator to allow a dam to be built in a national park area. His scheming and deception is brilliantly executed, but it's Rains' own humanity and conflicts that make you so stunned by his subtle performance full of pained feelings.\n\nI love the firebrand performance from Jean Arthur as she rambles and rants her way into your heart.

The film certainly differs from films of that era in that it isn\u00e2(TM)t a noir, romance, or thriller. It is very unique being so politically focused. I wish that they would have made the story more compelling to watch. As it stands, for me there wasn\u00e2(TM)t anything that made me intrigued to see how the story unfolds. In this professional work, I did enjoy aspects of the writing. I particularly liked the montage where Mr. Smith goes around to people that are reading the negative article about him and he punches them in the face.

This exemplifies their power struggle \u00e2\" choosing to show her standing over him. Something that I really appreciated about the editing was the transitions they used. There were often dissolves and screen wipes when moving into the next scene or to show the passing of time. An example of this is when the senator has his first meeting, the screen wipe shows a transition through the passing of time throughout the meeting. As Jefferson Smith, James Stewart proved to have enjoyable moments to watch \u00e2\" particularly when Senator Smith first sits at his desk. In this moment, he is unsure as to how he should sit and very obviously readjusts his arms on his desk and was very comical in doing so. Regarding the cinematography, one shot that I found to be interesting was when Mr. Smith meets Susan Payne \u00e2\" the shot stays on Mr. Smith fumbling with his hat and then immediately goes into him knocking over a lamp. This choice to focus on his fumbling shows his nervousness of being around Susan. Mr. Smith is cool as a cucumber, but his direction shifts when Susan walks in.

He's a refreshingly innocent face dealing with a lot of serious issues, and the film does take the minutiae of getting a law passed in Congress seriously. The film does have some problems. A lot of the villainy is just too blunt and obvious. I'd like to imagine that it takes more than a minimal effort to frame a senator for corruption and I'd certainly have a hard time believing that they could go around beating up children and driving cars full of little boys off the road without anybody caring.

In back to back years he directed the 1938 sleeper hit, You Can't Take it With You, and the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Capra carried some of the same cast members over to the ladder, as Jimmy Stewart, Jean Arthur, and Edward Arnold are among the many who acted in both films.  Continuing with the tradition of Capra's other works, Mr. Smith deals with a common man taking on big ideas and ideals, only to be shut down by those more powerful and privileged.\n\nThis was the film that really showed the world what Stewart could do.  Even though I have seen tons of his films, this one stands out as some of his finest acting and most demanding roles of his filmography.  He was always great at playing an everyman and someone you can undeniably root for, and Jeff Smith is a defining role for him.  Smith represents the audience in going along for this political ride and I loved the way Stewart gave the character a certain amount of innocence and vulnerability while also displaying a graceful and powerful presence as well.\n\nHaving wonderful chemistry in You Can't Take it With You, it's no surprise that Stewart and Arthur's work together here is just as good, if not better.  Arthur plays Clarissa Saunders, who manages to keep Smith afloat even though he's constantly swept away by Washington and all of the extra perks for being in the Senate.  It's also not a forced romance, like a lot of 30's films, it takes a while for it to be developed as its handled with care.  Arthur may very well be the best romantic partner Stewart ever had.\n\n1939 was a fantastic year for film, with Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind also being released.  But perhaps no film from that year is still as relevant as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  Capra covers the film with patriotism with beautiful shots of Washington D.C. and a patriotic song here or there, but its his step into a pessimistic style of filmmaking that's most intriguing here.  The last 30 minutes with Stewart giving an Oscar worthy performance and Capra seamlessly twisting the story into unpredictable territories is truly something special.\n\n+Stewart becoming the Stewart we all love\n\n+Arthur is marvelous\n\n+Capra's balanced directing\n\n10/10", "review_date": "2016-09-01", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Classic film that attacks the truth of how government functions.

The performances, the betrayal are all fantastic and after the first half, what happens outside the senate hall is interesting and often tense, the confusion among the public, the riots both in protest and in support of Mr Smith and also the scenes where even the children are being threatened. But all that happens inside the senate after the first half are boring and you expect Mr Smith to throw in evidence about his innocence and the other group's crimes, instead he recites the Constitution of America and all Non-American viewers are bound to feel just the same way as the other senators who are often seen as tired and sleeping. The film is illogical and simply wants you to believe that pouring in patriotism can in turn save one and even turn to enemies into being dutiful. The film is extremely predictable at instances as well, like the hero loosing all hope after being betrayed, now you know there's got to be some motivating dialogues, then at least in here, for a change the lead actress gives the motivation. Then again, the way it handles the character of Senator Paine shows you how it's going to end after all.

Basement dweller, momma's boy, and youth camp counselor, Smith has just enough naivet\u00e9--and just enough idealism--to stand by his principles in the face of great pressure.  He wants to build a youth camp.  Unfortunately, his campground site is on a place earmarked for a dam, placing him in direct opposition to the party bosses and his co-senator, Joseph Paine (Claude Rains).\n\nHis love of country, and his love for his office secretary Ms. Saunders (Jean Arthur), give him the courage to persevere.\n\nWhat is interesting, from a political philosophical perspective, is how this film can be viewed as a leftist or far-rightist film, depending on your perspective.  Smith's crusade to speak truth to power is symbolic of the people's revolution in the purest sense.  And, yet, one cannot deny the fascistic overtones of one man's quest to channel the founding fathers' vision to take the youth into the wilderness and away from the corrupt city life, against the journalists and statesmen of education and prudence.\n\nIt gets four starts only because the ending, to me, is too much of a deus ex machina to be believed.

Naturally there's nothing like seeing the inner workings of a committee, particularly the biggest committee in the land, to crush someone's innocence. As a result this transitions into a story about one man with honesty and idealism fighting against the corruption of the American government. Jimmy Stewart is so brilliant as the naive Mr. Smith. He is exactly the kind of actor you want when you are trying to portray a man who has an almost child-like outlook on life, but also holds within him the strength of character to stand up against all opposition even when he appears to be all alone. Claude Rains is absolute perfection as the compromised Senator Paine. He puts so much depth into his performance that you can sense his resolve, his pride, and his guilt all in one conversation. At every moment you start to think he will break, and so the conclusion makes total sense and feels like a logical progression for his character. Jean Arthur has a nice arc to her story as well, and she is just the right kind of woman to guide Mr. Smith through the dark truths of the American political system.\n\nI am simply amazed how relevant this film is more than 75 years after it was made. The vision of big business controlling the government through money and influence is even more real today than it was in the 1930s. Just as Frank Capra made people dream back then of a small town man who would stand up for what is right, I think we all find ourselves now wishing that would be true in our day and age. Speaking of Capra's direction he really has an amazing eye for film-making. The way he frames shots is pure brilliance, and he knows exactly how to imbue all the emotion and heart into a scene. I was absolutely flabbergasted by the brilliance of the scene where Jefferson Smith meets Susan Paine. The way he holds the shot on their hands and tells the entire story through Smith fidgeting with his hat is masterful. He knows how to maximize a shot and get every little bit of subtext without having to overwhelm us with expository dialogue. My only complaint about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington would be the abrupt ending. It feels odd the way that everything just stops and we see literally none of the fallout after the big climax (SPOILERS: Our hero is even left unconscious as The End hits the screen.) However I have to hand it to Capra, because he has a magical way of getting the audience to an emotional high point and then just letting them walk away with this huge smile on their faces.

Great performances all around and I thoroughly enjoyed how this film tackled themes we still struggle with today-private interests influencing government, lack of journalistic integrity, no real freedom of the press, popular resignation and cynicism regarding the system, etc.  \n\nIn December 2014 it's very interesting to watch a film from 1940 about politics on Capital Hill only to realize how the influence of industry in government hasn't really changed.  That back then just as today those with great wealth are the ones who assert their will through the current practice of our political economy.  For me this film demonstrates how historically this sanctioned (and sometimes not so sanctioned) corruption has been the common practice in government for such a long time now.  And when something is common, it is often confused for what is normal.  When the thing that's common and seen as normal is not a healthy situation and many people know it, but worse accept it, then it leads to resignation and cynicism.\n\nIt's very easy for the cynical to view this film as somethings being an expression of cornball idealism under the weight of business as usual that has been the business for so long.  I prefer to see those ideals as something still worth fighting for, because they are human ideals of a functional society that were intended to be a code of honor for government.  They were supposed to be a values system for our views and behaviors toward one another in our communities so that government had something vital to protect and serve.  Those were the original intentions.  Cornball idealism?  To the easily accepting cynic-of course.

In 1992 Eddie Murphy starred in a movie loosely based on Mr. Smith goes to Washington called The Distinguished Gentleman. \n\nThe film also influenced many other films including Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde and Evan Almighty.\n\nThis classic is very readily available now a days and I ask you to go see it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com", "review_date": "2012-09-07", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Excellent film.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington stars James Stewart as a naive Junior Senator in a world of corruption and career politicians. Overwhelmed by his surroundings and his new job he leans on an old friend of his fathers and his own childhood hero Senior Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) for advice and direction. Mr. Smith finds that this country's government is not what he thought it was and neither is Senator Paine. If not for the friendship with his secretary, Miss Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr. Smith's stay in Washington would have been very disenchanting. Through sheer will and determination Mr. Smith takes on the corruption of Washington and tries to fight for, what seems to be, a lost cause.\r\n\r\n    James Stewart's performance in this film was masterful and he was justly nominated for an Academy Award. He exuded innocence and sincerity with every word and every nervous stumble played out perfectly as he obviously dove into this character head first. There are several scenes throughout the movie that pull on your patriotic strings as you , the viewer, are reminded of what this nation is built on and for, as you connect with Mr. Smith's cause.\r\n     Not to go unrecognized are Jean Arthur and Claude Rains performances, in which they were also nominated for an Academy Award. Both of these actors were incredible and so well suited for their roles. Rains' performance in the final scene of this film was memorable, as the pressure of Mr. Smith's honesty and integrity start to wear on his conscience.\r\n\r\n    Directed by Frank Capra, who 7 years later directed Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, this film moves along purposefully, as the viewer experiences the ups and downs of Mr. Smith's journey . There are many critics who believe this film to be his best, nominated for an Academy Award Capra lost out to Victor Fleming and Gone With the Wind.\r\n\r\n     Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a movie that pulls at all the right places and pushes at all the right times. The film is about innocence versus corruption, good versus evil, right versus wrong and having hope when facing adversity.

The film was directed by the legendary Frank Capra who also directed many other classics such as It Happened One Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can't Take It With You (1938), Meet John Doe (1941) and the film that is mandatory viewing on television at Christmas time, It's a Wonderful Life (1946).\r\n\r\nCapra was known for making pictures that dealt with the social issues of the times. They were also called \"feel good\" pictures because, while they took the audience through a tense human drama of despair and hopelessness throughout the film, they always made them feel happy by the end, something that was important to him because these pictures were made during The Great Depression and then during World War II. After his great many successes, movies and stories made by other directors that seemed to copy his style were referred to with a new word, \"Capra-esque!\"\r\n\r\nBut with politics so much in the news these days and with the possibility of one or two people out there who have never seen this film, I decided that it might be worthwhile to write about it. It is astounding that Jimmy Stewart, one of the greatest actors in all Hollywood history, seems to be displaying the art of method acting long before the style was even known. In a dramatic climactic scene near the end, with his youthful looks and dynamic intensity, I am convinced that no one else could have matched his performance.\r\nThe film is about Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) who is an idealistic young man and a leader in the Boy Scouts organization in his state. Because he is also very naive and unaware of the political game, he is newly appointed by the governor to take the place of the state senator who had just died. The objective of the governor is to get someone in the office who can be easily controlled by the senior senator (Claude Rains) and by the bosses of the state so that they can proceed with their agenda of crooked corruption in congress.\r\nWhen Mr. Smith gets to Washington, he is met by his assistant (Jean Arthur) who feels sorry for him and his inexperience and so she takes him under her wing to keep him out of trouble. But she soon sympathizes with his plan to introduce a bill to benefit The Boys Scouts of his state when it becomes apparent that his plan would throw a monkey wrench into the scheme of the bosses who have other motivations to make some fast money. She helps him to navigate the complex congressional rules to the point where he must initiate a filibuster where he is obligated to stand up alone and continue talking non-stop the whole session day after day so that he will not lose the floor. He thinks that by doing this, he will rally his constituents at home but he has underestimated his enemies.\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM LINE?\r\nThe film is magnificently cast with top notch actors including Jean Arthur, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Carey. It did not win the oscar because it was up against the massive epic, Gone With The Wind. It was most likely the first film to expose the political corruption that goes on in the nation's capital as it does wherever and whenever power and money are involved. The picture was filmed in black and white and is a classic uplifting movie with classic performances made 72 years ago but still very effective and remarkably relevant today as it was then.\r\n\r\nFrom the Aisle Seat at the Movies\r\nmoxieandcharisma.wordpress.com", "review_date": "2012-01-29", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Fast-paced & well-acted.

Excellent direction, awesome acting, and some of the best editing I have ever seen in a film. It deserves every single accolade it received, and more. The story is actually quite complex and interesting. It's about Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart, who get's nominated for senator after the death of Senator Samuel Foley. Smith was nominated because of his work as the leader of the state's Boy Rangers group. Mr. Smith is a little nervous when he starts out, but he starts to get the hang of it, and tries to introduce some of his ideas, most of them are turned down, so he has to stand up for what he believes in, and by stand up, I really do mean \"STAND UP\". The story is very well done, even if it seems slightly far-fetched at times. Also, some of the scenes following the story are extremely well done, especially the ending. The characters are very likable and anything but cliches, especially Mr. Smith himself. They feel like real life people, while still being interesting. The acting is outstanding. Every actor, no matter how long they're on screen, leave a big impact. I was even shocked a young African-American boy was in the movie, as this was a time where racism was more widespread. Even still, Gone with the Wind had an African-American woman in a bigger role, so it's not a huge deal, even though it was still a great move by Capra to break the Black/White barrier. Also, James Stewart does completely TREMENDOUS in this film. In my personal opinion, Stewart is the second best actor ever (Behind Chaplin), and this has got to be one of his best roles. He's so intense when he needs to be, but when the movie is calm, so is Stewart. He's actually quite quirky at those parts, but in the climax, he is just powerful with every word. Also, Jean Arthur get's completely lost in her character, and between her and Stewart, it's hard to decide who's better. Now, as every recent review I do does this eventually, it's time for \"The Best and Worst of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\". The best, undoubtedly, has to be the last half an hour or so. This is where Mr. Smith talks non-stop, I'm not gonna say what he's talking about, and as time goes by, he get's more and more exhausted, and while he's doing this, his friends try to rally for him, but all attempts fail. The scene is actually depressing, with Mr. Smith talking for hours with no one listening, and his friends failing to rally for him. I won't tell you what happens in the end, but it's a big surprise. The worst of this film... The only huge flaw I can think of is how they portray the government. I know, I know, the government sucked back then like it does now, but it seems to portray the government representatives as snooty, hate-filled, etc, which can get on your nerves at times. Even with that flaw, this is still an awesome, timeless, wonderfully edited, amazingly acted, and tremendously written film, well worthy of a watch for all ages. 5/5.", "review_date": "2011-07-27", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "it's easy to underline the naivety of this flick, on the other hand, isn't the matter more up-to-date than before?", "review_date": "2011-07-26", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "james stewart is amazing, as usual. it was funny and tells the truth.", "review_date": "2011-07-21", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "I've always loved James Stewart as the cute guy in the movies who gets the chick...

In High School, this was one of the movies I'd turn to for a good cry.  I saw this for the first time since my college days the other night.  It was nice.  Although there were points where I thought \"typical Capra.\"  The singing of \"Auld Lang Syne\" while Jeff Smith is presented with his briefcase, I couldn't help but role my eyes at it.  And this is a political film and there are points where I do lose some interest.  But the power of Mr. Smith is in how it ends.  In his apparent defeat, he in some ways wins.  After his collapse, it induces Payne to exonerate Jeff of the false charges that he fought tooth and nail to be cleared of.  In effort for understanding and defense, the good moral conscious of a Capra character induces them to come clean and clear the hero from his apparent defeat.  Apparent at first but in being exonerated, he wins and he's totally oblivious due to being unconscious at the time.  An underdog David and Goliath story done well.  A film for the ages.  P.S.:  Forgive me for being bored with the political speak.  Its just not my thing.  The allure of the film is in Jeff's idealism and his ignorance in the wheelings and dealings of the Washington elite that subsequently lead to the conflict.", "review_date": "2010-10-07", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "Classic and beautifully aged", "review_date": "2010-10-06", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "I know this is a classic, it has changed cinema & it's amazing 'for it's time' BUT, I'm sorry...

He has been hand-picked to be appointed senator of his state by a corrupt political boss named Jim Taylor, played impressively by Edward Arnold. The great Claude Rains delivers a magnificent Academy Award nominated turn, as the senior senator and Smith's troubled colleague, a good man gone bad by the power of politics. Smith later learns that a pending appropriations bill will fund a graft project, a dam backed by his powerful sponsor. To prevent the bill from passing before this plot can be revealed to the public, Smith takes to the Senate floor to stage a filibuster and speaks for hour after hour, a lone hero standing up for what's right on the floor of the United States Senate is one of the greatest showdowns in the history of the cinema. Masterful Academy Award nominated direction by Capra, with tremendous performances by Jean Arthur, Thomas Mitchell, Harry Carey, Eugene Pallette, Beulah Bondi, and Guy Kibbee. An intelligent and witty Academy Award winning screenplay by Sidney Buchman, with beautiful black & white cinematography by Joseph Walker, and striking art direction by Lionel Banks, that features a meticulous-crafted and perfect replica of the U.S. Senate chamber, which is an uncanny set. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director: Frank Capra. A timeless classic! Highly Recommended.", "review_date": "2010-09-24", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "No one is better than Frank Capra to expose the heart and sincere essence of what it means to be an American in this  inspirational piece of storytelling.\r\n\r\nJimmy Stewart stars as Jefferson Smith, a Montana boy scout leader suddenly turned senator by Senator Paine (Claude Rains). At first, everyone makes fun of Smith and his traditional values, especially by his secretary (Jean Arthur) and his press corespondent (Thomas Mitchell). But once he finds himself in a scandal of alleged corruption, Smith must convince the Senate that he is innocent; by any means possible. \r\n\r\nFrank Capra's direction is spectacular. Like every great director you can automatically identify his style. Orson Welles is dramatic and visually dazzling, John Ford is sentimental and has vivid landscapes, Alfred Hitchcock is smug and suspenseful, and then you have Frank Capra, who provides a nimbly paced sympathetic story about moral values as well as great visuals when you need them. \r\n\r\nI would rank this with Capra's other achievements; It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You, and A Wonderful Life. If It Happened One Night is the rudimentary romantic comedy, and A Wonderful Life is the rudimentary inspirational story, then this is the rudimentary underdog story. \r\n\r\nThe story is flawless, and so is Capra's storytelling, but I will admit that there are some points that transcended my believability. Like the talking for 23 hours scene. And there were moments that were \"too good to be true\" or just seemed a little to unreal. Otherwise every scene is expertly crafted and there are many little details that make the film work better as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is deservingly monumental. Politicians and corruption? That sounds Absurd! Well here you go in 1939. And it's probably the most pro-American-film-that-criticizes-the-government ever made. Every scene, and I mean EVERY scene at the Senate House or with Claude Rains or with Harry Carey was perfect because it managed to keep its sense of seriousness and still have the old Hollywood magic.   \r\n\r\nThere's one scene near the beginning where Mr. Smith goes around punching journalists in the face, and that was just plain hilarious. There's also a great moment where Jimmy Stewart is nervous about talking to this girl who he has a crush on, and the camera just focuses on his hat which he's fidgeting with. Not something to be missed.\r\n\r\nNow, there's a lot of hullaballoo about the performances here. Jean Arthur is good. Claude Rains is phenomenal. Harry Carey is amiable. Thomas Mitchell (trivia: he won an Oscar for Best Sup. Actor the same year for Stagecoach) is witty and charming. Edward Arnold yet again fits into the \"evil corporate monster\" role. And now to Jimmy Stewart:\r\n\r\nJimmy Stewart is my favorite actor and is who I consider is the greatest American actor of all time. Naturally, the only reason I went out to get this film was because of his legendary performance. After watching this, I must reflect; other than his famous monologue at the end, Stewart isn't really given much to do. So during the end he's spectacular and completely grabs your heart. For the rest of the movie, when he's there, he's okay.\r\n\r\nThis film was nominated for 11 Oscars and won 1. \"Why is that?\" you may ask. 1939 was the same year that Gone With The Wind was made. You could say that the Oscars were already reserved. Gone With The Wind vs. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is a worthy battle, but I consider Gone With The Wind to be the granddaddy of all Best Picture winners. It also deserved to win every award it did over Mr Smith Goes To Washington, which is Picture, Director, Screenplay, Art Direction, and Film Editing. Jimmy Stewart didn't win Best Actor, and that's not as much of a crime as it seems, because my second choice would have been Clark Gable for Gone With The Wind other than whoever that was that did win.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith Goes To Washington is predictably iconic and a timeless masterpiece that represents Frank Capra at his finest. 99/100", "review_date": "2010-09-20", "source": "rt", "lang": "en"}, {"content": "This is one of my favorite movies because it manages to move me to such an extent that I cry and scream at my television set.

One film that starts very slowly then the plot begins to take form and then it turned into a great, great film. The screenplay is simply a masterpiece; all the Senate scenes at the end are an absolute gem.
