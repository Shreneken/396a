            "review_title": "Nothing innovating but still really entertaining and funny!",
            "content": "I went to the cinema to watch this movie because my girlfriend really appreciated the first part which I've never seen and she convinced me to come with her. She bought the DVD of the first movie and there was a special gift card in it which allowed her to have a reduction of ten dollars on a ticket for the sequel and so we went to the cinema.I didn't expect anything from this movie and I wouldn't usually comment on such a movie because it is simply not my kind of genre, but as I see now such horrible votes and the movie entering in the infamous top one hundred bottom list, I thought I'd be better if I might write my opinion, because this movie isn't simply that bad - and I am generally kind of severe on movies! While watching this movie for one and a half hour, I've never taken a look on my watch, I've never felt bored at all and I found this movie very entertaining. There were also a lot of nice laughs, especially the naive but sympathetic pigeon was worth the watch - and let me tell you that it is rather difficult to make me laugh. Beside the pigeon, the little girl which always saw the animals making crazy things while her mother didn't recognize anything was an entertaining running gag, too. Another funny thing was the scene in the animal's Alcatraz which I thought was a nice idea. The collaboration, the prejudices and the growing team spirit between the secret agencies of the cats and the dogs were also some really nice elements in this movie even if they were predictable. And the movie even had something philosophical: Cats and dogs put away their prejudices to save their beloved humans together and fight a common enemy. Well, I know, this is a predictable content, too, but still very touching and even teaching for young kids who are watching this movie. And the idea of adapting the world of James Bond to the world of cats and dogs isn't silly at all, but very funny for the kids, nicely done for the adults who understand some funny allusions and certainly better than most of the boring super agent comedy movie in the key of Austin Powers and other boring stuff.A part of that, the movie is well animated and has a perfect length. People who really like cats or especially dogs might even give a few stars more, for example for the funny and cute video clips in the end of the movie.Of course, this movie is just a sequel, it shows nothing innovating and the story is predictable and of course there are no twists in the movie, but you can't expect that from any animation movie a part of the amazing \"Wall-E\". Some people here say that you should put the children into the cinema to watch this movie and head yourself for the - in my opinion - heavily overrated \"Inception\" - I mean, you just can't compare those movies and if you take this point as a judgement, it is certain that you may be disappointed.So, don't listen to some of those really ordinary and exaggerated hate comments and spend some ninety minutes with your kids or younger sister or girlfriend or cat/dog fetish, switch your brain off and enjoy the nice jokes and this very entertaining movie.5,5 to 6 stars out of 10!",

So I advice you to go to the movie theaters as a family and your 4-12 years old go watch this film and you and our spouse or partner watch a more grown up film like Inception or if you have already seen Inception, then go watch Salt. However this isn't the worst film ever, or the worst film of Summer 2010, there are actually some funny and enjoyable moments in this film, however there aren't many of them at all. If it was consistently funny, I'd recommend it to the whole family or anyone looking for a good time.This film is actually better than Marmaduke, but its still very dull and really not funny. It won't be a horrible experience watching this film, but it will be boring.4/10",

I thought it was pretty funny and I enjoyed it. It's much better then the other movies for kid's that have been released lately. The movie was excellent and I especially thought Mr. Tinkle's performance definitely stole the show once he was on screen. There were many scenes throughout the film that had me laughing so hard I cried. If you do not like kid's movies then don't see this- plain and simple! But if you are like me and you want to see it just for the cute comedy then see it. Personally I thought it was funnier then a lot of comedies for adults.",

            "content": "I repeat: This is a CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!There's a lot of up and down votes on something that really wasn't meant for critically snarky 30-somethings. Get a grip!The First Movie was interesting because the concept of our pets being part of shadow spy organizations that stayed out of human sight was an eye-opener. Following up on the initial break-out is always an up-hill slog.This one was Okay. Crazed Cat Villain attempts to take over the world by making all dogs go crazy so humans will put them all into kennels. Both Canine and Feline Organizations get together to prevent disaster. what follows is EASY and ENTERTAINING to a Child. . .Repeat: 'Entertaining to a Child', not someone's Little Genius who reads the New York Times for Bedtime Stories!The references and gags put in for the accompanying adults are there to LIGHTLY ENTERTAIN us by eliciting Pun-Groans or soft snickers. They ARE NOT trying to give you a Comedy Central Sidetrack. The Adult is NOT the Target Audience here. If they did that, IT WOULD NOT BE A KID MOVIE ANYMORE!Personally, I groaned at the Batman/Joker redux of Kitty Galore. Then I smiled at the Dangerous Kitty doing the Silence of the Lambs sendup.And the rest of the time, I just sat back and enjoyed a rambunctious, Tom & Jerry style action romp simply because I wanted to be entertained by something lighthearted.And the Pigeon was a Hoot!Simply put: A good clean Movie for Little Kids that won't put the adult to sleep. Or even if you don't have Kids, and you want something light and silly to watch that doesn't require thought, this is an easy choice. Enough said.",

After seeing such a low score, I didn't expect it to be that great, but I found myself enjoying the film after a very short time.The movie was actually pretty funny, and I don't normally find kids movies very funny, but this was actually good as a sequel. No, it wasn't amazing or even great, but it definitely wasn't bad and didn't deserve such a low rating. I've seen much worse kids movies get higher ratings than this.You need to approach it with an open mind and remember that it is a kids movie and you will enjoy this, especially if you love animals or have a younger friend who loves animals to watch it with.I have been waiting for years for a sequel to the original, and while this one wasn't as great as I remember the original being, it was still an enjoyable movie with many laughs, and familiar characters.The special effects were definitely not the best I've seen, but there isn't anything wrong with that, the movie wasn't trying to be mind blowing, but the effects got the job done. Its a good sequel full of laughs and fun for the family to enjoy.If you can approach this movie with an open mind, and remember its not an adult's film, but fun for the family, you will find plenty of enjoyment and laughs for everyone in the family.",

There were some parts I actually got a laugh out of, even at my age. I loved the part where it was announced to congratulate a dog on his son, son, daughter, daughter, son, daughter.....just one of those clever parts that you have to pay attention to catch.I loved the opening credits and Shirley Bassey theme, straight from James Bond and very clever.Sometimes we need a change from the movies we watch. Movies are so much more than cutting up teenagers in slasher movies, or great American movies like Platoon where a young girl is raped by Americans, or the great Spielberg in his Saving Private Ryan where American soldiers shoot German soldiers who are trying to surrender. No, there wasn't any 'f' bombs, nobody was in a nude scene, nobody was decapitated, nobody cheated on their spouses. You know the types of movies adults enjoy.Yes, there are times I wish to watch a racy movie or a war movie, however this was not one of those times. The wife and I desired a cute movie that anybody of any age could watch, and this movie was one of those.Real quickly, I fell asleep during the original Cats and Dogs, but this movie hooked me from the first and wouldn't let me off the hook. The original lost me in the first 10 minutes.",

It may not be the most entertaining movie ever for adults, but heck, it passed a morning of the school holidays, & that's good enough for me. Being a Bond fan, I loved the opening credits & liked the fact that they were copying that genre. I confess to intermittent feelings of boredom, but have yet to sit through a kid's movie where this was not the case at some point. It is clearly very very difficult to make a film which genuinely entertains adults and children throughout - if they manage to make both laugh at some point, they are doing well in my humble opinion! I asked my kids whether they had preferred Toy Story 3 (which has a much higher rating on IMDb) or Cats & Dogs, and they said they had liked both just the same. Perhaps IMDb should only allow kids to review kids films! Adults, this film may not be Oscar material, but lets keep things in perspective.",

            "content": "This belated sequel to the 2001 box-office hit Cats & Dogs is better than I expected. That's not to say it's great, it's not, but there have been far inferior kiddie films I've sat through this year with my four year old (not naming any names... Alvin and Shrek). There's free-flowing action that will entertain the younglings and the animals themselves are cute and/or funny enough to please all audience members, though the plot has more than its fair share of eye-rolling moments and the CGI is poorer than it should be considering the movie's $85m budget.The gags are hit or miss, however the few that stick are quite amusing. A riff on Silence of the Lambs is hilarious and provides the sole laugh-out-loud scene whilst the Head of M.E.O.W (the feline secret service agency) Tab Lazenby \u2013 cheekily voiced by Roger Moore \u2013 offers plenty of 007 parodied humour. Elsewhere the talented voice cast do their best to inject energy into the frequently lack-lustre and cheesy script. Marsden is likable as lead mutt Diggs, Nolte is gruff as ever as Alec Baldwin's replacement for the hardened Butch, Applegate brings the sass as Catherine and Midler is clearly having a blast as the malevolent Kitty. Chris O'Donnell fares a lot worse as live-action character Shane, Diggs' loving ex-cop partner, his unabashed mugging an absolute low in his career.Decent enough viewing with the nippers on a wet weekend.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",

Poor misunderstood Kitty Galore. She wasn't evil, just angry.It is a funny movie with a host of big names that references a lot of other pop culture movies and themes.

            "content": "I've seen the original and those who think this is an improvement are on something. While the original was cute and did manage to entertain ,this sequel does not. They try and cram as much CGI and silly dialog as possible in this movie including a rather useless magician character and a pigeon that I wanted to skewer just to shut it up. I barely heard even a laugh or giggle in the audience except for the few under 10 set kids and even they looked bored after-wards. The plot involving a neglected cat aka Kitty Galore is so silly and ridiculous even by kiddie standards. The cat who was a member of some spy group of cats called MEOWS(the counterpart to the dogs spy group that protects humans)she turns rogue and decides to take it out on humans since she was neglected by her human owners after she lost her fur in an accident while being chased by a guard dog.So she collects computer parts and starts making a device to turn dogs into rabid animals which will force humans to put them in cages and then she and her cat minions will enslave mankind. It's even insulting to kids to sit through this drivel. Some of the dialog even tries to cater to older kids/adults but it fails miserably. Bette Midler tries her best to ham it up as Kitty Galore but her voice-over is nothing more than overacted camp that's painfully unfunny. I think this movie should have been a direct to DVD release-it didn't deserve the big screen treatment. It still amazes me how much money is spent on movies such as these when other movies that are way better and have a small budget get the direct to TV or DVD treatment. Bomb 1/10",

From the opening credits with the great Shirley Bassey doing a James Bond theme version of Pink's Let's Get the Party Started, I knew it was going to be clever and well written, and it didn't disappoint. The cast is very good with the appropriately utilized voices of the two main characters; the distinctive gravelly voice of Nick Nolte and in instantly recognizable voice of and Bette Midler as Kitty Galore herself (although slightly over the top), but obviously having a ball playing the villain. I could have done without the token stereotypical and very obnoxious black character, apparently required in all animated movies; in this case \"Kat\" (no pun intended) Williams. At least it wasn't Wanda Sykes.

            "content": "Cats & Dogs [2]: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (1:22, PG-13, 3-D) \u2014 other: talking animals; 3rd string; sequelI created the \"talking animals\" subcategory after years of frustration trying to figure out whether to slot things like this under SF, fantasy, or elsewhere. Now no agonizing is required: Anything that involves chatty critters (or cars, babies, vegetables, toys, or other entities that aren't actually capable of speech) just gets dumped here.There's a general sense that these things tend to be kiddie fare with low production values and even lower IQ expectations. But a review of the 74 such movies since 2000 shows that they aren't much different than SF&F movies in general, coming in with an average rating of 4.92 on my scale of 1-9 (compared to a 4.93 average for the other 474 movies in my database). Some of them have been superb (Bolt, Toy Story 2, Up), and others very good (Charlotte's Web, Finding Nemo, The Golden Compass, a couple of Ice Age movies, Monsters Inc., Ratatouille, Toy Story 3, and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit).At the other end of the scale are the movies that give rise to the stereotype: Garfield, Scooby Doo, Space Chimps, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, VeggieTales, Marmaduke, Rugrats, Furry Vengeance, and 2 wretched excrescences called Yu-Gi-Oh and Tamala 2010.The original Cats & Dogs (2001) was dead average with a 5 rating. It certainly was not the kind of artistic triumph or blockbuster hit that demanded a sequel, but we got one anyway, this one in (all together now: ooooooo) 3-D, as if that alone justifies its existence. Is it a dog or the cat's meow? (Puns intended; please don't hurt me.)Well, in the tradition of such things, there are bones thrown (ouch) to the adults, including a lot of smirky allusions to the James Bond oeuvre. 007 fans will recognize that \"Kitty Galore\" is a pun on Bond girl Pussy Galore (itself a smirking pun on something that will never sneak into a PG movie). There are silhouettes and sultry female vocals under the opening credits. And Bond actor (1973-1985) Roger Moore does one of the voices, for \"Tab Lazenby\", head of Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety (MEOWS), reminding old farts like me that the immediate successor to Sean Connery was not Moore but the hapless George Lazenby, about whom nothing has been heard since 1969.Nor do they stop there. I have to give Writers Ron Friedman and Steve Bencich and Director Brad Peyton credit for working really hard at throwing in a lot of code words, images, and background business designed to appeal to adults. Much of it was pretty clever, including allusions to movies made well before the target audience for this film was even born. But the result is schizophrenic. It's like going to see the Jerry Lewis version of Hamlet and discovering Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud playing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.In the final analysis, tho, do we go to see a movie just for the puns?*No, we don't, and regrettably the ostensible surface plot of the movie, tho crammed with substance, snappy dialog, and a certain cockeyed coherence, is pretty insipid. Once again, dogs and cats are portrayed as mortal enemies enslaved to their basic natures, except that this time they're required to *gasp* work together to foil the evil machinations of criminal mastermind Kitty Galore, who intends to broadcast a worldwide dog-whistle tone (from a CD helpfully Sharpied with the legend \"The Call of the Wild\") that will turn her canine nemeses into snarling menaces, thus bringing their doom upon them as an alarmed humanity wipes them all out. There are more twists and turns as well (as I said, no lack of filling), but it's all pretty much of the same caliber.The voice cast features many B-list names for no discernible reason and to no audible benefit (except for Bette Midler as Kitty), and the visual cast is a bunch of animals trained to assume unnatural positions and have matchmove artists do strange CGI things with their jaws. This is only fitfully effective.I saw the film in 3-D. The good news is that the main feature was preceded by \"Coyote Falls\", a 3-minute roadrunner cartoon in a passable imitation of the grand cel-animation tradition, and it used 3-D to marvelous advantage with Wile E.'s latest Acme acquisition, a bungee cord. The bad news is that the 3-D imaging in the movie itself was sloppy, with numerous cases of dogs having doubled snouts, or a patch of fur seeming to float above the surface of the cat it was nominally attached to. This is a movie that didn't care enuf to send the very best.I do appreciate the attempt to give the adults something to care about, tho, and it was accomplished without having to distract the kids from the story they came to see, so the overall effect is to get a gentleman's D+ from me.\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013*Besides, for SF&F fans, they're not even nerd puns.",

Most of the plot was quotes from other movies, with cats and dogs playing the parts (in particular, the opening title scene was a very well done version of the old James Bond movie title sequences). Except for where it was a direct parody of other movies, the plot was mostly perfunctory, and the denouement was a long and mostly incomprehensible action scene.

            "content": "Well, the official website for \"Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" has a paw for a mouse pointer, the movie uses most every lazy pun possible about pets, and a reviewer has already claimed the movie marks the end of civilization as we know it. With such prospects, a film about talking cats and dogs coming together to fight off Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) doesn't eye well for adults. And it doesn't. Any mathematicians in the theater can better spend their time tracking the noticeable upward curve of boredom and silliness the longer the movie runs (the pet gags during the end credits don't count).Aren't kids movies like this supposed to be funny despite their absurdity? It took 9 years to bring this sequel of \"Cats & Dogs\" to the theaters, which gave it plenty of time to spread a wide umbrella for big name voices. Nick Nolte's deep scratchy voice took to the end credits to figure out, but it stands out in his role as a scrappy mentor dog, Butch, the muscle of a secret agency run by semi-intelligent talking dogs.We learn that dogs have an underground spy organization where no human has ever entered, appropriately outfitted with hi-tech gadgets in the Bond tradition and specially tailored for dog clich\u00e9s. Cats have a similar underground facility for their secret organization, named MEOWS. The first pet puns are quirky and tone setting, but after the third or fourth - and when combined with lame cultural references (including Hannibal Lecter and who knows what else) - it becomes torture.The main character is a German shepherd police dog named Diggs (James Marsden), who joins a band of unlikely heroes to try to protect humans against Kitty Galore. Diggs follows the 'Dirty Harry' template of the ends justifies his means, that is, he causes havoc while taking down a madman and tends to set off fiery explosions in the process. So, of course, he's recruited by Butch (Nick Nolte) to join the secret dog organization. Diggs and Butch reluctantly join teams with a top kitty agent, Catherine (Christina Applegate), from MEOWs. Along for the ride is a pea brained pigeon, Seamus (Katt Williams), to provide comic relief.The plot is adequately thin and senseless. They battle against Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler), a hairless Sphinx cat, who plans to enslave humans and take over the world. Her plan is to use malevolent sound waves, from a weapon called \"The Call of the Wild\" (by the way), at an ultra low frequency (just for dogs) to trigger all dogs to violently rebel against humans. Humans will have to lock them all in kennels. But the movie forgets to mention how Kitty Galore intends to conquer humans. Will she change the frequencies and use the weapon on us? She doesn't specify, but perhaps she could change to an appropriate frequency to trigger our caveman impulses, or something.Kitty Galore is funny as she reluctantly placates her not so magical magician owner. She became evil because her previous owners treated her like a freak and threw her out after she fell into a vat of hair removal cream (like the Joker from \"Batman\"). The movie has a couple other funny moments with a house filled of too-lazy-to-move high cats, and a goofy Calico cat voiced by Wallace Shawn (lampooning his role in \"The Princess Bride\"). Other stars take part in hopes of success, including Neil Patrick Harris, Roger Moore, and Joe Pantoliano, but it doesn't help much.Some of the most effective scenes are ones where pets give normal pet reactions. The audience actually responded to Diggs whimpering as he was locked in his cage by his former cop partner, played by Chris O'Donnell (in one of the few human roles). The pets only pretend to act normal around humans, but on occasion a little girl stumbles on them talking. She's amazed, no one believes her, and the pets resort to clich\u00e9s (butt sniffing for dogs).That's it. Most of the other jokes are dull. The movie becomes so lazy, any action is just meaningless and boring. The movie uses a mix of live action animals, puppetry, and computer animation to bring the pets to life. The CGI mouths attempt to make such absurdity seem real, but who cares when what they say isn't funny or interesting. The 3D wasn't very noticeable at all.",

The human actors are just a distraction to the spy like efforts of the cats and dogs, and there are no characters as funny as some of the cats in the original. The CGI, real animals, and puppetry, comes together most of the time, and it doesn't matter when it looks a bit ridiculous. The brief segments of Sean Hayes proves that he was the driving force of the original, and he should have been a main focus here. Like most childish children's films, there are many annoying characters and a lot of lame jokes, which had me groaning and sighing. Probably a bit too long went by between this and the original. Luckily, it allows new viewers to slip right in.",

Yes, I love a bad movie now and then and last time I checked, it was on IMDb's Bottom 100 list. However, I now noticed that the film has a much higher rating (3.4) and it is no longer on the list. So, it's obviously not a good film, but not bad enough I should have sought it out to fulfill my bad movie addiction.Unlike a truly bad film, there is an audience for this film. Undemanding children (no older than perhaps 10) would probably laugh at the film and its countless poop and fart jokes, a bald cat, tons of stunts and just the sight of seeing talking pets. All this make for a bad and especially annoying film but you can't blame the kids--after all, most children are not movie reviewers and don't mind all this silliness! But, for anyone older than 10, it will be a chore to watch--and at times pretty painful. It's a shame, as the first film, \"Cats & Dogs\" was pretty good and had some appeal for all ages--whereas \"Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" would only appeal to someone over age 10 if they have very, very, very low standards...or a traumatic brain injury.My verdict: dumb and tedious but also fun for young kids. Parents, if you ARE forced to watch it, I suggest watching it along with copious amounts of your favorite HIGH alcohol content beverage.",

I like how this spoofs James Bond movies right down to the opening credits and the name Kitty Galore. Also, Roger Moore does one of the voices and his character is named Tab Lazenby (for you Bond trivia lovers, George Lazenby played 007 in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service). Don't call me weird but I think that there is a good message for children in this film, let me explain. The dogs and cats join forces to stop this rogue cat Kitty Galore. This teaches kids that you should put aside petty things to band together as a team. Oh, they also do a good job of spoofing Silence Of The Lambs. My only real complaint isn't with the animals its with one of the humans in the film, that goofy magician Kitty was working for. He was so annoying.",

Butch, yes one of the returning heroes from Cats And Dogs 1 but voiced this time by Nick Nolte (guess Alec Baldwin wanted nothing to do with the sequel) gets advised by returning hero #2 Lou (also voiced by another actor) that he wants Diggs to join up with them to fight the new feline threat to canine and human kind Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler). this time around the villain has come across a sound so severe that when dogs here it they will go crazy and attack their owners, therefore removing all dogs as pets due to safety concerns. As to which if this dastardly plan succeeds next up on the chopping block will be the humans. Cats and dogs this time around have to join forces to remove the world of Kitty Galore the feline threat.

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie knocks Inception out of the #1 spot AND passes it as one of the top 3 movies rated on IMDb. IT'S THAT GOOD! The movie is basically about a drug lord who smuggles cocaine into the United States through bags of dog food. When people start reporting illness in their pets, the magic dogs and cats try to find out what happens.Chris O'Donnell could get an Oscar nomination for this. His performance was nothing short of amazing. Like when he played Robin in that Batman movie.When the animals talk it looks really cool.

Which doesn't bode well, for a start. As far as I can see, there is virtually no continuity from the first film to this one apart from a Labrador called Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin previously and Nick Nolte here) and a Persian cat called Mr Tinkles, voiced by Sean Hayes in both. The general gist of things is espionage operations conducted by cats and dogs, and the wrinkle here is that they have to work together to foil the dastardly plans of Kitty Galore (one of those ugly cats things with no fur, voiced by Bette Midler).The voice talent is great - much higher profile than the humans (led by Chris O'Donnell in a thankless role) and the CGI work is excellent - there are times when you know something must be CGI (facial expressions, mouth articulation, certain actions and so on) but it is often the case that you really aren't sure. The script is loaded with gags (even down to Roger Moore playing the leader of the cats' espionage organisation, a cat named Tab Lazenby). And the moral of the thing is laudable - even cats and dogs can learn how to get along together (so, by extension, we should all be able to, shouldn't we?).But something doesn't quite work. And I think it is that the film has no heart. It seems to be a fairly mechanical exercise in putting elements together which should work, and maybe they do for kids, but they didn't really work for me.This may also be the reason why I don't remember the first movie.The 3D doesn't add anything significant, although the 3D Road Runner cartoon attached to the main movie was GREAT.

The soundtrack is a lot of fun too especially at the beginning, and the acting is decent with the human characters likable enough and Sean Hayes and Bette Midler standing out in the voice cast. The direction is at least okay. The film is too rushed though, particularly at the end, perhaps with a longer length it would have felt more steady. The script does have its clever and witty moments, but also one too many moments of stupidity, and the film is not that long I feel the story was too thin to properly sustain the running time.

Basically in the world where cats and dogs are enemies, most (not all) cats wanting to take over the world, and many dogs as the secret agents defeating them. One particular German Shepherd police dog Diggs (Enchanted's James Marsden), owned by his cop master Shane (Chris O'Donnell), is recruited by dog Butch (Nick Nolte) to help defeat a new threat to the world. Furless cat Kitty Galore (Bette Midler) is planning to take over the world, and after meeting feline secret agent Catherine (Anchorman's Christina Applegate) who works for MEOWS (Mousers Enforcing Our World Safety), it looks like the good cats and dogs will have to work together. Kitty, once known as Ivonna Clawyou used to work for the cat organisation as an agent, but went rogue after losing her fur and being rejected by her original owners, and she has a plan to brainwash all the dogs in the world to attack without though or reason. With a little help from the first film's super villain Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes) locked up in the secret cell in Alcatraz, they find out that Kitty is going to use a satellite in order to do this, but the mission is to find out where from. Eventually they find out that a fairground ride is where the satellite will be activated, and in the end the hero cats and dogs save the day, only to see the next mission coming up with the escape of Mr. Tinkles. Also starring Katt Williams as Seamus, Neil Patrick Harris as Lou, Michael Clarke Duncan as Sam, Joe Pantoliano as Peek, Sir Roger Moore as Tab Lazenby, Wallace Shawn as Calico, Rat Race's Paul Rodriguez as Crazy Carlito, Rugrats' Elizabeth Daily as Scrumptious / Patches / Catherine's Niece, Futurama's Phil LaMarr as Paws / Cat Spy Analyst, Scream's Roger Jackson as Inmate Fat Cat and Spirder-Man's J.K. Simmons as Gruff K-9. The voice casting works very well, Marsden making a likable dog hero, and Midler indeed nearly stealing the show as the devilishly raspy voiced villain cat, and the computer animation is certainly improved. I think besides these two attributes, what has improved is the story, taking a lot of ideas from James Bond, and of course spoofing the films, casting Moore as the feline M was a great idea, and there are also some actually really funny spoofs of The Silence of the Lambs, The Fly, The Terminator and Batman, so a much better part-animated comedy fantasy sequel.

For a second there, I also think there was too much CGI, I know it's inevitable in films nowadays, but when it's so easy to distinguish shots, geeze, it's like watching a cartoon movie.Now, Diggs, always blowing up the operation, is an exhausting resource here, it reminds me of Eddie Murphy in I spy... it's simply too stupid to be funny...

Perhaps it should be humans, dogs and cats against stupid scripts such as the one that became this idiotic film. It is every bit as stupid as its prequel with special effects that are still about as fetching as dog snot. Director Brad Peyton fares okay with the unexplained nature of these agent pets but that is where the central problem lies. Imaginations can only be elevated so far but this film tests the boundaries. James Marsden voices the police dog retrieved from the kennel whose future is brighter than the film. We can sense early that his screw up days will be reversed. Christina Applegate voices an agent cat on the good side. She is afraid of water but ultimately befriends the dog. Seeing that many households contain both species, it is amusing that these films oppose the two like a hand down clich\u00e9. Nick Nolte voices the cardboard dog Butch who is fed up with the new arrival but will be proved wrong because plot twists are beyond the talent working on this story. Bette Midler voices the scheming Kitty whose owner is a magician. Midler is an inspiring choice for the voice but she can and has done better. Katt Williams voices a dimwitted carrier pigeon who managed to fly into the wrong movie to further the idiocy. It makes no sense and should be buried in the backyard underneath a ton of dog crap.

I did not expect the sequel to be that good, because it is released around 9 years after the original; all the fans are grown up, and the new generation have moved onto different things. I prefer animations (usually!), and because it was a sequel to a childhood favourite, I decided to give it a go, for nostalgic reasons, and for love of dogs! (I like cats, too hahaha :D).The movie brings back original characters; Lou the beagle (Neil Patrick Harris), Butch the Anatolian Shepherd Dog (Nick Nolte), Shep the Old English Sheepdog (Michael Clark Duncan), Peek the Chinese Crested (can't remember his voice actor), and even a cameo of Mr.Tinkles the Persian cat! (Sean Hayes). Lou, despite the different actor, still sounded somewhat like himself, and even though his character changed A lot, he was still a good supporting character. I was disappointed by his change of character, simply because it disregards his role in the first film almost completely. It does, however, add a certain level of maturity to Lou. Butch's voice actor sounds older that Alec Baldwin, however, this shows his maturity and how the film is clearly set a few years after the first. Diggs (James Mardsen) the German Shepherd/Alsatian, is a great character, and does bring colour and humour to the film, as well as a level of humanity; what I mean is, it shows the dog having problems, which the audience can relate to, much like Butch in the original. Catherine (Christina Applegate) is another great addition, and the chemistry between her and Diggs as characters, no matter how clich\u00e9, is believable and humorous. Kitty Galore (a Sphynx Cat) is very well animated, and voiced fantastically by Bette Midler. She is a typical villaness, and is wonderful!The story, in my opinion, is bland. I understand Kitty's turmoil and want of revenge, but to enslave all mankind? C'mon Kitty, everybody has ups and downs, don't ya think you're overracting a bit? Just my two cents. At least Tinkles wanted to obliterate dog kind (in some sense) so cats will become \"Top Dog\" again. All cats were besmirched in C&D~#1, in Kitty Galore, why could she not seek revenge on that one dog? Or her family? What do you think?The action is plentyful, the CGI brilliant. The puppets were kind of stupid, and removed whatever smoothness one can find within the film. The whole cats and dogs working together is a good message for kids, showing you should overlook your differences etc in the face of adversity, to help one other out and build a bond.The humour, no matter how over done, is funny, especially the cats on 'nip! Some is cringeworthy, though.Finally; Seamus, the pigeon. I did not like him at all. He, in my opinion, added nothing to the story, even though he was meant to, and he annoyed me for the most part.Overall, if you are a die hard fan of the original, don't expect too much. The Brady's are never mentioned, and the only reference is the recurring characters. It is, however, a fun and enjoyable film, but mainly for the kiddies due to the humour in question.5/10.(my first review!!!)",

I would much rather watch his stand up than waste money on this movie. I don't think this would be a good kids movie either since it is based on the Bond series.

A reckless German Shepherd police dog named Diggs is soon recruited by Lou and Butch to help them bring down an evil cat named Kitty Galore. Kitty plans on releasing a sound that only dogs can hear and will turn them crazy and attack their master. Diggs and Butch are forced to team up with a pigeon named Seamus, and a cat named Catherine in order to stop Kitty. They even become so desperate that they seek the help of Mr. Tinkles. I would probably recommend CATS & DOGS: THE REVENGE OF KITTY GALORE!!!",

            "content": "I saw the prequel to this, Cats & Dogs (2001), a few years ago and, although I didn't agree with the sentiments expressed in the film, I kind of liked the way it was done. When this one came up on TV I decided to see if they had made any improvements in the intervening years. Well, I suppose technically, the CGI has improved, but the storytelling most certainly hasn't! Here's a brief summary before I really rip into it\u0085 I mean, give you my considered opinion.Kitty Galore is a bad cat, so bad that she wants to take over the world\u0085 Of course the dogs won't stand for this. And, so it turns out, neither will the cats. For the dogs, there's a new recruit, Diggs, a former police dog who has a problem following orders. He is partnered with Butch, a veteran agent who really knows the ropes. In their search for Kitty they find a pigeon, Seamus, who holds the key to catching her. They also find another agent, a cat called Catherine whose boss, Tab Lazenby, agrees to work together with the dogs in order to foil Kitty's evil plan. As they close in on her she begins to put her plan into effect\u0085 Will they get to her on time? I guess that's all I can say or my cats will probably do something nasty to me.First of all, the effects and the CGI were all done pretty well, but, at times, looked a bit too overdone. The voices of the main characters were provided by; James Marsden as Diggs, Nick Nolte as Butch, Christina Applegate as Catherine, Katt Williams as Seamus, Bette Midler as Kitty Galore and Roger Moore as Tab Lazenby. All were competent, but I guess it's hard to give a stellar performance in a film like this.It all started so well with James Bond style opening credits and even Shirley Bassey singing the song. Unfortunately, it went downhill from here. I know I'm not really the target audience, but I don't think even the kids will like this one much. It's almost like the writers were trying to be too clever, rather than relying on the things that work in a kid's film\u0085 visual gags. I was quite glad it wasn't a particularly long film and by the end I was glad it was over. Unfortunately, not recommended.My Score: 3.8/10 IMDb Score: 3.6/10 (4,096 votes when this review was written). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 13/100 (93 reviews counted when this review was written).",

On opening night it was a replacement for her running out of Sorcerer's Apprentice, on which she ran out (spoiler) after seeing the villain made out of cockroaches. (This for someone who likes playing with live insects, gently enough to catch a bee in her fingertips.) Oddly, both nights had about the same theatre audiences, very light. I did not see anybody run out of the theatre, as some of the one star reviewers have noted.I did not see the first one (unlike several of the one star reviewers, who seem to love *that* one and hate this one for not being the original). The Bond references start from the villain's name in the title, upon which Jay Leno does a routine which is likely based on personal experience. If you know which Bond flick involves a red Mercury Cougar, you'll do fine... :)The numerous external movies references keep the adults awake (if you care). The not so cute animals add reality. (Spoiler: The cute puppy some of the one star reviewers want is a disguise for Kitty Galore - so there! :) )In animal treatment obsessed San Francisco, I guess they had to give some Peta bread... :) Other than a flavored iMac, the product placements are kept to a minimum (a Moto phone, too). The San Francisco Bay Area location selections are interesting (and may have been a source of ire to the one star folks) (Spoiler) The only one that came from pure cloth was Playland at the Beach, which has been gone for almost four decades, plus never existed in the form depicted in the movie. (Spoiler) The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk currently has the same model of attraction as used in the movie (next to the Rock and Roll cars), except their operational one has many old photos of the Boardwalk.With the number of one and two star reviews, I would expect a piece of cow manure I would never own. Instead, just as noted in the SFGate review (which the low reviewers will probably hate), I found a decent movie the family (including our rescue cat) can sit down and enjoy.P.S. Kudos to the staff of the Century Tanforan who were willing to switch us out of the Sorcerer's Apprentice to this movie at no cost.P.S.S. I don't see in the trivia whether some of the animals were rescue animals. I'm curious to find out.",

Cats and Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore is a achievement. Not a good achievement though, a bad achievement. It could possibly be the worst movie ever made. Everything wrong with this movie begins at the credits. The credits rip off Goldeneye, the first Pierce Bronson 007 film. Nothing could save this movie after. The story is so bad it has to borrow every single clich\u00e9 ever made. The story is about a Cat who wants everyone to love cats and hate dogs. A agency of Dogs works with Cats with a new recruit and a cat and a pigeon.The casting by Zack Snyder's secret lover Kristy Carlson (If you do not get this, she basically casts every movie he makes) is awful. Waste of Good talent Like Katt Williams who is really funny in the parody movies I watch is the mind blowing annoying pigeon who never shuts up. Robin from Batman Forever is there and he is just plain bad. Bette Midler who has better things to do is stuck as the villain in this movie.The story as I said has a clich\u00e9 around nearly every corner. Basically they make a movie out of clich\u00e9s.The characters are abysmal. I told you Katt Williams shouldn't be in it but there are plenty of horribly crafted characters. The humans feel like aliens from another planet instead of real characters. There are many racist and plain stereotypes you see in every other movie every day.The music is not good either, it wasn't exciting at all.There are so many plot holes I could not count them all. One involves the animals talking to a human which begs the question wouldn't that danger their whole entire agency? The thing that made me mad the most (well, one of the things) is that they misplaced Playland in the U.S. I started screaming and swearing so much I couldn't stop.There are scenes where they rip off stuff from many movies like Silence of The Lambs and other James Bond films and Get Smart.The effects... there is no way to describe them. They are just some of the worst I have ever seen. HIdeous. Just Hideous.I don't want to sound rude or mean or arrogant or anything, but don't like this movie. I know you have your opinions which I do respect but Just don't like this movie. This movie is the worst. Nothing can beat this film's awfulness.Cats And Dogs 2 is not a movie, It is a clich\u00e9.

The cats and dogs are cute, and I can see young children liking them much. As for action, it is some simple stuff involving animals falling or fighting with each other, so there is nothing majorly exciting. As for humour, the only scene that may evoke a smile is the Hannibal Lector impersonation. Other scenes, or actually the whole film, is simply dull and uninteresting for adults. And I do not like the way it paves way for a sequel, as it suddenly brings back a villain from nowhere so that there has to be another fight to keep humans safe. It is so contrived, it does not pave way for a sequel, it feels more like putting the beginning of the sequel into the end of this film.",

            "content": "Saw this movie today for the first time (on Hub, a DISH channel) and I was amazed at the great FX, slick set designs, and witty dialog. I'm puzzled by all the negative IMDb reviews and message board comments. The action is great, the dialog is often very funny, and the acting of the dogs and cats (both the trained animals and their CGI-counterparts) was consistently good.Teaming up a cat, two dogs, and bird-brained fast-talking pigeon with a busted wing was a fine idea. It generated clever dialog and heroic deeds, like an aqua-phobic cat rescuing her dog partner by diving into a tank of water.The villains are great, too. Kitty Galore (the voice of Bette Midler) is a hairless cat like Dr. Evil's pet in \"Austin Powers\" -- with her own pet, a tiny terrified mouse. I also enjoyed the hulking henchmen-cat with steel teeth called \"Paws\" (with kind regards to Richard Kiel).* * * * * * Spoiler Alert * * * * * * Paws had a trick up his sleeve I did not see coming. In the climax he ripped off his fur to reveal himself to be a robot-cat -- and delivered a line in Arnold's voice!The music is terrific -- rich, rousing, and very much in the grand tradition of James Bond movies. Composer Christopher Lennertz did a bang-up job. And he got in his fair share of musical jokes as well, such as the subtle Superman-like music when the pigeon shows up in time to fling off the cast on his busted wing and shout, \"It's a bird! It's plane! Actually, you had it right the first time.\"I think the reason some folks didn't like this movie is because it delivers the clever dialog and the great action at such a fast pace that some of the good stuff goes whipping past the audience before they know it. I had to run a few scenes back to catch it all, like when the hero falls down a chute and shouts, \"Oh . . . my . . . Dog!\" Subtle but clever.Listen for an announcement on the PA in the super-spy secret headquarters. \"Today's seminar: Harassment in the work place. Remember, Doberman -- do not pincher.\" This movie is obviously the work of talented, hard-working people who invested time and money in an effort to make a very enjoyable family movie. Seems a shame their reward was the loss of over $40,000,000. That doesn't exactly encourage Hollywood to green light imaginative, big-budget productions.",

Overall the story moves much faster, is loaded with more laughs and the SFX are cleaner and better. All the major players from the first one are back, but that doesn't mean you need to see the first one to enjoy part 2. The new hero introduced is a German Shepard named Diggs that is a police dog in a funny and inspired opening. After Diggs disregards his police human master and blows up a used car lot Diggs is Jailed so to speak. Enter the dogs from part 1. From there the jokes are fast and furious, some hitting home and some missing, but overall, I had a smile on my face the whole time, and my eleven year old loved every minute. There is another new edition to the crew a pigeon picked up mid way through the movie that is down right hilarious. The voice work is well done, and in one truly inspired moment Mr. Tinkles the main villain from part 1 shows up to do a gut busting scene taken straight from Silence of the Lambs. It's at this moment you will groan or laugh in spite of yourself and truly feel the movie is worth your dollars. All in all an excellent family film that will have kids enjoying themselves and enough stuff to keeps the parents entertained. Note I saw the 3D version and truly nothing is really added from the effect, though the picture is clean and vibrant.",

That there was a 3D-animation/3D-projection Roadrunner short before it finally tipped the scales towards going.And I'm not sorry. It's not a very smart movie and the dialog is quite simple (OK, the dove character and some of the supporting cast is plain boring), but it worked great as a family movie: the kids (specially the 4 years one, who loved \"Toy Story 3\") liked the plot and followed it quite all the time without need of much explaining, and the parents liked the sometimes blatant, sometimes more silently reference to movies and sagas, from Bond's (it's really Shirley Bassey at the opening credits!) to \"Die Hard\", \"Lethal Weapon\", \"Men in Black\" or even Burton's \"Batman\". The middle part was a bit slow (both in the CGI an plot advancement departments) and the main character development was scarce, by any means; much more interesting was his kitty companion and the misadventures of both the villain and his mouse.All in all, recommended as a light family film or as a cop & spy spoof (if you want the spoof not to be as offensive to the original material as the Scary/Date/Disaster/Superhero Movie sagas.",

Although \"Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" never quite gives \"Austin Powers\" a run for its money, as far as James Bond send-ups go, this unwarranted sequel is reasonably smart, especially when you consider it's primarily an exercise in talking animals, the most dreaded of all children movie subgenres. Nevertheless, the film has a brain, albeit a pigeon's brain, the size of a pea, as evidenced by the scene where a cat rides a motorcycle, a cat incognito, lodged inside a human dummy. In a lesser talking animals movie, the filmmaker wouldn't bother to acknowledge how people may react to the miracle of a kitty on two wheels. At Alcatraz, however, rather than have a cat mimic Hannibal Lecter, in yet another tired \"Silence of the Lambs\" parody, why not mimic the Zodiac killer instead, since the island prison is off the coast of San Francisco? In this alternative universe, cat and dog technology is clearly ahead of our technology, so the same should be true for canine and feline law enforcement. The animals could bitch and moan about how David Fincher got it all wrong. As for Kitty Galore(a chi chi voiced superbly by Bette Midler), her plan to turn the humans against the dogs sidesteps her real grudge, which is the humans themselves. The popular belief that dogs need human companionship more than cats could've been explored, as man's best friend, once again, would have to save the city from the Zodiac killer, a cat. Kitty Galore's hench-cat looks demented enough to play the part, but due to the constraints of a children's movie, the violence is tempered, limited to knives stuck in a stuffed toy, as the chi chi obviously doesn't need her human owner, a magician(played by Jack McBrayer).\"Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\" eventually runs out of inspiration(there is the occasional funny line interspersed throughout the otherwise routine screenplay), and resorts to ripping off Barry Sonnenfeld's \"Men in Black\".",
