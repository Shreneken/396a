            "content": "This could be the worst movie ever made. Certainly its the worst I've seen in a very long time. Now, before I begin I have to say that I'm not a fan of the series to begin with. It had its moments, but as a lifelong resident of Manhattan I mostly blamed the series for the unbearable influx of wide-eyed moronic girls from all over the country who flocked to the city en masse, thinking that upon arrival their lives would instantly revolve around cosmopolitans, rich men and $1000 shoes, and who very quickly became insufferable basket cases once the reality of city life actually set in on them. Of course, I saw this movie with my girlfriend, as my good deed for the week. What I was not prepared for was how horrible it actually was. The first ten minutes contained more clich\u00e9, stinted dialog, corny jokes and general awkwardness than I had previously thought possible in such a short time frame. It was embarrassing. It also involved Liza Minelli. I thought it couldn't get worse, but oh did it ever. Next came the foundation for the entire film, which was that the ladies were in a funk and needed to get away for a couple of weeks. The funny thing about that is how they all have impossibly great lives, especially by NYC standards. They live in massive apartments, have high-paying careers, plenty of money and for everyone but Samantha, loving husbands and families. And its not like there was some substantial existential crisis underpinning their dissatisfaction to legitimize their feelings and generate sympathy on behalf of the audience. It all amounted to 'Boohoooo we used to partyyyy all the time but now we're all grownups waaa pity us'. Literally, that was it. Sorry, I don't feel bad for you guys. So Carrie starts a whole big fight with her husband because he doesn't feel like going out to some stupid party after working into the evening and providing her with a lifestyle that includes what appears to be a $15 million apartment, two luxury cars, an unlimited decorating budget, a truly massive closet with hundreds of thousands of dollars in clothes, enough leisure time to write her stupid books AND her old apartment to write them in. Then he had the NERVE to not buy her jewelry for their anniversary (she actually said that). It was completely effing nauseating.The rest of the women's 'problems' were no better. Charlotte has kids who drive her crazy. Really groundbreaking stuff there. Especially since she too lives in a multimillion dollar apartment with a full time live-in nanny and housekeeper. Pathetic. Miranda has a new boss who doesn't like her very much, OBVIOUSLY because she's a woman, duh. There's no other reason for a boss to not like a subordinate other than their gender, clearly. And finally, Samantha is old and needs to take hormones for menopause now, stop the presses. Is your heart bleeding for them yet? No? You must hate women, you sexist. Moving right along. Samantha somehow is a mega-PR agent at this point (in Times Square??), despite the fact that I've literally never seen her do any work resembling PR (and I know lots of PR people). She meets some sheik at a party who simply MUST have her work that imaginary PR magic on behalf of his new hotel, and as a perk of this great new account, conveniently gets the girls invited to Abu Dhabi. Hooray! Their dreary despair comes to an end as they're flown ultra-first-class to the glamorous 'new' middle-east, shuttled to the luxury hotel in individual Maybach limousines (one for each of them!) and given two weeks all-expenses-paid in the hotel's premier $22,000/night penthouse suite, because that is totally standard treatment for PR flacks. Naturally. All is well in this paradise for like a week, until the icky middle-eastern customs of female oppression begin to rear their ugly head and Samantha is inevitably arrested for being a giant whore and having sex on the beach with some Dutch dude, at which point they're politely informed that Samantha's PR expertise would not be needed after all, and that they'd be personally responsible for another night of hotel charges unless they vacated the hotel in one hour. So now these four extremely wealthy women proceed to freak the hell out because if they don't hurry they may be liable for (gasp!) $5,500 each to cover the suite. Makes perfect sense to me too. Never mind that they're millionaires, particularly Carrie, whose couch alone in her living room is worth upwards of $30,000. Never mind that they could have also asked to be moved into regular rooms for the night so they could leave at a normal pace the next day. But on the other hand, if they had been logical, we wouldn't have been treated to a madcap scene of the girls packing and then inexplicably getting into trouble at the local bazaar (again related to Samantha's inability to keep her clothes on), followed by a quasi-insulting scene of burqa-clad women revealing designer clothes under their robes and reading a Susanne Sommers menopause book, for some reason. Ultimately they make their way to the airport in a horrible little gypsy cab (because between the four of them they couldn't afford a limo of their own too?), and before you know it, they're off to America again. Oh and Carrie hooked up with her ex boyfriend at some point in there and told her husband about it for no good reason. Predictably, they get home and everyone is as introspective as they're capable of (not very much at all), and they realize how wonderful their lives really are (no they don't). The end.Now you don't need to see the movie. You're welcome.",

That was bad. This one...even worse. The characters have become utterly superficial, materialistic (in a way that's practically nauseating given the current state of the economy) - and completely 2 dimensional. The writing - cartoony and juvenile. Honestly, Carrie's the worst - the way the character acted in the film, I would personally have recommended that Mr. Big file for divorce. (Complaining because he wants to stay home and watch movies together, then forcing him to leave a party--that she dragged him to--early because he had a conversation with another woman?) Jeez.As for Samantha - that character's gone completely over the top - sex crazed in a way that went way past racy and into plain vulgar. Combine that with the incongruity of throwing the characters into a completely unrealistic situation (heading to Abu Dahbi?), and then disrespect that they show to Arab culture....well, this movie COULD NOT have been worse. Thank goodness that there's no way they'll make STC3. At least, I really, really hope not. How this ever could have been green lighted for production is totally beyond my comprehension.",

            "review_title": "Carrie On to See a Different Film",
            "content": "The popular TV series Sex and the City has ran from 1998 - 2004, spawned a movie adaptation of the series in 2008, and here's the sequel that will most likely bring it to a close in 2010. At this point, the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly, but after this movie, my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.To begin with, the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel, but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time, though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist, stereotypical jokes about homosexuals, Jewish people, and Middle Eastern people as well. I'm sure if Prince of Persia didn't steal the subtitle, The Sands of Time, it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.The plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie (Parker) wants more \"sparkle\" with her man \"Big\", Charlotte (Davis) has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny (Eve) is getting too close to her husband, Miranda (Nixon) is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be, and Samantha (Cattrall) is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed, Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical, and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.Its sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap, but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this, it's better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long, but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun, intelligent talks. In this sequel, an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment, no talk is perfect in this film.Overall, the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big, but with a big name like Sex and the City, it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics \"Best of the year\" list. Instead it makes the \"Worst of the year\" list and probably will earn the title \"The worst film of the year\" by most critics. Wouldn't surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Alice Eve, Chris Noth, John Corbett, David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lewis, Lynn Cohen, and Liza Minnelli.",

            "content": "My sister and I were so excited about going to this movie. With the recession, the loss of jobs and general pessimism of late - the thought of dressing up, drinking cocktails and watching a great movie in the company of a whole room full of women like us was excellent. We desperately wanted to love the movie.Initially, everyone seemed to be in good form \u2013 a bit of a cheer when Mr. Big came on screen; gasps and giggles in response to the first few jokes\u0085.then uncomfortable silence. My sister squirmed in the seat beside me through the horrible 'I am woman' song. Having visited the Middle East myself (and enjoyed the cultural experience and friendly people; albeit with a different outlook on life) I was pretty appalled at the blatant lack of propriety exercised by the four.I have to admit when the movie ended, all the women around me turned to each other and said it was 'great' \u2013 I don't think we were ready to admit that it was possibly the biggest disappointment ever. My sister and I had planned to talk about the outfits and scenarios after\u0085we completely avoided the topic. We had all looked forward to this movie \u2013 we couldn't admit to ourselves (never mind anyone else) that it was awful.To say I loved the original show is an understatement. As I enter my late twenties/early thirties, the reruns are even more relevant. The characters in the show discussed sexuality in a fresh, exciting way. They were women you could look up to \u2013 intelligent, confident, self-assured. They bear zero resemblance to the four self-indulgent, disrespectful, two dimensional creatures I had to watch.I doubt any fan will take my advice and not go \u2013 I would have ignored it myself. The movie seems to symbolise everything that has gone wrong lately \u2013 by blindly pursuing materialism we lose what's really important. This movie spells that out \u2013 and leaves you feeling ashamed for having loved them so much in the first place. Having said that, I watched an episode in the series a night later and realised that, actually, I'm not an idiot \u2013 they used to discuss interesting, relevant issues \u2013 just in fabulous clothes.As an aside, I spent an hour with my sister getting all dressed up to go, two hours chatting to her before we watched the horror show and four hours after dancing our socks off. Maybe the fact that was the best part means I have my priorities right after all.",

            "content": "In 1998, the series \"Sex and the City\" was a worldwide entertainment for men and women and for the next six years, the lives of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte made part of my life. In 2008, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis released the disappointing feature and they should have stopped with the revival of the four New Yorkers of thirty and something years old.Unfortunately money seems to be more important than self-respect, and the quartet returns in the awful \"Sex and the City 2\". The writer of these shallow and futile adventures of four dysfunctional Americans in Abu Dhabi seems to have the mind of a thirteen year-old boy, with stupid jokes and low-level dialogs. He seems to be interested in pleasing the gay communities and might have earned some money for the free merchandising. Sarah Jessica Parker lost her charming style and now looks like an anorexic with bad taste, wearing dreadful clothing. Her infantile behavior after kissing her ex-boyfriend is probably the most ridiculous moment of the story for a forty and something years old woman. Kim Cattrall's character Samantha deserves pity for her attempt to behave like nymphomaniac low-life slut. Charlotte seems to have Cinderella's Complex and Miranda is the only character that deserves some respect. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): \"Sex and the City 2\"",

            "content": "I'm an English person of no religious faith at all, but the way this film treats Islamic culture is so deeply offensive I literally couldn't watch at points. The four characters we have learnt to love over the series are made to be characters I literally despise in this hideously misguided sequel. They come across as ignorant, brash and horrible tourists who flagrantly disregard Islamic modesty laws while on holiday in Abu Dhabi and show little respect or courtesy in a foreign land. The scene where Samantha goes insane and starts throwing condoms at braying men is particularly embarrassing, followed by the girls rescue by a group of women in burkhas who then whip them off to reveal designer clothes beneath. The film doesn't set to dispel any myths about Middle Eastern culture, instead it actively enforces these stereotypes and makes them seem laughable and stupid, and worse encourages them to be disregarded and mocked by Western audiences. We are never given a sense of what Aby Dhabi is actually like; like stupid American tourists the girls spend little time outside of their luxury five star hotel and when they do eventually leave the Moroccan souk they visit couldn't look more like a studio set if it tried. The girls walk around with bare arms and legs as if this would have no repercussions in an Islamic country; the sad reality is this behaviour would see them swamped with lecherous men as happened to my friends during a visit to Morocco.What makes everything worse is the way the characters have been turned into grotesque parodies of their formers selves. Before the love of clothes of materialism was balanced by a sense of friendship; now the girls have simply become rich, ungrateful, moaning middle aged annoyances. Their gratuitous love of wealth is pathetic and stupid and the comparison of Carrie having to spend time away from Big when directly compared to an Indian hotel worker being forced to spend time away from his wife is insensitive. Charlotte struggling to look after two children when she is a stay at home mum with a full time nanny is also extremely insensitive seeing as she has it so easy.A horrible film that ruined the heartfelt and intelligent series. Complete and utter horror was my only reaction.",

This movie has little to offer except constantly changing 'bizarre' costuming presented as high fashion and thoroughly embarrassing 'ugly American' scenes of over-indulged, entitled and rudely written characters. I went to the theater to enjoy a fun movie. I came away shaking my head. The movie was disrespectful to me as an American woman. Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country, the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it. Unfortunately, the general public is judged by Hollywood--the American delivery system. It's not worth the money to see it. If you can get it on DVD for a buck, then judge for yourself.",

            "review_title": "Gaudy, superficial, tasteless, overlong, offensive, and full of missed potential and bad ideas",
            "content": "I watched the first film as someone who had only ever casually watched the show and didn't really care to do more than that. The first film didn't get the wit of the show but did try to have a bit of substance to it in some regards, even if it didn't work. The second film feels like someone has taken the decision that this should be more of an \"event\" than a film so instead of worrying too much about story and characters, what we should have is just an endless OTT parade of wealth. Very much like the wedding that opens it, the film is constantly excessive, gaudy and unnecessary. Some will love it for this as some sort of guilty pleasure but I'm not sure if it is what fans or casual viewers will warm to.My understanding of the show was that, while it did have the wealthy and free of the NYC fashion world as its main characters, it did keep itself connected to reality for the majority of viewers so that, while some of it was big city fantasy, it did still have a realism and wit in regards friendships and relationships that viewers could relate to. There is none of that in this film, instead the characters (themselves living in comfort and wealth) are granted access to a world of extreme luxury that takes them far from reality and makes them pretty unlikeable and patronising for the majority of the time. In terms of plot there is not a lot going on. Each character has their own little thread and mostly they amount to very little since the majority of the time is spent with them enjoying their luxury. There are some smaller moments of potential (Miranda and Charlotte being honest about motherhood with one another) that are good but they are lost in the luxury and the long run time as our characters just run from one glamorous location to another.Anything that is close to a plot is handled badly whether it be a device or a relationship theme. The loss of Carrie's passport is \"put out there\" in the middle of the film only to be resolved within seconds and used for a terribly pointless conclusion. Her relationship quandary (about not seeing her husband a few days a week) is nonsense (since she has issues with it the day before jetting off for weeks) and is also discussed in the most patronising way, with Carrie drawing from the example of her private butler having joy in only seeing his wife once a month (missing that he can only do this because he has to work all the time, serving people like Carrie, as opposed to it being a relationship choice). The thing about the nanny goes nowhere and is resolved with a piece of throwaway titillation (excuse the pun) that is as vapid as the character.Although the majority of viewers will not be offended by it, it has to be said that SaTC2 is an incredibly insensitive film considering where it was made. In principle I have no issue with the \"these women are just like us\" message but when it is made in as clunky and unrealistic manner as it is in this film then it is hard not to scoff at it. Likewise the constant suggestion that the women of the Middle East are oppressed is badly done and only made worse by having Western \"liberation\" \"celebrated\" by having Samantha wearing a revealing outfit, simulate sexual intercourse in a crowd of men heading to morning prayers \u2013 I'm really not sure what part of that scene was not designed to cause religious offense.The cast go with it but outside of the brief moments some of them get to be characters (eg discussing motherhood) none of them do anything of note. Much has been said of Parker's looks that is unfair and irrelevant to the film \u2013 her job as an actress is not to physically appeal to the viewer. However, it is hard to overlook this aspect when the film spends so much time troweling her in makeup to the point where she looks ridiculous. Her narration musings are so superficial that her delivery only sounds the same. Cattrall tries to be the Samantha she always was but it doesn't work and the material misses the chance to do anything smart or progressive with her; she is also hurt by having the lions' share of the culturally and religiously insensitive material and having to sell it as her being \"right\". Davis and Nixon have even less to do than these two, which is a shame because they both come over as the more natural and realistic of the four. The male cast are again mostly plot devices, although I thought that Noth's Big was a better character than normal \u2013 although maybe I just felt sorry for his situation here? SaTC2 doesn't have the decency to be a car-crash of a film, the sort of thing that you watch aghast, but nor is it any good whatsoever. It is gaudy, superficial, overlong, offensive, and full of missed potential and bad ideas. Removed from the City of the title and placed into a world of extreme opulence the film also pushes the fantasy so far that it prevents any meaningful connection for the casual viewer (which the show used to be able to do). I doubt that even fans of the show will be happy with this film.",

            "content": "I don't even know where to begin because this movie is so awful but let's start with the plot shall we? Carrie and Co. are so exhausted from their spoiled lives that they decide to have a girls vacation (all expense paid of course) by way of Samantha's business agenda. Where does this vacation take place? Why the only place where girls aren't allowed to show an ounce of skin, speak without permission, and wear burka's: AKA the Middle East.There, the ladies insist on acting like spoiled brats, which they can't help considering that's exactly what they are. But let's consider what makes these women want to take a vacation.1. Carrie is getting away from her terrible husband of 2 years who buys her TV's instead of jewelry, wants to come home and relax after a hard day while she wants to party like she's 20 instead of 45, eat Chinese food rather than go to some pricey restaurant, and lets her keep her apartment in order for her to \"get away\" from the pressures of her horrible life. Oh and he's so horrible that he decides to make her happy and go out anyway even though he's tired.2. Samantha is aching for some new male attention after sleeping with the entire east coast and looking to expand her client\u00e8le (the one that pays for her services with actual cash rather than nature's credit card).3. Miranda needs to get away from her loving, attentive, and adoring husband and their child that she never sees, her boss who is sexist (of course), her terrible job that pays for her wonderful home, and her terrible nanny that takes care of her sick mother in law, child, and the house.4. Ah Charlotte. We all know she's had it very rough over the past eight years in the course of the series and these 2 movies: her never ending trust fund, her Upper East Side (or one of those fancy places) apartment, her perfect husband that loves her more than the air he breathes, her two children that she wanted more than anything, and of course, her full time live in nanny. After a breakdown from having so much stress of this terrible life while baking cookies, Charlotte decides that her life is just *too* stressful with a perfect husband, full time nanny and all the time to herself to drink with her friends.Yes indeed, these women have it ROUGH. I'm surprised they haven't complained to the government about the unfair turn of events their lives have taken. How dare those husbands give them everything and love them so much! How dare those hardworking husbands want to relax instead of reliving their youth! To alleviate their dreadful lives, they go to Abu Dabhi...because that's the Las Vegas section of the Middle East you see. Only, it's not.Their perfect vacation goes awry when they learn that skimpy outfits, particularly midriff baring tops and fluffy skirts aren't considered cute especially on a middle aged woman. And who knew that having sex in public was against the law? Apparently not Samantha - she thought it was oppressive and sexist. So what does she do? She wears tiny outfits and yells \"I HAVE SEX!\" in the middle of a market place while humping the air.I know, I know. Classy.In the end, the ladies are kicked out for the lack of respect for another culture. Shocker right there. Oh! But not before Carrie conveniently runs into Aiden and kisses him because we all know that she needs drama to survive (we have six seasons and another movie as evidence). However, that lapse of judgment could be because she had an \"argument\" which Charlotte about something.Now, this is the point where Miranda and Charlotte have a toast and bitch about their horrible lives with those pesty full time nannies. Keep in mind that Charlotte has no job and doesn't need one.Samantha of course is trying to give a guy - who she barely knows - a hand job in the middle of dinner. She's then arrested and that brings us to when the girls are kicked out and Sam has her meltdown in the middle of a marketplace.Somewhere between the bitching and non needed drama and the boredom is a lot of clothes changing that remind me why middle aged women should stop wearing clothes made for 20 yr olds.I was a fan of the series, although looking at it now I'm not even sure why I am. The characters are selfish, materialistic, and spoiled; this film amplifies those characteristics to the point where I am genuinely embarrassed for the cast and crew of this...thing.Are we supposed to feel sorry for these characters or something? Because all I felt was absolute disgust. These women have *everything*: full time nannies, husbands who love and worship them, wardrobes that cost more than a house, houses that cost more than country, jobs that earn them more in one week than I do in a year, and children who love them.No wonder why foreigners have such a bad opinion of Americans! These women are so disrespectful and it's infuriating to see. How could anyone even be allowed to produce such a stupid movie? I'm not even talking about the \"so over the top even Liberace would be embarrassed\" gay wedding and a random but painful rendition of Single Ladies by Liza Minnelli (seriously, what is this? The \"We pity over 40 yr old women\" movie?).Just...bad. It's almost traumatic to see.",

The plot of the movie is non-existent. It all looks like a really long compilation of advertorials with not much connection between the scenes. And I am not speaking about the horrible inappropriate styling and the so-old looking women - it would be fine, if they at least were styled and made up properly: Carrie has this weird tan, looks about 10 years older than she actually is and has none of the coolness that made her so likable. Charlotte is losing it and in spite of all the makeup, looks tired and has totally lost her perky personality. Not only Samantha also looks much older than she is thanks to the terrible makeup, but her behavior is erratic and really not consistent with what has been shown in the series. The only one who was more or less OK was Miranda. And don't get me started on the Abu Dhabi stint - the Middle-Eastern country is ridiculed, wrongly portrayed and I frankly think that it is shown in a racist manner. It's a shame, really, that they have taken a social phenomenon and turned it into a shameful mess. I will choose to ignore this movie, pretend I never saw it and keep on watching the series.",

            "content": "After seeing the first Sex and the City movie, and finding it OKAY, I decided to take a stab at the second film. I am a huge fan of the HBO series, so i was naturally excited...THE GOOD: Yes, there were some funny moments, and some nice things to look at (clothes, design, men). I liked most of the music choices, and I did enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of the film because it seemed as though it would be building up to something interesting, but just these few things alone could not have made a good enough movie for one of the best shows to ever air on television. THE BAD: This movie had a lot of downfalls. Lets start with the plot (or lack there of). The audience was treated to four women that constantly complained about their \"problems\". I am not saying that their issues were not legitimate to regular women, but they did not present these issues in a way that would create an interesting plot..they were just seemingly simple problems that were over dramatized and annoying to listen to (lackluster marriage, boring job, declining hormones, having children...) In the middle of these \"problems\" we get to see how rich they are with their maids/nannys, change of expensive clothes every 4 minutes and fancy homes. All these things made it hard to sympathize with them. Yes, in the show we saw their lavish lifestyle, but this film was rubbing it in the audience's face, and it was a main part of the \"storyline\" when it really shouldn't have been. (plus, a lot of the clothing choices were NOT good) It seemed as though they threw in the idea of going to Abu Dhabi just to make things interesting, but it just made things worse. I felt as though there was a mocking/ undermining quality to the way they portrayed middle eastern customs... But more importantly (to me) is the fact that when i think of the show and its title \"Sex in the CITY\" I think of that city as NYC, NOT Abu Dhabi (really, what were they thinking?) Overall, i felt like this was a poorly executed film that had little resemblance to the show... I feel cheated.",

            "content": "A lot of people exercise their brains with puzzles found in the newspaper. Sudoku is a prime example. The variety published by a typical paper can usually be solved in less than 5 minutes, or at least that's been my experience with them. The goal for me was to grab an issue of The Kansan, take a seat in class, and have the Sudoku finished before learning was to commence. I didn't have class every day, so when I didn't need the Sudoku I kept the paper. A small pile sits next to me as I type this review. I never got to working a single puzzle after graduating; I found that writing and talking about movies was a more suitable exercise for me. It seems that the worse the movie in question, the more mistakes there are to find. For that reason alone, Sex and the City 2 is a good brain teaser.The adventure begins when Carrie Preston (Sarah Jessica Parker) and friends Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) attending the wedding of their best gay friends. Since this is based on a long running TV series, I'm sure fans of the show found more significance to the scene than I did. In my eyes it was the most logical way to present Liza Minnelli as herself singing Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies\". It's a scene that can't be unseen, and I knew instantly that it would haunt me for the rest of the summer. Everyone at the wedding makes Carrie feel bored with her life now that she's settled down with Mr. Big (Chris Noth). The most bizarre way this is accomplished is by having a random couple tell them they will be lonely if they don't have children. Then wouldn't you know it, something ridiculous happens and the girls get flown to Abu Dhabi where they are treated like royalty all because some sheik wants Samantha work a PR campaign for his property. But don't worry, our leading ladies forget about any logical objective and proceed to flaunt what they got in the desert.I realize this movie didn't have me in mind when it was created. This is my first experience with the girls of Sex and the City and from what I gathered I can see why an hour-long TV program running on premium cable would be a hit. These girls are rude, and vulgar, but they play off of each other like champs. When they are seated at a table gossiping is when Sex and the City 2 shows any hint of a shine. The problems then smudge that polish.I've never seen so many costume changes. I'm convinced it's the driving point behind the narrative. Every scene is constructed to show what Carrie and the girls can put on then lead to another situation for them to dress up. No movie should be so shallow, and even worse they look flammable and toxic. I wasn't sure if the running gag is that Carrie doesn't know she looks like a low rent streetwalker, there's a sign of trouble if ever there was one.No care is shown with the characters. Samantha sleeps with absolutely any guy regardless of the situation, and the outcome is too much to stomach. Miranda has a subplot about needing to balance work and family which gets lost in a sea of plunging necklines. Charlotte frets about her husband cheating on her with their nanny every 10 minutes. Lastly, Carrie is simply too selfish to be likable. She has a husband who seems to be doing a fantastic job by everyone else's standards. To her, he needs to do more and this sets her up for a lamebrain, and oddly predictable, encounter with an old flame.The wanton excess of this movie leaves no doubt as to why the world hates us. Sex and the City 2 is a better terrorist motivational tool than it is an enjoyable time at the theatre. These girls are easily living the life in New York before the film takes its sweet time to send them to the Middle East where everything is ratcheted up to 11. They each get a personal Maybach 62 S so they can be chaffered to and from locations where they can offend locals and change clothes. There's an occasionally clever line but that won't vindicate watching it.",

While I liked the production values in the show and the first movie, the production values thanks to some slip-shod editing look cheap and the fashions don't add anything. The music sounds annoying too, the writing is a mess, clich\u00e9 ridden and awkward too many times to count and the story is unfocused with too many moments of predictability and sappy filler. And did I mention that the film is much too long, it made the already thin plot as painful as it was already. The characters are shallow and some particularly Miranda feel like pale imitations, and the less said about the acting the better. In conclusion, awful sequel and film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I thought the first movie was a little disappointing, not very much depth, just wallowing and moping for most of it.The new movie is just an exercise in self indulgence and complaining about problems that aren't really problems. Charlotte complaining about how hard it is to be her when she has a nanny AND a housekeeper. Miranda complaining that her boss doesn't like her. Carrie complaining that Big puts a TV in the bedroom. Samantha complaining about her hormones. I just kept thinking \"are you kidding me?? This passes for dialogue??\". That's all in the first 8 minutes and it's just downhill from there.

            "content": "I guess you could call me a late fan of Sex and the City. A couple of years ago when the first Sex and the City film was released, I never saw the series, but I was working at a movie theater. When I saw the trailer for the film, I thought how strange it was that a movie was coming out a few years after the series ended and that it would probably flop. Now if there is anything I learned from working at the movie theater that I worked at the time, DO NOT underestimate Sex and the City fans. That weekend was crazy like no other for a female leading movie, not to mention a Rated R film. So I saw the movie without knowing the series or the characters and actually enjoyed it, so I decided to go out and buy the series on DVD. I actually was surprised how much I enjoyed it, it's a well written series with interesting characters. But it's a fantasy world that a lot of women want and I think that's where we have our down fall and why a lot of people hate the series/movies. We have four very confident older women who have sex, admit it and are not ashamed of it, it's very off putting. So I was one of those evil girlfriends that took the boyfriend with to see this, he owed me a favor lol, but it turned out that he actually had a good time watching the film too because of it's mindless fun.Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda now have lives that are more stressful than before: All are married except for Samantha, who is now 52 and trying to keep her libido with hormones alive while dealing with menopause; Charlotte's two children are a handful and Charlotte is worried that Harry is attracted to their nanny, Erin, who, as revealed at the end of the film, is a lesbian; and Carrie's marriage to Mr. Big has settled down, though they differ on how to spend their spare time: she always wants to go out, he would prefer to stay home and watch television some evenings. Meanwhile, Samantha is approached by an Arab sheikh to devise a PR campaign for his business, and he offers to fly her and her friends on an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to Abu Dhabi. While in Abu Dhabi, Carrie runs into her former lover, Aidan, and agrees to a dinner date. Meanwhile, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda run up against a culture clash in the Middle East, as their style and attitudes contrast with Muslim society.Now this film does have some real flaws, there are a lot of pointless moments. Where Carrie loosing her passport to get it back to get the other girls into another shenanigan, that was a little silly. The film is a bit long and could have been a bit trimmed. Wither I think it's racist or not, I honestly don't see it as looking down at the Muslim culture. A lot of American women are surprised to find out about other cultures, not defending that it's right, but a lot of Americans are very closed off to the world. As for the Muslim women revealing that they loved fashion and showed that they conveniently had designer clothes underneath their robes I found unnecessary and a little disrespectful. But however, if you let these silly situations go and just try to enjoy the film, I think you'll find yourself laughing and having a good time. While the film has it's flaws, it's enjoyable, there are some really funny moments as well as touching. I loved the scene between Miranda and Charlotte talking about the hardship of motherhood, it was one of the most honest scenes in the Sex and the City story. Also Samantha screaming at the Muslim men at the end on how she does have sex was really a blast to watch. Carrie was a down fall, her character is very self absorbed and not likable in this story. It's the side characters that bring this movie together and for the fans I think this is totally worth the watch. As for the haters, of course you won't enjoy it, so I suggest you just ignore it, it's mindless entertainment. Give it a break, it isn't hurting anyone.6/10",

Going to another country to visit and enjoy culture is one thing, going there and not having the slightest respect for their laws and telling them to \"Fuck You!\" while flicking them off because you disagree with their customs is another. I expected a little better for such a well known series. They really showed their true colors on this one. They showed how sensitive they really can be when interpreting middle eastern culture and way of life. Horrible movie.",

The problem is that Cinderella (Carrie) is a spoiled little madam, not only did she blame Big for everything that went wrong during their courtship and then the disastrous wedding for which she was to blame - they had agreed on a quiet wedding and she went ballistic with Vogue and a Vivienne Westwood gown - but then, after two years of living in paradise with a gorgeous man who adores her and lavishes all he can on her in the way of worldly goods and attention, she has a tantrum because he is selfish enough to buy her a state of the art TV for their bedroom so that, after a day's graft of earning the money to keep her in luxury, he can relax. How dare he! Switch then to another storyline with Samantha, who hit 50 in the last film, so technically should be through menopause by now, but no, is taking every pill and lotion under the sky to ward off symptoms and acting like an out of control pantomime dame, and Miranda who has a new boss who doesn't like her, and of course Charlotte, whose children have a nanny who doesn't wear a bra but who loves to draw attention to that fact - well of course, all meaningful crises in the normal world, but we are talking megabucks city here guys. Then by some chance they are whisked away to the United Arab Emirates, to Abu Dahbi, where the luxury is excessive even to one who dreams of winning lotto. There, bare skinned and offensively dressed and behaving badly they proceed to upset the locals and get kicked out, after Carrie has met up with old flame Aiden and kissed him and phoned Big to blurt out the truth - why not wait until you can do this humanely, face to face if you have to tell him, and if it meant nothing, why torment the poor chap? They arrive home, having learned that of course all Arab women wear NY fashions under their black costumes and read trashy NY books. Big's punishment for Carrie is to give her a massive diamond. Embarrassing to see Samantha, (my favourite) become a joke; sad to see Miranda, (my second favourite) and Charlotte so petty, and sad to see that Carrie (sorry but always watched despite her, not because of her) has not grown up yet and is still childish, sulky, spoiled and ridiculous. A real disappointment. Quit while you can girls...",

This movie, from the terrible beginning to the God awful end, shouldn't even be shown under the guise of a \"film.\" First of all, I enjoyed the television show. The comradery is endearing, and all women dream of a perfect life, with perfect friends, lots of money, men that love them, amazing clothes, movie star friends, red carpet premiers, etc etc. SATC has created this dream into a likable series that most women enjoy. Now turning any series into a film is tricky, 30 minute stories every week isn't really in depth story telling. Venturing into this realm the first time was ballsy, but the second time around was simply egotistical. The film contains a various stories, all hoping to appeal to its mostly female audience, #1, Husband and wife fight over the TV, wife wants to go out, husband doesn't. Carrie wants to go to the premier, Big wants to stay in and watch TV, very relatable matter to most women right? #2-Menopause, seen as a chastity belt by someone like Samantha. She is taking any known medical serum hoping to prevent the inevitable. Aiming to guarantee her worn out body the ability to be enjoyed by the other half of Manhattan she hasn't already banged. #3-Not enough time with family, job too time consuming....yes, I know...you are trying to grasp how women with money, maids, and nannies deal with such trying issues, but I haven't told you the final story line...#4-A stay at home, uber wealthy mother with a live in nanny is trying to deal with being a mother!!! Are you on the floor? That one should've put you right over the edge. So, here we are, four extremely wealthy women, dealing with problems that you and I deal with every day. Except they have live in nannies, drivers, extra homes to hang out at when they want to \"get away,\" closets full of couture, and oh yeah, did I mention they're millionaires? So how much crazier can this story get you ask, well here it is, the writers/directors decided to throw these women into a culture that is the total opposite of everything they stand for-THE MIDDLE EAST..(gasp, hand over mouth, tears streaming down your horrified face). So they send these spoiled sluts on over to the Middle East, now this is where the story literally takes a nose dive into the Red Sea. The writers/directors thought it would be humorous to have these women confronted with a culture so unlike their own, and then have them mock it, very ignorantly I might add. If there is ever the stereotypical view that Americans are stupid and ignorant to foreign cultures, that assumption would have been reached upon viewing this film. The SATC sluts dress provocatively, then mock the local women for choosing a life of piousness to one of shallow days filled with shopping. The culminating shot was Samantha's purse being spilled onto the streets of a marketplace and her stack of condoms falling out. She then screams into the crowd that yes, she likes to have sex, all while gyrating her hips and pumping her fists. Are we to assume that the writer/directors were hoping that you would side with Samantha? Hooray for America, for women having sex, wearing whatever they want and being proud of it? Not that there is anything wrong with that, but they are placing the Muslim lifestyle under the DON'T column of this list. Upon picking up her stack of condoms, the women are helped by a group of Muslim women that take them to a back room and pull of there niqab's to reveal they are all dressed to the nines like the SATC ladies!! Hooray, this culture of women dressed so terribly, but underneath, they want to be just like us Americans. Heartwarming right? Well it's not, it is terribly arrogant and embarrassing. I feel there is always something good that comes from most movies, good looking guys/girls, cool clothes (btw-the women were all dressed terribly in SATC2), some humorous dialogue, but this movie has nothing. If there is a God, then this movie will surely end up in hell.",

An incomprehensible pile of dough from your HBO TV show and syndication and DVD sales and the film version which made half a billion dollars and you know, you know in your bones because your product is good, that there is more money sitting there, waiting to be made.Your fans still love you, and haven't been won away to other shows: your brand is sacred and almost uncontested in its niche. But... well, it's getting to be a stretch. Sexy single women in their 30's struggling to make it in the big city have become married mothers in their 40's with fortunes of their own, fortunes that seem a little tacky maybe in these days of conspicuous economy and restraint.What you should do is say, \"We had our run\".What you definitely shouldn't do is make your coda a two-and-a-half-hour long slapstick romp about rich, dull women that look like ropy hunks of lacquered wood with jewels glued to them having a very expensive vacation in Abu Dhabi. Despite the impulse.Catching up with the girls two years down the road from the first film, Sex and the City 2 catches Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) as she struggles with the boring realities of her marriage to Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and spends her time decorating their new apartment \"12 floors down\" from their previous penthouse. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is barely hanging on, dealing with her daughter's terrible twos and the fear that her husband may have a thing for their fetching Irish nanny (Alice Eve). Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is chafing in her lawyer job, trapped under the glass ceiling while P.R. agent Samantha (Kim Cattrall) struggles with the onset of menopause. Getting the girls together out at the premiere of a film, Samantha is asked by a Sheik to visit his hotel in Abu Dhabi to design for him a P.R. campaign, and she whisks her three friends off to the U.A.E. for a fabulous, each-to-her-own-stretch-Maybach-limo vacation. Some drinks, some shopping, some dishing, a couple of romantic crises that arrive apropos of nothing and fizzle away into meaninglessness almost immediately.The film also suffers from its mightily weird choice to have the four sexually open imbibers spend their last hour of screen-time among the burqa-ed ladies of Abu Dhabi. That hour is spent pin-balling violently from hilariously simple cultural dismissiveness - the ladies' response to Carrie's observation that veils make it seem like Muslim men \"don't want women to have a voice\" is to go to a nightclub and sing \"I am Woman\" to rapturous applause - to facile commentary on the real dirty pool being played in that part of the world - slave labour building 7-star hotels - to borderline offensive exoticism to openly rude flaunting of the cultural mores of the city they've decided to visit. It's uproariously moronic. Samantha, shrieking and haggard and shaking under the stress of her aging vagina, throws handfuls of condoms at men in the Soukh, and then panics when they get mad and shouty, you know, as those Muslims do. Thankfully, the ladies are whisked away into safety by robed women, who doff their robes to reveal, for some reason the spring '10 Versace line. This is supposed, I assume, to mean something.It's not just pointless, it's also enthusiastically rude: a whole-hearted celebration of the clueless, rich American abroad. Furthermore - and most tragically - it's decidedly not Manhattan, the locale that transcended setting to become a living, breathing character itself in the original series.Almost all of what made the original TV show so great - its verve, its spark, its keenness of observation and snappiness and willingness to be up-front and unapologetically adult and funny and sexy - is gone. What remains is limp. It's shiny, to be sure, and there are a few short scenes of the girls sitting around the pool trading quips and bawdy barbs, but they're a melancholy pleasure buried under hours of pointless, boring agonizing over the really minor minutiae of grown-up life. A loud baby, a braless nanny, a TV in the bedroom, a mean boss: this is hardly sexy, provocative stuff, and outfits and jewelry and shoes alone can't keep this massive, gaudy thing afloat. 3.5/10",

This movie, on the other hand...I'll sum it up with the word \"stinks\".There are plenty of problems I have with the finished product. First off, the movie is set in Abu Dhabi...a location where most of the audience couldn't find on a map if they were given a flashlight-hat, a magnifying glass and a clue! And, by the way, movie producers, the show/movie is called \"Sex AND the City\". And that city is NEW YORK, clowns! Half of the identity and allure of the show is that it is set in New York. This sequel being set in Abu Dhabi would be like making a sequel to \"Waterworld\" and setting it in the Sahara desert! What an absolutely utter, moronic decision to cast it in Abu Dhabi. Who green-lights these types of decisions...and is there any way to have those people rounded up and savagely killed in a public setting?! Secondly, and trust me, I'm completely aware that Hollywood is going to milk this cow completely dry...but the basis of the TV series was the trials and tribulations of 4 middle-aged women trying to find their way in relationships and in life. That type of show inevitably brings a \"best by\" date along with it though. And that date has clearly passed. The show now resembles 3 rich and snobby above-middle-aged women...and their Grandma. People get old. Plots (excluding cartoons and superheroes) get stale. It's inevitable. No need to trounce around a 53-year-old Kim Cattrall spouting cringe-worthy lines that no 50-plus-year-old women would ever utter! (Example: After meeting a well-to-do Arab man, Cattrall announces \"He's the 'Lawrence of my labia'!\") Ouch. I had to pause and take a shower after writing that line! There's bad puns and there's bad puns...but that one takes the cake! A common theme from the general public in regards to the show...which is understandably getting louder and louder over the years...is the question of \"Are there any humans on Earth that actually behave in this manner?!\" You've got one girl, Cattrell, who's such a slut, she puts a drunk and coked-out Lindsay Lohan to shame! With her sexual past, I wouldn't touch her with a hazmat suit on! Kristen Davis manipulates more partners than Glenn Beck does viewers. And Sarah Jessica Parker - her love interest is nicknamed \"Big\". If that's not a slut for you -- nicknaming your boyfriend based on his member -- I don't know what is! I don't know any guys who would actually date any of these girls. They are high-maintenance, petty, gold-digging, partner-jumping, manipulating whores with apparent mental issues.And what's up with the running time?! 2-1/2 hours for a show about sex, gossip and relationships?! This isn't \"Schindler's List\" material you know! Liza Minnelli makes an appearance for comic relief...with the exception that she didn't really bring any comedy. Doing the whole \"laugh-at-the-old-lady\" routine isn't that bright considering your cast is all 40+ or 50+ aged females. Just horrible.Trust me, it's awful.Thank you for reading! JD",

When I saw the first movie I had high expectations and was left extremely disappointed and appalled, at how spoiled and selfish the four women I had loved and looked up to in the original, came to be portrayed as. I felt betrayed and angry then. So by the time this second movie came out I knew better - not expect much at all. I watched it simply to enjoy seeing their colorful lives once more, and to satisfy my own curiosity for what more the writers had in mind for the continuing lives of these four girls. That attitude worked for me, and I enjoyed it for what it was. I chose to ignore the elements of the movie that many people here are saying as offensive by not taking this movie seriously; it's not worth it. It's like when a movie is made out of a book, it's best to not compare the two but see them as two separate entities; the SATC movies and the original series on HBO... are two different things. Expect this to be a movie to be watched purely for entertainment purpose, for passing time, and not something that will teach you valuable life tips or inspire, as the original series did. If you go into it with high hopes you'll most likely end up feeling betrayed. If you choose to see it not so much as a movie but as a silly two-hour long reality escape on a DVD, it is not so bad.The movie does not have much of a storyline, but there were two things I appreciated: the plot on Carrie with her doubts about her happy-ever-after, and the exchange between Charlotte and Miranda about their motherhood. Carrie's acting out on her fears and her subsequent coming-clean to Big, was true to her character - fallible, and still lovable. The way Big handled their little crisis at the end, showed well in the short scene, that he had matured as a man from the once perpetual bachelor. Charlotte and Miranda sharing honestly with each other what they felt as their own flaws and shortcomings in their motherhood was touching, and true to their bravely honest characters from the originals. As for Samantha, well, unfortunately her over-sexed character lies flat and boring; her integrity and intelligence that was once well-deserving of respect in the originals, is forever lost in the two sequels. Final verdict: if you can see past all the flaws in this movie, and choose to see it just for fun, it can be enjoyable enough. If you have a hard time detaching the sequels from the original series in your mind... it might be best if you skip this one (or the first one).",

I've never seen any of the series, nor the first film, but this is disgusting, offencive, self obsessed and highly unlikable. The first travesty this film has to offer are the shallow and vacuous characters. In these hard economic times we are shown the troubles of women, whose biggest problems include a nanny that doesn't wear a bra, a man putting a TV in the bedroom, not liking your job as a lawyer, and getting older. Even just a glance at the first act of the film shows how despicable these women are. Carrie gets mad at her husband for buying a television for their bedroom. He does this as they enjoyed a romantic time watching Black and White movies together. Despite this, she acts as though he has cheated on her. Later she forces him to attend a movie premiere with her. He actually ends up having more fun than her, and chats with Penelope Cruz. After this she demands they leave and then gets angry when he watches some TV. These women are portrayed as victims despite their incredible wealth. There is no learning curve in this movie. The final conflict sees them racing to the airport and if they don't make it in time they will...HAVE TO TRAVEL COACH. This is all topped off with some offencive scenes involving the conservative beliefs of the middle east. It's hard to judge if this film is more offencive to the middle east, women, or Americans. I pray there is no one in existence like these characters, as they are both baffling and frustrating.",

As much as I (surprisingly) loved the first movie, #2 was just plain offensive.It started off all right (except for that over the top gay wedding) We catch up with the girls and their significant others in NY; Carrie and Big are having growing (or couch/TV) pains, Charlotte is overwhelmed by her children and a braless (gorgeous) nanny, Miranda is working too much, and Samantha is going through the big M. This was all relatable stuff, but then Samantha gets an all expense paid trip (through Smith) and they end up in the UAE.Where every scene requires another outrageous costume change, they stay in adjoining 22,000 dollar a night suites, personal butlers, etc and its all just too, too much. And jeez the stereotyping and offensive behaviour towards middle eastern culture and travel outside America in general. It was just painful to watch. I suppose this is meant to be watched as escapism or fantasy, but still.All in, a nothing movie that had me cringing more than laughing. I will admit Big's \"sparkle\" and speech at the end almost had me forgiving him for his behaviour over the years.As much as I've been a fan of the girls, the entire series and the first movie I really hope this is the end. 1/6/14",

And while the reviews have been quite harsh and many may feel that it's just \"more of the same\", my response is: \"So what?\". If you're a fan of the hit TV series, you should by now know what the general tone of the movie would be. If you hated the series, then obviously this movie wasn't meant for you to enjoy.It's 2 years after the events in the first movie, with Carrie and Big settling into domestic marital bliss, but soon Carrie starts to resent the \"routine domesticism\" and longs for more excitement and fun with her husband. But instead, he enjoys sitting on the couch, ordering take-out and watching old black & white movies. Charlotte is struggling with being a parent to two young girls. Especially when the youngest is continually crying and she soon finds herself longing for freedom from parenthood, if only for a while. Miranda is stuck in a great job, but with a boss who continually demeans and despises her, even though she sacrifices way too much family time in dedication to her work.All three of them soon get the perfect opportunity to unwind, when Samantha gets invited to Abu Dhabi in the Middle East, with regards to promoting a client's new movie. She invites her girls, and they all set off in search of a break from New York City. They of course get involved in hilarious mishaps (notably Samantha and her insatiable sexual appetite), as well as offering some wry insights into Middle Eastern customs with regards to women and how they are viewed.Many were complaining that taking the girls out of \"The City\" (New York) was a bad move, but I saw it as a refreshing change of direction. And what I enjoyed about the plot was the semi-serious look it took at modern issues regarding marriage, parenthood, and even America's outlook on the Middle East. There was much less nudity this time around, but some of the jokes were a lot funnier. And while the movie may not be to everyone's liking, it certainly knows how to please it's devoted fans, and I found it in some respects to be better than the first movie. PS. I'm a guy, and before you assume it, no I'm not gay",

These characters are fun characters and people like watching them interact but i just once again feel like there was nothing to be said once again.The glaring issue is this movie is also too long. 2 and a half hours! That is 5 times the run time of a single episode of the original series. That is a big jump and i don't think it works especially when then story isn't there to support the long run time.I actually found this movie slightly funnier than the previous but only by a slight margin. But i just couldn't get past the blah-ness.Kim Cattrall is great as always but why she is also great is she's the only thing stopping them making a third movie, so good on her. They would keep making them because like i said people love these characters, i do too but i don't want to see them just like flounder around the screen not growing or developing. I said it in the last review that these characters have plateaued. They have reached their end and big surprise they ended once again where we started with them.I do want to mention the start of this movie because it was the strangest thing id seen all week, Liza Minelli singing Single Ladies.

Thus, Sex and the City was born.In 2008, the girls had a reunion on the big screen, and it puts to an perfect ending to the series.However, in 2010, another reunion on the big screen was created, which this time round, the reunion does not seems to be enjoyable compared to the previous reunion, which brings love, trust, faith, hope and ever lasting friendship together.Welcome to Sex and the City 2, which brings fails to deliver the high expectation from fans of the popular HBO series. Love and sex remains, together with more exaggerating comical sequences, posh nosh and time consuming plot, which not only bores and sometimes frustrates audience, but also, a disappointment to the fans of Sex and the City.Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattral) are back together on the sequel, which begins with a list of problems they are facing in their daily life: Carrie is in doubt with Big (Chris Noth) on their marriage; Miranda faces the pressure of a chauvinistic boss; Charlotte unable to handle her two daughters growing up together, and Samantha is tackling menopause. An unexpected invitation to a holiday at Abu Dhabi for th girls allows them to enjoy themselves, and at the same time, clearing about their thoughts on their love life and marriage.Sex and the City 2 promises to be another fashion parade. However, girls don themselves with clothing unsuitable for the weather and environment in Abu Dhabi pulls the movie down, since it makes the girls looks lavish and filthy rich, rather than stylish and chic. While the latest fashion fits in perfectly in New York City, the crew has failed to consider creating clothing that fits into the environment and culture of Abu Dhabi. Thus, it does not bring out the charm the girls ought to get from wearing them, which has been displayed in the previous series.The plot seems like a typical episode of Sex and the City, but such typical plot are good for the drama series rather than the movie. The paper thin plot can be seen as a form of extension from one of the episodes, which looks rather dull and draggy. Sub plots were added in to keep the movie going, which fails to point out some of the points that can be discussed further in the movie. Instead of keeping the spirit of Sex and the City going strong, the second half of the Sex and the City 2 seems to be a farce.Discussion of culture and religion in Abu Dhabi has also diverted the spirit of the series away, which at some point, could be offensive and uncomfortable to some audience who are not prepared for it. For fans, this might be seen as a sequence that has no relation to the girl's usual talk over the coffee table.The strong support for each other and the friendship is the only saving grace for the movie, which not only ends haphazardly, but also fails to end with a big bang.In summary, director Michael Patrick King and Parker can do more to salvage Sex and the City 2. Remedy must be done to save this broken pieces of anticipated reunion in order to keep the spirits alive.",

            "content": "I have a review of the first Sex and the City movie on this site, so if you are interested in what I wrote, I invite you to read my review. Now as for this, the second, Sex and the City, movie, well, my review is just about the same, in that I really enjoyed it. I think it is simply fabulous entertainment---NOT to be taken too seriously, but just to be enjoyed. It follows the lives of the four women two years later. Miranda is having a problem with her new boss; Charlotte is finding motherhood somewhat of a challenge; Samantha's mind is competing with her aging body; and Carrie is not exactly thrilled that married life to Mr. Big is not the social whirlwind she may have envisioned for herself. Stanford gets married in a lavish gay wedding, complete with Liza Minelli, who looks older, thinner, who seemed very,very strained in her voice and in her speech--something was amiss with her speaking voice. The plot in the first movie was more of a drama; this movie is not as intense as the first movie, but more of a comedy--that is how I would classify it. That is really the big difference between the two films. All, with the exception of the slim downed Kim Cattrall, do look a wee but older, or as someone else said, the photography of the women is not the best in this sequel. Kim, as I said, lost a lot of weight, and looks great. Carrie's hair is a bit darker, so, perhaps, that is why she looks drawn. The girls have an adventure in the UAR, and the whole plot is unrealistic and very, very far fetched--as if anything like this could possibly happen to someone in REAL life, but, again, this is a movie. A lot of the reviewers here are taking the whole thing just too seriously. I found it a funny, touching and just a great movie. I could see it again and again. You should too.",

And the story, well- what story? What did actually happen? Nada. The husbands (including Smith and excluding Big) looked like they were only in the film because they signed a contract 3 years ago. The \"story\" with Aidan didn't really go anywhere and the 5th \"girl\" NYC was merely in the opening credits. Nothing happened - except for me feeling the same way I do when I see Madonna these days - uncomfortable a bit embarrassed and really glad my mum isn't like that. All the sparkle and the love that used to go into this show was no were to be found.

            "content": "Ok, so this was a total Lockdown watch. Thanks to Covid most of us are spending more time infront of the TV trying to keep ourselves entertained. Unfortunately this doesn't entertain. It insults - women, the Middle East, people who aren't as overly privileged as the 4 main characters, the viewers intelligence.The original 6 seasons of SATC were in general very good entertainment and it was refreshing to see female friendship, empowerment and them living their lives the way they wished. Though by the end of its run they had become somewhat annoying and the over privilege had set in. The first movie was OK and like an extended episode of the original series. Success was guaranteed and it came by the bucket load.SATC 2 is a deliberate and tasteless cash-in on that success. The issues dealt with by the women in this film by and large are purely them moaning about how dissatisfied they are with their incredibly rich white woman lives. Carrie is bored with the boring aspects of her marriage to Big - yes, sometimes marriage is boring. Charlotte is finding it hard to be a mother - oh yes, so, so hard given you have a live in nanny and live in a multimillion dollar apartment in Manhatten and don't have to go to work. Miranda hates her job as a super well paid lawyer - OK, yes clearly she works for a firm who don't acknowledge that as a mother she has other responsibilities outside of her job and that is something many can relate to, but still she's a high paid lawyer. Samantha does whatever Samantha does and is going through the menopause like pretty much 50% of the rest of the population will at some point in their lives, but again she's rich and privileged. At least she's entertaining with it, with some of the (very few and far between) funnier lines in the movie. Actually Samantha seems to be the least changed for the worst of the characters. We all know what we get from Samantha and Kim Cattrall played her so well. But I think she was right to turn down any further movies because she had done everything that could be done with the character brilliantly, and it was time for her to move along as an actress. Plus clearly the friendship we see on screen wasn't what they had away from the cameras.The beginning of the film is basically a set up for all the rich people problems they're \"enduring\" and need to escape from. Also we get a big gay wedding and Liza Minnelli. There is a slight political angle because the wedding is taking place in one of the very few places same sex weddings could take place in the USA at that time. But that message is kind of lost in the complete over the top-ness of the scene, and is where we see Carrie discover her \"problem\" in her own marriage.Moving on to the main plot (such as it was - it's very thin) the 4 girls take a break from their oh-so-hard lives and go all expenses paid to Abu Dhabi. This isn't a plot as such, just an excuse to surround them in even more luxury and privilege whilst managing to insult and ridicule the culture of that part of the world. Whatever your personal opinion of how the people of that area live, the way it is portrayed here with the 4 women coming up against it is basically ridicule. The scenery and costume changes in this part of the movie are amazing, but they don't actually add anything or even move the very thin plot along.Finally, the timing of this movie's release into cinema was at the end of the global financial crash when a huge amount of people were suffering - job loss, less money, loss of homes and all sorts of awful things. Was it really a good idea to basically rub these seemingly recession-proof shells of characters into everyone's faces? Was their not any kind of relatable storyline they could have included from those times to show that recession could affect anyone including them? Anyway, that's maybe all a bit too \"political\" now.In conclusion this film manages to be insulting on quite a few levels whilst at the same time being incredibly shallow. Critics at the time were not particularly kind, which looking back I can see why. It was a big financial success of course. Thankfully it also killed off the idea of a third film.",

Poor Charlotte with her full time nanny living in her Park Avenue apartment, is overwhelmed and has a crying spell/breakdown in her pantry when her daughter puts her red icing filled hands on the back of her vintage ivory colored Versace skirt. Who wears a vintage pencil skirt while making cupcakes??? A white one no less??? Poor Carrie, disappointed that her marriage is getting stale because her husband, who probably works 60 hours a week on Wall Street, doesn't want to go out on the town night after night. The horrors!!! The nerve of him bringing home dinner!!! Doesn't matter that her days are filled with filled with shopping and lunching with her friends. The raunchiest women in NYC go on vacation to the most conservative part of the world. Yawn. Dear lord, one lame joke after another. Abu Dhabi do? Erin go bra-less? Lawrence of my labia? \"Dick Spurt\"??? Who's your long distance carrier??

Truthfully, I almost turned off the movie within the first 10 minutes with Samantha rubbed cream \"down there\" while sitting at her desk - oh and her office has glass walls and her secretary saw the whole thing.

As the four principal pals ( Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall) settle into marriage and menopause, they are still young enough to struggle with competing desires within themselves and yet old enough to laugh at themselves and at times choose the selfless act over the selfish.Some of the issues: 1. Gay political incorrectness. The opening gay wedding, which we are reminded multiple times it is, and certainly the La Cage visuals and speech affectations would confirm, at least for those influenced by stereotypes. 2. Marriage\u2014does it become stale? Is separation, even structured at regular intervals, a good thing? Is it better to be single? 3. Condoms are a laughing matter. 4. Women in Saudi Arabia-- are they enslaved or just arch manipulators who eventually get what they want? 5. Are the Emirates wealthy and sexist or newly rich and traditional? All this and more are served up with the brightest eye candy, from bejeweled designer shoes, legs (particularly Sarah Jessica Parker's) that age well, and an Abu Dhabi every bit as glitzy as you've heard and more. The girls Carrie (Parker), Charlotte (Davis), Miranda (CNixon), and Samantha (Cattrall) travel to Saudi land at the behest of a prince, who puts them up in a $22,000 per night suite for a week of camel riding, indiscriminate sex (just Samantha, but then she has enough sexual energy for the entire group), and issues of fidelity to spouses left behind.Witty conversation never trumps the visuals and issues skimming, even when Carrie and husband Big watch the smart \"It Happened one Night\" with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert (it's clear our actors can never measure up to the black and white actors or this script come close).",

See if anyone else can do better. I wonder how much the Emirates Tourism Board offered the filmmakers for each time this occurred? If you Google \"Sex and The City 2\" and cross-reference the term \"product placement\" you will find over a thousand results. It seems I am not the only one who thought I was watching a 2.5 hour infomercial. Before the movie had begun I'd already suffered a million commercials for the usual chick products: adverts for Chocolate when you're feeling ugly, and adverts for beauty products to fix up the damage done by the chocolate. However, when a movie fades in, I expect the advertising to stop. Brandchannel.com called SATC-2 a \"brandapalooza\". The sequel even beat the first movie's record of 94 brand placements.When I wasn't counting product plugs, I was laughing at Samantha. Apologies to Kim Caterall as I was not laughing with you, but at you. You would think by time you are 52 years-old you would be over your daddy issues and realise frequent intimate encounters will never fill the emotional void. On two occasions we were subjected to watching this sad lady desperately trying to fill her void with some guy. As predicted, lazy Sam lets the man do all the work. It's always the ones who brag about it who are the worst at it.The most hilarious part was watching Sam and her pals sing the feminist anthem \"I Am Woman\", and why the hell not? Helen Reddy had long ago sold out her song to Coors and Burger King for \"a gigantic amount of money\", in her words. I smiled while I pondered, \"this is what forty years of sexual revolution has given women: the right to be a slave to overpriced fashion.\" The punchline of this joke is that they were singing \"I Am Woman\" in the United Arab Emirates - one of the most sexist countries in the world wherein women are commonly and legally abused. Sex And The City has a cute solution for Muslim women in the UAE: Just swathe yourself in Dior, sing bad karaoke, and everything'll be alright.",

            "content": "Urrrrgh, they're back in the ineviatable sequel, but now they go to Abu Dhabi! Pretty much the same thing as \"Sex 1\", but with a new location. The girls still carry on the same way while they giggle,talk about dreams, reality,goals, meeting perfect men, clothes, shoes, etc, etc, etc. There is also a performance by Chris Noth as Mr. Big {anybody care to guess why he is called that?} and he talks about the caste system, justice, social issues and the two kinds of people in the world. Obviously this guy never took a real philosophy class! There was a gay wedding where has-been Liza Minelli sings that just fell flat-not to mention it featuring every gay stereotype that can be imagined. To call this movie long is missing the point. You don't actually watch it, you endure it. There are scenes of the girls in the desert that feature the fakest looking rear projection that you've ever seen. Some of the visuals do look pretty good, but that ain't saying too much. As in Sex 1, this is the kind of movie that men get dragged to and have to admit they enjoyed it to please their dates. Again, I really can enjoy a good womans picture just as much as the next guy, but this one just ain't it. The estrogen level is so high, you can fuel a 747 with it and fly it around the world. Also, as in the first one, there are so many product placements in this film that I just couldn't count 'em all. Not really a movie in the conventional sense, its just a super expanded and padded out TV show, and a paper thin one at that. The Abu Dhabi locations are exotic looking, but , like the women themselves ,they just serve as a backdrop to hang the story on. It could have been set anywhere on Earth and the results would still be the same. Maybe I am being somewhat hard on it, but lets face it. The movies that play the multiplexes today are just products. They have no heart, soul or real worth. Everything is just the same old recycled product . Prequels, sequels, re-makes, franchises, comic book heroes and TV into movies like this. ATTENTION -Men! If you get duped into seeing this avenge yourself! Look for a revival theater , find a movie like \"Great Escape\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Longest Day\", \"Patton\" or any real man movie and drag your date to go see that! Its called \"payback\" and its a bit-h .... you know that. This is probably the ultimate movie for the dumbed down multiplex era of lowered expectations. My rating-one star. Unless you are a Masochist, avoid it like the plague! You've been warned. Another PU movie review from Lou.",

The acting was terrific,the dialogue clever,although at times a bit risqu\u00e9,and it was a great travelogue. I so much wanted to be with the girls on that flight to Abu Dhabi. I had never seen such a luxurious plane with your very own cubicle. And the hotel was beyond amazing.I wanted to be there also with them. I adored the clothes they wore,of course knowing most common gals could never afford such fashions. It was a terrific fantasy,for heaven's sake,and what a wonderful escape.Of course Samantha was uncouth and overly sensual in many scenes but that is Samantha. And she was going through menopause,poor thing. Much of the dialogue was so comedic. The other girls were very respectful of the middle eastern culture,if not Samantha who was just being herself.I thought the scene with Miranda and Charlotte discussing their true feelings about motherhood over drinks was genuine and moving. How many mothers throughout time have not been tortured with feelings of guilt along with deep love for their kids. When Charlotte finally admits the truth and screams out \"Yes,the kids are driving me crazy!\" I'm sure all mothers and grandmothers in the theatre could really identify.I really liked the gay wedding even if it was \"over the top.\" it was fun and energetic.The music and celebration was great with Liza Minelli along with the choir & dancers.And the marriage of Carrie and John(Mr. Big)was portrayed in a very realistic way. They were trying to figure out how to \"design\" their relationship with just the two of them.I thought it was cleverly explored in the script. All in all I thought it was a great movie. I will probably see it a second time. It provided me with laughs,tears,smiles,\"food for thought\" and a great afternoon escape. Women out there,don't miss this movie.You will have a wonderful experience. I went to see this movie for a second time in a week when a friend wanted to see it. I have never done this but figured I would still enjoy it. And I did! I saw different issues I hadn't seen the first time. I still thought it was great. The wittiness and quips were so clever that I missed the first like \"first soup,then souq\" (market),or\"Lawrence of my labia, etc.\" I think the whole point of the series and movies is that to have a group of friends for total support and who understand you and accept all your virtues and foibles is wonderful. They will be old and grey and still going out for lunch \"with the girls.\" Every woman everywhere needs this,close friends as family,even more important than family.I still teared up at the scene with Charlotte and Miranda discussing \"Motherhood.\" I would probably love this movie a third/fourth time. It was pure fantasy with fantastic entertainment and relevance,even the second time around. Don't miss it regardless of what the critica say.What do they know?",

            "content": "I suppose you just cannot postpone a girl's night out, not when these famous, fabulous four still have a firm following worldwide to greenlight a sequel to their 2008 feature film, though seriously, are we really that interested in the married life of Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and the expected troubles from a modern day girl with plenty of emotional issues still too immature (she still continues to be oh-so-whiny here) to deal with?While waiting to get some flak for that last statement made, I wonder how writer-director Michael Patrick King felt like having to craft interesting stories and challenges for the female fab four, after all, it does seem like a natural progression of problematic issues all generically laid out waiting for someone to put them into the narrative. The sequel is set some 2 years into the marriage of Carrie and Mr Big (Chris Noth) as seen from the first film, and as the relationship matures, the petty issues start to creep up, though from a guy's perspective, pray tell what is wrong with just wanting to be laid back a little, stay at home, plonked down on a comfy couch and to watch a little telly? But for Carrie, it translates to a lack of commitment and interest.So that's Carrie's challenge to address. As for her gal pals, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) has to deal with the notion of her husband's possible temptation by her new Irish nanny Eric (Alice Eve), who is naturally endowed by Nature with humongous hooters, and the preference to go braless (which contributes to the nudity rating of the show, so there). As for Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), as the career legal eagle, hers is the feeling of not being appreciative at work, having her arc take a backseat here after a major one in the first film. As for resident slut Samantha (Kim Cattrall), it's having to tackle her post 5 decades with multi-vitamins so that her sex drive is kept at an equilibrium instead of nose-diving.We spend the first hour in New York establishing all these issues and to attend a gay wedding for the sake of (and watching Liza Minnelli in a cringeworthy Beyonce performance), before Samantha's reputation of PR extraordinaire wins her and her pals an all expenses paid trip to UAE (well, actually Morocco doubling up), courtesy of a rich Sheik (Art Malik) who wants her to handle the PR for their hotel. The film's setting in the second half will make you wonder if it's a little out of date, with its throwaway extravagance and opulence being showered and pampered upon our quartet, from mansion like hotel rooms with breath- taking balconies, right down to personalized butlers who can warm your milk and act as confidantes dishing out good advice.With Samantha's high sex drive in tow in a conservative Muslim society, expect comedy to come in the most politically insensitive / incorrect manner to try and draw laughter, though sometimes one wonders how such jokes could have gotten away with it. Most of them fell flat on their face, while those that did earn a deserved chuckle, seemed to be grouped amongst jokes told for the sake of, sometimes quite jarringly out of the blue, as one character mentions, she saw the punchline and went for it. Those into fashion will find the usual labels on display here, coupled with Middle Eastern influences.It's fun while it lasted, but this again is nothing more than a glorified television episode set to rake in box office gold from fans and curious non-fans wondering just what the fuss is about. There's nothing deep in the film as themes are casually handled on the surface, but as popcorn fare, it will likely prove that it has enough gas in the tank for another romp in another city of decadence, if that should be the formula it so decides to stick to. Perhaps Singapore next, since we have shiny new IRs to tempt them all to come over?",

But this one is a major disappointment.There was very little plot, even fewer laughs and the whole movie was superficial. Did a 13 year old boy collaborate in writing the script, one wonders? Even the frequent costume changes couldn't save this farcical disaster. Though I acknowledge that some of the clothes were gorgeous, an equal number were hideous. Which begs the question - what were they thinking??? Now tell me girls, how many of us wear bras under our nightwear, hmm? Or hats on a plane, let alone one large enough to be seen from the moon? Pleeease! Spare me!Carrie was annoying & unrealistic in her struggle to maintain her singles lifestyle within the confines of her marriage to Big. She also struggled to keep her boobs in her bustiers throughout the movie, which quickly grew tired for me (hence the 13 yo boy reference). Poor Miranda was superfluous - a bit like a witless cruise director in the end. Her storyline, such as it was, was far more interesting at the beginning of the film and could have been built into a more compelling storyline.Charlotte was prim & ditzy - playing to type, nothing new there. She was not coping with motherhood and yet somehow her best friends didn't realise she was in trouble after 2 years? Oi! A little hard to swallow.Samantha, who is normally somewhat witty with her sexual innuendo was just plain schoolboy-crass. Her sex scenes were neither erotic or artful - more like something out of Porkys. Eww! And for a supposedly savvy business woman, she showed an appalling lack of respect for another culture in her appearance & behaviour when in Abu Dhabi. Again, I didn't buy it.The movie's biggest blunder was not elaborating on the early days when the girls first met and how they developed into the girls we knew & loved. They opened the door for a couple of brief minutes & slammed it shut with my fingers in the jamb.Do yourself a favour ladies - hire the DVD. This one is not a keeper.",

The cultural insensitivity shown in the film is blatantly offensive. The jokes that the characters say are irritating rather than funny. For example, that joke about down under sounds more like a pathetically desperate announcement.

As usual it was over the top in parts and some of the one-liners fell flat. I have read that people are upset that Samantha was disrespectful and to me the only clear disrespect was wearing shorts and dropping the f-bomb in the market but that was part of the plot albeit a little too Keystone Kops for my taste. To counter it, Miranda served up cultural tidbits throughout the movie and they all tried to keep Samantha in check.The Big, Carrie dilemma of the two of them being enough for each other for the rest of their lives is a great question. As is the acknowledgment that even with marriage and children (Charlotte and Miranda), how do you make time for yourself without feeling guilty? All in all, the movie was entertaining. Not as good as the series, but how will they ever be able to top that work?On a side note, what I find interesting about some of the men's reviews here is how they use the word kill so freely. \"The actors, producer, director, and whomever OK'd and bankrolled this movie should be shot in the stomach and then killed!\" \"Who green-lights these types of decisions...and is there any way to have those people rounded up and savagely killed in a public setting?!\" Are you kidding me? Even tongue in cheek, who makes cruel remarks like these?That is far more offensive than four pairs of breasts, Samantha in shorts, and the mention of the word labia.",

I also think that there won't be many people watching this, that haven't at least seen the first \"SatC\" movie. Though most will probably have caught the series/TV show too. I'm saying that because this all builds into the expectations I was talking about. While the first movie did try to involve as much people as possible from the show, this actually does try to single out (no pun intended) our ladies! And it actually succeeds in doing just that. It peels off some of the layers, which also makes it less complex, but therefor more focused on the ladies. And the ladies do have fun (it's obvious), though especially Carrie has the biggest part of the pie (or so it seems). Which also incidentally was something that was argued about, if you believe the tabloid press.But those are things, that do not interest me (and I actually don't mind the \"singer\" in this movie, though she got quite some heat for her performance ... I just didn't take it seriously). The movie is quite nice as it is and might bring yet another (extended) episode to your home ... if you let it!",

            "content": "So I've seen Sex and the City: The Movie and I thought it was below average (4/10) but does the second one improve from the first movie's flaws? No, it doesn't! If anything, it's added more flaws. The story was very basic and not in a good way, it was boring and not interesting in the slightest. The girls basically moaned about their lives so Samantha manages to bag the women a holiday to Abu Dhabi where they moaned even more (except for a couple of scenes). The characters were poorly written this time round as all of them did nothing but nag, moan and bitch about everything in their lives. If they weren't bitching to their families, the women would get together over lunch and have a good bitch at their lives. The acting was so-so, there were a couple of okay moments when the actresses didn't do a bad job but there were a lot of moments when it was bad. The direction is rubbish, the writing is a joke and the script isn't fun at all.Sex and the City 2 tries to be something it's not: Fun, sexy and smart. The worst thing about the movie is, yet again, the runtime. Two and a half hours is simply too long for this movie and the plot was very thin. I could have very easily cut sixty minutes out of the movie and you wouldn't miss anything. The only reason why I saw this was because I saw the first and I very stupidly thought that it could improve, but it didn't. Another thing that bugged me was the stuff they were wearing. This movie is supposed to be all about glamorous fashion and things but half the stuff they were wearing looked horrible, I couldn't see any woman with a sane mind wearing half the stuff they displayed in the movie. The characters were yet again stereotypical but this time, it was more blatant and in-your-face. The acting wasn't very good at all, they did a better job in the first movie. The 'funny' scenes aren't funny at all, except for the parts with Erin the Irish Nanny who made Samantha jealous. Overall, one of the worst movies this year and possibly one of the worst chick flicks I have ever seen and in even worse news, if the rumours are true, it's possible that it could be a trilogy!

            "content": "Sex and the City 2 is a follow up to the 2008 film Sex and the City and of the long running television series of the same name. This film takes place two years after the first film with more problems facing the four women in different ways. They deal with problems at work, home, with their families/significant others and more. So when Samantha gets an all expenses paid trip to Abu Dhabi, the girls jump at the chance and that is where most of the film takes place. Before I saw the first Sex and the City film, I had not seen too much, if any of the popular television series that it followed. However, I was still interested in seeing the first film and to my great surprise, I ended up thinking what a really good film it was. I thought it's depiction of these four strong willed and independent women with their different romantic, work and other situations was handled and written quite well and after awhile I really started to care for these four characters and could see after the film why they are so drawn to one another and why they are soul mates. The first film had good writing and at times it felt very realistic to me and it added a great deal of humour and warmth to it as well. I could certainly see why the first film and the series for that matter were such big successes because after watching the first film I did watch some episodes of the television show and I enjoyed that as well. So in other words, I was quite looking forward to this second visit with the women and to see what had changed with them over the course of two years and what was going on in their fictional yet somewhat fascinating imaginary lives. This follow up film is a fun and entertaining film, but I would not go as far as to say that I enjoyed it as much as the first film, or would recommend it as highly. My few flaws with the second film are not all that much, but enough for me to give it a lower rating and not call it as much as a success as the first film, or even the show for that matter. This time I found the antics of the women and supporting characters and even the plot at times, to be a lot more silly, if almost ridiculous at times. They really loaded on the camp value in this sequel and in some films it can work quite well, but when you are trying to be serious one moment and completely over the top the next, I just don't feel it works that well, put into the same film. I also found that at times this second film did drag on a bit with it's longer running time. I was never exactly bored, but there were some scenes thrown in that I found unnecessary and did not quite understand why they were put in the film because they really served no purpose whatsoever. I also think I would have liked more on the relationships of the women in this second film as was clearly evident in the first film. A lot of the time in this sequel they are in Abu Dhabi just having fun and at times being overly juvenile and silly and the chemistry or the realism of the first film was just not there, so I found I could not connect with the characters on the same level as I did with the first film. However, besides it being over the top and not having as in depth characters, or story, I still found there was enough here for me to enjoy and to recommend it. I still found it to be quite entertaining and fun and when I purchased my ticket to see the film, that is pretty much what I expected and these were my expectations going into the film. I think if you are a fan of the first film, or the series and you are looking for more chemistry, or depth in the characters, then you may be disappointed, but if you don't mind just seeing the girls letting loose and having the time of their lives, while not quite as good, but still is fun and entertaining, then Sex and the City 2 is the right film for you.",

Carrie has the man she loves, lives in a multi-million dollar NYC apartment that she would not have if it weren't for him plus she has another expensive apartment but all she does is complain that he wants to relax and watch a movie because she hasn't been out for an exciting night in what....a day or two?

I am a man and part of any appeal of the TV version was that you got to see sex and the jokes were OK, but the older these women get the less anyone cares about their issues. Samantha's character is just gross at this point, what was that disgusting thing she did in her office? Ewww. Why would young model type men want with this old bag? I have no sympathy for these people, I don't care what happens to them.And now these poor women have to fly on the richest airline to a super rich place, oh my what are they to do???

Way to save the environment, their own private plane for 4 people and they each get their own 300K car.The desert scene with the camels has to be some of the worst film making in history and asks the age old question, what the hell are they wearing?

But they did it any way, and the result was absolutely devastating, sick and plain unnecessary.All the women do in this film is complain, day and night about their \"horrible\", \"miserable\" and \"unfulfilled\" bloody lives. They literally have absolutely every thing they ever wanted and more, and they still aren't satisfied. Charlotte always wanted a baby of her own, and now that she has one, she locks herself in the closet and cries just because she can't control her, and fretting over her nanny's breasts. Carrie turns into a nagging bitch wife unhappy with the takeaway food and flat screen TV in the bedroom her husband gave her. Samantha's gobbling down pills so she doesn't have to deal with menopause, and she's also being unfaithful to her boyfriend, who stuck by her through Chemo, even though she was faithful to him in the first film. Miranda, despite working at her firm for God knows how long, suddenly is belittled by a male colleague, and she quits. And Stanford, Carrie's gay friend, is all of a sudden in love with his enemy Anthony, and they marry! And Liza Minelli shows up to perform at their wedding, performing a slightly tone deaf version of \"Single Ladies\".And it just gets worse. After Samantha impresses an Arabic partner, they are all being treated to the luxury of luxuries in a palace in Abu Dhabi, which they really don't deserve. Despite having to leave early after Samantha disrespects the Muslim culture with her outgoing sexuality, they still get to fly first class back home. What a joke.These b--ches want it all and they get it but it's still not enough for them. The script has to be the worst I've ever seen on screen. There were so many silly things simply put in there such as the Muslim women wearing designer clothes under their mosque clothing, and even the Aiden plot seemed unnecessary in the end (although I did like seeing him)It wasn't even funny. Every \"unfulfilled\" part of their lives is filled up in the end. Oh so happy! Happy, happy, happy! Maybe in a fantasy world, but not in the real one.",

            "content": "This movie isn't bad as some of the reviews have said. In fact I am an SATC fan and I enjoyed it very much. There are a couple of minor flaws but they are minor.Firstly, it isn't as dramatic and eventful as the first SATC movie - no wedding collapsing etc. But enough happens to fill a movie. It starts off with Stanford & Anthony's over the top wedding which is quite comical. Unexpectedly, half the movie takes place away from New York. It was filmed in Morocco and looks like it. For those who have been to both Morocco and Abu Dhabi or Dubai you will be able to tell the difference. It seemed landlocked but maybe I was looking out for it knowing they filmed in-land in Marrakesh. I think they used the Mandarin Oriental and the Amanjena. There are cameos by Liza Minelli, Penelope Cruz and Miley Cyrus the last being quite a hoot. Samantha has a major role here. It's clever how her behavior is instrumental in their departure from the hotel. Her romantic adventures are fun as in the early SATC days. She is just friends with Smith now so she is free to have fun and that is good. And face it, it is interesting to see what she can get up to.Not that much happens with Miranda except the change of firm. Charlotte needs to escape from screaming kids. The solution to her nanny problem is clever. There are some financial downturn references. Big comments the market dropped 100 points and Big & Carrie's new place isn't the penthouse anymore - it's now a smaller apartment. But we have to be dazzled so the opulence belongs to the Abu Dhabi sheik. And its fun to watch the girls enjoy it. Those who didn't like the commercialism and materialism miss the point. We want to escape that's why we watch this this kind of a movie. They even try to show the service side perspective of the people there. It wasn't racist either - just showed cultural differences. Like any of those many movies of Americans having a good time in Europe.There are some flaws. The main dramatic storyline is a little weak. The meeting with Aiden and dinner play out quite romantically but her decision to call Big is annoying. Also her couch potato complaint is silly. Apart from these slight weaknesses in the Carrie storyline the other main flaw is the wardrobe is ludicrous and quite ugly. They all seem to be wearing cheap, ill fitting and inappropriate clothes. Carrie's dress in the souk is absurd. Also their make up artists made them look old. I know they are getting on but somehow the filming didn't flatter them. Samantha looked bit squinty and haggard and puffy. Charlotte's eyes looked aged. Carrie didn't look good with her hair pulled back - it made her face look too long and witch like. It wasn't that they aged that much - they just weren't presented the best way.Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and a very pleasant transporting experience.",

When Samantha said \"I've had it with this economy and I need to go somewhere rich\", what was that all about?? It praises a way of life that is irrelevant. Shoes, clothes and a glamorous life is what us girls need to be happy! Even if you have a partner who loves you, if he watches to much TV, you're gonna cheat on him 'cause you want the glamor! No wonder so many people are in debt. And it gets worst! They present the middle-eastern women as fashion victims too!

Only rich people might identify with this movie, but only materialistic-wise. When it comes to every day problems, I don't think anyone in this world can identify with this movie.

I prepared myself by going in with a take it as it is attitude & I have found it has deserved every bad review it has received.The over the top wedding with Liza had poor choice of music, & badly stereotyped gays as being able to cheat because they are Gay. Liza was an embarrassment to the gay community & for some strange reason I have no idea why they adore her. Judging by this movie I have to ask why? The wedding was just a slight irritant to things to come.The whole story line with Miranda hating her job & Charlotte with the nanny who has never heard of the invention called a bra was so poorly executed & rushed. When Miranda quits I expected her to tell her boss where to shove it but they just cut off to a different scene. The nanny & that horrible Irish music playing when she's flopping her knockers about was just weird. The Irish music is okay but her flopping about with her boobies all over the place was embarrassing. Then they solved that storyline with Poof, the nannies gay, no threat problem solved. Their story lines were poorly written & executed.Samantha was written as a common floozy with no class. Again her story lines was poorly written & her character was assassinated. She used to have confidence & class. Well, not no more she does not. Thecondom scene in the village square was embarrassing. I know i use the embarrass a lot but with this movie most of it you feel embarrassed.I also felt the characters remarks & their stares of the middle east was insulting. Who goes to another country just to sit there make catty remarks & gawk at the people there. Seriously? They played the whole middle east thing poorly into the ground.Carrie really came off at her worst in this film. Her constant nagging at Big made me want to strangle her. Her kiss with Aiden & the heart break on Big's face when she tells him has me pity Big for once instead of the other way around. She would get mad at him for any little thing, then when he buys a TV she flips. A TV with the intentions of them spending time together. The moral of the story Nag & Cheat to get what you want? Are the writers retarded? The only characters I liked were Big & Miranda. Though the best scene in the movie is between Miranda & Charlotte with their heart to heart about motherhood & even that was rushed & could of been written better. My advice is avoid!",

All 4 characters (well, Miranda made some kind of effort)were so insensitive to the Middle Eastern culture they were in because, I guess, of their sense of entitlement and general shallowness, that half the movie was mostly unwatchable. The ugly scene in the souk with Samantha and the condoms (no spoiler here)set back women's lib 20 years. What in the past had been positioned as this character's sexual joie de vie here in the hands of the writers and the director became hysterical and smutty, and well, just embarrassing. It was awful. I'm a former foreign correspondent who has enjoyed being in the Middle East and other parts of our interesting planet. However, to go to another country and parade around in the most, by the way, ridiculous outfits--no fashion here!--and totally ignore the customs really was the rise again of the ugly American, 2010. No graciousness, no subtlety. What a shame. They certainly weren't role models(troll models, yes!), and unfortunately only served to underscore what many overseas say is the true image of Americans abroad. Sad, sad, indeed.",

            "content": "Sarah Jessica Parker and her soul sisters are getting older. As they move on to new scenarios, new fears, and new challenges, everything becomes more complex. There are two new elements in the film: self-doubt and fear of the new or is it the old? Samantha charges on, calling it like it is, and she is the one who remains most true to the original series, as she is defiant and at times too practical in the way she handles her affairs. Her mouth and antics is the main reason the film earns its rating. She continues leading her PR firm and is the catalyst that takes the girls on a trip to an exotic, middle eastern resort, and the adventures begin. Needless to say that her take on life will clash with some more traditionalist points of view in this city.Charlotte is a bundle of nerves and insecurity, as she leaves her children in the care of a quite capable and attractive nanny. She hasn't quite mastered the art of knowing what it takes to run her new lifestyle, and is it paradoxical, but maybe she does have too much help and too much time in her hands at the same time? After all, how does she manage to do all that thinking and worrying? She manages to reflect with the help of one of her friends, and this is a refreshing new twist in the saga.It is typical that the most logical and driven of our protagonists, Miranda, will find herself on the verge of imploding, as she continues to prove herself in the legal world. It is an early decision that sets off the mood for the rest of the picture. She discovers that she does have an intense drive and lust for life, and she finds ways to utilize that energy to help her friends throughout most of the story. She is after all the perfect balance to our leading lady, a woman who now discovers that being married might not be all that much \"fun\".Carrie continues to be an interesting and frustrating character. She still keeps our sympathy, but she also does everything possible to strain our relationship. It took her a long time to realize that she might have landed the deal of a lifetime, as the obvious choice kept eluding her, and as we saw in the last installments, he will give her \"almost\" everything she needs or wants, but even Big is human, and this is something that is hard to Carrie to understand. It's the cause of most of the conflict. She wants to remain the center of attention, the \"it\" girl, and well, as the introduction shows, things look and are very different now...Overall, there are darker undertones in the film, and this is good. It might be a fact that might not appeal to the audience this time, but there is no way one can only have fun all the time, and this was an element that existed through the original series. Does anyone remember that Russian? or Big's crisis? or Carrie's financial struggles? It's not all frothy fun.There are some disturbing portrayals in the first ten minutes, and they contradict some of the stuff to come, but in general, it's more of the same formula: amazing photography, fantastic set design and costumes, and plenty of fantasy to go around, except this time they burst the bubble, and waking up to reality can be a bit painful.",

Having them go to Abu Dhabi was perhaps a weird choice, but it gave them--especially Samantha--a chance to have some great fish-out-of-water moments. I was happy to have gotten to go along for the ride. These girls just wanna have fun -- and they did!People who weren't fans of the series would obviously not want to wander into a screening. Those fans who are screaming that the movie was horrible and not realistic should maybe re-examine the original show. It was a fantasy (not as broad, perhaps) as well. Hello? In real life could Carrie, a newspaper columnist, ever be able to afford her New York apartment and all of the clothes/shoes she had? Heck no. So, with this movie expanding the camp/fantasy aspect of the show, I was more than okay with.And I truly believe that each character grew a bit. Charlotte admitted to herself it is hard being a mother. Miranda was able to make her career into something that made her happy. Carrie was able to make her life with Big that much better and Samantha... Well, okay, Samantha hasn't changed much---but she doesn't want to change. She's keeping herself well preserved (and that produced several wonderful moments and laughs).I had a great time seeing Carrie and the girls again. It was an escapist fantasy. It was fun, it had some great laughs...and it was a good time. What's wrong with that?",

            "content": "Two years after the end of the first film, we return to Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha. Carrie is married and beginning to feel a little restless, Charlotte is struggling with motherhood, Miranda hates her job and Samantha... well, you know Samantha. The trailers and teaser pics drove fans into a frenzy, more so when clips of John Corbett (as Aiden Shaw) were revealed. The whole thing built up expectations and painted a diamond-like illusion. Unfortunately, what we got was a Swarovski crystal. I suppose I should first touch on what I liked about the film: The first half was probably the best, the opening set a very familiar mood and tone that welcomed fans back to the series. Stanford/Anthony shippers like myself also received the ultimate fanservice in the form of their wedding. Long time watchers such as myself (I break out the DVD collection every so often), will have a fun time spotting the numerous homages they paid to the original series. It had its moments outside of the homages, some of it had the audience in stitches. Those moments were few, but when they happened, the movie shone.Now for what I disliked:The fashion was really a hit and miss for me. In fact, some of it was downright bad. The second half of the story was just contrived and floppy. Even though the whole Abu Dhabi (filmed in Morocco really) part was supposed to be the highlight of the film, it just didn't do anything for me. I enjoyed some of the scenes there but the plot just started to twist illogically.Among other things, I disliked that the film pulled away New York proper and from what many fans loved. We followed these women through six seasons and one movie to see them be with the loves of their lives, yet much loved characters like Steve and Harry received minimal screen time. Even less than the first movie if it's to be believed.In fact, despite the fact that these women started the series with some key problems that they needed to work out, we spent half the movie watching them cavort around in a foreign country and then those problems are magically solved in the 5-10 minute ending. What I loved about the first film is that while it had a rather somber tone for the most part, it showed how these characters worked through their issues. It's a little something called 'character development', something that only occasionally brushed the surface of this second film. Props to Miranda and Charlotte's story lines though, because if it weren't for them, there wouldn't have been anything in the story that would've been particularly relevant or down to earth for the viewers to connect with. I just wished I could've seen more concrete (plot) and less sand. Aiden's return was one of the most horrible things to ever happen in the movie despite the fact that it was supposed to be a major plot point. I for one thought that the Carrie/Aiden saga had reached a very nice end note at the start of season 6 when she sees him married with a child. Instead, the writers chose to rip that wound wide and gaping open again. And it was for no other reason than to provide some kind of climax to the tepid storyline. It was disappointing and cheap. It would have been less cheap if they threw Carrie in a women's prison where the women have real problems like abusive boyfriends who beat them up and make them take drugs (and maybe end with a Madonna medley) ala Bridget Jones. Another thing that many other formal reviewers complained about, was the portrayal of Abu Dhabi. The general sentiment was that it was 'stereotypical' and 'racist'. I'm going to approach it from a different angle. It was stereotypical and racist, but mostly in ridiculous behaviour of the four American women in a foreign country. I mean, we all know that Samantha is \"politically incorrect and inappropriate\", she behaves in ways that are so inappropriate that she manages to get herself arrested. Remember what I said about the illogical plot? Somehow, we've forgotten the fact that the reason why she's even there was partially because of a business venture. As inappropriate as she might behave, I honestly doubt she'd so unprofessional as to screw that up. Unless of course there was a really bad script writer who realised that they had run out of things to talk about in Abu Dhabi and needed some silly reason to get the characters home to New York. For us non-American viewers, we mostly got a screening of 'Har har look at the stupid Americans behaving inappropriately. They have no respect for anyone's religion or culture.' Fans try so hard to think of the four protagonists as intelligent women, yet every so often the script writers seem to go out of their way to prove us wrong. I have no idea why and it's a shame.All in all, while I enjoyed the good parts and tried to blank my mind to the bad parts, I didn't really feel that Sex and the City 2 was worth my rushing with the weekend crowd and paying weekend ticket prices. I gave it a 5 on the basis that I'm a fan of the series, but I honestly think that even fans are better off just waiting to rent it. It had plenty of glitter, but it just ain't gold.",

The best parts of the movie were all shot at the beginning. I was laughing so hard at that wedding. The wedding must have cost at least 1 million dollars. The other good part in the movie was when that Danish guy stood up and was yelled at by the mean person from the middle east. I also liked it when Charlotte looked over at the three men and saw that Irish lady being gawked at! As for the Chris Noth Character - BIG, he was not in this enough but then again, maybe he was.

Their stories have been told.\" Well, somebody decided that their stories still were worth exploring, and Sex and the City 2 hit the screens. I did not expect much but thought that the biggest, most glamorous, exotic, and outrageously soaked in the decadent luxury film with four defying age and laws of gravity Manhattan fashionistas best friends could be fun. And indeed, the Abu Dhabi scenes (filmed in Morocco) that take the central part of the movie are spectacular. The super star hotel where four friends were staying which I assume supposed to be Emirates Palace, the most expensive hotel ever built, is most certainly the star of the movie, THE PALACE where the luxury of the Arabian fairy tales combined with the efficiency and quality of services would satisfy the most jaded guest if he/she can afford $22,000 per night or has luck to stay as a guest of a Abu Dhabi's sheik. As always, the fashion site of Sex and the City is colorful, creative, and chic even if sometimes it looks totally out of place and silly. The dresses, bags, purses, accessories, shoes (salivates), the stunning jewelry designed to resemble the eastern patterns are all breathtaking. The problem is that the lavish abundance of all things glamorous could not hide the cruelty and weigh of time towards the foursome, and most sadly - to Carrie Bradshaw. I don't know what happened to Sara Jessica Parker's face - the plastic surgery went wrong or her makeup artist on the set held a serious grudge against her but watching her close-ups was a true torture. Parker may not have been a classic beauty in the past but she used to more than compensate with the charm, gentle voice, gorgeous hair, sparkling big eyes - something unique she had that made her cute and deservingly won her the part of Carrie Bradshaw in the hit HBO series. It is not the problem that even the most fashionable attractive women grow older and change as time goes by but Carrie Bradshaw has been a quintessential \"girl\", an embodiment of eternal femininity and desire. In the Sex and the City 2, she was the most attractive while hiding under the covers of the mid-eastern women clothing and stopping the taxi in the same exact fashion as Claudette Colbert in the B/W classic It happened one night. In the latest Sex and the City entry, her looks even contradict with the plot lines. Who would blame Mr. Big for wanting to spend two days a week apart from her to help the marriage work? Who would believe Aidan, who made a surprising appearance in the Abu Dhabi the same day Carrie was there, when he kept repeating in awe how great she looked? I did not. Ironically, both men looked great and have not changed a bit since the days of the show. Another thought came to my mind - for the film with sex and the City in its title, it has very little of both. If anything, the streets of New York City were missed. Of four women, only Samantha still was interested in sex (when she was able to gulp all the medications to fight with menopause), and often in the very wrong places. I don't regret having seen the film in the theater. Two of my friends and I went to the Cinema Cafe on Wacky Wednesday, and the tickets were only $3.50. The movie was fun while it lasted but in the end once again I want to wish four friends the happy lives and to say goodbye to them. Their stories have been told.",

People with that background don't do things harshly in public, especially to her boss. No matter how chauvinist the boss was, no lawyer will do that if they still want to be a lawyer. Carrie got carried away with her selfishness towards her husband. Excuse me, but they have been married for two years and dating for ages. Isn't she supposed to learn something about being tolerance to her husband and stop to act like a tween just because she kissed (not even a french) another guy. Just take a cold shower and a French Martini, girl! Charlotte get too obsessed with the potential affair between her husband and her bra-less nanny. Big deal! If she could afford to pay the nanny to live in, she can buy the nanny tons of bra&nanny uniform dress.

She can't be that idiotic to ruin her image like she did on the sisha scene and the after-the-song scene. And the men!!! Do they have to show erected organs EVERYWHERE on the movie???

The fact that the movie is largely set in the exotic locale of Abu Dhabi (really Morocco) and 146 freaking minutes long leads me to believe that the creators were aiming at a kind of Bob Hope road movie but settled comfortably next to Ishtar (1987) as one of the largest Arabian misfires since the Kuwait invasion.While dealing with the aftermath of an ideal happy ending, Carrie is excited to see her gay best friend Sanford (Willie Garson) and Samatha's (Kim Cattrall) gay best friend Anthony (Mario Cantone) get married. Or is he Miranda's (Cynthia Nixon) gay best friend? These vapid forty-plus-year-olds wear their friends like interchangeable accessories so I can't really keep track. We as the audience have to endure a wedding more flamboyant than the Village People getting married at the Grammys, promptly followed by a movie premiere featuring pre-twerk Miley Cyrus. After meeting a sheik amused by Samantha's Samantha-ness, the four are whisked away to Abu Dhabi to enjoy the comforts of the sheik's new hotel; and maybe cause an incident or two.Based on the episodes I've seen and now the two movies I've had to endure, I can safely say that Carrie and her crew of selfish, petty, permanently malcontented Real Housewives of Saks Fifth Avenue need to disappear. They simply are no longer characters worthy of consideration and contemplation. They've become parodies of the fairer sex and themselves; no longer endearing in any way. Please go away.Okay, now that I have gotten that off my chest, let's address the vexing antics the foursome get into while in Abu Dhabi; a country with laws on female modesty. Samantha is arrested for getting jiggy with it out on the beach forcing the Abu Dhabi trip to come to a merciful end. Of course that ending doesn't arrive until after the four are almost strung up by their thumbs for wearing revealing clothing and having condoms in their purses. There's another scene where Arab women wear \"the spring collection\" underneath their burqa; because, you know, it's not hot in the UAE. Then there are repeated scenes of the \"good-natured\" ladies abusing their status before a pod of butlers. The whole treatment of the Arab world is just frightfully ignorant. You'd think college-educated women from the multitudinous island of Manhattan would be a little more culturally sensitive.I hate this movie. I hate the story, I hate the characters, I hate the episodic flow of it and I hate the offensive mentality of it. Sex and the City 2 is a broad, grotesque spectacle that can't hold sway with a seasoned fan let alone anyone who didn't grow up with HBO. It's scary to think that the best thing that one can say about a movie of this caliber is it features a 64-year-old Liza Minnelli singing a Beyonce Knowles song. Avoid this film like a pair of counterfeit pumps.",

We get the concept here, as we have for 12 years: Charlotte is the pampered stay-at-home mom and wife who apparently \"needs a break\". A break? From what? She has a full-time nanny! Anyways, I digress. Samantha is the usual sex fiend who can't keep her zipper closed for more than a day at a time. Miranda is the overly-feminist lawyer/mom who tries to balance life and work (again, as we've seen for 12 years) and Carrie just can't decide if she wants to be the single party gal or a married woman. I understand the need to break away and find solace to do her writing. As a writer myself, I can see that. But then she turns a suggestion of Big's to stay in, wear sweats and watch TV into a threat to her Prada/Gucci-filled go-out-every-night lifestyle. The movie is filled with the usual lame one-liners. \"Lawrence of my labia?\" Samantha, are you serious? After the dreadful and completely pointless gay wedding, we're whisked off to the mid east where Carrie can't stay faithful for a week and Charlotte turns into a bumbling nitwit in search of cheezy trinkets for her kids. When they were running through the streets incognito and discover a group of women who wear designer clothes under their robes/gowns (yeah, right) my stomach churned with agony. We get the characters and the storyline already and nothing ever really changes. An amazing show turned into a sequel with a plot so painfully replayed I truly hope they put SATC to bed already (no pun intended).",

I left feeling good and not that I'd wasted my money. It was funnier and had less drama than the first by a mile. I prefer SATC when it's funny. Situations with Samantha have the most hilarity (when you're facing menopause yourself, then you'll understand) but all the ladies who lunch are fabulous. The costumes/clothes are wonderful, most of the time. Since we're in the mist of economic hard times, it's fun to watch people get all dressed up in those clothes. It's an escape from reality.The technical aspects of the film, such as the cinematography is wonderful, and the set design was very, very nice. Some parts of the story could have been written differently; wasn't that crazy about how things were set up for Carrie meeting a certain former flame in a foreign land. My first rating was a 7, but after thinking about this another day longer, put it up to an 8/10.",

However, there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this sequel, except for the eye candy created by master costume director Pat Field, for which I give the movie two stars. The marriage of the two main gay characters from the series seems completely random and out of place. The person next to me in the theater actually said aloud, \"you've got to be kidding me.\" The \"humor\" of the movie takes the form of astoundingly bad clich\u00e9s and puns. The \"Real Housewives of Abu Dhabi?\" The \"Jude Law?\" Really? The film's portrayal of Muslim culture is uninformed, patronizing, and downright insulting. The climax of the movie, which consists of Samantha flipping off a bunch of conservative Muslim men, was incredibly uncomfortable to watch. I was wincing and squirming in my seat for much of the movie. Regardless of Mr. King's feelings on the treatment of women in the UAE, SATC is not the appropriate venue for addressing these concerns, especially when done in such a crude and seemingly uninformed manner. Overall, an insult to the loyal viewers of the series. I can't imagine the four female leads are proud of this film, especially since in real life they seem to be intelligent and informed women.",

            "content": "When I watched the first SATC movie I thought it was awful and wanted to throw things at the screen because Carrie was so whiny, girlish and just didn't care about anything the man she loved had to say. But a few days ago I saw SATC2. It was so boring that half way through I went out and bought a snack, since there was no end in sight. I went out during Aidan and Carrie's date, which was supposed to be a turning point in the movie.So what was wrong in it? During the NY events: Carrie sees Big bringing a bag of takeout food as this huge tragedy, an insult to their high life. She bullies him into going out because she misses the glitz and glam (you'd think they live in the slums, not a million-dollar apartment.) She complains that he didn't buy her jewelry for their anniversary but something based on a romantic memory. Samantha takes 1000 pills a day - I understand she's 50 but not even my 85-year-old grand-grandmother didn't pop that many.The Abu Dhabi stuff: The desert-walking and camel-riding outfits were downright ridiculous. Cleavage and jewelry? Are you trying to set yourselves on fire? The outfit Carrie's wearing when she meets Aidan involves a \"I love Chanel\" t-shirt, which is at close as you get to a human billboard. I didn't hate the idea of the Muslim women wearing fashionable clothes under the burqas but id made absolutely no sense - why hold the fashion club in the most populated and poor area of the city? I mean if you can afford $5000 per outfit you DO NOT live in a little dark, poor, hidden room. The resort where they're staying is SO kitschy but still they act overwhelmed by every single thing they see. Half of the movie they walk around amazed and nothing happens in the meantime. It like: look, we can ride the camels, we have 4 private cars, we can('t) sing, we travel super-1st class, we walk around in these horrible outfits that cost more than you can afford to pay for clothes in 5 years - we're so cooool! So what if the world economy is going to hell, we are fabulous. It doesn't matter this movie makes no sense, just LOOK at us.What I found most upsetting about this movie was the women's behaviour. They are portrayed as successful, intelligent, experienced women. They're supposed to be sophisticated and educated - then how come they behave like 15 year-olds? Don't they know the rules of the Middle East? Is this the first time out in the world so they can't manage without embarrassing themselves at every move? Most of these women are older than my mom; if my mom ever behaved like they did, I'd crawl into a hole and never come out. Ever.Carrie kisses Aidan and immediately calls Big to tell him? What is this, Saved by the Bell? Since this movie is supposed to be empowering women, why is Charlotte whining about the hard life of the 2-kids housewife with nanny and housekeeper? I mean, what does she actually DO when she's not making cupcakes wearing designer clothes? The line \"I can't do it with all this help, so how to the women who need to manage alone do it?\" is artificial and basically apologizes for Charlotte's story line.The one thing I loved about this movie was Carrie's black silk dress, the one she wears when she goes out with Aidan. It's simply gorgeous. Oh, which brings me to one detail that has been bugging me since the very beginning of the series: Carrie/SJP is u-g-l-y. Ugly. There, I said it.I hope they do make SATC3 -- seeing stupid things can be a lot of fun.",

The lack of ideas reflected on the reviews that - fair enough - rated the movie one of the worst titles of 2010.There's a moment in the movie that defines its entire 146 minutes when Carrie reads a review of her newest book which says that \"she would be better advised to explore the value of silence\" and a cartoon with a cross-tape in her mouth is shown. That moment happens a little too late when the movie is absolutely boring with nothing more interesting to add. While Darren Starr wrote it for Carrie, it fits perfect for Darren himself because there's no reason for the existence of S&TC anymore. It's paradoxical the fact that someone as Carrie became famous writing about the single life and the search of the love happiness and now became just another old and bold housewife.The movie is awful since its opening credits with letters using diamond and sparkling textures, an outrageous gay marriage, Liza Minelli singing and dancing Beyonce's Single Ladies in a appearance that she should had avoid for the sake of her career and 4 gals walking on the desert like on a runway using horrible clothes that not even the richest fashionist woman in the world would have the dignity to use.Everything in the movie is exacerbated to a shameful level. It's impossible to watch. Poor dialogs, infamous moments and 4 actresses that seems to don't know what they're doing and where they are going.Sex And The City is now old and bold as Carrie Bradshaw became. It's no secret that it's time to let them go and stop trying to destroy the best of them that still in our memories.",

In the span of 2 years the apple has fallen too far from the tree. This film has no resemblance to its predecessor nor the series. The characters have totally lost the plot and their personalities, not to mention their sense of style, intelligence and self respect.The movie starts off on a bad note already with a very clich\u00e9d, airy-fairy overly stereotypical gay wedding which in the real series never would have happened, because these characters totally despised each other and had absolutely nothing in common. So from the start it is obvious the writer was out of ideas as to plot and storyline, killing the film's credibility in the first 10 minutes.There are also unfunny offensive 'jokes' as well as ghastly wardrobe choices, and an unnatural Stepford Wife-like robotness to all the characters.SATC2 oozes desperation from every orifice: The desperate writer Michael Patrick King who couldn't come up with anything worthy of a movie; The whole production team and actors desperate to cash in on the success of the first film. Then the characters: desperate gay 'couple' who settle for each other with no intention of faithfulness; age-fearing Samantha desperately trying to stop menopause; desperate Carrie still in search of the fairy-tale perfect man that real life will never deliver; Miranda desperately trying to prove herself equal with men in her career while sacrificing family; and Charlotte desperately clinging to her perfect WASP designer life, breaking down when she cannot keep up appearances with two little children.SATC2 is these shallow characters putting their vanity, ignorance and stupidity on display and when they land in Morocco (or Abu Dhabi as we are supposed to believe) the movie becomes an unwatchable cringe-fest. SATC2 not only showcases the intended ignorance of the characters but also the unintended blatant ignorance of the writer and all the people involved. The cultural gaffes are just too many to list. Let's just say it is the epitome of the 'ugly American tourist': rude, stupid, ignorant, naive and self-aggrandizing to the core.I also don't understand why the makers insisted on setting the movie in Abu Dhabi even though they were not allowed to film there and instead shot in Morocco. Why hype and deride a city, country, and culture they have never been to and know nothing about? Why not just set it in Morocco, a country which itself is beautiful and culturally rich but cosmopolitan enough for these western women to enjoy on some level? It just doesn't make sense unless the makers were intentionally trying to mislead the viewers to think that the UAE though rich is an anti-female stone-age 'evil-muslim' backwater? (Which of course could not be further from the truth). If that's the case, then SATC2 is nothing but an American propaganda film, which makes it even sadder than it already is.",

At the same time, I think they made middle east look much more glamorous than what it really is. Thanks to the power of Hollywood.With regards to the movie itself, I think it was funny, very colorful, glamorous and beautiful. I loved loved loved the clothes, the material and the fashion they used were astonishing. Yes, they magically solved all the issues without creating too much drama, but is that really that big a deal? What's wrong with knowing that sometimes, the dramas that we make for ourselves aren't really that big a deal, and there could be happy ending??I don't think they showed Carrie as a bad character and Big as a good character, they showed that men become boring after marriage, and also showed that Carrie was honest enough to admit even the slightest fling she felt with Aiden.I am not a fan of drama myself, I have loved Sex and the City TV shows for years, I own the DVDs and watch them all the time. I personally didn't like the first movie that much because I think it was very sad,, ,but the fun came back with the second movie.In my opinion: Samantha was fabulous as ever, she didn't want to change herself for anybody else, and she had the courage to stand up for herself in the middle of angry men. Miranda was brave enough to quit her job and show the hand to her abusive boss, and at the end, after taking some time off for herself, she found a better job where the atmosphere was more accepting to the person she really was.

It makes a mockery of the characters and everything this franchise once stood for. When the TV series kicked off we had these four independent smart sexy women living in New York City facing the same challenges all women face - romantically, sexually and professionally. The end of the series gave each of the ladies a satisfying happy ending, where each embarks on a different chapter in her life. The first film brought them back, three years later, and we got to see them in a new light - dealing with finally settling down into the lives they'd always wished for that didn't quite turn out as planned. The second film brings them back, 2 happy endings and 2 years later, and it tries to be different from the first film. Perhaps trying to improve upon the slightly depressing tone of the first film, Sex and the City 2 tries to be more funny, more flashy and more colorful. It holds on for dear life to this notion that these women's happy endings must not be disturbed. Their relationships, their success and their life stories seem to be etched in stone now, making any attempt to create some sort of conflict in the actual plot of the film seem contrived, unnecessary and mostly foolish. The characters are reduced to self-indulgent, materialistic bitches that fail to be satisfied by absolutely everything - since they have it all: the money, the clothes, the husbands. At some point in the film you go from loving these characters to just hating their rich behinds. I presume the makers of this farcical sequel thought they'd try to take our minds off from our sad little recession-hit lives by taking us on an all expenses paid trip with the girls to Abu Dhabi. What they seem to have completely lost is their storytelling ability and a way to reach out to the audience. (not to mention that the title of the series is Sex and the City, the city being New York City, but what can we do - it's an all expenses paid trip after all) While the makers of the film focus on delivering ridiculous puns and changing the ladies' outfits in every consecutive scene, no one seems to have been the slightest bit concerned that not only has the film lost the plot, it's lost touch with reality. Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte are no longer every woman. They are Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte, the rich bigoted American feminists who have it all. They have become...celebrities. Are we supposed to be happy for them? For the sake of the show, yes. But do you really want to watch them rub it in your face along with awful puns and Liza Minnelli singing \"Single Ladies\" by Beyonce? No. I wish I hadn't.",

There were dashes of politics mixed with a Carrie-esquire look at the challenges that arise in maturing relationships, and the whole thing was wrapped in the high-fashion confection we've come to expect from the show. I felt the characters, who had wandered off to weird places in the first movie, were back in fine form--especially Samantha. There are cornball turns of phrases, insider jokes, and winks and nods, but again, this is all very much in keeping with the original HBO series. If you're expecting Fellini, then this ain't the flick for you. But you should have already had 10+ years to figure that out.

At least his present was from the heart, since the story behind it was that he enjoyed watching an old movie with her the other day.

I mean, after a long day at work he decides to make Carrie happy and go with her to a movie premiere. I mean, c'mon, this guy is doing everything to make her happy. And what does she do?

At no point did she stop to think. I mean,even though she was never perfect in the series, she was someone who would stop and ask herself rhetorical questions every five minutes. For someone with so much experience in relationships, she was so stupid. The other characters were also equally dumb, Miranda was maybe the only one that was still half normal.All in all, I just wish the producers of this film would have stayed true to the characters and focused on what really mattered instead of trying to impress us with a bunch of superficial things, which in the end, made everything in the movie look shallow.",

But come on...do intelligent,accomplished career women actually act like these women? I would hope not. What firm or business would tolerate them being around...imagine the rumors. The insecurities of each of them were too extreme as well...none seemed capable of meeting a decent guy or establishing a lasting relationship. Mr. Big...who we all know is Carries' man...never seemed to care he was leading her on...and well...she let him..dropping everything whenever he showed up. What a pig...despite his money and good looks. Does being a career woman...a successful one mean you also drink too much worry about designer clothes and shoes? Sounds unappealing to me. Sending a message to women that is you are successful you will have to be like one of these ladies is ridiculous. I hope there is not a 3rd sequel planned..that would be a waste of time.",

Gratuitous product placement takes the place of writing, and an elaborate and pointless musical number featuring Liza Minnelli derails the film from the start. For die-hard fans who can't get enough of SATC, this film may be the cure.

It was a funny, good jokes (Charloote drunk was great, camel-toe was funny, and some other good jokes)but it did not feel like the last movie or the show I loved. Not many Carrie voice-overs about how she feels which I loved from the T.V. show. No drama really, Big being mad lasted 10 minutes and they could have made it more interesting how they solve their problems. I feel like I just got robbed, not for the $10.50 I paid but the chance to develop the relationships between the girls and their relationships with their husbands. I am so sick, so disappointed, and can not believe that the movie was so lame. If your a fan, go see the early show to save some money. And for the people that are intested and want to see the movie, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Wait for the DVD. I hope the Sex and The City 3 gets back to the shows roots and what we all want, not some vacation movie that has almost no plot.This review is coming from a fan that has the entire DVD set of all 6 seasons and the Blu-Ray of Sex and The City:1.

The only main good things in the movie is the acting, production design and music. For the storyline is seems like it should be nominated for Worst Screenplay and Worst Sequel and win both Razzies. It might be time to end the Sex and the City universe and the 40-something foursome unless they can get back on track with Sex and the City 3 and hopefully be as enjoyable as the TV-show and the first movie. If not then I would have lost all faith in good characters that get ruined in some future sequel. In some parts of the movie I was totally bored while in others I was quite happy because of some brief spirit back from the Sex and the City TV show. In my personal opinion this movie sequel is just an excuse to bring the brilliant foursome back along with great costumes and beautiful scenery, if only there could have been a proper script then it could have been just a long special episode like the first film",

            "content": "Summary: Good not great. If you miss the ladies, you'll want to see it regardless.The 1st sex and the city movie was a gem to me. I loved it, I thought it was bright and all us SATC fans were dying to catch up with the characters and where they'd been since the series. There were also surprises in it Steve cheating!, the way Carrie gets left at the alter, Charlotte pregnant.SATC2 had none of that in my opinion.NO SURPRISES: I really wasn't surprised about anything. Aidan is back (OK we all knew that), Charlotte gets a nanny, Miranda quits her job, nothing really earth shattering here.WHY: I had heard about Penelope Cruz being in this movie for a while now and that she would be a potential other love interest for BIG. While I don't care much for her I thought, hmm OK, interesting twist, I can see a good complication there for Carrie. Nope. She was there for 1 scene -maybe 5 mins and poof no more Penelope. I ask myself, really? Why was she even in the movie? They could have hired any good looking woman with decent acting skills to play that role. I kept thinking she would pop up again later (possibly BIG cheating on Carrie with Penelope after hearing her Aidan news) but it never happened. Pointless.SMITH: Why tease the audience with Smith reconnecting with Samantha if he wasn't going to even be a real part of this story? Other than him helping Sam connect with the guy wanting to build hotels he wasn't really in this movie. Again, huh? Pointless deux.A PLUS: SATC2 does have something going for it that the original did not. The characters were more themselves this time around--or rather more in line with the personalities seen on the series were. I always felt the 1st movie was great but the characters were a wee bit different, almost too evolved. I missed these girls more--they were funnier.The Clothes: I'm not sure why I've seen repeated reviews about the clothes sucking in this movie because I have to disagree. I thought they were great. Fashion is ever evolving and I happen to think Pat Fields did a great job keeping these girls looking great but all with their distinct personal style. Great to see Miranda not looking 100 percent perfect all the time and having some casual attire moments. She was way way too dressy in the 1st one (although stylishly so). And Carrie back to wearing see thru dresses with visible panties, tacky but that was the Carrie I remember, glad to see that part of her still exists!BIG and Carrie: Loved seeing them together more and their domestic issues. I think the best part of their scenes came when he picked her up at her old place. There was a collective awww in the crowd. Loved it. Though I think BIG forgave her too fast for the kiss, but whatever. And is it me or is Chris Noth looking 50 million times better than the 1st movie. He lost weight and is looking great!General Plot: A bit all over the place in my opinion. I think they were trying to do too much at once and I don't think it always worked. I also think that most of the fans, love the New York of SATC and would have preferred to spend most of the time there versus abu dhabi. I would have also loved to see Carrie writing more. Did we really see her writing much at all in this movie? Blink and you missed it.Lastly: Was anyone else wondering why those Liza Minelli scenes lasted so long? And was anyone else as disturbed as I was? No offense to the Liza fans but eh...I think we could have done without most of it. Just like the girls singing. It was cute, but did it need to go on so long?In Short: Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie but I'm not sure it lived up to my expectation of what I had hoped it would be. The ladies themselves were in fine form though. Personally better than they were the 1st go round. They may want to take more time creating a better script (as with the 1st one) if they decide to do a SATC3.",

That SAMANTHA's assistant didn't up and walk after witnessing her boss shove hormones up her @$%& and, to add insult to unsanitary injury, use a touch screen. Seriously. 7. \"Interfriention\"?

She always looks so glamorous throughout the movie as do the other woman. All the characters are unique and different but all friends and it is so interesting to see all of their personalities blend together. This was better than the first and better than the TV show! I loved seeing them in another countries interacting with the other cultures. Many thought they were being prejudice and that Americans don't always respect other cultures. There is some truth to that in that Americans tend to think they are superior and that they were visiting another country and just mocking them for wearing burqa (is that what they call the coverings?)but they later made friends with them and learned something about them.While I am not for woman covering themselves (and perhaps many women in that country are not either) I do not feel it would be my place to visit a country and point and mock their culture, but I think they were taught that these housewives had personalities and opinions and refuting any stereotypes they might have. I can honestly say I have never even heard of that country they visited, but it was awesome to see it. I loved the part at the end when Carry gave the butler money to visit his wife. There were some faults of the movie, like they never really explained what happened to Aidan. (By the way he changed; I thought it was a different actor until I heard his voice). They were vague about why Davis resolved her feelings about the nanny; I thought they were implying she was a lesbian, but I was not clear. Also when the one (I forgot her name) but you will know what I mean, went to jail, they never explained where her boyfriend went and why he was not helping her out, like if he was in jail it would not be his fault But he was back with her at the end. Also, some of the scenarios make you unsympathetic of the characters but they are comical, and make you laugh. Like when Davis got the kids painted hands on her skirt cause she wanted her mother to give her more attention, I was laughing. I know how stressful kids could be, but its hard to be sympathetic to a woman who's biggest problem is a ruined skirt (who wears a designer skirt around the home, and that did not seem like her personality in the show or other movie) but yes I know she was really stressed about caring for a baby and it was nice that they showed her like a real mom, I liked how she was not so perfect like she seemed in the first movie. And as far as sympathy goes, she was a stay at home mom with a nanny. Staying home with kids is stressful, but she has hired help. And there whining over having to ride coach was a little annoying, oh my coach, the one who did most of the whining used to be a bar tender, but she is above riding coach? Now it just sounds like I bashed the movie, and most of these things are what made the movie funny. Still all in all it was an interesting movie with great acting.",

Carrie Bradshaw, always an acquired taste, has become even more equine looking. Miranda look s like Miranda only slightly feeble and Charlotte York has managed to remain quite the boring character. It is the dialogue though that makes one cringe. Beginning with every gay clich\u00e9 known to gay man, including a visitation from Liza Minnelli, you would swear this was written from a straight man's version of what gay life must be like. Not worry, it gets deeply, deeply heterosexual as move into the Middle East, where Samantha, who is revealed as a sex addict, gets into trouble because, she is in Muslim country. The fact that these American women seem to be dressing for Anna Wintour not tourism in a country where they could actually get hurt seems besides the point. There are a lot of sub-layers to this film: women's rights, motherhood, relationships, even a passing glance at the difference in cultures throughout the world, but like everything Sex in the City its light, light, light. And sometimes, it's hard to discern light from stupid and so much of this film felt stupid.",

            "content": "The movie was GREAT even better than the first one we went with 10 girls and all love it (our ages are from 20 to 30- so as you can tell our ages are the most suitable for the movie) To be honest I don't know where to begin with.. all these negative comments are just horrible i am sure that any of you who said the movie sucked, never been a truly SATC fan, or to be precise never watched an episode! Guys this is SEX AND THE CITY. It is self- explanatory. How come go to a movie like than and expect cheap clothes or crying over emotional sadness are you out of your minds? This is a fiction if your looking for something more profound go and see the little children! The movie has always been superficial in a way. ALWAYS BEEN SINCE 1998. Its about sex its about fashion and it about women. It is not about reality or situations that we are in. Our only common point is that we are all women and we have the same problems ( children, boring job, marriage issue) and this movie express these issues with a sense of humour. How can you expect Samantha Jones to be serious and crying, of course if you ever watched and episode, and in your case its clear you did not! Definitely go and see the movie, it is better than the first one. It made me laugh so many times and I was almost crying even. It has every value in the movie. It leaves you with a thought and a shopping urge. I highly recommend the movie. PS: I did not even have an account.I just got it to write this comment because the negative comments made me so angry. I can watch it over and over again.",

The movie was recorded on high-def cameras so you can see everything in amazing realism, and believe me, that's not Carrie and her friends wanted you to see. First of all, women in her mid-fifties (Samantha is 52, the actress portraying her is 54 in 2010) acting like girls in her early twenties. The blu-ray painfully shows the wrinkles, the flaccid skin, etc. Very sad.... Second, the movie locations. While some scenes were actually filmed in Morocco (not Abu Dhabi for sure), many of them were recorded in the studio and you can easily tell that was all fake stuff. It just did not feel real, just like a bad soap opera. Third, the countless bad jokes (not one single laugh!). Very different from the TV show and even the first movie. And by jokes I mean the little gags Samantha throws at men, and some of the ridiculous behaviors in the movie that just denigrate women and gay in general. Fourth, a terrible plot, no story, no character development. The whole thing just felt like a bad Abu Dhabi advertisement, including unnecessary offenses to Muslim religion. Finally, the worst: the ending leaves the story open. I just pray that Sex and the City 3 does not come along. For the sake of a good TV show that had its time, I hope S&C2 did not turn a good profit. Time to move on Carrie! Like a New Yorker critic wrote about her book in the movie, time to go for the silence vow...",

            "content": "This movie got dreadful reviews, so I was curious to judge for myself. I am assuming that nobody would go and watch \"Sex & the City\" expecting any serious sort of entertainment. Consequently, I was surprised to read the poisonous review of film critics who suddenly realized that Carrie & co. are selfish, spoiled and hedonistically interested only in themselves. This should come as no surprised to anybody familiar with SATC. Anyway, back to the movie: it offers a couple of hours of entertainment without any pretense of being taken seriously. That is, apart from the product placement \u2013 I am sure somebody is expecting you to invest big cash in shoes and handbags. However, if you are not easily lured into spending big bucks, it is a relatively safe experience. For me, it was like one of those fantasy movies of the 30's, with Carole Lombard as a millionaire heiress and William Powell as her butler. It is an escapist fantasy for people living during hard times and Willing to spend a couple of hours without worrying about the future \u2013 just like during the Depression. Hundreds of such escapist movies were churned out during the Depression and nowadays they are considered classic.I do not want to imply that SATC2 is in any way a classic, but neither is the horrendous movie described by critics. My guess is they were so negative because they would like to live like Carrie & co., but cannot afford it. In fact, not many of us can, but some of us can at least be so sincere as to admit that living like them looks more fun than being a missionary in a rundown village without electricity or running water. Sainthood is not for everyone\u0085I also understand the choice of Middle East as an area relatively untouched by the world economic crisis and as a good location for a luxury fantasy. Having written this I must add that indeed the product placement, the fashion and the greed of the ladies are OTT and feel a bit nauseating. I will not even tackle the subject of disrespect and the Muslim traditions, because it truly does not make any sense in this context.Conclusion: Many critics love violent, dark movies such as the Batman franchise and other action movies. Apparently there is never too much blood, too many car chase scenes or too many bullets flying around. Brutality is always easier to tolerate than frivolity\u0085..I do wonder why\u0085..",

Trouble is, women like her exist in this world and I see them all the time - that's the saddest and maybe most angering thing about this movie, that such self-absorbed, self-entitled women do exist.Carrie shows utter disappointment when Big gets them state-of-art flat screen TV for their bedroom as an anniversary present. Instead of \"thank you\" she tells him - tells him! - that \"a piece of jewelry would have been nice.\" The reason he got them the darn TV was that he had found it nice to lie in bed with her in a hotel room and watch old movies *she* likes together.The women just look aged and they try to remain young, which is sad.

Then we forgot about it until tonight when it appeared on HBO. As we watched the end of The Shawshank Redemption on AMC I noticed that she had a movie recording on the DVR. Once she told me she was recorded this abomination I knew we had to watch it confirm just how bad it truly was.It was worse than Maya Angelou or Robert Frost could possibly describe. Seeing as I do not have their command of the English language let me just say that my wife (who is the biggest SATC fan I know) said \"oh my God this is awful\" before the movie was half over and every 10 minutes thereafter. It was superficial, materialistic and full of lame dialogue. When my wife asked me if the girls were even pretty I couldn't even answer in the affirmative.Our favorite line was when Samantha fawned over some guy she just met and used the term \"Lawrence of my labia\". Then the girls fell over in laughter. Charlotte got upset because her daughter ruined a vintage skirt. Why was she wearing it while making cupcakes is the real question. Miranda is such a complainer I'm sure she has trouble getting ass in real life just because her character is so annoying. And the opening scene was a 20 minute gay wedding. The Godfather it was not.Bottom line: there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. Neither woman nor man, young nor old, liberal nor conservative will find anything to like about it. Unless you just like laughing at horrible filmmaking. In that case maybe this does stand up to The Godfather.",

Opens at a gay wedding where Carrie is a best man. After the celebration is over Carrie struggles to get her husband to move off the coach. She focuses on writing and agrees to some time apart. When Samantha receives opportunity to travel to an Arabian country she invites the others along. Director Michael Patrick King made the first film as well as being involved in the successful TV show. The girls all go through many wardrobe changes from glittery and glamour to the outright forbidden. Sarah Jessica Parker leads the cast as Carrie, who knows fashion and success but becomes trapped in possible infidelity when an ex appears on the same vacation. Her handling of this is one of the film's honor moments. Kim Cattrall spits out the sexual dialogue at every moment until her outrageous behaviour gains her unwanted attention from authorities. This is an interesting reference to culture and specific laws but unfortunately Samantha's last scene features her beneath a naked male atop a jeep in erotica. Cynthia Nixon leaves a cruel job and takes charge of trip activities. Kristin Davis worries about her gorgeous young nanny and the attention she spurns but the handling of this is a cheap contrivance. Chris Noth plays Carrie's husband and they are on the verge of the next step in their relationship. Not as good as the original but it does ask questions regarding the sequel of marriage vows.

            "content": "While I can't say this was a good movie, I'll say it was an enjoyable one. I laughed, and I even cried during a surprisingly heartfelt scene between Charlotte and Miranda. But I'll qualify that by adding that I made a decision before watching it that I wasn't going to think about the film too much. As someone who regularly studies issues of feminism, gay rights, race & ethnicity, etc., movies are easily ruined for me, so I decided to put all that aside for just one night.That being done, the movie was a spectacle, and it was fun. It oscillated between some more serious issues (e.g., Charlotte getting frustrated with her kids but feeling as though she's not allowed to complain about it because it'll make her a bad mother; or Carrie worrying that she and Big are becoming a boring married couple) and indulgent arrays of couture, luxury resorts, male eye candy, and snarky one-liners.Many reviewers have noted that the film is offensive in its portrayal of the UAE. I would have to amend this statement by saying Samantha is offensive to the UAE. Miranda tries very hard to be the good American tourist and does obsessive research in advance, learns about the words and customs, and tries (about 20 times throughout the movie) to keep Samantha covered. Charlotte and Carrie try to follow her example. Samantha not so much. You don't get a lot of glimpses of the city beyond the hotel, and hotels in Abu Dhabi and Dubai are often more tailored toward what tourists want to see than actual representations of the culture. Yes there were servants and belly dancers and lots of Orientalism, but from what I've seen of luxury resorts in the Middle East (and in other countries), that's how you lure wealthy American tourists. I did get uncomfortable, at times, with Samantha's behavior. I loved her in the first movie, when they finally developed her into a 3-dimensional character. Now we're back to the Samantha of the TV show, pre-final season.I also have to say, I like that there is a film out there that takes women in their 40s and 50s and shows them still living life beyond the husband. By that I mean so many films featuring female characters end with the girl getting the guy. It's nice to see someone at least attempt to explore what happens beyond that. It may be someone obsessing over her marriage, or someone being afraid she's selling out if she takes a break from work, or someone still trying to live the fabulous single life when she's past menopause (which, aside from Blanche Devereaux, we haven't seen that much of), and this film may not be the most valiant effort, but at least it's something.Final thoughts on this film: if you loved the show not for any in-depth feminist questions it raised, but to see girls having fun, wearing great clothes, and living exciting lives, you'll probably like the film a lot. If you loved the show at all, you'll probably at least enjoy the film.If you can set aside the fact that a group of four women going on a camel ride through the desert need one set of outfits for the limo ride to the camels, one set for riding the camels (all couture), and one set for lunch under a tent during a camel-ride break, and just roll with it, then nothing should stop you from seeing this film.",

Carrie is bored with her rich, wealthy, charming husband that she chased for 10 years before he finally put a ring on her finger. The guy works all day? He's not allowed to come home and hang out on the couch? Sorry Carrie. That's what people do. They don't walk around in designer clothes and high heels and hit a party every night. And they don't put on bad eyeliner and hit on their married ex-boyfriends. Miranda, now that she has her husband back, is annoyed about her 6 figure job. You're a lawyer.

You wait ages for the 'sex' to get going and then its about as thrilling as watching afternoon repeats of 'Murder She Wrote'. What I found really offensive is that women have for years whined incessantly about being stereotyped in major motion pictures as brainless sex objects, yet here they are being featured that way all over again and they don't seem to mind. I was reminded of the 1977 feature film of 'Are You Being Served'. You know the sort of thing: \"hey, we're in a movie! Let's go abroad!\", but at least that flick had the gorgeous ( and alas deceased ) Wendy Richard as compensation. 'S.A.T.C. 2' has nothing.

I think I prefer them younger and more frivolous. It didn't seem right to see Carrie fretting about furniture. At 2 and half hours this is way too long and whilst the budget is bigger, the story is light and not very exciting. In fact nothing really happens and what does is overly predictable and some a little cheesy - the girls singing 'I am Woman' at karaoke made me cringe, as did the 'gag' of the girls wearing burka's at the end.There are some things to enjoy: there are still some amazing clothes (although, some of the outfits they wore whilst visiting Abu Dhabi, seemed stupidly over the top: the outfit Carrie wears to the souk was outrageous). There is plenty of gayness: in fact Liza Minelli singing and dancing to Beyonce's 'Single Ladies' at a gay wedding that also has a gay mens chorus and white swans may be the gayest thing ever on film. But despite this there is something lacking. It feels flat and rather flaccid compared to the TV series. The sex talk has gone, the sex scenes and flesh are very tame and there isn't the cracking one liners (it is Samantha who has the best declaring a new man will be her 'Lawrence of her labia'). But there isn't as much fun in it and some of it bordered on cheap gags-the nanny and her bouncing bossum for instance, it's not Benny Hill...this and much else seemed way beyond something Sex would have done in it's original format.It's also a shame that they felt they had to drag all the characters into this, Aiden being in Abu Dhabi as well, just seemed too convenient, but then if that had happened, there really wouldn't have been much else to the story. I'm not sure they should hang their Manolo's up, but they should certainly consider changing into something a little more comfortable.More of my reviews at my site: iheartfilms.weebly.com",

            "content": "Like many other reviewers, I was a BIG fan of the series, and although the first movie wasn't great, and despite the mediocre (being nice) initial reviews, I decided to give this a go. So I settled in with two girlfriends, and all it took was the first setting of Stanford and Anthony's wedding to know this wasn't going to be anything like the series and I'm amazed this was actually by the same people. As Carrie said later in the movie \"I don't think we're in Kansas anymore\". My friends and I watch disbelieving as Liza Minelli \"performed\" Beyonce, and a couple of strangers told Carrie and Big they were basically doomed to be lonely or bad people just for not wanting children. We were shocked, and I have to say, embarrassed. The high point was the re-emergence of Smith. A high point which lasted all of 4, 5 minutes?! Then pretty inexplicably we're off to UAE, and Miranda was treating us to Abu Dhabi for Dummies for most of the remainder of the film. Aidan's re-appearance felt completely contrived, against character and un-needed, and he disappeared again just as non-sensically. Samantha managed to insult an entire culture, and apparently get away with it - and I'm sorry, the character was never stupid, nor that dismissive of culture and beliefs. It felt completely pointless and against all previous laws of SATC. The best part, and I did genuinely laugh, was Charlotte being drunk. And if that's the best part, then we're in trouble. So Carrie loses her passport, and miraculously it's still in the market, so endeth another 2 minute plot. And the girls escape an angry mob by yet again insulting the culture before the end of the movie which again seemed to come from nowhere and dis-count the previous 2 hours... All in all, a very big disappointment, against the series and characters, non-sensical and pointless plots, embarrassing and uncomfortable at times. At its height SATC was never about full on comedy, it was real life drama that we could relate to. My friend turned to me at the end and said \"I didn't know we were watching a Carry On film\", and I couldn't have put it better myself.",

            "content": "I have never written a movie review before, but I am honestly too frazzled with the extraordinary ignorance of \"critics.\" I will be the first to admit that the execution of this movie could have been better; I would have liked to to see greater development on Miranda and Carrie's story lines (they missed a great opportunity there.) I do not believe the movie built an adequate momentum to support its very promising premise. Additionally, I think they should have fleshed out how Big stepped-in to quell Carrie's concerns. This movie speaks to the very old axiom about the cathartic nature of reaching life-long goals, the accompanying fears and writing the rules for your own relationship. Personally, I have been in many relationships that have defied convention, the approval of my friends/family, and even sometimes, my own beliefs. This is part of the learning process. (Men typically will not understand this as they expect women to conform to their man's expectations, thus they don't think anything of the difficulties women endure in \"shrinking to fit.\") Everyone has been disappointed by an achievement or milestone not delivering the happiness it foretold. Honestly, it is so easy for everyone to hop on a \"bandwagon,\" following \"critics\" more concerned with how their insulting barbs enhance their own reputations, as opposed to critically evaluating intent and execution. With regards to the \"racist\" nature of the movie, the fact of the matter is that what was portrayed was accurate in terms of Middle-Eastern Culture- women are REQUIRED to dawn those garbs, and Samantha commits an infraction that MANY Americans make by attempting to impose her American culture over the customs of a foreign country. The accusation of racism was made by persons pertaining to that faith and culture, because it is portrayed pejoratively when juxtaposed with American standards. This movie is a Valentine to anyone who has ever feared life's many transitions, not being able to meet new challenges, and/or loosing themselves in the process.",

It took all the charm away and presented a bunch of over the hill photoshopped perfect New Yorkers on a glamorous all expense holiday? I don't want to see that! It was detached from reality and completely over the top. The girls are all well groomed in their perfect little lives with their perfect apartments, loving husbands and massive wardrobe. Yet still find pointless sh*t to complain about, now you're just being a difficult rich b*tch. And then there's Samantha (Cattrall) who's now an overly successful 52 year old child. It makes me cringe.The first scene started on the wrong foot, with cheap gimmicks seen at an exaggerated gay wedding with an ice palace, swans, choir singers and Liza Minnelli. Who looked like she was about to drop dead after her 'single ladies' performance *cringe again*. Followed by eye-rolling, gag worthy and head shaking scenes one after the other. No interesting controversial topics were brought up. No clever cute humour. All in all, a lame over the top exaggeration about nothing.http://musingsandmorsels.weebly.com/",

            "content": "SEX AND THE CITY 2, at its core, has a fairly good story and script by Michael Patrick King (with bows to Candace Bushnell and Darren Star who created the original HBO series) - issues that face older girls post marriage and menopause. But those tidbits get buried in the embarrassingly extravagant production that reeks of misspent funds attempting to make the show a crowd pleaser. It didn't work in the theaters and it doesn't seem to work on DVD. It is especially sad to watch this self-indulgent film because there are some really fine actors involved. Not only is the original quartet of high flying comediennes intact - Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall. Kristin Davis - but the leftover men - David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Jason Lewis, Chris Noth, John Corbett - are also pulled into the redux, each appearing a bit tired of the attempt to update what had been a good show. There is no real story: after an insulting wedding of tow gay men, Samantha is invited to Abu Dhabi for a PR swing and of course she takes her girlfriends along, each of whom is having conflicts in their marriage or mothering status. The trip simply allows for the constant costume changes that are appallingly grotesque to be shown in contrast to the social mores of the Arab Emirates (burka wearing women contrasting with the flamboyant quartet) and many lessons on how to identify the old 'ugly American' tourist. But of course, the trip's influence on the ladies makes them appreciate what their lives are truly like in New York...la la la. There are very brief appearances by Liza Minnelli, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Miley Cyrus, Tim Gunn etc that only seem to underscore the expensive budget of this Redux. If the viewer is able to get past these obstacles and hear the tiny bits of advice for women a la Carrie Bradshaw Preston's journalism, this can be an entertaining evening. It is just not worth the final tab. Grady Harp",

I must confess that I didn't always like the series, I only really started enjoying it from season 4 onwards and then when the first movie came out I was a little disappointed.

I mostly put this down to it being too difficult to make a 20 minute comedy/dramady series engaging enough for the big screen. But, with the sequel they had oodles of spark, one of the few times I actually enjoyed the sequel more than the original. Or could it be, that because the series came first, then the movie and then the sequel, that this actually falls under the \"the 3rd installment is almost always (nearly) as good as the original and waaay better than sequel\" rule?",

And I must admit I was hooked, it had all the same sparkle the show had when It first aired, the cast all accounted for done an amazing job with what they had to work with. Samantha again stole the show with her nympho quips and one liners, Charlotte played up her \"pookeepsied herself\" joke with an all new set of embarrassments, Miranda had lightened up and of course Carrie, is still our Carrie, only she is married and pondering so.

The quality of the writing is decreasing rapidly. These are barely even characters anymore, just stick-figures to hang dresses on and caricatures of their audience. The film-makers are just pandering to women between the ages of 30 and 60 and finding superficial things in the characters for them to relate to. I was disgusted by their constant ass-kissing of their target audience. It was very unnatural, but then again at least they know their target audience, somewhat.Of course the depiction of Abu Dhabi was superficial, but that was to be expected. The entire point of this film was for women to feel empowered and to want to buy expensive clothes. For those of us who see through the disgusting glam, that point is hanging on a very thin understanding of women.Despite the poor writing and embarrassing attempt to please all women, the actors were still able to connect me to these characters and keep me emotionally invested throughout. I was watching because I knew Aidan (John Corbett) was back. They gave me most of the things I wanted to hear but the Aidan-Carrie storyline wasn't exactly what I wanted. And the entire point of the movie was to give us what we wanted! But with a two and a half hour run time, I can guarantee that \"Sex and the City 2\" will give you some of what you wanted, and a lot of stuff that you don't want.",

But I knew that anyway and I watched it with friends in order to laugh our asses off at the crappiness of this commercial garbage. 'Sex and the City' was always a sexist show and of course the films don't deviate from that. As badly as the characters are written, Samantha has been an exception if one can ignore the first movie and Kim Cattrall manages to entertain as well as Cynthia Nixon whose role here is almost nothing. 'Sex and the City 2' mainly focuses on one of the most annoying characters on TV (and now in movies), Carrie Burtshaw. Sarah Jessica Parker just whines and wears so-called-expensive clothes that look quite hideous. She has no sense of fashion nor can she act. One of the most unintentionally funniest sequences were that of the 'New Middle East'. In order to go against stereotype, 'Sex and the City 2' reaches new heights of stupidity.",

It is no longer fun to still portray Samantha as a whore when she is over 50, the arghile scene was let's say, humiliating at best. Charlotte complaining while her face couldn't move and Miranda looking 200... They looked like a complete parody of their former selves.There is a reason this show was a hit... Sexy, professional adult women in the big city.This Abu Dhabi film made it looked like retired, desperate women looking to have sex or complaining about their husbands and flashing clothes and their lifestyle and etc..

It's pretty much SATC, but bigger, better, louder and shinier.Not that it doesn't have flaws. The product placement is, as always, very annoying. The storyline is a bit too much sometimes, and it seems like the story gets out of hand more than once or twice. Carrie's inner monologues have lost their wit and smarts, even though she still delivers great lines when faced with other people. Samantha is her usual self, the one that she's always been. But it's Miranda's and Charlotte's characters that steal the show. Miranda was finally given a chance to sparkle, be fun and brave, something that's been missing in the first part. Davis' performance is extraordinary, and it really shows when York is facing real emotional problems with her family.Overall, it's a gay fantasy - it's bold, sparkling and bigger than life.

Its also a story around taking Carrie's relationship to the next level now she is a married woman, shows motherhood in a relatively true light and Samantha is still Samantha, she doesn't change, which means she is still trying to have sex with anything remotely good looking, has no respect for anything, especially the residents of where she goes on holiday and has to try and come to terms with the fact that maybe she is going through menopause.

Yes the first film was more gritty and emotional but that also made it a bit of a somber experience, whereas this second film had really lightened up and was fun from start to finish. I know a lot of people were disappointed that the girls didn't stay in New York and have complained that there was no storyline, but of course there was! We had already seen the girls in the first film fall in love with their husbands and realise they were the men that they wanted to be with and as they grow older their stresses in their lives move away from having to find the right man, now they need to worry about...... trying to keep the spark alive in a marriage where the husband wants to watch TV.... trying to take care of young children.... having bad bosses at work and feeling unappreciated. This story was about the girls getting away from it all together miles away from home so they were able to unwind, have fun and go back to their lives and families with fresh eyes and appreciate what they have got. Why should the fact that Carrie kissed Aidan turn into a 3 hour problem? Why can't it be solved in 10 minutes by 2 adults who have been together for a zillion years who clearly love each other? Sometimes I think people want drama where it isn't needed and instead should be content with having a giggle and seeing their favourite characters back on the big screen.I went to see this film with 7 of my girlfriends and we all really enjoyed ourselves and had a lovely night out.

Although the characters at time made you want to shake them and scream \"Grow up\" in the end they all had redeemable qualities. While the first movie failed to fully capture the magic of the show it was still enjoyable. Not so with the sequel. It starts off with the marriage of Stanford and Anthony. The wedding really serves no purpose but introduce an extremely nosy couple who make Carrie who was happy before start to question her marriage to Big. The question she has isn't, are we truly happy, or did I marry the right guy. Her question is does the fact that she and Big are not going out every night mean they're are a boring old couple with no social life? So instead of sitting down and talking with her husband like a grown up she runs off to her old apartment to hide for a few days. Miranda mean time is having issues with her boss she quits her job, and thats pretty much Miranda's whole storyline for the rest of the movie, done in the first 20 min. Charlotte finds motherhood to stressful and demanding on her despite the fact that she is a stay at home mom with a live in nanny. When Samantha makes a comment about the always bra less nanny Charlotte starts to worry that her wonderful devoted husband will have an affair. Samantha spends the entire movie trying to keep her sex drive up during menopause. When Samantha is invited by a rich sheik to visit his property in Abu Dabi and possibly do PR for him, something which any smart business woman would have seen as the opportunity of a lifetime, the girls decide to run away from their problems and go with her. Once they are in Abu Dabi the film gets even worse. The sheik is wonderfully generous flying them in first class, giving them the best suite in the hotel, each their own private butler, and every other comfort they could want. Samantha, who is supposed to be a successful business woman, should be treating this trip as a business trip but instead can only think of sex, and thumbing her nose at middle eastern culture. Charlotte is a bumbling idiot the entire trip. Miranda spends the trip trying to keep Samantha from getting thrown in jail for lewd behavior and trying to get the others to have some fun. Carrie mean while is still pondering her marriage. As she was leaving for the trip Big admitted to her he kind of liked the two days off when she left before and thinks they should do that every week. Carrie who started the whole thing by running off in the first place, worries about what this means for their marriage. While in Abu Dabi Carrie runs into Aiden her ex-fianc\u00e9, who she broke up with because he liked to stay in, eat KFC and watch baseball, and Carrie decides he might be the perfect replacement for Big who she's mad at because he likes to stay in, eat Japanese take out, and watch old movies and Deadliest Catch. Their time in Abu Dabi ends with them being asked to leave the hotel because Samantha can not control behavior. While leaving Carrie realizes that she left her passport back in the market place so all four go back for it. Charlotte in the mean time is acting like an idiot again and while being run out of town can only think of getting souvenirs for Harry and the girls. This leads to a scene with Samantha being accused of stealing a purse while her year supply of condoms comes spilling out for all to see. What does Samantha do? Does she do the classy thing and scoop her possession quietly. No she makes a scene and enrages a crowd of angry men. By this time in the movie I was routing for the mob of angry men to kick all but Miranda's ass. The movie then wraps up quickly and neatly with a bunch of voice overs, a quick crappy end to a crappy movie. I once loved Sex in the City. It used to have the best one liners (\"oh my God she's fashion roadkill\" and \"I've been shoe shamed\" were two of my favs) However in this movie we were treated to lame one liners like \"Abu Dabi do\" and \"he's Lawrence of my labia\". I actually cringed in embarrassment when I heard those lines. We also got the totally classy scenes of Samantha in her office with her panties around her ankles rubbing hormone cream on her female parts and later deep throating a pipe in a bar. And don't even get me started in the fashion. This show used to be trend setting with that, but every time Carrie and Samantha came out in a new outfit I heard other women the theater mumble how ugly it was. The writers, producers, and stars of this movie need to stop milking this franchise and let us remember these ladies fondly not as the shrews they've turned them into. If I could rate this lower then a 1 I would. I think Michael Patrick King and Sarah Jessica Parker should have to give everyone who wasted their movie on the movie a refund and an apology.",

The movie far surpassed the first one (which I thought was very good too, but not nearly as good as the 2nd). This movie was total campy fun. Gorgeous men, great story lines, hilarious jokes. We literally laughed throughout almost the entire thing. I had thought the trip to Abu Dahbi (sp?) would be silly, ala any t.v. show when they take a trip somewhere always strikes me as hokey and desperate, but this was just a total blast and great juxtaposition of how THEIR American/New York lifestyle compared with a whole other world of culture and traditions, namely modesty.The movie again dealt with some serious themes however it was told with humor and entertainment. The whole Samantha \"menapause\" thing was just hysterically funny without giving anything away.I won't say much more as it's not necessary. If you've followed the show and the series you know what you're in for. If you are at all a fan and even if you're not I feel women AND men would find this movie to be wildly entertaining and a ton of fun.",

You should not expect something really that sensible from a movie which was rooted to a series that was, well, more focused about sex and having fun. It actually looked like a real midlife crisis for all the characters. I know all of you would have the same problems or worst if you reached the characters' age. When people get old, they become sensitive and insecure about things. You couldn't blame anyone from being paranoid because of marriage. What more for these women who were used to living as the life of the party and all glamorous and top-rated professionals in their own field, right. Give it a break! It wouldn't hurt to just appreciate a little piece of reality shown in this film. If they're making SATC3, I hope they give Samantha a lifetime partner, too.",

The series were really good, and with most things: it's good to quit at your peak. Now, SATC The Movie 2 was even more disappointing than the first movie. Overall it was really bad acting, no funny jokes, and not needed scenes in the Middle East, where especially the scene with Samantha getting all loco on the streets didn't do any justice for her character. I feel sorry for Kim Cattrall she had to play that.I couldn't relate to any of the women anymore. Actually, I felt rather annoyed watching them whine like some spoiled upper class brats. And Carrie is in her 40s here, but still thinks and acts like she's in her 20s. Come on...Now they're making a follow-up series of 10 eps, and I give props to Kim Cattrall for saying NO.

In the process they will also end up endorsing Wonderbra as the fundamental law of existence to women across the world.And so they fly off to Dubai (Actually Morocco but its all the same really). You know, one of those little crumbs they cant spot on the world (Read, Manhattan) map. Where they'll make bold feminist statements by sporting costumes that make you at least grateful that these hags have gotten their regular bikini waxes. Parker's character (assassinate please) coos \"I was more Coco Chanel than Coq Au Vin\". More like coq-a-bull than coquettish in my opinion. And then there is Kim 'I'll screw a flag pole scented with testosterone\" Catrall. A 'Yo mama so botoxed, they use a bulldog as her 'BEFORE' picture' joke. The layers belonging to the script have been usurped by the make up that'll need hose jobs to come off.

We saw it, we laughed, we ooed and awed at the scenery, the extravagance, etc. and we accepted it for what it was. In my opinion, this movie was consistent with both the series and the first movie. These are not exercises in Oscar nods or deep, dramatic story lines. The whole crux of this book/series is lighthearted exploration of relationship and fashion. That's what this movie offered. And as someone who was wondering how the writers would broach this movie given that the main storyline of the series and first movie--Carrie chasing Big--was pretty much sowed up, how would the married Carrie be a relatable protagonist for the single-girl audience? I think they pulled it off pretty well. The dissension between Carrie and Big was real and relatable. As was the frustration of Charlotte being a new mother. So again, for what it is, the genre it is, it is a decent offering. I really don't understand why someone who enjoyed the series would not enjoy this movie. In my opinion, it's virtually the same.Virtually.I will concede that the plot in this movie was lacking, was not fleshed through well. The Carrie-Aiden moment was just dropped off clip with no real resolution. And none of the others really faced dilemmas. It was light--maybe too light. It could have used a little bit of real drama, like the first movie. It could have used just a tad bit more seriousness. That I will concede.But again, if you are a fan of the series and the original movie, you should at least semi-enjoy this movie because it's not really that far off. It is just like a prolonged episode of the series. Maybe not the best episode, but one that at least entertains for a spell.See it if you liked the series. Skip it if you are \"above\" this genre of film. 6.5/10P.S. The only thing that I will add as maybe a negative (or not) is that the extravagance is way over-the-top, to the point that you find yourself alternating between longing for that kind of life and shaking your head at the unrealistic-ness of it all.",

The girls in the middle east were disrespectful to an entire culture- I thought for a minute they were trying to highlight the issue of women in some of these cultures, alas they merely mocked and ridiculed them, (Miranda had shown hope but in the end was as bad as the other three).I did laugh at some parts, however most of it was aimed at the actors for allowing this film to go ahead after fighting so hard to have a worthy first film as they didn't want to disappoint the fans. The producers, director and writers should be ashamed that this was pushed just to make more money rather than give a plot, and something for the fans to love.Overall it was too long, too full of celebrities just trying to show they were cool by making a cameo, strange clothing choices even for Carrie,and no point in my mind whatsoever.Lets just pretend this film wasn't made and that our journey with the girls ended with Carrie and Big getting married at the end of the first film, that is what I'm going to do anyway.",

It is not easy to bring up kids even with a nanny, it is complicated if you meet an old flame, because even when we part with someone we loved, still there's something left deep in our heart that can easily come to the surface when we meet them. And if a woman goes into menopause it is also very difficult to come to terms with it, as for a woman it means that basically her youth and beauty faded away, and does any woman wants to realize that??? And also, what exactly did you expect from that genre??? Aids, cancer, teenage pregnancy and homicide??? Other people comment that Carrie looks 10 years older. If you'd know the dates from first-last series, you'd realize that it's been 12 years from the first episode and 8 years from the last one.

Well, we live in the 21 century, and I'm pretty sure that if we haven't seen it all yet, then definitely most of it.People set to high expectations for films, they expect not to be entertained but simply to see miracles.

I guarantee most of people who have rated the film poorly or wrote negative comments haven't seen the film or the TV show. Its a knee jerk reaction to a successful women centric film. God forbid Hollywood make a film geared toward adult women. The nerve of Hollywood not gearing 100% of its films to teen age boys or men who still think they are teen age boys. Sex and the City is a fantasy film for women, but keeps its feet on the ground. Instead of super powers or explosions, women get to explore a fantasy world of designer clothing and fabulous locations. Yet the issues faced by each main character is rooted in reality. Miranda struggling with sexism at work, while trying to juggle work and family life. Charlotte dealing with the stress of being a mother. Samantha tackling menopause. Carrie adjusting to the reality that she will never have kids and how to keep the \"sparkle\" in her young marriage going. All of these issues are played out in comical and sometimes moving ways. These are real issues that women are confronted with that men will never have to contemplate. This gets to the heart of the negative comments and bad reviews. If you're a guy who didn't like the film, that's too bad. The film wasn't made for you. Men will never know what its like to be a woman, not even gay men.The accusations of racism are also ridiculous. Its a reality in the Middle East that views on sexuality and women are way more conservative. Each character responded to that reality in different ways. The more conservative Miranda was the most keen on honoring the traditions of the area and continued to remind the other characters to keep their Western ways in check. Meanwhile the most sexually liberated character Samantha struggled with those differences and eventually lost her cool. The Middle Eastern characters were never portrayed as \"bad guys\". Abu Dhabi was portrayed as a community struggling to deal with its traditions and modernism. That was a metaphor for the struggles of the main characters as well.",

I watched it many times and just love the different aspects of the film. Starting with the wedding for Stanford and Anthony! It's like I was watching the tv show. I love that Carrie is terrified because her and big aren't having kids and people are making them feel bad about it. That she's scared they will be a boring couple, especially how he just wants to sit home and watch tv every night. Every women has had that fear, even if you finally got the man you always wanted. Charlotte is annoying but she always annoyed me. I still like her story line about her nanny being hot and husband cheating. Because that's what rich men do a lot of the times and end up sleeping with nanny. So she knows she has it easier than most women who have kids. She just has a typical rich women problem that many celebrities went through. Miranda has always tried to have a great career and she's finally having problems with it. That was always the one thing she could control in her life, that she was a successful lawyer and now she can't anymore. And Samantha with the hormones, she's in her 50s and in menopause. It's a typical thing women go through. Despite all their problems they still decide to take a vacation, which I thought was great because we never really saw them go away. Except on Carrie's Mexico honeymoon. So this was a good touch to put in the film. I love watching all the luxuries they get with this vacation, all the food, the airplane ride and clothes! I thought it was amazing. Also seeing the Middle East and their culture and how women are very limited. When New Yorkers go, Its like shell shock! Carrie sewing Aiden was great too because now she's with big and afraid the marriage will end up boring and lonely. She could see if Aiden was really the one or not. Which he wasn't because once she kissed him she felt regret right away and imagined Herself that lost single girl again. It's relatable, anytime in life you make a life long decision. You sometimes go back to the \"what if\". So I'm glad they added that. And I did like no matter how many thing a they were offered in the Middle East. They all missed the freedom in America. Sometimes you want to run away from home, just to realize it's the best place to be. Oh and for the record I loved when Samantha makes that scene with the condoms when her bag dropped and broke! It was annoying they were all yelling at her for being a women! Again I love this movie and can't see why so many people hated it. Only based on a cheesy story line or how they weren't accurate about the Middle East. But it was supposed to be fun and cheesy. That's sex and the city!

I always thought the 4 women (with the possible exception of Miranda) were just drag queens fantasies from a (very messed up) gay man's mind - this film really confirms that. These are not real people, much less real women, but they do make sense as drag queen cartoons. What's sad is it looks like all the actresses were either told (or told themselves) that they had to have \"work\" done, and unfortunately, the camera does not lie. Don't get me started on the hideous idea of sending the four cartoons to Abu Dhabi so they can give the finger to everyone there and join in eternal sisterhood with local women who are more into western fashion than they are. I think SJP and Michael whatshisface - and yes, the whole cast - should be sent to hard labor for this crime against humanity. Lessons learned: Carrie should not kiss other men other than her husband. Miranda can find another job which allows her to watch her child win 1st prize at school. Samantha can continue to end each film screaming in orgasm b/c her reason for living is to have sex and scream about it. Charlotte need not fire her bra-less nanny b/c - what luck!- turns out she is lesbian so her husband will be less likely to succeed at having an affair with her. Is it any wonder we are so despised around the planet?",

This seriously was one of the most awful, stupid movies I ever watched. No real dialogues, a completely unrealistic non-story (what nonsense, why would a rich Sheik invite four obviously rude, crude, loud, impolite American women, middle-aged but dressed like 20 year-olds, just because some z-class action movie is launched and Samatha has somehow (how ever?) to do something with it?) And those exaggerations! Of course they get their own Maybachs, their own elevators, their own butlers bla bla. But what was most disturbing for me was the offensive and rude behaviour especially the character of Samantha showed. This was NOT funny, it was just disrespectful to let her be loud, naked and vulgar all the time, running around the streets in Abu Dhabi, screaming for sex or complaining about her hormones. And the pseudo-Danish Lawrence of Arabia-guy :D! First, this was NOT a Danish guy. They don't behave like that, and it was most unrealistic that he (of course) immediately fell for Samantha, looking like and old hag with too much make-up and making raunchy gestures. Summing it up after all that, the four women are just too old for their behaviour and it is simply embarrassing to watch. Charlotte has a hard time being a mom with a nanny and a housekeeper?? Carrie is married, has two New York luxury apartments (btw who can afford that?) and her main problem is a flat screen TV in the bedroom? Enough already! Please DON'T make another SATC movie, it is just a shame!",

Despite this i thought it was enjoyable and still had some of the original brilliance that the Sex and the City series had.Whilst struggling with busy life's, and the pressures of work, love and family life the four ladies take a trip to Abu Dhabi. Samantha is attempting to deal with menopause, Charlotte is struggling to cope with her children, Miranda hates her new boss, and Carrie thinks her marriage has lost it sparkle.The plot however is quite predictable at times. You just knew when Carrie saw Aidan that something was going to happen between them. And as for bringing Samantha to a place where showing affection publicly is illegal, you just knew how that would end up. But despite the negatives in the narrative, i still thought it was entertaining and felt that i could actually relate with Carrie's situation of the terrible \"two's\" of marriage.This film does have some flaws and is not as enjoyable as the first one, but Michael Patrick King should be commended for moving the ladies life's along as naturally as would happen in real life. Instead of being caught up by the woes of being single, they are caught up by the realities of the life's they have chosen to live.As usual the clothes take centre stage, and there are copious amounts of costume changes throughout. One of the highlights to the film, is the music which accompanies it. I especially like the irony behind Liza Minnelli singing 'Single Ladies.' And you can't help but become empowered when they sing 'I am Woman' at a karaoke night.This time around there isn't much sex, or much of the City, but its still good to be back with the girls.",

Sadly, this film was a huge disappointment, and maybe I should have lowered my expectations before I saw it so that I wouldn't have been as horribly let down. There wasn't a single scene where I could relate to any of the characters. Who wears couture to watch TV at home? I am usually home in my grubby pyjamas and slippers, not Manolos. Couture on a camel? There are no words to describe how ridiculous the story is. Sad, really, as the thing that made women bond to these characters over the years was their strength and humour and there was none of this in this film. In fact, I found them all weak, humourless and tragic. (Mini-spoiler alert!) Carrie in particular was a hateful person in this film. Gorgeous rich husband, perfect designer home, great friends and still this isn't enough for the selfish cow. At the risk of repeating myself, this film is tragic.

Just saying.I've read a lot of bad comments from people who say they're fans of the show, but I can't for the love of me understand why they dislike the movie so horribly.To me as a woman, the entire series was a learning tool for sex and relationships, each episode a different topic from cheating, anal sex, homosexuality and even funky spunk - all in the WOMAN's perspective. Every issue known to single woman in the dating world was out in the open and uncensored. This movie was just a continuation of that learning experience brought into the married life. Charlotte coping with the hardships of motherhood, Miranda making choices between work and family, Carrie adjusting to the realities of married life without children, and a little insight on the gay marriage of Stanford and Anthony. Everyone had a problem that so many women can relate to. Each character gave us completely different perspectives of the issue that is marriage and commitment.The writers of the movie have done remarkably well keeping the characters consistent throughout the series and movies. The only difference you may notice is that there may be a little less spice and a little less sex. That is because the movie is the \"winding down\" of the series where all the women are finally married and settled (minus Samantha because that's her character) therefore, there won't be as much drama as the series. What did you expect? Their fashionable character has also been consistent. Classic Charlotte, bold and outrageous Carrie, sexy and promiscuous Samantha and Miranda the straight-laced.I loved that the movie was set in an unfamiliar (but just as fabulous) place and out of the old New York \"box.\" It shows that these hardcore New York ladies (who had believed that everything you could ever want is right here in New York) have really grown.I much enjoyed this movie and honestly wished it hadn't ended. I think a lot of people just wanted to see drama drama drama \"Carrie cheated! They should have had sex!\" But no, I found this movie to be very modest, comedic, and true to the growth of the series and the women.------- In response to \"Sex and the Shitty\" writer jcdugger.\"Big\" is not a nickname after his member. If you've seen the very first show of the series, it is understood that \"Big\" refers to his \"big shot\" status as the next Donald Trump.The series is not called Sex and New York, it's called Sex and the CITY.

            "content": "Once upon a time four women lived in New York City. They had (we assumed) in the past battled law school, the demanding city, and were now facing a battle they may not win: finding happiness. The year was 1998 when we first heard Carrie Bradshaw write her column from an apartment that was only to be seen for one episode. In this first season, Carrie and her friends now had to fight their thirties, leading to an onslaught of emotional wreckage and failed experiments. Then the series matured and moved beyond its titular book. Suddenly, new layers were revealed, seemingly extracted between our imaginations and the lines of Candace Bushnell's prolific book. Sadly, the stories woven expertly by Micheal Patrick King came to an end in 2006,and while we would miss our favorite four women and their expert outfits, at least Carrie and Big found each other. We thought we would never hear those famous four notes again...Then, the summer of 2008 offered fans an extension. A chance to meet with our old friends. We found they were older, and not necessarily the wiser for it. Carrie was happily(unmarried) with Big (John Preston), Steve and Miranda were stuck in the terrible twos of marriage, Charlotte York-Goldenblatt and Harry were raising a daughter and Samantha was still with Smith. The thirties having been conquered, now the women had to face dealing with the forties. This journey left viewers with a heart wrenching story of love and forgiveness, a story that stood unparalleled and seemed to make this series only shine more. And even if it was now over, we had our happy ending.It was when a sequel to such a firm movie was announced and I was filled with questions, even dread: what would it be about? Where else could the series go? I am not disappointed with the latest saga to the Sex and the City. It is not a sequel so much as it is a homage to everything that made the series relevant in the first place. Where SATC 2 succeeds is that it does not rely on conventions of the rom-com genre planted thick with Meg Ryan substitutes. Instead it crafts a story that is woven with the brightest thread imaginable, and even attempts to answer the elusive question of \"What happens after the guy gets the girl\"? If anything, the new SATC was a pilot to a show leaving us with many questions: Will Samantha trick menopause? Can Charlotte really cope with two children and a bouncy, bra-less, and buxom twenty something? Will Miranda strike a balance between her need to work and her love for her family? All those questions however, are dwarfed by the most important question: do Carrie and Big have what it takes or was Bushnell's prolific work right in casting them as two people who will never find true happiness?The first act of the movie is a tale of domesticity. It is all about marriage. From Liza Minnelli reminding all the single ladies to put a ring on it, to the overdose of gayness in the gay wedding of Stanford and Anthony, and the struggles that each women endures in her now domestic home life. Not surprisingly, we need a movie, and all the women are not happy. It is this unhappiness which leads to a second act as the SATC girls, Danny Kaye and Bob Hope go to the Middle East. It turns out that the distraction they longed for was not completely welcome. Each woman faces her issue and finds her own way to conquer it. The montage like pace may seem like its a cheap excuse to show off the creative costumes but in the end you are left feeling like if there was a fantasy world, you've found it.That is truly where SATC 2 wins. It creates a charming fantasy in excessive overtures. With a lack of subtlety that is only a gleam in comparison to the arty violence of 300. That being said the movie is not without weaknesses. It would do better as a pilot for a new TV show rather than a full length movie and ran just touch too long. Two hours would have been fine.In conclusion, Sex and the City 2 proves that even flat soda is still sweet.",

They don't want to have kids and they advance practically nothing with their marriage! It seems like it was just an excuse to take the actresses on a real vacation to the United Arab Emirates.

I didn't see anything remotely insulting. Lots of movies, involving a foreign culture, will use stereotypes to portray it. This is something the viewers can understand and relate to. What's the point showing hidden traditions of a particular culture and portraying it in a different light than that known to your average viewer?? For God's sake, people, if you want an accurate/multi-dimensional portrayal of a culture, watch a DOCUMENTARY. This is fiction, and the movie has a purpose - to entertain the viewer, therefore - it's SUPPOSED to be exaggerated and stereotypical.Another popular complaint, is that these girls are not the same as in the sitcom. Hello?? And what exactly did you expect? It's been, what, OVER 1O YEARS?? Do you think these girls are going to be exactly the same as they were in the sitcom? How dumb is that? Their lives have changed (and so have their views), they have grown older, and some of them have kids -- the movie reflects these changes; it's only natural. The girls COULDN'T have remained the same!! Well, I have to say, I have never been too fond of Charlotte (not the character itself, but Kristen Davies's portrayal; more specifically: her constant OVER-acting), and she has really crossed the line in this one. Her acting was bad in the first movie, but, in this one, it's bordering on unbearable. And I didn't like that ridiculous \"Irish bra-less lesbian babysitter\" story, either. It was just stupid and totally over-the-top.Miranda's character was severely under-developed, and so was the story with Aidan. And, to be honest, the Carrie and Big story was a bit cheesy for my liking. I mean, fighting over the fact that a man wants to watch a little TV after work? Please! All in all, the movie was pretty well put together, and, in my opinion, the things people are complaining about, are absolutely irrelevant. The movie is FINE -- it's entertaining, there are some great clothes, and we get to see lots of familiar faces. Never a dull moment! I was not disappointed at all.",

            "content": "I have been so excited about this film since it was announced that a second film was being made and wasn't in the least bit disappointed. Chris Noth has previously described this film as a \"romp\" and that's exactly what it was: comedy entertainment with a vein of insecurity from each of the women, as we have come to expect from the series. The uniqueness of this film as opposed to the series and the first film was the discovery of how Big feels about Carrie and marriage. His journey, I feel, makes this film fantastic. Big offers the audience a different view of Carrie - a male point of view, something not usually present in SATC - and this complements the story in Abu Dhabi, of how the women are completely muted in a strictly male dominated society. Those who criticise the film of being racist are clutching at straws and obviously have no understanding of the premise of SATC - like the series, this film invites discussion about changes in the women's lives and the barriers that they have to overcome for happiness in life and relationships. They never condone Samantha's behaviour and she is, in fact, encouraged to abide by the law of the country by the other girls. The depiction of the Abu Dhabi women is not malicious and is merely a comedic device to alleviate the strict lives that these women are obliged to live. The setting, while important to a degree, is merely a backdrop for a comfortable display of the girls' deep bond with each other, occasionally being tried and tested, but ultimately, making them untouchable. By bringing Aidan back, an alternative view of marriage and the idea that festers occasionally in a marriage that the grass may be greener on the other side, is not just felt by Carrie. While this film may not be as serious and emotional as the first, there are still emotional parts. Who wouldn't be moved by Chris Noth's depiction of a devastated man when Carrie tells him she has kissed Aidan? Chris Noth's increased presence in this film, I think, shows a possible new direction for another film. While the SATC brand is, and should always be, about the girl's and their friendship, Big's role in this movie makes it brilliant and he should be more of a fixture in the future. This movie does exactly what it says it will: it is Sex and the City as we know and love!",

Watching this movie is like seeing an old friend, who now is a pathetic shadow of what she used to be. The main \"plot\" is Carrie, who has to get used to the fact that marriage may not be, what she expected. When she finally realizes what we - the audience - have known all the time, you want to shake her and yell: \"for God's sake woman! Get a grip!\" The fact that they shamelessly use Aidan for 5 minutes in the progress is unforgivable.This time the girls go to Abu Dhabi instead of Mexico, and what a horrific trip this is! Except for some shopping and sightseeing, nothing really happens. Charlotte misses Harry and is afraid that he might have an affair with the nanny, Miranda, who has read all the travel books, gives us facts about the country, while Samantha... Oh Samantha... I sat in horror and watched her drop condoms all over a street, and afterward yelling F*CK YOU and giving the finger to the angry men, who surrounded her. I really disliked the way that they traveled to this foreign country, and seemed to have no respect for it's guidelines - except for Miranda.When the movie was over I was mad.

These scathing reviews are rampant, so I thought this movie was going to bite the big one. I had a great time and was never bored and LOVED the Middle Eastern journey, which was ripe with comedy. People saying the movie disrespected the culture of Abu Dhabi is laughable...most of these people have never even been to that part of the world, and know nothing of their culture, or what it's like being an American woman there. And they seem to be hating on the actresses themselves, not even the characters...If Will Farell was walking around Saudi Arabia with his shirt off, people wouldn't have said anything about how inappropriate he was being in a Saudi country, but because they're women.... Anyway, don't forget this is an HBO series turned into a film. I'm glad it wasn't all complicated like the first movie, I can see a drama for that.

What a disgraceful interpretation of these characters. It was on the local cable network and I tuned in. I can see why Kim Cattrell refused to do a part 3. They absolutely butchered her character. She must have walked out of the final editing of this film feeling terrible seeing herself like. In fear she may never be taken seriously again. Being sexually liberated is very different than being portrayed as a desperate easy woman.This movie was culturally offensive, like middle aged women would go to a foreign country and behave like morons... They completely undermined any kind of business savvy or smarts these characters had in the series with the exception of Miranda. In no way would 40-50 something year old women behave this way. What a disgrace of a film. Carrie's character just came across as being rude, selfish and self-centered, to her husband and to her friends. Their was nothing cute, endearing or funny about her. At the end I was hoping BIG would divorce her for being such a selfish brat. This was a writing disaster, the acting was forced trying to bring a script to life that in no way reflected these characters. The make up and acting was terrible. And that karaoke seen gave me a \"Oprah you are embarrassing me\" feeling. Watch if you must, but expect the ridiculous.",

Loving this show is like being in a passionate yet stabile relationship - the love lasts forever & every time you watch the re-runs you discover something new and exciting; and i've been dating it since my teen years! After all, the 90's are my most favorite thing on earth! In the series, I didn't even really LIKE Carrie's nutty outfits or Sam's costumes, but i have always been certain that that is true urban fashion. Even nowadays when i watch some old episodes i still feel the same about it. Also, I didn't agree with many highlighted moments in the show; but i always felt like it was the best thing ever made. Fun, flirty, contemplative enough, appearing as materialistic and shallow but actually quite meaningful in a classic manner. The world was changing fast, and people's private lives were in trouble.Given all that, this movie failed all SATC fans. Those creatures i saw in the movie are definitely not the women we all shared troubles with, full of envy and joy for their Manhattan lifestyle, nope. Not the cult characters that inspired ways of thinking and behaving for many generations. First of all, i could not wrap my mind around the idea that they are all so wealthy! One thing i especially loved about Carrie was her pretty much normal life: struggling with money yet carefree.Actually...you know what? I started writing this prepared to bitch slap this movie, but the following is the only thing i really wanna say. SATC is a unforgettable cult show. As such, it should have never been exploited for making freak-festish awkward no-brain movies for the sole purpose of sucking money out of the legions of lustful fans. Nothing will ever be good enough to be its sequel/prequel/whateverthef**k-quel. SO JUST LEAVE IT ALONE!",

Carrie lives in an absolutely beautiful Architectural Digest NYC apartment with an apparently upstanding husband and has the emotional maturity of a 10-year-old ('omg! why did he buy the TV when i _really_ want jewelry?' and 'hmm... is it RIGHT for a couple to spend time apart?'). Samantha is kind of disgusting (one scene has her stripping down her underwear while still at her desk and applying creme there in a glass office while in the presence of her secretary). Miranda replays the same trite old work-life balance plot. Charlotte complains about the misery of her life (the nadir being her daughter putting dirty hands on her vintage cream valentino skirt, and unable to understand how people take care of kids without full-time help and a housekeeper). The scene where they employ 4 white Maybachs to drive 4 people to the same hotel makes the environmentalist in me hurt. Also, the way this show treats gays and lesbians is incredibly simplistic, particularly the last scene where the narrator notes \"Charlotte's nanny enjoyed the company of other nannies,\" cocker-spaniel style. Ugh. The dialogue is pretty much the dumbest thing I've ever heard in a movie, but it's not much worse than Sex and the City 1. All the jokes sound like anodynes or clich\u00e9s and is accompanied by the appropriate facial expression. Some fashions are really lovely, but some are utterly ridiculous -- like Carrie wearing a ballgown to what looks like a street fair. Some scenes- -the women undressing to reveal the nyc spring collections, and a rendition of 'single ladies'-- can only be described as bizarre. The only redeeming quality is the beautiful visuals, landscapes, shots of the 'good' life ruined by these actors.",

So I decided to download the sequel and even before watching it I expected the same boring movie but with different problems and so far i'm right but what got me onto IMDb.com and to review it while I paused it in the middle, well it's personal...See now as soon as they mentioned the middle east in the movie and the girls going to Abu Dhabi, I wasn't surprised. That's one of the few places westerners know about in the Middle East and one of the few they know about that sounds good to their ears. Now that didn't disappoint me but I realized that in the movie so far while on the plane to Abu Dhabi, they have moments where there was a lot of nonsense spoken from the soo called Arabs on the plane, who had too dark a skin and too Indian of an accent to be Arab I would know i'm from the middle east and i'm from Kuwait and I'm right here in the great hot Middle East in Kuwait and the only thing Carrie said to the air hostess was \"I like your hat\" since her nose was too big.Now still for me that was tiny and I only just realized that, but what really ticked me off is, at the bar on the plane Miranda(I think thats her name) says a word that means thank you and i'm guessing in Arabic because in Hindi it means nothing but in Arabic it doesn't either! The word she said was \"hanjee\" or \"hanji\" or \"hanjy\" and whatever way you spell it or say it, it's still fake and irritating!!So let me tell you this, anyone who is reading this! This movie is flashy and looks good and is basically eye candy, with all the cougars and hot women and materialistic life but it has a very cheap script that just makes 2 hours of crap that used to be done way better on TV on a much shorter period of time even though I never saw the show. They throw, fashion, luxury, Miley Cyrus(who I bet is still a virgin), Liza Minnelli(who did it probably for the money) and Beyonce's annoying song just to put a good show and get the money and get out!And now I'm gonna go finish this sequel so I can see what ever else I forgot to mention.",

            "content": "Movie Review Sex and the city 2\"Sex and the city 2\" is a modern day fairytale of four wayward princesses incarcerated in a painfully real life in an island called New York. Life, however, takes on a dramatic turn when they land upon the free passes to the magical land of the Scheherazade. Reality is broken loose and fairy tale, complete with high fashion, a luxurious hotel, camel rides, eccentricities and uncalled for dramas, unravel on the screen in this sequel of HBO's famed TV series \"Sex and the city\". Without a penumbra of doubt it can said that this movie is made for all the die-hard fans of the TV series who have been waiting for this production to hit the box office. From the very beginning director MIchael Patrick King loads the movie with all the right spices needed to soothe the salivating tongues of hundreds of thousands of women who find a little of themselves in his four angels. And pleased the women are; there is more drama than expected, more bathetic turns than needed, more luxury than can be afforded, and ultimately \"Sex and the City\" comes out as a delectable dessert that has to be tasted.The fairy tale begins at the most anticipated gay wedding of this millennium: Carrie's long time gay friend, Stanford Blatch, ties the knot with Charlotte's gay pal, wedding planner, Anthony Marantino. The initial scenes of the movie give us glimpses of the lives of our beloved ladies: Charlotte is happy homemaker with two great kids, Carrie is a successful writer, Samantha is younger than ever, and Miranda has a great albeit stressful job. In a way our ladies look apparently happy in their 24 karat gilded glittering lives. Underneath this facade of happiness, however, there shroud all the dark clouds of a modern day nerve-racking life. Carrie's marriage with Mr. Big has lost its initial sparkle and she is looking for new ways to rejuvenate it, but her hip sachet life hardly allows her any opportunity to mend her married life. She is worlds away from Big and is still drifting apart. The other three ladies face their shares of quotidian pressures in their own ways: Charlotte is tired of her kids, Miranda hates her job, and Samantha spends fortunes on age renewing drugs. It is at this point when Samantha and the ladies get invited by the Sheikh himself to visit Abu Dhabi for a week. The movie, which is, by the way, an odyssey in length, is shot partly in New York and partly in Abu Dhabi, and provides the movie goers a free trip to the \"New Middle East.\" And in our trip we get to see it all: oriental luxury, veiled women, tradition bound men, and a booming economy. The jaw-dropping luxurious hotel is as much a protagonist in this movie as the ladies are. The climax of the movie takes place at a spice market where Carrie chances upon her ex, Aiden Shaw. The adventitious meeting ultimately leads to Cinderella's kissing her former beau, and this incident, my friend, sings the denouement threnody for the plot. The haphazard events that ensue this kiss including Samantha's arrest for public display of affection, Charlotte's catharsis, Carrie's telling Big about the big-kiss, and finally her losing the passport before boarding the plane, all seemed affected. The naturalness of the plot lost its aura in the artificiality portrayed through out the film. The most outrageous scene has to be the one where burqa clad ladies shed off their outer garment to display this year's spring collection! The movie doesn't allow us a great many opportunities to get to know our ladies as they stand at the midlife juncture. The story, which is enervated and at times a little caricatured too does, nevertheless, gives us some real funny and refreshing scenes to enjoy; and it is those scenes, those natural laughs, which revamp our expectations from the plot. The plot, sadly, doesn't recuperate; neither does it emphasize the subtle touch ups on female sexuality and the subservient role of women in an apparently polished, seven-star world. The director doesn't take a lot of risks, and therefore ends up making the movie a real long \"Sex and the City\" TV episode. In apodosis it can be said that \"Sex and the city\" is \"Sex and the city,\" and one cannot help falling in love with it. Even though the movie suffers from a lot of misgivings, it ends up being one of the most loved creations created solely for women. The innate attraction of the female species towards Manolo Blahnik shoes, Louis Vuitton goods can hardly be denied; and since fairy tales are meant to be unrealistic, a little sneak peak into the high world of unaffordable fashion and forbidden pleasures with the ladies as your hosts is certainly worth your while. So, all you ladies out there put on your best and head to the nearest theater and catch the hottest adventures of Carrie and her gang.",

I am only compelled to review this movie because I noticed that most of the negative reviews center around the same fundamental principles and they are: a) The movie does not take place in NYC from start to finish (boo hoo). b) The movie is not PC when it comes to women's stereotypes and the sexually-repressed Middle East (boo hoo). c) and the movie was too \"over-the-top\" with regards to fashion and people's living of their lives (again, boo-freaking-hoo).What has made the Sex and the City franchise so good in the past and what drives millions to watch it is essentially three major principles - friendship, sex-love-romance, and fun, and SATC2 mixes all three together again in a package that is as bizarre, over-the-top (did you SEE the gay wedding??), and tongue-and-cheek as it is funny, and it IS funny. As promised, the producers of \"2\" let the story follow a romp of comedy, and while some of it is so high-brow it may annoy us typical \"9 to 5'ers\" who scrape from paycheck to paycheck to make ends meet, most is sophomoric and flat-out blatant, especially the thousand or so gay jokes that kick-off the movie and really, never truly stop.The movie is unrealistic, shouldn't be taken seriously, is not going to uncover layers of character fortitude, and will make absolutely no push or argument for an Oscar. It's a stab at comedy through the SATC program that has relied so heavily on sex to sell, and the same holds true for the film. I do not own SATC DVD's, I've seen the show only in passing on HBO and I only watched SATC1 about a year ago on cable.In a day when romantic comedies and chick flicks fall flat on their faces and offer almost nothing of meritous value, both in production and in finished product, SATC2 takes you on a comedic journey and does it lavishly, wasting next to nothing. You'll feel as if the film dumped just as much money on production as it makes you believe it's four principals do as they cavort around their day-to-day lives. Along the way, you get just enough on each character to set you up for what has happened up until now, and where the story will go when it wraps.Again - Gone With the Wind it is not. take it for what it is, let your guard down, and enjoy the movie!",

Long time fans who, in spite of everything, care about these characters and want to see what's new with their lives.. and people who heard of the series, don't follow it as well, and saw the movie with friends. I am seeing that the later of this group are the ones who see nothing wrong with the movie. I feel that real loyal fans can see all the problems this movie has. While on it's own, I can see how it might be entertaining to watch with it's silly jokes, and almost child like antics. However, add this to a 10+ year story line of 4 woman maturing into middle-aged adults, and fans are left scratching our heads asking what we just saw.The series was a mix of serious issues mixed in with comedy and let's face it, some silliness. The first movie dealt more with serious. This one clearly is way more about the silliness. However After so many years, and clearly after watching the woman mature as they did in the last movie, this one felt so completely out of place and out of touch. It's hard to believe that the character I liked most was Big! (Chris Noth). Though I understand Carrie's worry about not wanting to lose her husband to the TV, the way they tried to get this problem across failed completely. Not only that, I thought him wanting to share that moment together of laying in bed and watching old movies like that, was way more personal and touching then some $20,000 necklace. The fact that Carrie still refuses to grow up about some issues is beyond annoying. They already touched on the \"my love interest is an introvert and wants to stay home\" plot with her already. With Aidan. And she learned her lesson then! Miranda and Charlotte were the only two who I felt, saved the movie. They did rush the plot of Miranda hating her boss, but I think it showed how much she matured as woman in a family and picked them over the job and dealing with someone who didn't respect her. At times she came across as very silly, but after leaving a job that you took so seriously for 20 years, It's understandable that she let go the way she did. Not freaking out about having the internet every two seconds. Char, well.. I understand having a 2 year old who wont stop crying and there is nothing you can do to help. Plus trying to take care of a 5 year old who acts out cause she is clearly being ignored, would cause any mother to break down. Since at that time, she was home alone without her help. (I've done that. It's hard) However, her whole issue with the bra-less nanny, was beyond ridiculous. No mother and wife would allow their nanny to dress like that around their family. All you have to do is pull them aside and tell them \"You can see your boobs through your clothes. Can you please cover yourself up more while around my family\" That's how an adult handles that situation. Samantha acted like a complete child.Lastly, as an American, I am completely offended by the direction and underlining insult that movie directed towards an Arab Country. After Sept 11th? Taking 4 New York woman into an Arab nation and have them be insulting and not understanding at all towards their customs (except Miranda), is just so beyond.. I don't even have words. It was beyond insulting and totally insensitive. I can't believe that point of view was allowed to even be addressed. I get that it's just a movie, and we do to watch them to get away from the real world. But that doesn't give any movie the excuse to insult another culture. I can understand that how woman are treated in Arab countries can be a real shock to this 4 very empowered woman.. but they are from New York. There is no excuse for their lack of respect and understanding. New York City is more open to people of MANY cultures more then any other city in this country. I'm half their age and I understand it. I might not respect it myself, but I would never go over there and give them the finger and shove condoms in their faces. I hate the impression this movie gave about American's. I'm honestly surprised any of the actors agreed to do this movie.",

Yay, consumer individualism wins again, our hero living happily ever after, though she's conveniently forgotten that there are now a thousand copycats in Iran looking just like her. A word from Emma Goldman: \"As to individualism, at no time in human history did it have less chance of expression, less opportunity to assert itself in a normal, healthy manner.\" Ohhh, burn.In terms of aesthetics, the film has the nondescript, anonymous look of most TV to Movie transitions. The film was directed by Michael Patrick King, whose IMDb profile picture provides good laughs (What? This review went AWOL at \"pelican\"). As near as I can tell, the message of King's movie is that lesbians are OK, individuality costs, penises bring happiness and the Koran isn't sexy. Speaking of lesbians, if a guy has a sex change and is attracted to women, is he a lesbian? And isn't that what this movie is secretly telling me to do? I don't know. Great movies inspire deep thoughts. But so does sleep, which I did throughout this film's first two acts. And by \"acts\" I mean pelican molestation sessions, or PMS for short.

And Samantha(Kim Cattral) is the only who is content with her life, and she gets an offer to travel to Moraaco, and decides to take her three friends, will this be a life changing experience? Not has good as the first, I felt that the spark that made Sex and the City fun to watch, was not there for the most part. Although there were some funny scenes. Even a scene with Kim Cattral in Moracco. Liza Minnell has a good scene, doing musical number by a famous artist, I'll give you a hint it's not Lady GaGa. And I liked the scenery in Moracco. John Corbett appearance as Adian showed interest. But other than some of the spark was missing.",

            "content": "A new installment in the SACT franchise, with all the elements that the fans of the series loved. The new episode focus on how our favorite four girls face the challenges of marriage and consolidated relationships, and how marriage means different things for different people.I'm surprised at the poor reviews of this movie, which I think it is not worse than the first, which has double rating. Completely senseless. The story has moments of the soul of the TV and Carrie's character. Needless to say, fashion and luxury are still gorgeous and an essential part of the look and mood of the movie, but the story makes good points and grounds the characters. Most importantly, the acting has returned to what we were used in the TV series, making us forget some of the flaws we resented in the first movie. I cannot believe that nobody noticed how terrible was in the first, and that is back to normal here.The movie has some very fun moments, many of them by the always cheeky (and hilariously vulgar) Samantha. The gay wedding at the beginning is great, with a cameo by Liza Minelli as wedding minister and wedding singer.I think the main problem of the movie is the whole trip to Abu Dhabi. Not the trip, the destination. I had the feeling that this was a long commercial about Abu Dhabi. The girls could have gone elsewhere luxurious and still face the same challenges. I thought that focusing on cultural differences and the idiosyncrasy of the Emiraties was a waste of time, and completely unnecessary for the story, which, until the trip starts, was making good points about marriage. In short, I would have eliminated the touristy part and dug deep in the part of the relationships. On the other hand, this being a show about sex, love and relationships by very liberated Western Women, the UAE were never going to be a good destination. Never ever! This is one of those chick-flicks that will entertaining women who were fans of the TV series and have all the background to understand and enjoy the characters and what is happening in this double length episode, which is what it really is.Abstain from viewing men and people who are not familiar with the series. Otherwise, don't complain!",

The first 'surpirse' was not at all surprising, you could see what was going to happen the minute the first scene had started.A lot of the good bits were in the ads and lost the punch for the film which was sadly missing any interesting things at all. Samantha was the same as she always is, Miranda didn't really do anything, Charlotte didn't really progress or change or grow and Carrie moaned so all in all nothing much different there then!I wanted and wished that this film would be so much more but I was sorely disappointed and won't be watching this again voluntarily.",

            "content": "To list the redeeming qualities rather than the problems of Sex and the City 2 would make a very short review. It would be one word, no matter the language: None. Zip. Nada. Null. Nolla. There is not a single good thing about it. Just isn't. I would compare it to A Serbian Film in the sense that when you think it has reached the ultimate epitome of revulsion, it gets worse. It is vomit-inducingly grotesque beyond your wildest imaginations.There's no story: the whole movie is just the main characters wandering from one extravagantly expensive set piece to the next. There are no likable characters: every single living being in this movie is despicable to the bone. If real women were like these hideous caricatures, I would have had myself castrated years ago. There's not a single group of people who won't be offended by this film: male, female, straight, gay, Christian, Muslim, doesn't matter. There's no conflict, character development or any sort of buildup whatsoever: perhaps the film's longest lasting \"conflict\" is that the sex-obsessed one is losing her libido because she couldn't bring her vitamins to Abu Dhabi. Oh the humanity!But the very worst thing that permeates SATC2 from beginning to end has to be its philosophy. Basically what the film says is: not having thousands of dollars to spend at your leisure is terrible and no matter how bad things are, buying expensive things will always make it better. Just a few examples of this philosophy are: -The main character actually complains that despite being married for two years, she still doesn't have a diamond ring. One of the women cries in a food closet because her child put jammy hands on her vintage skirt and stained it. In one scene (taking place in the private bar of their $22,000 a night suite no less) the aforementioned character actually says out loud: \"How do the women without help do it?\" and her conversation partner replies: \"I have no f****ng idea\". The amount of moments like these is practically irrational.One could write a series of novels about everything that is wrong with this film. But in short it's misogynist, crass, sexist, offensive, racist, repugnant, insulting, grotesque, revolting, spits in the faces of everyone who knows anything about the middle east and shamelessly objectifies both men and women. I can't remember ever having wanted to become a terrorist as much as while watching this film. Recommendation: I can give this film two recommendations: 1. If you're dreaming of becoming a film critic, watch this film and then think again. 2. If you're an extreme masochist you'll definitely enjoy this one. In any other case stay the hell away from it.",

This movie wasn't as good as the first but it's a sequel so you can't really expect it to be. I think any mother who's gone through some of the struggles that Miranda and Charlotte face, and any woman who's married that's experienced disappointed expectations for what marriage would be like, like Carrie did, will like the fact that this movie touches on these issues but also does it within a ridiculous fantasy world so it doesn't get too serious to be depressing. It was absolutely fun and fabulous and is exactly who and where you'd expect these characters to really be two years later. It's really enjoyable once you stop trying to notice all the outlandish stuff. I've read the reviews by critics that criticized the fact that this movie lacked the heartfelt friendship content that the first had, but it absolutely had that- it was just another side of their friendship. I recommend it wholeheartedly to the SATC followers but I can see how silly it might be to people who don't know these characters.",

For me it looked like an extra long episode of the show. Sex And The City 2 is something completely different to anything that relates to the previous film and the TV show... in a bad way. Even my wife could not ignore the annoyance of some scenes.An over the top wealthy, neurotic-racist, whining-like-little-children, over-aged-scary-looking and some way-too-skinny-women, horror show is what you will get in this sequel.The New York Magazine itself summed it up very good: \"The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film.\"Stop the self humiliation of something that once was adored by so many women...",

            "content": "Sex and the City is about women, and in order to condense the essence of the female mind into a show or movie we are presented with 4 very different women. Charlotte is the good wholesome girl. Samantha is the promiscuous, independent, A-lister. Miranda is the logical workaholic, who's sometimes a party pooper. Carrie is the successful writer and fashionista who holds this group of girls together. Though fashion, sex, and glamor are central to the franchise, the conversation is what makes Sex and the City what it is. The topic of conversation? Sex and Love. It's the unadulterated thoughts of all women funneled into just 4. Guys, if this sounds horrible, then stop watching Entourage because it's the same damn thing.We last left off with Carrie marrying Big in a label-less dress at a small wedding. 0 guests. Just a New York City officiant and other couples anxiously awaiting their turn. Sex and the City 2 flashes forward 2 years. The gang is back together for their gay friends' wedding, which is completely over the top with swans and a all-male chorus dressed in white. The gay cherry to top it off - Liza Minnelli weds them and then sings Beyonc\u00e9's Single Ladies complete with choreography. Ridiculous. While at the wedding, a fan of Carrie's writing is shocked to find out that Carrie and Big has no plans to have children. This triggers a chain reaction of thoughts until Carrie realizes that their relationship has become a bit routine. Watching TV on the couch and ordering in is just not her style. So one night, she forces a scotch on Big and drags him out for a red carpet event that Samantha has invited them to.At the after party, Samantha scores a PR job that provides all 4 of them with an all-expenses-paid trip to Abu Dhabi. Luckily Miranda had quit her high-stress job after a sexist tyrant becomes her boss. Charlotte simply needs to get away from the craziness of raising two young children. And Carrie is yearning for the adventurous lifestyle she had before marriage. So off they go into a world of glamor and decadence. They each have a private suite on the plane, a personal butler at the hotel, and a personal Maybach at their beck and call. To mix it all up, Carrie runs into Aidan (an old love interest) at a spice market in Abu Dhabi. She has to sort out what she wants while her flamboyant friends avoid trouble in a very conservative Arab nation.So how does the movie compare to the first? How does it compare to my expectations? It's pretty much what I expected. It's Sex and the City 1 times 2. Everything is much more extravagant. I can't help but wonder how much these people make at work. They live such fabulous lives. They put on expensive clothes to cook or to simply flop onto the couch. You will either be awe struck or contemptuous. I'm glad to say that it is funnier than the first as well. Hence, entertainment-wise, I'd say that Sex and the City 2 is better than its predecessor.What about substance? The primary message is that marriage requires compromise and understanding. Furthermore, it's unique to each couple. Although I've concisely extracted a moral, I don't think the movie did a wonderful job in making it clear. And does it really need to make this clear in the first place? Really? Compromise and understanding? Marriage? You don't say... What was the catalyst of Carrie's and Big's drama? Carrie feels that they're becoming a boring couple. If this was the only problem married couples encounter, then the divorce rate would be much lower.In the end, Sex and the City 2 has made a mountain out of a mole in order to sell you the same product. It's just more of the same, but with the number '2' appended to the title. I remember watching the 1st Saw and thinking it was great. Saw 2 - more of the same. Saw 3 - annoyingly repetitious. Saw 4, 5, and 6 - I didn't even try to watch them. At this rate, we should expect Sex and the City 3 in the near future. If they can make big money with the same formula, then why not? I would advise them to stop at 3, but seeing how the 2nd one played out suggests this might go on indefinitely. I wouldn't be surprised if I woke up in an empty room strapped to a chair and given a choice between watching Sex and the City 4, 5, and 6 or forfeiting my life.

I've never seen the TV show, I haven't seen the first movie (and now know to set fire to it if I see it on sale at Big W)- I went expecting the worst. And that's exactly what I saw. The characters were flat, predictable and downright unlikeable. The jokes were all terrible innuendos aimed at those clearly not capable of intelligent thought. The costumes changes were gratuitous and ridiculous (again, I know it's about the fashion, but as another reviewer said, numerous costume changes DO NOT CONSTITUTE A PLOT). Speaking of which, what plot? The four women deal with their issues in a way that's... no hang on, they don't. Sorry. My mistake, conflict resolution is dealt with magically here. Then they arrive in a completely different culture and take the term ethnocentric to a whole new level. They insult the locals, change costumes, whine, commit adultery, change costumes again and then are sent home, where they proceed to change costumes (I didn't see that one coming). I must say the lowest point of the movie for me, personally, was when Charlotte (who was, admittedly tired and under stress) completely lost it with her daughter and yelled at her for getting icing on a skirt- in other words, for behaving like any child would. The idea that a mother should favour a vintage skirt over her own children is wrong- are we really this materialistic?? I beg you, please, you are better than this. Only if you have ten dollars in your pocket that you found on the pavement and a spare two and a half hours that you would otherwise spend sadistically torturing small animals should you see this movie.

And again it's much your typical fashion of style, high class, and glitz it's just not your common everyday woman's world. Sure the sex appeal and laughs are present, but this is one film that most will find to fairy tale and dreamy.You have the four colored bra wearing females Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte all back together as friends waiting on another adventure this time their journey involves an Arabian desert vacation. While in my opinion turns the film to nostalgic, impatient, and to make believe. Some fun subplots are Samantha's battle with menopausal and it shows Carrie's breaking away from Big as she writes a new book. So really that's not to much of a distraction to make it take away from the overkill of high class and glitz. Yet the sexy scenes of the ladies were a treat and seeing Carrie's ex played by John Corbett was all right. Clearly this film is to big on substance and very little on taste.",

            "content": "I generally liked it. It may be because I was so prepared to such a bad bad movie after reading all the negative comments, that I didn't have high expectations. Of course, they could have dressed the characters a bit more like \"normal\" people when they were in Abu Dhabi, and there is one day (in the movie is the same day) in which they are in the desert and they change 4 times, always wearing fabulous dresses. It is true, there is not such a big story behind this movie, and true also that Carrie looks quite selfish in this movie (these are some of the comments I read about it). But the point is: 1) Carrie is a selfish character, even in the episodes, so no surprise there. I think that the fans of Sex and the City knows her that way. 2) The dresses were exaggerate for being in Abu Dhabi probably. The movie is a lot about the different outfits of each of them. But so it was the previous movie. I guess that it is more and more a characteristic of Sex and the City being something like a fashion show too. I don't find it adding something to the movie, and some of the outfits were out of place (e.g. the skirt of Carrie when she meets Aidan at the market downtown), but I guess that it was predictable that clothes would play a bit role in this movie. 3) The story behind this movie is really poor. True, there is not such a big story, but there are a lot of more daily little stories in there. I don't have kids, but I love the scene in which Miranda and Charlotte get together to talk about their frustrations. And I felt close to Carry when she got a bad review for her book (I don't write books, but I have to write a lot of articles for my work and sometimes I get very bad reviews too).I also read that the movie is kind of racist, especially because of Samantha's behavior, and shows that Americans know little about the culture of other places. Samantha is Samantha. She is very true to her character. And in fact, in a different culture, she gets in trouble for being so liberal. I didn't find it respectfulness. Of course, Samantha was there for work-reasons, but wasn't the goal of the person who invited her there to let her know and appreciate the place so that she could propose it as a fancy-luxury holidays location? She explored the place in her own way. And I don't think that the movie portraits Americans in a bad way.Conclusion: it is not a great movie, and the episodes are still better than any of the two movies, but after all I liked it, I spent some 2 nice hours with some girlfriend, we went out after it to talk about it, it made me feel very light, it made me feel I wish I could wear some of those dresses and shoes just to try them on, and it made me laugh. And Liza Minnelli is great! Really a plus to this movie!",

In addition, the meeting with Aidan should have been a little more drawn out, but I was glad she didn't sleep with him. I definitely liked how bug forgave her.

I am male, straight, and suddenly found myself watching the entire series with my fianc\u00e9e and loved it. The first time I saw the first film I walked away feeling disappointed but maybe coming out of the series I had high expectations. When I re-watched the first film before seeing the second I enjoyed it much, much more and didn't find it as...depressing as the first time through. The biggest issue I had with the second film wasn't the cast, or their age, or the same old gags (which I actually think is a good thing), but rather nothing happens. Even in each half hour episode Sex and the City was never dull...something was always happening, something was always changing the lives of our fab four girls but with Sex and The City 2 it felt like an elongated Epilogue and I'm just not sure that was necessary. Nothing significant happens to any of them. We get a minor recap to their lives but you get no new information, very few new developments, and the only thing different to the story is the exotic location. It was just disappointing to not have something earth shattering happen which is what Sex and The City thrives on.While plenty has been said about the cast bad and good and professional critics love to poke fun at their age and their promiscuity and everything else but fans of Sex and The City love them for being them. Charlotte's neuroticism, Carrie's fashion and romantic hopelessness, Miranda's constant reality check and lack of dreaming, and of course Samantha is always Samantha. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, and Kim Cattrall still bring all we love about their characters to the table and their chemistry together is still A+ and that will always be the redeeming quality of Sex and The City. None of them deserve acting awards but at the same time they live and breath these characters. David Eigenberg, Evan Handler, Jason Lewis, and Chris Noth all return as the boys of Sex and the City. Part of the charm of the original series and the original film was the interaction between the girls and the guys but the guys took a huge back seat in this film. They have some good moments but the driving story behind this film is Carrie and 'Big's relationship falling into a rut and its just not believable. Willie Garson and Mario Cantone return to their adorable roles as the gay Romeo and Juliette, who finally tie the knot in a rather ridiculously over the top but hilarious gay wedding. Finally John Corbett also returns as many fans hoped for as Carrie's other major love interest. It was the sole saving story line to the film but they still managed to make it rather boring but it was very cool to see Corbett and Parker together again. Watch for a small role but the beautiful and sexy Alice Eve in a very amusing role as Charlotte and Harry's new nanny. Good lord that woman is smoking hot.You can't make a smarter move than taking on a writer, producer and director from the original TV Series to do the first film and the second as Michael Patrick King takes over again and does a fine job controlling the film. The scenery and cinematography is beautiful but where is that spice we all know and love. I think what has happened here is that the TV Series gave us everything we adored about the show. The first film was the perfect wrap up, the perfect reunion and gave us everything we could possibly need from this series and then there was the sequel. I love the characters, its fun and has some laughs but it just feels unnecessary. Yes the girls are getting a little old to be having the same wild times they always have and they tip toed around through the whole film so it didn't shake anything up because fans were happy with the way things are. So we have a 2 1/2 hour epilogue. As much as I adore sequels its time to say goodbye to Sex and the City and the first film would have been the perfect send off. So if you're a fan of the series watch the second one as a glorified epilogue and if you happen to watch the first film then you might be better off to skip the second. 7/10",

She made me watch the first one on DVD and I didn't like it but it was still somewhat entertaining, so I thought OK I'll watch this one, it's free and we got nothing to do on a rainy Wednesday night. I knew it wasn't gonna be a good movie, but after 10 minutes into it I just wanted to leave the theater. The dialogue was weak, scenes were just put together with no connections whatsoever. Then they go to the Middle East and act completely disrespectful to their culture. I'm not from the middle east but I felt offended. American movies are very ignorant and show a complete disregard for other cultures. They used cheap jokes disrespecting their culture and religion and wrongly portrays the Middle East. It's shameful, it's not even a bad movie, it is insulting to anyone with a little bit of intelligence.",

            "content": "I've always thought that the quartet of 'ladies' in Sex and the City are really meant to be four gay men played by actresses. It's harder to hold this view now that three of them are married and two of them are mothers. But Samantha, still single (and a slut) at 52, is more like several gay men I've known than any woman of my acquaintance (perhaps I move in the wrong circles).Playing to the gay audience, we have the cringe-inducing 'marriage' between Carrie's best gay friend and Charlotte's best gay friend (Martha and Martha!). Ageing icon Liza Minelli improbably officiates at this ceremony and then provides the (pardon the pun) cabaret. She talks and sings as if her mouth is full of pebbles. Joan Rivers needs to give Liza some career advice (\"Liza, it's over\").Half the movie takes place in Abu Dhabi on a PR junket of Samantha's. There are modesty jokes galore (and a few 'daring' burka gags) and Samantha (surprise!) has one or two immodest moments.The critics have generally dismissed this, as well they might. Yes, it's crass and crude, but when wasn't it? There's some full-on sex (guess who? no prizes), a lot of full-on smut and an endless fashion parade of silly frocks, but hey, what else do we expect? The barrel is very close to being scraped dry. Maybe they should let ten years go by and then revisit them in their 50s and 60s, perhaps living in Florida, all divorced - it could be a raunchier version of The Golden Girls. David Gee is available (and very affordable) for script-writing!",

            "content": "OK, now, I know that my rating will have some people raising their eyebrows, but I don't care because that's exactly why I'm writing this review. Quite frankly I'm only writing a review for this movie because most of the reviews available for this movie have been extremely negative and incorrect in my opinion. I never really got to see the original show religiously because I was, like, 12 when the show was still on, but I have seen an episode or two since then. The movie is glamorous, smart, sexy, and funny--in that order too. Fashion is obviously one of the main reasons why the show and the movies became very successful. The clothes in the movie were spectacular and the shoes even more so. Admittedly, some of their clothes weren't really appropriate for the Middle Eastern setting, but these were the Sex and the City girls!!! And anyone who knew who they were knows that they have never been one of those people that would easily compromise themselves, especially not when it comes to fashion!Some reviews argued that the characters qualms were all very petty and ridiculous. Supposedly, the girls were complaining about the most insipid things because they are selfish and insensitive to the other people around them. Sure, there is truth to that, but those qualms do not define them. Most reviewers are being hypocritical here because, let's admit it, we all can be a bit selfish and insensitive sometimes. And it's not like the girls are broadcasting their qualms to the world or telling every single person they meet about them. They are discussing these issues with their best friends and lovers which is normal and, might I add, appropriate. I mean, seriously, who doesn't talk about things like these with their best friends or lovers? Unless you're some kind of hermit or a complete loser with no friends that is. And, besides, when Charlotte and Miranda were talking about their problems, they both expressed that they felt really bad and felt like they were the worst mothers for having those feelings which pretty much captures how real mothers might feel in the same situation.There were reviews saying that this movie was racist which is absurd. I am a person of color, part Muslim, and have been fighting against all forms of discrimination from racism and color-ism to homophobia, and this movie was definitely not racist. Sure, at times, the characters become a bit irreverent especially Samantha, but that IS Samantha. She has always been the crazy and outrageous one. She's never been and never will be a girl to change who she is, no matter where in the world she is.Overall I think most of the other reviews have been misguided because they misunderstood the film and kept comparing their own lives to those of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha's. Wake up call, guys, you're not them and this is just a movie. People seem to have forgotten why these girls are icons and the original show even more so. The show and characters were phenomenally successful not because they were realistic, but because they gave us relate-able escapism. The girls were beautiful, successful, promiscuous, rich, fashionable, and sexy, and that's why we love them because they were everything most people wanted to be.",

I mean the first movie is a very nice add to the adorable and worldwide phenomenon that was the series. Saying all this in advance i must say that the critics to this film were way to harsh and way out of line. There much much worse movies that come out every year and even get awards. This movie should be seen for what it is. An escape from the real world, a vacation with \" the girls\" Its not the best and the story is not at all complex, but we get to Samantha in the \"Middle\" East. And one last thing. I don't see how this is an insult to anything even to the middle east. Lets be a little serious, there are series and movies who make jokes and comments about the middle east, this is only an experience of two majorly different world's. I only gave it 7 star's because i wanted to see more drama with Big and Carrie or with Aidan. But the movie was a great laugh and it was nice to see them all again.What i truly want in for the future of this series is a Sex and The City 3 with them ( not a god damn prequel), that will close the mouths of those critics and angry fans alike. A movie that will have an ending that will not need another movie or a prequel. A last story of the 4 girls that every guy and girl loved to see once a week.",

It was a bit long but I thought it was good and worth watching for anyone who liked the series. It was easy to skip past the few parts of the movie that were a bit much. (The closet cleaning scene?)I went to see Sex And The City 2 on a date. First off, we were given the evil eye by a 'Devil Wears Prada' look-a-like in front of us for talking too much before the movie even started. Then during the entire movie a women next to me yapped the entire time and said \"My Gawd!\" at least 20 times and Devil-Wears-Prada didn't turn around once for her. Go figure!I won't go into the psychology or social aspect of the film. Plenty of other reviewers of done that.This movie too was too long. It seemed like they went crazy with story, plot and scene ideas and shot every last one to the Nth degree and left absolutely nothing on the cutting room floor. This was like the Directors Cut, extended Version, times two.Many scenes were unnecessary and a bit boring with very trite and predictable jokes and dialog.Do these girls ever do anything without wearing multi-hundred dollar designer clothes? They are on vacation in sweltering United Arab Emirates and they do everything in high fashion. They even go camel riding in nothing but over-the-top looking camel riding gear.Someone needed to take an exacto knife to this script and movie design and edit out a good one-third of it.

The actresses do a good job playing their roles, just as they always have. There is some funny/witty dialogue, and some old flames such as John Corbett come into play, so the movie does have some good things going for it. The thing that's not so great though, is the fact that this film just isn't as good or entertaining overall as the first movie or the TV show. The writing is alright at best, some good parts, but more dull parts than one cares for. The costume design is of course absolutely fabulous as Sex and the City fashion always is.

            "content": "For fans, the more they become part of their lives again, the better. Everything is an excuse to see them on the scene, with new conflicts and agendas. The result of \"Sex and the City 2\" is that it is still wonderful to see them together, but that there was not necessarily a need for another film for this franchise. Although there are problems with the work, the fact is that, during the 146 minutes of projection, it is impossible not to laugh at the antics they go through. While the previous feature captivates with emotion and adds acid humor, this one is only in the mood. The proposal, then, is fulfilled, even though it lacks one of the spices that made the show become a reference in the world: New York.In the two cinematic episodes of Sex and the City, the action follows the same narrative line of his life on television. The only thing really expanded is the schizophrenia of luxury, whose best example is the costumes signed by Patricia Field for each of the characters. And speaking of schizophrenia, the character of Sarah Jessica Parker plays the role that best exposes this issue, either through her clothes, or through a very confused psyche, which combines extremely unconventional and conservatism in the same figure. This time, the writers used a huge gay marriage to talk about civil liberties, and also for Liza Minnelli to star in a version of Single Ladies, hit by singer Beyonc\u00e9, in one of the funniest and most embarrassing scenes in the film. Logically, a gay marriage would not be just a place to celebrate this freedom, but all the schizophrenia of consumption and interference from the pop universe even in the most traditional of events.Much more glamor, parties, charm, travel, the best brands, breathtaking scenery, dresses to leave anyone jaw-dropping and unmissable excitement is what promises Sex and the City 2. But what happens when the film fails to present just the who gave you your greatest charisma: 'sex' and 'city'? In this new reunion of the four best New York friends, there is a little bit of everything, except the essentials. First, because three of them are very well married - and perhaps that means lack of sex, since none of them appears having sex on the scene. And the fourth - Samantha, who has always been the most liberal - spends more time complaining about her age than going into action - she even stars in two 'hot' meetings, but it is still little in the face of the girl's man-eating history.The most fascinating thing about \"Sex and the City\" as a whole is the fact that the public, regardless of sex or sexual option, identifies a little with each character or with the conflicts they experienced in the series and in the cinema. For this to be maintained, they return carrying the essence that marked them. Carrie remains paranoid and perhaps more boring, while Samantha continues with the best comic strips and Charlotte returns to having key moments for free during the screening. The exception is Miranda, whose sarcasm is unfortunately overshadowed, but even so her presence is essential for the balance of the friendship of the four.New York is also a character in history. In the previous feature, the streets of the cosmopolitan city were stages for broken bouquets and amorous twists, even though, from half of the projection to the end, the protagonists also left the city for a renovation trip. In this feature, little is seen of New York and this mischaracterizes what has always been ingrained. The movie's theme song, \"Empire State of Mind\", by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, would be perfect if the plot unfolded major conflicts in NY. The new scenario for the story is not completely displaced, not least because cultural issues are interesting to be observed, but the least that the script could do was preserve the basics. Anyway, the trip to Abu Dhabi brings priceless comic moments, but in none of them the problems of each really move the viewer. So it is worth mentioning that this film is purely for entertainment and maybe even more fun than the first, even though this is inferior when it comes to quality.Again, screenwriter, producer and director Michael Patrick King opts for the juxtaposition of extravagant scenes, each with more dazzling costumes and more elaborate situations than the previous one. However, the plot that makes the connection between the various moments of celebration of femininity and each of the \"fashion show\" looks could be better tied, so that the whole made more sense. As it stands, the romantic comedy falls short and all the moments created to elicit euphoria in the women in the audience seem a little free. The film seeks to deliver to the women in its audience the escapist dream of a luxurious life, in which wonderful men and free vacations can simply fall from the sky. Sex and the City 2 is the fairy tale for the consumer society, in which a fairy godmother in the form of an Arab sheikh rescues women from the hardships of being mothers and wives to take them to the enchanted world of the Middle East, full of possibilities and mysteries.Patrick King recognizes in his script that his protagonists are no longer able to hide wrinkles, even under so much makeup, and position them as true 40s (and 50s) who thought that the stability of life would be maintained when maturity arrived. The issue is not maturity, but the fact that at any point in our lives we will have problems to resolve, and many of them involve feelings and relationships. King's script also shows exhaustion of original situations and sometimes falls into the embarrassment of others. Liza Minnelli singing \"Single Ladies\" is torture, as well as the extensive musical number of the protagonists singing \"I Am Woman\". The fashion under the cloth of Arab women is also dispensable.The mood of the text is shallow, but it is within the expiration date. Among the curiosities, a super advertisement of the actress Suzanne Somers, author of a book, among other activities, and also for the singer Paula Abdul who \"wins a funny character\". Ah! There is also a Brazilian flag with the inscription \"I Love S\u00e3o Paulo\" (near the end when Charlotte buys t-shirts). Stars Miley Cyrus and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz also make points. The soundtrack is consistent with what is seen on the screen and rescues, from 1986, \"True Colors\" in the voice of Cindy Lauper. Sex and the City 2 plays with the cinema by inserting in the plot, again, the faux heartthrob launched by Samantha. However, more than that, he uses a classic B&W (It Happened That Night) as a reference to illustrate Carrie's psychological conflict that he thought was living in black and white, but discovers the colors of life.In the direction, King does a little of the same, since he has never been so technical in his filming, being more urban and creative precisely when capturing the soul of New York. So he remains apathetic as a director when he takes the plot to the East. However, the filmmaker's conception of maintaining the created universe, with the brands and wide-open advertisements, as well as the incredible looks bring back the feeling that we are really seeing \"Sex and the City\", even though it seems like a combination of three episodes in that not everything has its deserved attention, leaving aside and discarding essential characters for the feature. Anyway, only King is able to raise the protagonists with authority and does it well.However, despite all the excesses, the sequel manages to recover from the gaffes of the first film and is not just superficial. Although little tied, the script hits the emotions and dialogues - such as, for example, a great scene between Miranda and Charlotte at the hotel bar in Abu Dhabi -, delivering a result consistent with the trajectory followed by the characters in the six years of the series. Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte are again spherical characters, who show the best of their stereotype - the sex buff or the professional superwoman, for example -, and also rich moments when we see them totally disassembled and fragile, like any woman normal. The big budget also helps and the director takes advantage of desert locations and aerial shots in New York, providing beautiful images.Sex and the City 2 has no justification - over 146 minutes - for its existence. Everything is just an excuse for a parade of stunning costumes - and absolutely unlikely - recycled jokes, and, above all, advertising. But that does not mean that the end result is bad. Quite the opposite. It is quite impressive how well they managed to disguise the absence of a more consistent story, which really took us somewhere. The four characters are more united, and look much more like the ones we get used to seeing in the television series, contrary to what was shown in the previous film. Yes, there are great moments and sequences that are a true dream. And if everything is just an excuse to run into old and well-known friends, at least the fun is guaranteed. Sex and city may be lacking, but there is plenty of laughter, lots of sparkling wine and breathtaking events for the unsuspecting.",

            "content": "As a heterosexual guy I have watch my share of romantic dramas and coming to see the movie \"Sex and the City\" I have to say that though I don't completely hate \"Sex and the City 2\", then again I never had the strong feelings going to see the movie and that I never cared much for the series. I was never invested by the four leading ladies who are constantly obsessed by consuming trendy luxury while talking the talk of sexual empowerment and scoping out a rich beau. Like the series itself and the first installment, they hoped they could swing it both ways. Sadly it was bombarded with vulgar undertones and unscrupulous exhibitions that took over the concept of a serious hidden underneath it.Two years later the sequel reunites the four girls and the vulgarity has elevated to a higher degree. This the consumer-happy quartet locates themselves from their American estates to the very gorgeous, but ultra-expensive Abu Dhabi in the UAE. And though the location was pure eye-candy with the beaches and resorts, I would have felt better watching an infomercial for two and a half hours and would never have known the difference. Just don't engage in tonsil hockey within the public spectrum and make sure that you have enough dough to tip the help generously. The plot is the same crap that materialized from the series. Lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is disgruntled by her boss who constantly dismisses her. Instead of doing the sensible thing, she just calls it quits. To her it feels like a win for woman's liberation. When really it's a cop-out. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is now married with two children wants to get away from the stress of it all even though there's help living with them. Carries (Sarah Jessica Parker) has grown over the fact that her beau is ageing and it outraged when she discovers her book was struck with negative reviews retaliates by kissing an ex-boyfriend. Her husband's reaction is priceless. And sex kitten Samantha (Kim Cattrall) wants to ward off menopause by feeding off hormones due to the restrictions of having sex in a Muslim country.And sure the film takes largely in such heavy-handed topics like menopause and culture clashes. And sure being a mother to young children can be believably overwhelming, it still feels very hokey in my mind's perspective. Sure there's some compelling jabs about declining economy and feeling heroic of child raising alone, but the fact of staying in luxurious hotels makes these ladies hypocrites especially when Carrie tips of a Hindu servant to return home to India to be with his wife.Sure I might be jabbing on the film over the characters, but in the end I'm jabbing at both of them evenly. But if I had the money like them I still wouldn't have liked the film. It just doesn't measure up in what it preaches out to be. Even the fashion looks absurd and not trendy. The women's fashion is over-the-top and scruffy. The camera-work looks jilted and very tiresome at best. Even Liza Minelli's song number looked strange like her face and body didn't match. It was quite an unorthodox experience.",

The movie had it's flaws and the story line wasn't that great, but still it was a movie with 4 great girls, who all looked and were great. The fact that Carry and Big are finally happy together and that Charlotte's marriage finally has it's flaws, made it realistic and nice to watch. I assure you, if you really love SATC, you will love this movie. Samantha made me laugh the entire movie and also Miranda starts to loosen up. I hope there will be a third movie.

Also, Lloyd and Harry dressed MUCH better....some of the SATC clothes were HIDEOUS!!!!! If only I could rate it with a negative number.One of the single most pathetic pieces of cinematography and writing ever. Ever.It would be easy to write an essay for every 5 minutes of film describing how offensive, sub-par and annoying each segment was without even breaking a sweat.Here's a fact also - if these woman/actresses had any talent they would have never done this movie after reading the script - so much for \"producer\" credits and experience. At the very least they should have been able to exert some control, direction and/or changes to this train wreck.Breakdown of the women: narcissistic, whiny, dumb, ignorant, self-absorbed, classless, boring, shallow, weak, drama queens, embarrassing, old, needy and in need of mega therapy.I'm going to agree with other posters who said that SJP is Ugly...no hating here...just burned corneas from staring at the screen in disbelief and realization that there must have been some soft focus lenses getting daily use of the series set.These women need to eat also - it was very distracting to watch them move with sinewy muscle and protruding bones.I'll probably update this review further since there are many things to say but for now please listen to other low rated reviews and do not insult your intelligence. Nothing but plot holes, filler and clich\u00e9s.This movie was baaaaaad - and unless you are sheep that can understand this baaaaad mess, then you should find something more worthy.",

            "content": "I wondered why Michael Patrick King - the writer/director of SATC 2, and overseer of most of the best episodes of the HBO series - could have fallen so flat (if the critics were to be believed). In my opinion, he didn't. It's just that the first 15-minutes, featuring Stanford and Anthony's gay wedding, was unbelievably bad. These characters would never even be dating let alone tying the knot. The Liza Minnelli cameo was beyond preposterous (her scene completely ruined the song SINGLE LADIES forever for me). Even Carrie's \"hat\" made me throw up a little - it looked like something a Disney villainess would wear. Grade so far: F.But after this, the movie is solid and entertaining. The characters and their story lines are all spot on. All the plot turns are believable enough - even the coincidental appearance of Aiden in Abu Dhabi. The only minor complaint I had after the initial 15-minutes was the farcical burka-draped escape from the souk toward the end of the film. But even that scene had its enjoyable moments, such as trying to identify Charlotte, who had separated from the other three, just by her shoes.The actors and actresses are all in top form. I loved Cattrall's Samantha as the embodiment of the \"ugly American\" in a foreign land. Davis works Charlotte's marriage-anxiety very well (although she has always been a little too muggy for my tastes), and Nixon is finally handed a very upbeat arc that really elevates her character Miranda.Sarah Jessica Parker is given a hard line to tread between nag and open-minded adventurer. I have to say she is superb. Never one to overshadow her more colorful co-stars, her humble and understated performance grounds the film.I think the culture clash aspect of the film was handled very realistically. A measure of trust combined with a measure of caution, as seen in Charlotte's introducing herself to her Arabic hosts as \"York\" and not Goldenblatt. Also handled well was the appropriateness of behavior that Samantha takes for granted in the USA. All in all, it would be a mistake for any fan to forego this film because of a few over-the-top moments..",

It's got your favourite characters behaving in their own inimitable way, wearing the loveliest outfits - perfectly accessorised - while facing the trials and tribulations of relationships and sex. If you hate chick-flics, you should know already to stay away. I don't like many of them either, but then I got the opportunity to go to a private screening and decided I should face it with an open mind and a couple of friends. No good deed goes unpunished. Unfortunately the story couldn't convince me. Perhaps die-hard SATC fans can revel in the clich\u00e9s - the gay wedding just had to be fabulously over the top (kudos to Ms. Minelli, though, those are some great pegs and at her age!), Samantha gets arrested for lewd behaviour in Abu Dhabi, Miranda is stressed out at work and Charlotte can't cope with her kids without the bra-less nanny (don't worry, she's not the threat to the marriage that neurotic Charlotte fears) and Carrie and Big go through yet another crisis in their relationship, only to come out even more perfect in the end (to the point where one wonders whether a third installment is possible without culminating in the two having surgery to be joined at the hip) - but I would have preferred it if the film had been somewhat less formulaic.I'm an optimist, I believe it's possible. And there were some themes that I liked, the black- and-white versus colour, for instance - which didn't need a sappy voice-over at the end to explain it. We got it - but all in all not enough to make me love it. A fifty/fifty movie.",

In the early seasons of the show, I would attest to this, but throughout the later seasons, the first movie and the second, I would argue that the girls have matured, taken responsibility for their lives - except for Samantha, who remains the wildest of the four, even after her serious relationship with Smith.The New York sequences are perfect; after all, it's where the girls belong. Even Abu Dhabi wasn't terrible, until Samantha's arrest. From that point on the plot felt convoluted and rushed. This, about half an hour from the end of the movie, however, didn't ruin the rest of the movie, which realistically deals with life after marriage, life after kids and even the tough reality of the workplace. I was thrilled to see Aidan's return, I have always been an Aidan girl. However, as with Smith's appearance,I felt it was mostly just thrown in there for some familiar old thrills from the show. If Aidan had been brought in earlier in the plot, his story line would have been much more strong and enjoyable.The movie isn't perfect, it's very different from the feel of the first, and even most of the shows. However, throw caution to the wind. Put on some heels, go with the girls. Don't think you're going to see the movie of the year (you're not) - think you're going for fun - which you are.",

The entire undertone was \"fuck this backwards country!\" although by the end, Samantha certainly wasn't hinting it subtly. Apart from the entire cringe that was these girls in the Middle East, what story line was there?! Honestly, what was there? Oh Charlotte is stressed out. Okay? Carrie got a bad book review. Okay? This movie couldn't have more honestly been a desperate grab for cash, because nothing else like a real plot seemed to be even been considered.

That's pure fantasy, every girl's dream to be a princess.Samantha's character, as always, delivers the funniest lines/situations in the film. When she's caught having sex on the beach, gets arrested, and the girls eventually have to leave for the airport, a woman dressed in middle-eastern attire shoos the girls into a secret room, where other middle-eastern women are hiding.

            "content": "When I saw the first installment of the two films I was transfixed by the discovery of a new spin in film-making: in order to \"stay young against nature\" as one critic put it, the four characters, to put it that way, resorted to a new kind of make-up that I would call cubist make-up; and as far as I know, this really, really is a first.Two years later the new film also establishes, albeit in a minor scale, the flash style, not so much as flashy or flashing style, but as a flash back and style-of-the-times combo, as the opening credits dumb us.Whether the films stay in tune with the series in spirit depends largely on matters of taste, and I mean that as more important than the ideological import many people depend their critique upon, for the taste exemplified by the series was, despite the occasional witticisms, largely dependent on a privileged and smug and confused sexual/economic impulse; the economic crisis, as at the only point it is referred to by the Samantha character with a yelling voice carrying a stupid, dismissing comment as if the economic crisis was some personal offense, seems to collapse into their \"midlife crisis\" Carrie later refers to, once more impersonating the endearing, humanely preoccupied other side of the coin, while obfuscating the fact she is on that coin. And the collapse is total, midlife and economic crisis falling the one into the other (watch how bizarre the scene between Charlotte and Miranda is, when they exchange luxurious motherly problems while sipping their cocktails like Russian roulette).Now, let's get back to the aesthetic heart of the matter. To cut a long story short, the film risks to earn the title of \"Les Demoiselles d' Abu Dabi - non!\" echoing Picasso's defining masterpiece \"Les Demoiselles d' Avignon\" with its cubist, deconstructed facades (the painting's original title, as Picasso always referred to, was \"The Brothel\"). Here the cubist, deconstructed facades run from the horse-mouthed make-up, to the ludicrous opening credits, to the beyond-the-grave Liza Minelli, to the gay marriage as redeeming alibi (all alibis in the series are gay alibis), to Samantha's Michael Jackson epaulets, the bi-dimensional hotel-and-desert poor, poor depiction of Abu Dabi (which actually is a cheaper country, production-wise) and the more self-castigating actually rather than racist jokes. It's some ass-mind-kiss-numb vortex. Why is that is answered in the end by the unabashed moral, striping the whole series from any witty past: Tradition needs its own decorating. This is one hell of a senseless line. In a tradition-as-decoration universe, you may find yourself expecting that when you squeeze a pimple, instead of pus, some wedding-cake will spurt out. And that may quite easily and cosmetically happen to you.",

Only Samantha -- the oldest in real life -- looked stunning in every shot. Director King, don't you check how the make-up looks in the early rushes before you blow millions on a movie that's supposed to make these fashionistas look their best so we will envy them? I, too, read the reviews before I went and decided no matter how bad it might be I would enjoy a couple hours with my screen \"girlfriends\". I was pleasantly surprised that what was touted as \"Outstanding!\" (dance number at wedding) was only so-so; and what was rated as \"Horrible!' was amusing. i can't understand why the ladies would show so much cleavage and wear shorts in a country where covering up head to toe is the law for native females.

            "content": "In two years amazing things did not happen. It was great at the beginning to have a quick tour of Manhattan and knowing how the company of four had met and what they were like(the audience just loved it). After relaxing for a while I felt like I was in rush hour. The scenes were very fast and had no connection that would give the time to enjoy the movie. Too much time spent in Antony's and Stanford's wedding which main theme was the excess, no time given to the audience to enjoy such event (such as laughs, good jokes)-best performance Mrs. Liza Minnelli. During the reference to the lives of four, such as their family, I was not satisfied by the fact that Carrie and Mr.Big did not keep their apartment and chose another one less big at which the scenes were not bright compared with Carrie's old apartment and had no special decoration as the other apartments. (I mean the ambiance was not good). And then there is the trip to the Middle East (thanking Jerry \u2013 the audience did not have the chance to enjoy his presence at the movie). Amazed by the fact that the transportation of the company of four was made by four Maybachs (excellent choice of car)\u0085we arrived at the luxury hotel. The movie from that point started to get a social aptitude. We were overwhelmed by the social comme il- faut arabian law(which OK it is true but we want to see some funny action and no restraints) and we did not have the chance to see all the outfit of the company of four. Furthermore, the scenes were very quick, some were funny enough but in overall I think the audience was disappointed. The movie's main ambiance was a little depressing. The only story I enjoyed was Miranda's (which during their trip was very amusing) because she had something to give. The camera \"had a fight\" with Carrie and Charlotte. They looked tired and old. Miranda was great. I do not know much about the filters that they use in cameras but they were some\u0085bad takes. My opinion about this movie is that it was sloppy. The movie was big but they chose to give to the audience many stories in quick scenes and did not concentrate to some that needed more time to develop. They could skip some parts. I guess this movie would be great in episodes. As part of the audience in the end of the movie I was tired, emotionally and physically. Emotionally because I was drifted from funny jokes to malign, from optimistic views to the opposite and physically because my eyes were tired from the quick scenes and the alternation dark/bright scenes(indoors,outdoors,night,day). Conclusion: the movie was OK and could have been great.",

I like most movies at some level and rarely walk out on a movie. I am so thankful that I did not pay to purchase a theater ticket to see this atrocious mess. As a rental, I my money loss was small; unfortunately the time lost can never be regained. I kept hoping for something redeeming, something worthwhile, something that would provide a bit of worth. But nothing ever appeared. Its just a vacuous waste. I can't even imagine what the producers were thinking, let alone the director. I have seen movies almost this bad, but fortunately not often. There really is nothing I have to say in a positive way about this movie, even the ending is depressing; it just points out the futility and emptiness of living a self-centered life.

What happened next was close to having my happy chap being slammed in between bricks for 2 hrs+.As far as I can tell these super rich women that have zero grasp of reality are in a group that spend their time shopping, slating their bf;s/husbands and generally doing sweet fa for loads of money.The general plot line , if there is such a thing seems to be Samantha (the slutty one)a publicist gets invited by a Arab hotel owner all expenses to review and help with the hotels image. She somehow drags along horse faced parker, the scary looking ginge and the dark haired dense one.What happens next is Red Rum Parker does a costume change every 5 mins, like wearing a ball gown in a boiling hot middle eastern market..? why??? The slutty one trying to simply get more rides than a Blackpool roller-coaster, The dense dark haired one dealing with her inner emotion of being a mother and the ginge's passion for knowledge and learning.( on a note how she managed to stay pasty white and not burn to a crisp throughout the film is beyond me)2 hrs of this crap... seriously!.. queue a sub plot of the old one being done for having sex on a beach ( wow didn't see that coming )and the '3:15 from Donnington' Parker kissing some random man,even some slow-mo scene involving the Austrialian rugby team!? Every actress seems to milks every screen minute to show how pretty and flowing they can make any dress look. It's beyond me how scenes like the condom market scene or the frankly insulting beyond belief Gucci under burkhas scene was kept in. Did the writers seriously expect us believe that such a character (Samantha) would have no respect for another countries traditions or rules?? I'm not a woman so I cant understand the appeal this series gets.Horse face Parker should be given some sort of uber award for managing to milk 2 films and multiple series out of this crap. On a finishing note- It was way too long, had little or no plot, wooden acting and borderline racist ideas for plot fillers, If your a woman and you loved the series - fine go watch it, my fianc\u00e9e thinks its personally better than the first so if your a uber fan you'll prob love it.",

The papers are full of articles titled \"Why I won't be seeing Sex and the City 2\" but I'm here to change your mind. Two years on, the 4 BFFs have moved on from their single lives and face pressures from husbands, employers, children and nannies. Of course, Samantha doesn't have to worry about any of these as she remains a wild child throughout the sequel. The first part of the movie is \"all work, no play\" for all 4 characters whereas the second part is set in Abu Dhabi where \"PARTY TIME\" begins! Over-the-top details include Liza Minnelli singing a Beyonce song (which is also kind of genius) and Arabic women wearing the entire collection of one of the highest priced brands. If you think it's too much then you can prepare yourself in advance because it doesn't get more out of hand than that. Wilder, yes, but more out of hand, no! Most movie critics tell us what a disappointment this movie is, but we have to face facts: the sequel topped the first film and even the series! I might not be talking about the profit the newest addition to the franchise have made but the storyline is certainly more exciting. Maybe it's just me and all those sparkly accessories blinded me, but the first time left me craving for more and I am already planning my next visit to the cinema. Stop reading those bad reviews and stop giving yourself excuses why you shouldn't invite your friends to come and see this blockbuster with you.

How nice it would be to only worry about who you're going to boink or what mindless party the husband who pays for your spending habits doesn't want to attend. I give credit to Miranda because she works her ass off in her profession. Charlotte cares about her girls but like so many parents gets Overwhelmed.

The End of the movie fails a little bit, it's to fast and it comes without a warning. It's like: So that's the story, thanks for watching and BOOM Credits roll in ... I wasn't anticipating that the story would be the important thing in this movie, it's about the Girls, it always was this way and I hope will stay this way for a third Part. The actors are as great as always ... sure they got old, but they still kick ass. I love the Soundtrack, the clothes, the fun, the friendship, the guys and of course the gals. And at least the story was still so much more fun than the first one ! All that Drama is gone and now Carrie and Mr. Big are just a married couple, but nothing about Big cheating on Carrie is true ! Don't know if that was a PR Gag or something ... but at least it isn't that way around in the movie. And be sure that Samantha with a menopause, however will still be Samantha and there are some freakin' hot guys in Abu-Dhabi. Miley Cyrus is also pretty sweet in her 50 Seconds on Screen.

The sequel however, avoids all these errors and for me watching it was just as enjoyable as my SATC boxset marathons. A lot of the criticism levied at the film revolved around the fact that (nearly) all of the four main characters are now happily married and who would be interested in hearing their stories? Well, actually a fair few I imagine. What DOES happen when the initial sizzle goes out of a marriage and all you do is sit around at home watching TV and settle in to the routine of middle age? Seeing Carrie and Big interact as husband and wife and work that out, whilst also seeing Carrie struggle with the normality of marriage was a great extension to the series.I never thought I'd say this but I'm actually hoping for a third.

We get the schizophrenic position on Abu Dhabi. First it's an Abu Dhabi love fest, then, well, not so much. What happened, guys, did the Abu Dhabi funding pull out when they got a load of the outfits? And as anticipated, Kim Catrell's vagina is back. So much so that it should probably have its own billing in the credits. Ah, that wacky vagina! The blatant product placement you may remember from the first movie is back, too. But this time, it's not only product placement. This time, we get whole segments of dialog dedicated to product promotion. Long segments of dialog. Entire scenes, even. In fact, probably two thirds of the movie is basically a bunch of infomercials strung together.Okay, well anyway, long story short, I'd say borrow the DVD (don't rent, don't buy) and play drinking games - every time the girls change outfits, every time Kim Catrell mentions that wacky vagina, every time Carrie wears something stupid (is there that much alcohol IN THE WORLD?), every blatant product promotion, every time the movie makes you feel just plain uneasy - there's just so much opportunity here.

So because of this movie I will watch series. They convinced me, so much love in this movie, so much laughs. Like they are my friends. I REALLY recommend this movie.",

            "content": "I expected to hate it, based on the scathing reviews, and didn't. I actually enjoyed it. Anyone who's a longtime fan of the series would want to get a fix of time with the four women and their lives, and forgive even the lapses in quality of the film. That being said, by movie standards, and by standards of those who are not fans of the TV show (or first film), the film is almost shockingly inept. Incredibly badly photographed, patchy storyline, contrived plots, inconsistent characters with previous episodes, corny moments, and unnecessarily shallow. But again I enjoyed myself, forgiving the lapses. It was fun to see the girls, who acted like they were enjoying each other, and the ride. Very comforting, in fact. I found, though, that the movie pumped up all the virtues so that everything was too much, too big, too loud, too broad, too shallow, too obvious, too corny. It moved from sophisticated to broad, from incisive look at single New York women who addressed contemporary relationships with men, sex, their work and friendship to more immature hissyfits over nothing. While they looked older, they acted more juvenile than originally written. I felt the clothes, which were always inventive, were gaudy, excessive and, the gravest flaw, were not clothes that Carrie would have actually worn, which was the beauty of the show. The Jump the Shark moment for me was her crinoline with vintage t shirt for the Arabian bazaar, which was preposterous. Carrie would never wear that. It were moments like that where I internally groaned, though, again, was just forgiving, like, Whatever. Ultimately, I loved seeing the girls, the pro-women message, while heavy-handed, was touching, and it made points in reinforcing Carrie and Big's determination to live as an independent couple. Miranda's professional dilemma, however, was unbelievable and uber- contrived. Charlotte's borderline unbelievable and contrived. Mario Cantone would never have let anyone else party-plan his wedding, would never have married Sanford, and that whole sequence looked like a movie set. But as I said, enjoyed it anyway. Hope they get their creative bearings on-track for the third film, which I will still see opening weekend.",

I thought the series was good, some years better than others, but overall funny, smart and what made it good was TIGHT writing. A lot was delivered in span of that TV show. Not as much was delivered in the first movie, but still enough to keep you hooked. But this one? OMG! It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. Literally. I kept thinking didn't anyone EDIT this script? I almost walked out before it ended, but didn't because I knew Mr. Big would reappear and he's worth just looking at on a big screen. But please...the plot was ludicrious and took us out of 'The City' which IS one of the characters. The acting and character development was so lame, and empty it was like they were all cardboard cutouts of themselves. It lacked '2 year follow-up' and development of the group. They were just 'plopped' down and twirled around until another costume change. If you're going to have a sequel give us something, not just costume changes. Give us the depth the show had. There was SO much that could have been done between the last movie and this. It was about as boring as watching Carrie and Big sit on the couch and watch black and white old movies. No, it was worse than that. It was like watching the make-up dry on Liza Minelli's face.Awful. Stay away from this movie. It's not even worth renting. Skip it. You'll be upset with King for writing this piece of garbage and mad at the actors for selling out and acting (if you can call it that) in it.I had read other reviews on this site and thought, oh, it can't be THAT bad. The last movie got panned, and it was still a fun little romp. And it was. People laughed, cheered, and clapped in that movie. This one, NO ONE in the audience laughed except once. I think they were all in shock like I was wondering what happened to the writing and acting that we were so used to enjoying.",

If you want to know what went around in the show, check out the TV show trivia and if you need to remember what went on in the first movie, visit Sex and The City The Movie Now, the second film: Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Big (Chris Noth) are about to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) has always gotten the family she wanted-she has two beautiful daughters and she is happy with her husband Harry (Evan Handler). Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Steve (David Eigenberg) are back and happy together. Samantha (Kim Catrall) is\u0085well\u0085 Samantha. Of course things are not as smooth as they first might seem: Carrie is afraid Big is getting too comfortable in their marriage. She starts to freak out that they will turn into a boring old married couple. After all, Big is too fond of watching TV, ordering and staying in. She is now working on her new book and this time it is about marriage. Samantha is over 50 and she is dealing with the side-effects of menopause in a very Samantha way: taking as many pills as she can so that she can \"trick her body into thinking it is younger\" and it seems to be working. Her libido is back and her hot flushes are under control. She is in fact the happiest of the bunch. Miranda and Steve are great as a couple but Miranda's now asshole of a colleague is giving her nightmares. For the first time in her life, Miranda is dreading her office and hating her job. It doesn't seem worth the trouble that she is missing out on all of her son Brady's important moments. Charlotte is about to have a nervous breakdown. Her baby won't stop crying. In fact she is so relentless and loud, she could have been a perfect commercial for promoting birth control. And despite being a mild child, her oldest Lily is sick of all the attention Rose is getting. Thankfully, her nanny (Alice Eve) is a god-sent, She is sweet, lovely and really great with the kids. But one problem: She is a young, pretty blonde with big breasts. And she doesn't wear bras\u0085. So when Samantha meets her ex Smith's (Jason Lewis) movie producer, a very rich man from Abu Dhabi and the gets a job offer, the girls are presented with the chance to an all expenses paid vacation. They will have a chance to get away from it all and there will be 4 of them- without the kids and the men. Just what they all needed. However, how smart is it really for Samantha to be in a Muslim city where most of the population doesn't consist of modern, new generation Muslims but old-fashioned, ultra-traditional and conventional people? Where women mostly cover all of their bodies and hair and so do men? It gets much worse when she meets an attractive Danish architect (Max Ryan) and well\u0085wants to do him. But the greatest yet the worst thing happens to Carrie when he runs into Aidan (John Corbett), the second love of her life. The guy she almost married\u0085 Are they truly over each other? Will it be a reunion for \"two old friends\" or is she actually playing with fire as Charlotte suggested?The review for the show, the first movie and more analyzing on the first movie is on pinartarhan.com/blog",

Having recently been to the middle east - I can't express how appalling the obvious and not really funny jokes and observations they put out there. I'm hoping it didn't go far internationally as it's truly embarrassing to Amercans.What the heck happened? From costuming to makeup this movie was beyond \"off.\" Did the directors and producers suffer brain damage that made them approve the dailies for this piece of crap?Everyone looks old tired and uncomfortable. Way older than they are by the way. Dressed ridiculously for anywhere - much less a trip to the middle east. Aiden was the only one that looked like he was traveling on earth. The rest were fashion victims of several IDIOT stylists. The plot was actually worse than a combination of clich\u00e9s from the smart series. From an over the top gay wedding to Samantha conning some Emir into a lavish trip. It's not fun even if you watch to ridicule it. Several drinks might not even help.Here I sit - painfully watching this train wreck on HBO - apparently with a horrible karaoke scene coming up. One gets the sense that every member of the cast realized what a dog it was and barely acted. I guess every actor needs to round out their accolades with a razzie or two huh? Hope they cashed in on this one as I'd bet their phones stopped ringing the minute this came out.There's two and a half hours of my life I'll never get back...Save yourself! Don't even bother to watch it.(And that's the reason I bothered to type this review.)FYI - I did manage to get to the end of this horror completely sober. However tempted I was to get stone drunk to see if it would get the bad taste out of my mouth. It wouldn't have helped anyway...My final conclusion: The producers became so tired of this concession that they murdered it. How do you KNOW there will be NO SATC3? By charging admission to this insulting garbage. And I mean insulting to every stripe of viewer, fans, the subject matter, the location and the poor actors. Don't worry. No one will be asking about another SATC movie. While I'm personally neither here nor there about Kim Catrall, SATC2 gets the prize for giving an actress the worst stereotypical \"unlikeable and stupid slut\" role I've ever seen on film. I was actually embarrassed for Catrall in the second half. The directors and writers get the \"Idiot\" for thinking it could play as campy.

In this film ironic and even sarcastic humor that distinguished the show from the others is gone...The show just got so old that humor vanished along with Samantha's estrogen.. The characters are dull, the story line is boring and some of the scenes are just stretched.. In my opinion - the movie would be enjoyable if I was a 16 year old stuck in a body of a 50 year old woman.. Producers should have left the legend of \"Sex and the city\" be. Instead of completing the show this movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The main character Carrie not only got old from the outside, she got rotten from the inside as well - instead of living happily ever after she still focuses on the small things making an elephant out of the small marital problems. Since she obviously is not happy and not even young and beautiful, the producers decide to go back to one of the old story lines - Carrie meets her old love in the middle of the Middle East. Not only is this storyline unreal, but it is unnecessary as well.. The character Samanta..well lets just say that free spirited femme fatale was the FATAL error in this movie. Not only was she boring, her sex scene in this movie was just one close up away from the actual porn movie.. To conclude, I have to say, that if it wasn't for Miranda and Charlotte - the movie would have been a complete waste of time. I was really happy to see that at least two of the original four characters moved on with their life - found new purpose and new topics and the old wounds were not brought up. All and all the movie was disappointing..I will never like \"Sex and the city\" again..",

I don't call the flick asinine because of its characters or content (some level of laughable drama and superficiality is to be expected) but rather because the sheer unimaginativeness of it all: the drab, been-there-before lines, and most of all, the truly embarrassing West Meets Middle East triteness. It was as if a freshman producer had googled \"things that can go wrong when 40-something neophytes visit Abu Dhabi\" and then churned out a film based on the search results. I won't provide spoilers, but suffice it to say that Murphy's Law of traveling chic New Yorkers in the UAE holds true--but would you really expect anything different? Most frustrating was the film's length: a good hour longer than it ought to be, the film begins in earnest with a wedding scene that accomplishes nothing in terms of dramatic effect, but takes a great deal of time to trudge through. The viewer feels like he has eaten enough appetizers to fill him up that he doesn't even want to see -- let alone eat -- the course that comes next. Indeed, the film's structure feels so unbalanced and ambitious that even the most devout fan of SATC is eager to hear Parker's hideously sentimental (and oddly expositorial) closing line come, just as a sign that the torture is over.There is one admirable scene between Davis and Nixon on the challenge of motherhood and career balance, and \"Mr. Big\" delivers a respectable performance. But otherwise, save this afterthought of a movie for a Tuesday night $1 rental over some cheap wine. That's about all it's worth.",

(2) Poor Charlotte who doesn't appear to work has a beautiful nanny. (3) Miranda has the only thing that could be considered a real problem, a misogynist boss. Cured by throwing a hissy fit and giving up the job without any real fight. (4) Sorry, can't remember what \"problem\" Samantha had.But wait until they start heading to \"The Arab World\".

Taking the girls out of NYC was not a great idea and didn't help the story line once so ever. It had its funny moments, it had its dragged out moments and it had the same old SATC moments. It was definitely NOT as good as the 1st movie, but it is still worth going to see.

It is for Miranda and Charlotte though.The first part of the film feels more Sex and the City than the latter (when they go to the middle east).Charlotte's worry over the nanny is realistic and when her and Miranda have a 1 on 1 at the bar it felt very real and true for friends to talk deeply about their lives concerning motherhood.Samantha is over sexualized (yes this happened). Going to the middle east was a vacation but it was also business for Samantha so her behavior there was out of character. She would NEVER jeopardize work with her sexual temptations. She knew how to separate work and sex like a professional but she is wanting sex so much that she uses sexual innuendos so much in an unprofessional manner with her business colleagues that it is cringy (especially since her sex drive is very low anyway). It was disappointing to see Samantha as unlikable. The only good parts with Samantha is towards the end right after Carrie and Aiden had dinner. Perfect Samantha you're back!Carrie's problem with Big is so childish it's very unrealistic. She worried so much about Big's feelings after the incident in the first film that she threw it out the window when they're married.Here is where she meets up with Aiden (which what are the odds) in the middle east and his character is so cringy and disgusting I think they forgot that Aiden was loyal to his wife, has kids, and is happily married. This Aiden is like a dark twisted version of him that I cannot even grasp. He was the good guy in the series, the perfect guy, the romantic... now he is a creep who breaks vows. I just don't think this Aiden is real and Carrie's behavior with him is appalling. From what we see with her and Big I had no idea she hated their coupling so much she'd do that to him...It's a terrible plot for Carrie and Big to add that into the mixture and personally it feels unrealistic that they'd even get back together afterwards. Carrie in this film is basically where \"once a cheater always a cheater\" comes from. If I were Big I'd run but because Big is so in love with her (who knows why) he decides to give her s ring to 'remind' her that she's taken.When Carrie asks why the diamond is black I laughed when she thought it was because of her soul. I was disappointed when Big said it was because she was unique but we all know it's because of her soul.Even Carrie is self aware that she is a bad wife and a nag with a black soul. That's the only accurate thing in this film. It's only watchable for Charlotte and Miranda.Carrie is such a bad friend in this film she went back to a crappy character. She uses Samantha to get her into a premiere Big doesn't even want to go to and she tells Charlotte in a mean way she's crazy. Miranda's actions and behavior in the film is what saves it. She's fun, happy, true to her character and has even learned that telling Carrie she's being stupid won't stop her from doing stupid things as Charlotte takes on that role. It was a vacation for Miranda and she deserved it.",

I am more bothered by the plot holes than any of the other hot topics oft-discussed here, e.g. it taking place largely in Abu Dhabi, the AbFab-approaching ridiculousness of some of the costumes (Carrie in the J'adore Dior outfit meeting Aiden in the souk market tops it). So, let's see: it's been two years since the end of SATC1, which ended with Charlotte discovering she's pregnant, but somehow she skipped the whole nine-months pregnancy thing and spurted out a kid who's already a \"terrible twos\" toddler. Stanford and Anthony, two basically upper-middle-class Manhattanites, hire Liza to not only officiate but sing at their wedding. Bitch, please: Liza's pricetag for such an endeavor would eclipse the $1 million Elton John got for doing Rush Limbaugh's reception, and there is no freakin' way they'd have the dough for that.Abu Dhabi? Their trip there is at first described as the \"month to go before temperatures meet melting.\" Then a clock in Big's apartment indicates that it's August, meaning that that month expired four months ago (everything else in the film, however, implies that the film takes place in spring 2010). Then Samantha says it's 118 degrees as they're headed to the airport. Really, WTF? A huge chunk of the last film was about Big buying Carrie the Fifth Avenue penthouse of their dreams, replete with epic shoe closet ... which they apparently immediately replace with a small-ish apartment on a lower floor. I can only assume the writers did this as a concession to the economy, but the plot flaw here is that while Carrie never sold her UES apartment because the market was bad, apparently they had no problems selling the penthouse. The priciest real estate in the city, in the city's worst economic crisis in 75 years. Uh-huhhhhhh.Concurred that this film had largely no plot and that it was ridiculous for Carrie to randomly encounter Aiden in an Abu Dhabi souk. (Realistically, a rug shopper would not be going to the UAE for bargains.) There was WAY too much quasi-women empowerment stuff, from the \"I Am Woman\" scene at the karaoke place to Charlotte and Miranda hashing it out that they're \"bad mothers\" because they realize that child-rearing many times sucks, even given their extremely privileged positions as women who are lawyers and wife-of lawyers who can afford full-time nanny care. I did think the UAE, even if it's the most liberal of Arab cultures, deserved its much needed digs at women's continued subservience in such nations, and I am imagine the producers added it after they were denied permission to film in Dubai, solely out of fear that SATC was not \"morally acceptable\" under UAE doctrine.The biggest problem the film had, however, was a lack of resolution of the Carrie/Big baby matter, which I can only assume was done to save a plot for the now-not-likely SATC3 movie. Plot-wise and logically, the thing missing from Big and Carrie's marriage was not just a diamond ring, but a baby, and considering SJP had a surrogate harvesting her two twins during filming, I am amazed this did not come up.",

We know better.

Guess they shouldn't have made a second movie...Am I ready now?? Can I go now, please??",

            "content": "It's a known fact that the sequel to any movie is never as great as the original, but after watching the first movie (which I thought was pretty decent for being based on a TV show) I was really eager to see the second one. However, my doubts about this movie kicked in within the first 10 minutes, starting with the surprising (and awkward) cameo of Liza Minelli dancing (and even more awkwardly singing) to Single Ladies. After that, every scene seemed to be one face palm after the other between the cheesy humor and dramatic story lines. In fact, one of the things that I think dimmed this movie's spark was the outrageously unrealistic situations in which each of the characters were put in - like Miranda quitting her privileged (and cushy) job as a lawyer to become a full time stay at home mom -.- And did I mention how ungrateful they were this in movie? I mean Big gets Carrie a turnable flat-screened TV for their anniversary and she's pouty because it's not jewelry. Another irritating characteristic - the fact that every single character in the movie had an irritating trait. Want me to list them? OK: Carrie was being a whiny little baby about everything Big did, Miranda became a walking travel guide/manual/dictionary , Charlotte took stupidity to another level, and Samantha only spoke in one-liners. I mean, it is hard to like a movie when you can't even stomach the four main characters.Long story short, the movie had it's thrillers and shocks but the outcomes tended to provoke audiences into a yawn or a frustrated rolling of the eyes. But I will give it to each woman in the movie...they looked fabulous, and the movie as a whole made me appreciate the joys of female life. And maybe - just maybe, I can grow up to be like one of them....rich, sexy, with 3 best girl friends - and still having drama.",

I absolutely fell in love with the show and ended up buying the entire series on DVD. I also enjoyed the first movie - it kept the tone of the show and the characters maintained their personalities, etc.I was so disappointed by the 2nd movie. -There was barely a plot. After two hours in the theater, I only remember one significant thing happening. -The characters were not themselves. Carrie made one pun that I can remember, Charlotte was so weak and unhappy through the whole thing, and Miranda was way too excited and happy about everything (I missed the realist/cynic). Samantha was the only one who got to maintain part of her personality, and even that was weaker than on the show. -Too many celebrity cameos that didn't really contribute to the story -Too much pandering to the audience. It was all about saying things that would make women cheer in the theater. It's hard to raise a child *cheers* Men don't like women to speak because they are afraid of strong women *cheers* let's all sing \"I am woman\" *cheers* -Too many things happened that had no explanation and weren't built upon. (EX: When did Stanford and Anthony start dating?) -Where was everyone else? I think Miranda and Charlotte's husbands each had one line. Magda made a few faces. They focused completely on the 4 ladies and Big, but there still wasn't really a story.Overall, it just made me sad to see how much potential the movie had (why didn't they show more of the 80s? etc.). It just wasn't the Sex and the City that I came to love! I don't think I will even buy it when it comes out on DVD.",

However, it could have been improved upon. But practically everyone was displeased with the second movie. The plot was weak, and the bulk of the movie was in a foreign country. The ads always declare that New York is the fifth character, and she was absent from most of it. Also, they finally bring Aiden back, and then they didn't do nearly enough with that character. Now because of this poor sequel everyone says that Sex is over and there should not be a third movie. It's not that our interest is gone. The problem is that the storyline needs to be much improved. We still want to see our gals in a third movie. We just want it to be interesting and dramatic. We need more than exotic locations and glamorous outfits. Michael Patrick King please contact me as I have an excellent idea for a sequel. We want our gals to go out with a bang and not a whimper.

I'm glad we did. Because really, it wasn't that bad.Sure, there are some cringe worthy moments (Liza Minnelli singing Beyonce, the karaoke scene, and the oh so horrid \"Lawrence of my Labia\" remark), but otherwise there were funny Carrie one liners, gorgeous fashion, good looking men and of course, the hilarious Samantha. The entire cinema seemed to enjoy it, and there were times where we couldn't stop laughing because it was so hilarious! On the downside, the girls just don't have a good grasp on reality... Carrie and Big's marriage is just so unrealistic it's not funny (who eats out EVERY SINGLE NIGHT?!). Plus their moaning about not making first class somewhat annoyed me, as did Big giving Carrie the ring at the end (C'mon, she blew it, why give her JEWELLERY?!) You do have to remember though that it's JUST A MOVIE, and not to take it too seriously.At the end of the day, it's definitely not a 10/10, but I think it deserved a 6 at least. I think what people need to realise is that it's been years since the TV series, and the girls are now older and pretty much all settled down with kids. It was a pleasure to watch them, but I think they should leave it there. SATC 3 would be pushing it in my opinion.Go see it for yourself, don't take it too seriously and make up your own mind.

            "content": "Riding the popularity of the 2008 movie, 'Sex And The City 2' boldly dares to continue a story that was well and truly ended twice. The first full-length feature justified its existence with the genuinely plausible next phase of Carrie and company's lives; the sequel, bravely, came forward with the tried and tested adage that girls just really want have to fun. Where its predecessor was an often sombre affair, number two revels in enough hedonism to make up for the previous lack of it.Finally and happily married, Carrie has settled in to her life with Mr. Big as her friends have to their own commitments; Miranda and Charlotte have also settled into their unions, while Samantha is finally serving herself alone, just how she likes it. This is the sequel's main stumbling block, that the characters have faced nearly every relationship ache imaginable. Therefore, their individual conflicts they face in 'Sex And The City 2' - heavy chested nannies and irritating bosses - are so trivial that the unfolding drama sadly reverts the characters into exaggerated caricatures of their former selves.Courageously switching the main location from New York City to the Middle Eastern culture of Abu Dhabi, the film is similar to several episodes from the show that staged the girl's exploits elsewhere; New York City, however, was a major character in itself, one that isn't easily replaced by a holiday destination that offers endless opportunities for escapades which sadly, hardly ever occur.There is still plenty of heart and emotion, but long term fans unfortunately begin to feel like they can't root for their favourite characters anymore, as they are written in a manner that actually portrays them in the negative light that critics have long ascribed to them. Clashing their New York sass against the culture of the Middle East is a clever, though often uncomfortable concept as the film tackles racism like no other franchise - forever considering equal opportunities - could.There is much to enjoy about 'Sex And The City 2', such as its intricate wardrobe and lavish setting; when the most positive aspects of the movie are aesthetics, however, it is hard not to realise that the sequel is a somewhat vacant affair. It does contrast the heavy tone of the first movie well, making it an excellent companion piece, though with such shallow character conflicts, it tarnishes the resolution and conclusion of the 2008 feature. Therefore, audiences are left itching for a third and final film not to satisfy their lust for more 'Sex And The City', but to regain a sense of closure.",

When I got out of the theater my notion was that the production team had no script what-so-ever in mind, and they just scribbled down 4 little plots that could (and were resolved)in a five minute radius. The rest of the film is summed up to easy jokes and lavish (but not so fine) fashion. That was not a film, it was project runway with continuity issues. Don't get me wrong,it was fine for an all-girls night out but it was not the Sex and the City that we all know and love (I still watch the series in re-runs). 1st issue: Where is the City? I mean 80% of the movie is set in the Middle-East (and filmed in Marocco actually). It should be called Sex and the City on vacation. For me it should have been half the movie in NYC and the other half in M.E. 2nd issue: It was too long. For a film that was so sloppy written and had little to no plot, it should have ended sooner. 3rd issue: Camera angles people, editing room, filters. The ladies are growing and some shots were really unflattering especially for Carrie and Sharlotte (oh God the close-up when SJP puts the eyeliner! If I was SJP I would cut that scene).Samantha was OK and Miranda for me was gorgeous.(her style has really evolved from the series). 4th issue: What happened to the characters? We're used to Carrie being whiny, selfish and messing it up but she sure did a number this time. For a girl who spend 6 years chasing Mr. Big (Chris Noth was great by the way) she surely messed it up with the guy she \"allegedly\" loves. I liked Sharlotte's storyline (though she went a bit overboard)and I liked Miranda's too. Actually I liked Miranda more than the other three. And Samantha, oh God Samantha. We know she's over the top, but man that was too much. Aside the sex-drive, Sam Jones is also a PR Pro. Let me tell you something; she didn't act like one, not in the very least. Also it was no wonder the Emirates didn't allow them to shoot the movie there. Some part were really disrespectful to the culture there. I'm not a fan of romantic comedies. I always prefer a good shoot-out that a tear fest. But Sex and the City is my guilty pleasure because is more comedy with a spice of Love. I couldn't find that spice, not in this movie. If they are to make a third, they should pay very close attention to the script. Otherwise leave a fine franchise at rest. Peace.",

Miranda was almost as bad with her attempts to speak the language. And Charlotte being afraid to use her last name Goldenblatt because they were in the UAE was the most offensive. I am very upset with the portrayal of Aiden, they turned him into a better-looking version of Big. I was excited at first when I heard he was in this movie, but after seeing how his character was written, had I known it would have worked out the way it did I wouldn't have bothered seeing it.The \"fight\" scene with Big (if you can even call it a fight) was poorly done and his way of accepting Carrie's apology I felt was lame. Heaven forbid a married woman should wear a wedding ring! Oh my what a punishment. All in all I am super disappointed in the whole thing. The Liza cameo was so painful to watch, even though it was at the start of the movie I was tempted to leave after that scene.

Yes and No. Yes, the actors seem to have forgotten how to act. The shouts and screams seem over the top and the girls lost their fun interaction. But is seeing the actors of your once favorite show again worth a couple of bucks? Yes.Let's be fair. Was it worse than the first movie? Not really. At least now there is a story to tell, even if it is a bad one. Let's not forget that the first movie only had a story line because of mr Big's two minute pre wedding jitters. What story would we have had if Carrie had not exploded and made a big deal out of nothing. After all Big turned around almost instantly. For Carrie to act this way when he is the love of her life, seemed like a desperate attempt from the writers to get a story line.So.. with this new one, at least it makes more sense. And yes, the oversexed attitude of Samantha lost its appeal. And yes, Charlotte and Miranda looked old. And yes, Carrie became a whining wife. So one is right to dispute that the original characters just aren't what they used to be.But despite that, it is still Sex and the City and they are still Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha. If anything the writers tried too hard to make them into their fun characters. Maybe they forgot that having these women on the screen is enough to please the millions of fans. We really did not need the writers to exhaust themselves over a script that is clearly overdone.If I were to say anything about this movie, it would be that it is overdone. But in some way I still enjoyed it, just because I got a glimpse of my favorite TV series and because of the vow I took to watch any movie,show or series that features these women together.

This movie just made me want to cry. I guess the time really does not pass on any and really leave marks. I guess the edited pictures of the move made me think that after all these years, the girls still got it. I watched the last movie 2 years ago and the foursome still looked OK. But this time, I was really startled, scared, ambushed by screen after screen of each actor's fading face. Big, he is still charming but his face is starting to look like a senior citizen. Carrie, I don't know why she is still into big bushy hair and big skirts at her age, she really looks like a witch. With her skinny face, it looks even more gruesome with her eyes look smaller ever and cheek bones sticking out. Charlotte, she is still graceful but with her aging face, she should not dress like 35 anymore to make her look don't fit with her dress. Miranda, she is still put together but when at one scene when she turned around with a frowning face, her cheek looks like it was going so down it was going to fall out of her chin. The only actor in there that does not show as much sign of aging is Aidan, boy when he appeared, it was such a cool air in a hot sticky day, he still looks the same, maybe a bit darker, face - a little wider, but at least it does not look like it is falling apart or looking like a skull with rotten skin on it. Finally Samantha, she is losing her face definition and she looks like a grandma at best but she still acts like a crazy woman. I couldn't resist to check on their ages and found that they are not so old yet, 45, or 55. Aidan is 49 but he looks the best. I really think these actors should take the responsibility in taking care of their appearance, 45 looking so old and 55 looking like a senior already is crazy. Isn't 45 the new 35 and 55 the new 45? Their face look like the their wax sculpture is melting and their face is rapidly melting away and they are still walking around.Overall, the style is still the same, glamorous, women issues with great hair and great outfit, but that really need some great face and great attitude to carry that, or it is just one big disgusting stinking act. I saw there are already a lot of bad reviews but I just cannot stay quiet and not say how disappointed I am with the movie.I really hope this movie does not come out the III and these characters can rest in peace to leave us the nice memories.",

            "content": "I was taken along to watch this movie with my wife; not being particularly au fait with the series, nor having watched the first movie. I therefore felt I could look at the movie somewhat more objectively than my wife or her friends did. I have to say that the film surprised me in that there wasn't much of the 'city' in Sex and the City. It pretty much went from a wedding in a countryside retreat to the Middle East; and New York itself, despite featuring over and over as the place of wonder and aspiration in the soundtrack (\"....n' Noooooooooo Yauuuuuk...\"), featured very little. Otherwise than this my overarching feeling was that the film was completely preoccupied with three themes; sex, luxury and drugs (in the broad, stimulants, sense). It was as if the script writers put these things on a huge cork-board and then set to writing every scene looking only at these three words. Firstly the sex. Now this title-element did not suffer a lack of presence in the film in the way the City did. Yes, sex was omnipresent throughout the film. Not just the physical, graphic sex or nudity, although that was in plentiful supply. No, there was also a constant drip-feed of innuendo, sex-talk, body parts (the nanny's breasts, the man's erection, the Rugby-player's bodies, the exposed legs...), gay cheating, straight cheating, kissing, touching and sexual frustration in general. Secondly was the luxury. Now again, this featuring heavily in itself comes as no surprise, but I think I was just shocked at the sheer relentlessness of the theme in the film. Luxury fashion of course; but also luxury rural retreats, restaurants, apartments, furniture, Rolexs, diamond rings, cars, TVs, airline seats, servants, drivers, trips, food, animals, drinks... I read some time ago that this would be a recession- film, where Big would lose his job and we would see another side of the city, but I guess like a pre-election government they eventually thought that's not what the voters (viewers) really wanted to hear about. Instead they went square opposite, going all out on the luxury, but throwing in a couple of occasional - and therefore completely incongruous - references to \"this awful recession\". I guess the risk of making a very boom-time-riches film, set in recession-ridden NY is what made them change the location. Instead deciding to set most of the film in the permanently oil-rich Middle East, and have almost all the antics funded by an oil-rich sheikh with an endless stream of money. Whilst this perhaps made more sense, it did in my opinion take the film to a sickening level of luxury. Like being force-fed ten portions of your favourite desert, the unending and unearned, undeserved continual opulence and grandeur were laid on so thick that I think after half an hour most people will become either immune to it or nauseated by it.Finally, there were the drugs. As noted above I mean in the stimulant sense, as in caffeine, alcohol and similar substances (although there were hashish pipes and boxes/mouthfuls of pills as well). Admittedly I consume both caffeine and alcohol and have nothing against either, but I was amazed by the amount of both in the film; it was as if one or other had to be in every single scene, as a sort of visual liquid-stimulant for the audience. Filter Coffee, Tea, Middle-Eastern Tea from little golden cups, Tea from Silver Teapots, Espresso, Tea from China Cups, Warm Milk with Cinammon (perhaps to break the chain of alcohol, caffeine, alcohol, caffeine), Champange, Champagne Cocktails, White Wine, Red Wine, Pink cocktails, Orange cocktails, Other cocktails, Whiskey... the list goes on. All in all I would say that as far as sheer escapism goes the film did tick a lot of boxes, but personally it left me with a very hollow feeling.",

I hesitated dragging my husband on our night out to see it, but we were in for a treat! Sex and the City 2 was made with a different outlook than the series and the first movie and that is why a lot of people didn't like it. It focuses on the married lives of 3 of the 4 friends and it has no longer that cool-single-new york city lifestyle happening, where we constantly watched Carrie dragging herself around the city looking for love and looking to be loved. The single crowd could no longer identify with the characters since they were all married and Samantha, who is the only one with the crazy fun single lifestyle has menopause and gets comments on being old for her fashion style. If I was single, after seeing this movie, I would have also hated it and found it repulsive to watch, since its focusing on married people and the ones who are not married or getting married are old and menopausal. Nevertheless, as for married people I find it a very good entertaining film, easy and fun to watch, with problems that married couples can related to. The middle-eastern experience was fun, since they have played too much the new york city lifestyle and it was very refreshing to have them in a different scenery, and it gave the movie a funny twist. I expected it to be a lot worse. Not bad for Carrie and her learning experience on love and marriage! If you like this kind of movies and shows, don't hesitate to watch it!!!",

And it began as expected, with funny situations and presenting four well educated, professionally successful, wealthy and independent women in their 30s to 50s (at least seemed to be the idea). Then it came the Middle East and the women started to act like teenagers from a poor neighborhood that just hit the lotto and the film became superficial, absurd and worst of all Boring. At the end went so bad that I started to think in films like \"The Naked Gun\" and \"Scary Movie\". I never understood any character; the \"lawyer\" looked like the intern of the firm and it seems she didn't gave a penny for his son and husband; the \"mother\" (who uses and expensive skirt to do pastry?) was just a flat character and not even funny ; the \"publicist\" was taken from a low budget x-rated film, vulgar, brainless, over the top superficial with a sex appetite that never was explained or even interesting; and finally the \"writer\" (because all girls movies should have one) was a cheesy, predictable and teen character. The end was beyond ridiculous with the Muslim women using \"expensive garments\" (the leader looked like a parrot) and hiding in a cheap market, I would guess wealthy women in the Middle East may have better places to be and may use more comfortable clothes for that weather (which can be expensive of course). Finally I will talk about men. They basically could be changed for clothes, accessories or even a pet and the history will be the same, but lets be fair, women in boys films are also for show up. SATC is a long, most of the time boring, superficial and silly comedy, if your girl like it, I would think twice to continue dating her.",

I thought maybe Carrie will get in some trouble for writing a piece on some of the outdated traditions of the Arabian Gulf. King, however preferred to give the platform to Samantha to do all of the 'oh no they didn't' for them.I love the series and I liked the first film because we needed real closure. However, they seem to have ran out of idea's and decided to turn to fiction rather than what the show has always been about which was reality and human relations. This film lacks a lot of research when it comes to UAE and the Arabian Gulf. Facts are misrepresented and although they did reveal some realities, the film reminded me of Aladdin the animated film where they embark on their riffraff journey. Forced adventure and negligence to find the line between provocative and distasteful. **SPOILER**One thing that really disturbed me was the scene where Charlotte tells Carrie that she's using her Christian name York as opposed to her Jewish name Goldenblatt. Carrie asks her why and she quickly replies repetitively \"we're in the Middle East\" but then Carrie reaffirms that UAE is the \"New Middle East\".Now this would've been a wonderful message to send out if it wasn't for the ignorance of the writers. The UAE and most gulf countries do not object to the entry of Jews in their countries but they do object to the entry of Israelis due the political problems between Israel and most Arab countries. Carrie's response to Charlotte would've been an ever greater one if Samantha did not end the trip by saying \"new Middle East my a$$\" . I ponder as to what was the intention of the whole new ME thing to begin with? If the four sexy new yorkers are there to break stereotypes or reinforce them ?This film lacked a sense of reality and lacked a lot of research.I give it a 4/10. I loved seeing my girls again but I'm afraid my girls have gone too fictional for my taste.",

Glitzy, glamorous and geriatric, I couldn't help but wonder\u0085was this the best they could do? The reaction to the second film has been mixed at best, but still I was curious as to how this new instalment in the SATC franchise would unfold, so I bit the bullet and sat through the whole film. All ill-judged 146 minutes of it. The wry wit and passion of the television series has long burnt out and now we watch 4 privileged, wealthy, middle aged women, moan and whine about the dull and difficult role of being a career woman, a mother, a semi-newlywed and a menopausal cougar.These women live in the most exciting city in the world, they have amazing opportunities and for the most part they have everything they could ever have wished for. But of course, it's just not enough for them. Whilst the television series was thought provoking and risqu\u00e9, this insipid sequel lacks any of the shine and pep of the original incarnation. At least when we watched the show weekly we had time in 40 minutes to laugh, cry, cringe and marvel at the antics of the fiery foursome. Now we are subjected to a mid-life crisis of four older women with a dynamic that has gone stale. There is no sympathy anymore for these women when their lives falter at the slightest hurdle. They are in the minority of women who do have it all and their lives are far and away more glamorous than the likes of us, so to witness them wallow in self pity and despair for no good reason leaves a sour taste in the mouth. We don't even have the typical backdrop of New York City for most of the film. The absence of this iconic character is felt even before our intrepid seniors venture to the (unnecessary) location of Abu Dhabi for business and pleasure.Speaking of which, for a show that is famous for using sex as a major theme, there was very little to be had in this film, which added to the lack of sparkle that the series and first film offered in spades. Instead we have personal journeys and oestrogen talk that really fails to light a fire in the hearts of die-hard fans. By the time the \"action\" moves to the desert we are sucker punched with more designer looks than a head to head between Amir Kahn and Karl Lagerfeld. Unfortunately, the most glaringly obvious must-have found in this film is a life time supply of botox.Perhaps the reason why the film didn't work (or one of many) is because in the beginning, every twenty something girl to every forty plus woman watched these friends like they were our own. We related to them, we wanted to be like them but in the end - even with the fairytale \u2013 their problems turn out to be the same as us mere mortals.In spite of a script devoid of laughs and sentiment, I am sure the cash will roll in, making the third instalment a likely outcome. If that means Gucci Zimmer frames and Swarovski encrusted Rascals roaming the streets of New York (or wherever), count me out.",

This, on the other hand, lasts for 2 hours+!Thank god I paid for a Premier seat as there was lots of squirming to be done! Wheeling Liza Minnelli on to do a number at the start (since she struggled to even get the shortest of lines out) sets the tone for what's in store.....a jaw-droppingly mortifying piece of clich\u00e9d, 'chick flick' (yuk), over-the-top cinema.As well as seeing Samantha act like a drunken auntie at Christmas (pelvic thrusts, racial slurs and drunken karaoke included), you have cheap puns and unbelievable characters with even less believable motivations. To then set this charade anywhere other than NYC would be mystifying but to set it in Abu-Dhabi truly boggles the mind. Especially when it's clear the writer knows little more about the United Arab Emirates than the rest of us living in cities in the Western world.Now...I'm not daft and I know that even the most casual SATC fan is going to head along to the pictures with their girlfriends (or a very unfortunate boyfriend / husband) no matter what the reviews say. So all I can do is say this...do NOT expect anything more from this film other than 147 minutes of ridiculousness. If you're prepared, you may even have a giggle or two. If you're a huge fan of the series and are expecting more of the same (which, in my opinion, wasn't even delivered in the first film), just stay home, watch the boxset again and pretend this movie doesn't exist because - if you do put yourself through it - you'll be doing that at the end anyway.On a positive note though....at least they're weren't any bleedin' montages in this one!Now, that's fabulous!",

            "content": "Sex And The City 2 is a visually appealing movie, but in terms of character development, it is a huge disappointment. Carrie Bradshaw/Preston - it is difficult to interpret how she is written. On the outside, she looks like a happily married, rich, successful writer, with a cool gang of girl friends. But on closer inspection, she has complaints with everything going on in her life. As a wife, she is simply oblivious to Big's needs. She tells him that she doesn't like the gift he gives her for their anniversary on his face. (That is quite alright, except that she does it so blatantly.) So much being angry with Miranda for saying something to Big before the wedding, which Miranda assumes might have been the reason for Big dumping Carrie at the altar, which is not altogether true. As a writer, Carrie cannot take criticism. When she gets bad reviews for her book on marriage while in Abu Dhabi, she gets worked up and goes out to dine with her ex- boyfriend, purely because she is frustrated, and dining with him is her way of dealing with it. After the dinner, she ends up kissing him. This makes us wonder how Carrie survived in New York all these years without being able to cook, and how she can be a famous writer without being able to handle the slightest bit of negativity. The most lovable character gone awry is this film is Samantha. There are three things she does in this film \u2013 1.obsess about looking young, 2.crib about menopause and her creams being confiscated by the airport authorities at Abu Dhabi, and 3.fling herself at every man she sees. And then, there is the sex itself. While there is nothing wrong in ogling men and having a healthy sex life at fifty, it is painful to watch Samantha trying so hard to land every man she meets. Despite Miranda's repeated warnings about behaviour considered sexually inappropriate in the U.A.E., Samantha ends up making highly suggestive gestures to Rikard on a date in front of a conservative Arab couple, much to their obvious displeasure. While the sheik's behaviour on learning of Samantha's arrest for kissing/making out on the beach is quite inappropriate and so is the behaviour of the men in the souk, who start berating her when her bag gets ripped open and condoms fall out, Samantha makes it worse by thrusting her pelvis at them and shouting. Samantha seems to have no respect, whatsoever, for the Middle-Eastern etiquette, as far as sexual behaviour in public is concerned. She acts like she cannot go through even a single day without having sex. It makes ardent fans wonder whatever happened to the super-successful, in control and classy Samantha, who even ogled in style. (Remember the scene in SATC: The Movie, where she raises her hat half an inch to check out her new neighbour while sipping her drink? That was the Samantha audiences loved). Charlotte's character is quite realistic, she is shown struggling to deal with her two children, a toddler and an infant, and comes across as natural and believable. Her obsession with the nanny tends to get a little annoying at times, though. Miranda is the happy lady in the film. She is the in-control element. She quits her job when her boss who is uncomfortable with women being successful, intimidates her. She is the only girl who thoroughly enjoys the trip to Abu Dhabi. She gets some books and tries to acquaint herself with the culture of Abu Dhabi, and even makes an effort to learn a little Arabic. The scene where she helps Charlotte unwind and talk about difficulties in raising her children is quite endearing, since it not only portrays Miranda as a wonderful friend, but also shows that even mothers need to unwind at times. It is easy to relate to Miranda. But the one character who audiences cannot relate to is Mr. Big/Mr. John Preston. To begin with, he puts up with everything Carrie puts him through, and after Carrie confesses to him on an international phone call that she kissed her ex-boyfriend, his reaction seems inadequate, till the end of the movie. Moreover, he gifts her a black diamond ring when she returns from her trip. (Ironically, Carrie mentions earlier in the film that she would have been happier with a piece of jewellery, rather than the flat screen television, that Big gifted her on their anniversary.) It seems that Big has been written this way just because we need a happy ending here, which cannot be possible if Big is angry with Carrie for kissing Aidan. In conclusion, it does not make for as interesting watching as SATC: The Movie.",

This is the same basically women in their 50s going on a holiday and having fun and we are paying to this. Please do not watch this go on holiday but don't watch this movie. This movie was probably made by these old women who get what they want for example they change clothes every 2 minutes and they act like there 20 Get over Sarah Jessica Parker Needs to grow up also the girl with the blonde hair no one wants to see Nanny's getting off and having sex their skins are all wrinkly and nasty. This movie is also disrespectful to the abudhabi culture if they did this for real they would get their skinny asses kicked sex and the city girls Grow up and act your age your embarrassing your self.",

The movie made you laugh,and put forth great memories of the series. Sex and the City Movie 2 explored fantasy, intrigue, and restated each of the characters. The clothes worn by all the girls were relevant to each of the four, and were just as bizarre in some scenes as the previous movie, and the series. Everyone played their part well. I just don't understand why the reviews were so negative.I do hope there is a third movie. Maybe the series should be reunited!",

I was a fan of the series, it was cleverly written and because of it's popularity , the writers had years to develop the characters and layer experiences that created depth to each one . Well, p*ss on all of that work. This movie managed to turn these well loved characters into hideous caricatures. Prepare yourself for two long hours of cringing.I'm embarrassed for poor Kim Catrell. She proved her worth as an actress for years through the Samantha character, but here they have taken the fag-hag trope, over painted it and smeared it with gaudy cheap glitter. The bag of flamboyant one liners they gave her to dish out added a whole new cheapness to the \"cheap laugh\" category. Prepare yourself for juvenile fashion montages\u0085 in the desert? and with the heaviness of hearts I must say ..the fashion didn't make up for the absurdity. Oh sorrows!! What's the point then? The Carrie and Big storyline was such a snore, I decided to mop my floor while watching the rest - I'm not kidding. I didn't rent a SATC movie to trudge through the daily monotony of someone else's marriage- I've got my own. It's not that it wasn't a worthy subject but certainly not one to base an entire feature length movie upon.I agree with a previous reviewer's opinion that the Charlotte storyline was a bit insulting considering they gave her a full time nanny. Yes, mothering is hard, harder than we all knew before we signed up. Sometimes we snap from exhaustion no matter what our income level, but I'll tell you, peeking into that window through the eyes of someone with full time help isn't going to earn you any points with the majority of women who are paying to see this movie\u0085 because I'm willing to bet the majority are doing it without help. They should have perhaps written the nanny as having to go out of town or something- and Charlotte then has to handle mothering alone. I could have then maybe accepted her \"How do mothers do it without help?\" as more of a compliment than an eye roll. Miranda's character lacked depth but I suppose they let her exhibit the full range of emotion in the last movie so was just a prop in this one. Steve, once again, just like the first movie, lacked so much depth that they could have substituted a broomstick with a plaid shirt and a smiley face on it. And at some point between this and the first movie, the Big character had his balls removed. I will pretend this movie never happened.",

However, when the writers of \"SATC2\" were tasked with deciding on what the message of the film would be, they seem to have landed on a portrayal of the comings-and-goings of four corpses that can't seem to find the politeness of being actually deceased.\"Production quality\" is a term that should be forbidden when discussing this movie, as \"quality\" suggests the existence of any discernable effort to making the piece enjoyable in any way. Unfortunately, it seems as though the lighting crew decided that a better use for the burning cigarettes used to light the first act were better-utilized by being jammed into their own eyeballs. At least, this would save them from having to witness the betrayal of cinema unfolding before them.Character development is...In summation, the viewing of this picture could be considered as a torture method for the most radical of global terrorists, were it not for requirements for humane methods of the Geneva convention.

            "content": "I would like to make it clear that i am one of the biggest fans of this show since it began, i waited a day in Leicester square to see the premiere and i have never stopped loving it until now. i have been urged to write this review after seeing a few \"so called\" fans saying they enjoyed this film.The film started really good the marriage between Anthony and Stamford was such a shock but a good shock. i expected to see how this marriage would go.but none of that happened.they got married then nothing. smith comes back and you think maybe he could get back with Samantha. he never shows his face again. I don't even remember seeing Steve or harry in the film.i felt that the film began with a few interesting stories like Charlotte's nanny which could have developed. but no you see her breast twice and then 2 hours later it just turns out shes a lesbian.The main problem was that if they had stayed in new york which is the \"city\" of sex and the \"city\", then maybe the film would have been good but instead the majority of the film is an Abu Dhabi. and the whole time I'm just waiting for this holiday to finish so they get back to the story.except they come back 10 minutes before the end of the film.So what happened to Aidan, they kiss then thats the end of him!! so many little stories were started but never completed!! And who have these girls turned into! Samantha get fired from her job thing for breaking the Abu Dhabi kissing law, i always thought she was professional. they are all racist talking about the face scarfs and Samantha giving the finger!.Carrie stupidly causes the problems for her marriage when shes the one always trying to make things perfect! and is mean to Charlotte in the elevator for no reason. it just feels like nothing happened they began a film then filmed the whole core of the film with Abu Dhabi.. they could have developed the idea of Miranda having problems with her boss, but instead she just quits in the first 5 minutes. and they don't even show that scene, just Miranda telling Steve about it! It did have some funny bits.but what good are a few jokes at a funeral. and the camel toe just isn't that funny compared to Charlotte shitting her pants!! I hope that a 3rd film is made that makes this all better!!",

Carrie is a whiny, unsatisfied, typical Jewish princess when her husband gets a TV for their anniversary and she tells him she would rather have jewelry. She is looking old and stupid in the fashions. The black hat she wore to the wedding made her look like Cruella from 101 Dalmatians. And the blue hat on the plane made her look like a revolving appetizer plate from a Mexican Restaurant. Samantha is just disgusting. She needed to be douched with Lysol years ago but now she is just an old \"whore\". Miranda and Steve were great and Charlotte, burdened with two kids, had the best and only good line in the film. When she thought her husband may take off with the Nanny, she thought, \"Oh no, I can't loose the Nanny.\" There was a very thin story line filled with ridiculous situations that were so over the top suspension of disbelief was impossible. It was pitiful and the old ABC after school playhouse movies were written and executed better. It reminded me of the plot-less series called the Monkees back in the 60's. Mindless, gratuitous, convoluted,idiocy.It was just on TV. If I paid money to watch it I would demand a refund. Terrible movie. Just terrible. Boring. Ridiculous.

Basically, they just all run away from their problems and act stupid in a foreign country. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to get away from New York?! The whole point was that they were set in \"the city.\" I didn't care to see Abu Dhabi -- that was totally pointless. There are a few real problems that are touched on, but mostly the four of them are just running around acting dumb. And the wedding at the beginning as well as the karaoke scene later on are overdone and painful to watch.Samantha used to be funny, but here she's just a total whore (worse than the series if you can believe that) and embarrasses herself all through the Middle East. Her only serious issue is that she's aging -- they could have made some interesting dialogue about that, but it's all stupid jokes about hormones. Carrie's problem involving seeing her ex could have led to really interesting dialogue. Miranda and Charlotte's issues also COULD have led to interesting dialogue. But that's all left out. Where is the introspection that made the series so fascinating? Leave out all the Abu Dhabi crap and get back to the women dealing with their problems there in the city. They used to have real character. This leaves out all of those moments of grappling with real dilemmas that made the series so fascinating. Stupid jokes, dumb outfits and people acting like whores used to be minor comedic extras in a series that was introspective and about adults dealing smartly with problems (divorce, infertility, breakups, extramarital affairs) in their fast-paced New York lives. It used to be so fascinating to watch. I hope to forget this awful ending.",

Guys steer clear and if you don't like SATC don't watch. It's just good seeing the girls reunite on screen again. The film is about the Sex and the City girls, well duh; Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha (Kim Cattrall) and Charlotte (Kristin Davies) coming together again and discussing their relationship and family problems. To get away from all their troubles they go on a girlie holiday to Abu Dhabi where Samantha struggles to stick to the strict no sex laws, Carrie bumps into an ex, Miranda enjoys learning about the culture and Charlotte gets some well needed away time from the demands of motherhood. It's really like a longer and more adventurous SATC episode; as a fan I was satisfied. SATC always deal with problems that are real and like a lot of Hollywood films doesn't portray the perfect relationships and marriages and that they need working at. SATC is a lof of fun and something to watch with your mum and your girl pals. I found the film entertaining and sincere and it's nice to catch up with the SATC girls and see where they are after the series finished. I hope they make a third film. This film isn't for everyone, but its something SATC fans will appreciate only.\r\n\r\nGrade: A-",

This was all relatable stuff, but then Samantha gets an all expense paid trip (through Smith) and they end up in UAE. Where every scene requires another outrageous costume change, they stay in adjoining 22,000 dollar a night suites, personal butlers, etc. and its all just too, too much. And jeez the stereotyping and offensive behaviour towards middle eastern culture and travel outside America in general. It was just painful to watch. I suppose this is meant to be watched as escapism or fantasy, but still. All in -a nothing movie that had me cringing more than laughing.

I'm not sure that I would have tolerated this movie if I had not followed the tv series. It does not measure up in wit or substance, and seems far more concerned with product placement and flashing its ridiculously large budget around than actually delivering a quality movie. Carrie, whose likability had been questionable in the series, is incredibly frustrating, though still an improvement on the first movie. Aidan makes a bizarre appearance, despite the film being set on the other side of the world, whether to add some adulterous conflict or to simply make Carrie's marriage to Big even less satisfying it is unclear. The film flirts with racism throughout, crossing over completely at the end with the insulting display of Islamic women drawing their garments to reveal haute couture. Correct me if I am wrong, but I am sure there aren't many Muslim women smuggling Prada underneath their hijabs around Abu Dhabi. The only redeeming factor was that the film did not shy away from the fact that the ladies have aged: Samantha hits menopause head on, something that the folks responsible for airbrushing the promotional posters into oblivion apparently missed. I don't think this movie should be discounted completely, it just would have been so much more pleasant cut down to one of the 25 minute segments that the writers once excelled at.",

Like I've mentioned in a few other reviews of films I despise, this is one those cases where I wish I could give zero stars, but the rating system won't let me, so I have to award this cinematic abortion a half-star, even though that is being far too generous. Not since Gigli have I witnessed a comedy so utterly horrific and insanely unfunny, and while this film isn't quite as bad, it's not very far behind. This film takes everything that made the first film suck horribly and accenuates all those problems to a near-apocalyptic level of badness. This film was so awful, it felt like it raped and crushed my soul right from the get-go because everything about this film is beyond horrible. The storyline is even shittier than before, the acting is annoying and dull once again, the humor is even worse, nothing happens in this film like the first film, the characters are even bigger bitches than before, it's chock-full of stereotypes about women and gay people that are utterly offensive and horrifying, and it's even more boring despite being only a little bit longer. Now, I know there might be women who think that this film is all about women empowerment, but this film is a total insult to women because unless you prefer the depiction of women to be selfish, fashion-obsessed, air-headed whores who talk about nothing interesting whatsoever, then this is not empowerment. If you want to see a good film about women empowerement that features female friends going on a trip together, then I suggest you watch Thelma & Louise, which is a wonderful film that has everything the film doesn't have like a good story, characters you grow to care about, actual humor, genuine heartfelt moments, and it's also a film guys can get into as well.

In a time of a continuing economic collapse, inequality and racial controversies, Sex and the City 2 is the completely wrong movie at the wrong time. Its water-thin narrative about four female travesties traveling to Abu Dhabi to basically do nothing but eat exotic food and spend money on worthless trash celebrates consumerism while creating abhorrent depictions of motherhood, marriages and womanhood in general. These women shriek, complain, consume, shriek, complain, shriek, complain some more, consume and consume and complain... WHILE EVERYTHING IS FINE. They have mountains of money, fancy clothes, extravagant apartments full of trendy furniture, giant televisions, irritating children, and loving husbands, but who must be a little empty-headed since one of them (who has to be an arms dealer or at least a crooked fundraiser for important politicians) buys a TV the size of a football field for an anniversary gift, while the wife had hoped some more jewelry. Oh, but she learns not to care about that little vexation, since in the magical consumption land of Abu Dhabi she has a spiritual awakening as she learns that everyone really can't afford that jewelry, because they just don't make enough money. This is two and a half hours of absolute torture. The only glimpse of light is the hope that this is meant to be just a really bad satire. But even if so, Sex and the City 2 is still cinematic consumption porn completely disconnected from real societal issuses, such as gender roles, motherhood and inequality, that it hopes to touch upon even slightly. Instead it wants its audience to sympathize with and relate to the most contemptible bunch of hysterical and materialistic imbeciles, and realize that money actually doesn't define everything, as long as you have an extravagant apartment, a TV the size of a football field, fancy clothes, jewelry, and a loving, if sometimes lazy, husband. This is a film that will make you both mentally and physically sick. It is a film to be burned at stake and buried deep into the ground, so its evil forces can never rise again.",

This does not mean I don't advocate grabbing a cosmo and revisiting the girls when you're feeling down. It simply means that in stead of putting the extra effort in and making it good, MP King decided to rather just sit back and ride the wave, opting to not really even try. A weak script, lacking a central plot and any real drama, shallow and with acting that could only come from lazy directing. It's also rather loose, and loses itself most of the time. There are, however, isolated moments where you'll flashback in your head and relish in the splendour of a typical Mirandism or Samanthaism, and the wedding scene featuring Liza Minnelli is divine to say the least - reason alone to watch the film! Sadly, it's downhill from there. MPK also unfortunately tries to tie in a recession-focused plot - an idea that seems more like a last minute attempt to make the film appealing on a broader scale than a well-though through plot. Too many stories, too many loose ends, too little substance and no real weight. I hate to say it, but the naysayers were right.",

Don't get me wrong, the characters, the issues and all the glaring social injustices in the plot still bothered me, but the movie was entertaining. But this piece of crap, wow. What an absolute train wreck. I was cringing so much through the first hour that I just couldn't watch anymore.

While he was outraged by the class, gender and race politics of Sex and the City 2 I simply found it to be a tired retread of material that this franchise has already 'explored' in the show and in the first film, in short it is boring. There's nothing new other than the setting, only this time the four leads are playing caricatures of their character, particularly Kim Catrall as Samantha. There is one scene towards the end in which she announces to the proverbial Arab world that she, simply put, 'has sex' whilst flailing her arms in the air grasping condoms. For me its a scene that sums up just how tired this franchise has become and really how lazy it is. What other conclusion could one reach when the great denouement is that the repressed women of Abu Dhabi are in fact as driven by consumerism as our four protagonists. Much like the first film this is way too long but really it's just tremendously insignificant.",

What I did like is that I was drawn into the love and friendship that the women had for each other.  I could feel it and flow with it and be in it.  One thing I would ask Sara is why wasn't anything done with her hands?  Her hands really tell her age so that distracted me somewhat.  But what do I know?

I never saw the first movie, but based on what I've seen from the show and this movie, I'm sure I can fill in the gaps.  Anyway, I don't really even want to talk too much about this pile of trash, but if you want to see spoiled bitches who complain for TWO AND A HALF HOURS (seriously, they couldn't make a movie like this in 90 minutes?)  then by all means go ahead and check it out.\n\nThe worst part about this movie is how it is marketed towards women to be \"empowering\" and inspirational, but really any woman between the ages of 18-25 who wants to live like these women is setting them up for a life of disappointment and misery because no man will give a woman a ring after she bitches him out and attempts to cheat on him.",

It's been two years and just as the friends are getting a little too settled into marriage and motherhood, they are whisked away to one of the most exotic places on earth for a sun-drenched adventure. Get ready for the ultimate weekend away with the girls. So I've seen Sex and the City: The Movie and I thought it was below average (4/10) but does the second one improve from the first movie's flaws? No, it doesn't! If anything, it's added more flaws. The story was very basic and not in a good way, it was boring and not interesting in the slightest. The girls basically moaned about their lives so Samantha manages to bag the women a holiday to Abu Dhabi where they moaned even more about their lives (except for a couple of scenes). The characters were poorly written this time round as all of them did nothing but nag, moan and bitch about everything in their lives. If they weren't bitching to their families, the women would get together over lunch and have a good bitch about themselves.\r\n\r\nThe acting was so-so, there were a couple of okay moments when the actresses didn't do a bad job but there were a lot of moments when it was bad. The direction is rubbish, the writing is a joke and the script isn't fun at all. Sex and the City 2 tries to be something it's not: Fun, sexy and smart. The worst thing about the movie is, yet again, the runtime. Two and a half hours is simply too long for this movie and the plot was very thin. I could have very easily cut sixty minutes out of the movie and you wouldn't miss anything. The only reason why I saw this was because I saw the first and I very stupidly thought that it could improve, but it didn't. Another thing that bugged me was the stuff they were wearing. This movie is supposed to be all about glamorous fashion and things but half the stuff they were wearing looked horrible, I couldn't see any woman with a sane mind wearing half the stuff they displayed in the movie.\r\n\r\nThe characters were yet again stereotypical but this time, it was more blatant and in-your-face.  The acting wasn't very good at all, they did a better job in the first movie. The 'funny' scenes aren't funny at all, except for the parts with Erin the Irish Nanny who made Samantha jealous. Overall, one of the worst movies this year and possibly one of the worst chick flicks I have ever seen and in even worse news, if the rumours are true, it's possible that it could be a trilogy! God help the world of cinema! There were a couple of funny scenes but apart from that, Sex and the City 2 has no sparkle and it has to be one of the worst movies of 2010. It didn't improve from its flaws, it just made more. I still can't see why women love this...",

I can tell that as sex goes there is very little here except for the antics of the very forward Samantha, and there aren\u00e2(TM)t that many of those either. The other three girls are a bit quiet because they are married, so in this film we can see their struggles with work, fidelity and offspring; sex becomes something barely sketched in the background.\nThe film starts a bit slow but picks up once they are invited to Abu Dhabi. I confess that I didn\u00e2(TM)t even pay that much attention to the dialogues nor to the story, I was far too busy looking at the luxury of the locations and to the exquisite wardrobe of these ladies, the shoes, the bags, the jewels, the designer outfits... The film seems like a perfect excuse to show us the sophisticated looks of the main characters, like if it was a cat walk.

As a fan of Sex & the City, the television series, it was difficult for me at first to remove myself from that bind, of having the expectation that punch lines, life lessons, and themes were going to be packed neatly in a 40 minute segment. However, the script, for the most part, achieves the goals for this full-length movie format. The characters are who we expect them to be, we are taken on an adventure that's fun, and reflective. My only complaints, though, is that elements in the screenplay could have definitely been fine tuned. That Carrie-voiceover that fans of the TV series are so accustomed to hearing, where she neatly packages her lessons into a few words, doesn't function quite right in the movie. Also, the relationship the characters have with each other, what impact they make on each other, and how they urk/comfort each other and under what circumstances, could have been tighter. With that said, though, this movie is a fun adventure with no shortage of dramatic moments that encourage viewers to see that no matter how far away we look, how hard we look, sometimes, what we needed was right in front of us all along. Further, this movie (not unlike the television show), really pushed the envelope! I mean, it pushes the boundaries by including a gay wedding, signifying the transformation of the meaning of weddings and commitment in our modern society, and unlike most, no, ALL romantic comedies, it really makes a powerful commentary on modern marriage--the juggling the hustle and bustle of work, friends, and lovers.",

Watchers are all different, some may get shocked into too much sexual content, but that's the reason why there are four different unique characters in this whole story. One can find himself/herself in each situation. Learn from it instead of thrashing it. Anyways, Samantha never fails me.

But they are kind of grotesque and cartoonish here.  Especially Carrie Bradshaw.  I am used to ROOTING for Carrie... not wishing her ill will.  Samantha smears a lot of hummus on her face and porks a lot, as usual, and Miranda remains as affable as ever.  But what they've done to Charlotte is has to be (by now, and far and away) considered a sin.  In the first movie, Charlotte hardly-enjoyed a severe case of the shits.  In this one, they gave her a camel toe.  Nobody involved seems to really care much about these characters any more.  Burkas are even slapped upon them.  Michael Patrick King is almost like the mad surgeon in \"The Human Centipede: First Sequence\" to his once-beloved New York babes.  He cruelly sews them ass-to-mouth, ridding them of their once-appealing humanity.  They are now 4 annoying Betty Whites with orange-y spray tans.  Strutting obnoxiously in the Arab Emirates.\r\n\r\nWith all this money at stake, HBO coulda made a slammin' \"Sopranos\" epic.  Oh, well.

Before they leave for Abu Dhabi, all the \"girls\" have interesting problems:  Charlotte is frustrated with motherhood; Miranda has a stressful job and a sexist boss (Ron White!); Samantha is waging a futile battle against menopause, with a variety of pills and potions; Carrie is afraid Big just wants to lie on the couch, order in, watch tv, and never go out again.

None of these plot lines were interesting nor expanded on the major players' lives.  There was no growth and it seems that the sole purpose of the movie was to remind us of how fabulous these four women are.  The problem is that we already know they are fabulous and don't need that fact rammed down our throats.  \r\n\r\nBut the major insult was that these characters came across as stupid which is something they never were portrayed as in the past.  They may have done stupid things from time to time but never did we the audience think them frivolous.  For example, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) bakes cupcakes with two small daughters wearing a Valentino skirt and heels? Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) can't handle her chauvinistic male boss?  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) blows a very lucrative international PR deal?  Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has trouble being faithful to Mr. Big (Chris Noth)?  No.  No.  No.  And no.  None of these plots lines are believable given the context into which these characters have previously been placed.\r\n\r\nShame on the writers for doing such a disservice to loyal fans and to the beloved characters!  We can only hope that if the producers deign to do a SATC3 they think long and hard about returning the franchise to its rightful place of intelligent comedy.",

Carrie Bradshaw is in one of her spoiled, self-absorbed moods. Of course, she gets her way in the end. Did she really learn a lesson?  Miranda barely has a storyline and Charlotte's was the most identifiable for most women and it seems quickly shown and quickly resolved. Samantha, whom I love, was obnoxious. I found myself a little offended that they would have her character in a country where she is old enough and mature enough to respect their cultures and she blatantly defies it. That may have been meant for comedic effect but it wasn't. It was really in bad taste. They should have kept the girls in the City. That would have saved this film.",

As an added incentive, he pays for her and the gal pals to go visit for a week. Things get complicated when both old and new faces show up, and Samantha predictably sleeps with every guy at the resort.\r\nThis film was a nightmare to watch, and I feel pity for everyone who suffered with me.

MPK writes and directs (for SATC3, let's allow him to direct only) a mostly flashy, substanceless, meaningless and hence, no care for what happens at all to Carrie and the gals. Whoever said opulence has to be superficial ONLY is wrong. There could be an understanding of the importance of glamour in this post (?) recession world and elevate these characters to a new place without sacrificing their inner core. This film does neither. Other than the ridiculous costumes and 'what will they do next' curiosity, what kept me going was my anger at the offensive lack of story (most scenes are stretched out 'set pieces' meant to entertain at the lowest level), and trying to figure out why this film was made other than a guaranteed paycheck. I'm shocked that Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall would agree to this script. Except for a few good lines, and an ending that picked up 'a bit' (if not enough) of steam, SATC2 makes the girls look like one of the Housewives on Bravo with very little impulse control. It's as if they've learned nothing in 10 years and have regressed to childlike behavior...and it's not funny. This may be the death nail in the series unless I take a stab at the threequel.",

I found this to be a horribly stupid unrealistic idea, oh sure the two token gay guys get married even though they cant stand eachother. How convenient.\nCarrie (whom ive always loathed) is more unrealisticly self obsessed than ever, she finally married the man of her dreams and he is a wonderful husband to her, but she obviously hates being married and acts as if the whole thing was a horrible mistake. I honestly thought they would have a baby and be happy but they pride themselves in chosing to never start a family, which i understand because someone as self obsessed as Carrie could never care for a baby.\nCharolette's dreams of getting married and having babies is crushed when motherhood becomes too hard for her as her parenting skills deteriorate and her focus is 100% on the nannies boobs and her husbands interest in a woman who isnt crying in the closet hiding from her children all day. \nMiranda finally decides that she likes her son enough to acknowlege he exists and quits her job to take responsibility for her kid. (SNORE) Samantha (now officially an elderly spinster) is more sexualy reckless than ever, and here i was hoping she would find and marry Mr.Right and grow up like the rest of us. \ni honestly think this movie is insulting and outrageously offensive to wealthy middle aged new york women. I mean the series made women look bad from the start but this movie is the climactic trainwreck of idiotic rich women with no real problems. \nThe climax of the movie being Aiden kissing Carrie (which never would have happened in the series after he got married and had kids) and Big's reaction to Carries childish shameful behavior is buying her a huge amazing diamond ring. But of coarse he was already in trouble with Carrie for buying her a flat screen for the bed room, which makes sense if you abandon all thought and logic.\nThis movie takes the cake for cinematic disasters, and from now on will be the refference for disappointing women everywhere, sorry men with small penises, your role has been stolen.",

It features four shrieking, over privileged banshees who whine and complain that they have such horrific inconveniences as two apartments, a full time nanny or a high paying career job. And I'm meant to feel sorry for these people? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps, though, the awful indulgences mean that they will learn to find solace in little things? Oh no. Wrong again. The Sex and the City women get solace from the following things: first class flying, luxury cars, butler service, sex with strangers and shoe shopping. And that's it.\n\nThe message of Sex and the City 2, therefore, is that to be a woman is to acquire enough status to buy things or people. And if you cannot buy things or people; you must find what peace you can in watching other women doing the same thing to remove yourself from the destitute life you are currently living. Sounds pretty gross, right? Yes, that\u0092s right. Sex and the City 2 is a hate crime. It\u0092s a crime against you. If you have the misfortune to watch it; please report it to the police.",

            "content": "the reason i chose to see sex and the city 2 was because i felt like bitching about chic flicks...my primary target is \"eat, prayer and love\" but the dvd-rental is more expensive because it's just released! yeah, there's an option of internet free-download but what's more miserable than watching a movie in your computer is to watch a bad movie in your computer (when the movie is good, it's easier to endure sitting in front of a computer for it)...get the logics? so the more practical and economic decision is to rent sex and the city 2 in a somehow cheaper price then watch it in your living room and get numb. haha.\r\n\r\nand, it also pleases me that  there's one person in my friend-list \"want to see it.\" (ps) i do have a sense of cinephile morality that don't bitch a movie before you watch it even when it's obviously bad. if you wanna bitch about something, name your reason articulately (i definitely try my best).  perhaps it's just the way i am, i prefer not to call you an asshole crudely, but when i do, i name all the reasons why you're an asshole without using the word asshole.\r\n\r\ni'm no agist, but i do expect maturity from people (even from myself, but i try to manage it with struggles, for sure, just like everyone!) after a certain age, but the controversy here is: what's the right age for a person to be sophisticated? for the \"girls\" in sex and the city 2, 60?! 70?! maybe the right age for them is when botox stops working on their faces. (do i sound mean?) quite often, i feel they're living in disneyland, but come on, they're all over 40! everything about this movie is absolutely artificial and far from common senses. i did mention quite often about the idea of camp, a celebration of artifice, such as my praise over knight and day...but there's a sense of sincerity in camp, yeah, a naive self-love devoid of pretentiousness. (so it's not everything bad and fake is camp)..but sex and the city IS pretentious, encapsulated within the so called avant-garde third-wave feminism, and it has great deal to do with pop-culture ideologies in women, or let's be more specific, upper-middle class white women who have nothing to do but whine about life......and their vaginas!\r\n\r\ni'd like to focus on three specific details (if you really care about synopsis, check imdb). i point them out because i consider them crucial for character-portrayals, this movie has involved a trip for these four \"fabulous\" women in \"new middle-east\" (ali abu). FIRSTLY, they emphasize in details on all the materialistic products they carry in their luggages, for example, samantha mentions about the books she carries: suzanne somers' \"breakthrough to wellness\" (serious reading to her), and she mentions something for relaxation: THE US MAGZINE. then four of them scream in hysteria. and i was thinking, what, you're over 40, and you're in a sort of exquisite society which tends to value taste (they emphasize that) and class..and the entertainment for your mind is THE US MAGZINE. are you just 16? what's so different between your mind and the mind of a high-school teenager with raging hermones? except the later doesn't need botox to look young. and, one of them is a supposedly well-reputed columnist. another one of them is allegedly a harvard-graduate. isn't it a bit too un-classy? kinda un-believable, isn't it?\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, in this trip, samantha claims to her girlfriends that it's free due to her association with some tycoon in arabian world, and she keeps saying dubai is history and abu dahbi is the new fabulous middle-east. anyway, this movie poses a counterfeit attitude about their liberal welcome to the arabian exotica but somehow it keeps its superficial bombardments on the arabian culture, stereotyped racist remarks about the veiling obligation in arabian women and how sexually uptight those arabian men are. i'm not really familar with the arabian world and i might also be infected with that bias that arabian men are terrible sexists due to media presentation, but there's one part in this movie that is really hypocritical: samantha annoys the crowd of arabian men for showing off her cleaverage, then four of them escape into a secret room full of arabian housewives who actively offer helps for these four \"fabulous\" new-yorkers, then they take off their conventional arabian costumes and reveal themselves in the dresses from the latest catalogues of louis vutton, dior and gucci, and they're holding a book-party on the same god-damned book samantha mentions earlier: suzanna somer's \"breakthru: eight stages to wellness\"...it's like announcing that you third-world arabian women, under your conventional appearance, you all wanna emulate us by buying off those commodities of luxuries, we, rich american women, feel complacent to be copied and emulated while we're taking a plane to get away from your land of gender-inequalities. the only solace left for you is the commodities from the latest catagues of louis vutton, channel..you shall continue to contribute your money to our corporations even your life still stinks as hell. but we don't care as long as you continue to vent your discontentment through consummerism!\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY, the character of mr. BIG is depicted as a partially conventional man who favors old black-and-white movies, and the story keeps emphasizing his love of nostalgia. his favorite thing in the world is to watch clark gable and claudette colbert's \"it happened one night\" in bed and he prefers to stay home on his couch eating and relaxing with those nostalgic movies. i wonder the screenwriter's choice of describing mr. big as fan of nostalgia is because women all secrely wish their men to be cultured, conventional and sophisticated (nostalgia is a reference of all those qualities.) in the mean time, woman behaves like a spoilt 40-something fashion-princess who disregards her man's frustration over the fall of stock-market, insists on her man's companionship after one laborious day. carrie even tries to pay homage to claudette colbert by showing off her leg in arabian street for taxi. the movie even features one scene of mr. big talking to penelop cruz, who is a hot spanish bank-manager in the movie, and she discusses their shared concern for the stock market in the cocktail party while carrie remains in her girl-friend circle. and i thought he's going to cheat with penelope but i almost wish it to happen..think about it, if you were a rich not-bad-looking man who's worth billions, what kind of wife you would want? you would want a wife who shares some concerns of your work-labors, instead of picking on your faults all the time, showing her non-appreciation for your interests in nostalgia and expecting to be liberated like a signle woman while you generously provide every possible luxurious item for her? if i were him, i would think: why not just court and marry peneloppe cruz?! that's common sense. \r\n\r\ngee, i'm tired of complaining about it..my point is: i could understand why some men have prejudices about chick flicks, especially sex and the city, because those women just won't step out of their enclosed circle of life! so narcissistically self-absorbed as if the world only whirls around her, and worse of all, chick flicks now degenerate into a genre for narcissistic females who think the meaning of life is the expensive clothes you wear, the travelling catalogues (third-world nations are all on the map for such consumption of exotica) and the so-called \"sparkle\" with their significant the other. and what the \"sparkle\" is made of? MONEY! everything is about money. yes, money is important in this world. but please have the decency to bare it all instead of granting it a beautified name of love! \r\n\r\nsometimes, i have an indignant sentiment why women are still so narrow-minded and short-sighted after so many decades of revolutions? i mean, when i watch movies like sex and the city 2. (of course, not all women are like that, i'm not. but the movie is popular, supposedly its popularity reflects something in its patroning audience) in conclusion, the only achievement feminism revolutions have accomplished is that women wear less clothes, spend more money, and certainly much much more fuckable than they used to be. (profanity intended for my anguish)...come to think about it, men should be grateful to movies like sex and the city, it opens millions of gates for you fellows to have gratuitous sex! (conspiracy from men)\r\n\r\n(as a matter of fact, sex and the city 2 is DIRECTED BY A MAN indeed. ha)",

But are we still getting carried away?\r\n\r\nThe first Sex and the City film showed us how the girls had moved on and settled down with their husbands and children. The second film picks up two years later and the former single ladies are even more settled in their married lives. The story revolves around Carrie and Big who are encountering a two-year itch in their marriage, Charlotte who is struggling with two children and a braless nanny, Miranda who comes to a halt in her career and Samantha who is reluctantly reaching menopause. The girls escape to Abu Dhabi for a week and we don't get to see much of New York City which has had a very central part in the series in the past.\r\n\r\nIt's a rather thin plot compared to the first film, but it thickens somewhat when Carrie's ex-boyfriend Aiden shows up in Abu Dhabi and stirs it up. Samantha provides most of the laughter as the only single one left in the group and the one who is still mostly like the character she was in the series; adventurous, brutally honest and delightfully promiscuous.\r\n\r\nThere's not much of a storyline this time around and the characters are starting to feel a little bit like a parody of the series. However if you're a SATC fan you will most likely enjoy the film as it will satisfy your curiosity and you will love the \"fabulous\" fashion - but if you're not you're likely to get bored half-way through and might consider sitting this one out.",

            "content": "It's easy for film fans to bash Sex and the City 2 for its obvious faults. This second big-screen outing for Carrie and co. played up the TV show's weaknesses and all but ignored its many strengths, placing the characters in increasingly more idiotic scenarios and leaving behind the great city that for more than a decade has been the beating heart of the show. However no matter how badly they missed the mark, for a die hard fan, bashing this movie is a painful task.\r\n\r\nEveryone has those TV shows and movies that hold a special place in their hearts. Well for me HBO's Sex and the City has been a glittering, stiletto-shaped crutch since I was thirteen years old. As a gay teenager there was no one in the world I wanted to be more than Carrie Bradshaw, her internal monologues and eventful sex-life have taught me more about relationships than any number of sex-ed classes ever could, and let me tell you those six fabulous seasons have set in me good stead. Therefore when it was announced the fab-four would be reuniting for a movie I was naturally excited. The first film was a clear step down from the TV show but my sparkly crutch was back so I didn't care. However Sex and the City 2 is the first really disappointing blip on what has been twelve years of Manolo-loving greatness.\r\n\r\nThe problems are myriad. The writing is incredibly poor, glossing over any real character-driven issues in favour of eye-rolling one-liners and a ridiculous subplot revolving around a trip to Abu Dhabi. This storyline is so misguided it beggars belief that it was ever approved; there's a reason it's called Sex and the CITY! Add to this the ongoing culture clash between Samantha's sexually liberated Western woman and the strict Muslim rules of the Middle East and the movie is pretty much dead and buried. Then you factor in the preposterous runtime and realise things somehow just got worse.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the characters, who were once carefully written pioneers of female independence and sexual freedom, are now little more than caricatures of their former selves. Furthermore the dumbing down of these women appears to have translated to the actresses who do little to rescue their characters from the appalling writing. Even bringing back beloved characters like Aiden, and featuring a host of celebrity cameos including Penelope Cruz and Liza Minelli, does little to distract from Michael Patrick King's terrible screenplay.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, there are some areas where the film lives up to its reputation. Most notably the costumes and clothing feature the best contemporary styling I've ever seen in a movie. The legendary Patricia Field has done an incredible job of dressing these women of a certain age in a way that reflects their character and cutting edge style perfectly. Also it should be noted that there are glimpses, albeit brief ones, of the celebration of friendship that made the show what it is, and it's during these moments that the film does work.\r\n\r\nDespite what most critics and moviegoers will tell you (many of whom had clearly made up their minds before they even saw the film), there is still enough here for some fans to enjoy. It isn't a patch on the TV show, and is undoubtedly a disappointing way to continue the franchise, but if you love Carrie and her girls as much as I do, you'll take what you can get.",

This OBVIOUSLY wasn't made for me, but JESUS CHRIST.  The plot is so thinly veiled...  you know what, I'm not going to even pretend that there's a plot; it's just these four intolerable women, each dealing with their own midlife crisis, going on vacation in Abu Dhabi and deciding that indulgence is the solution to all their problems.  This is why countries hate America, and I honestly can't blame them.  It's offensive at every turn, and it shamelessly flaunts materialistic ideals with pride like it's a good thing.  It sometimes presents itself in such a poor light that my eyes widened and my jaw dropped, an automatic reaction to my brain trying to eat itself.  Maybe if you've spent six seasons and a previous movie with these ladies, you'd find their comedy and mannerisms endearing, but I didn't find it funny in the slightest.  It didn't make me laugh at all, it just me roll my eyes so much, I'm surprised I didn't give myself a nosebleed.  And putting up with that for two and a half hours, it's a goddamn endurance test that I feel somewhat accomplished that I made it through.  I hate the horrible sense of humor, I hate all four of these annoying harpies, but what I despise the most is what this movie stands for.  Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, fuck this movie.",

Yes, even more so.\n\nClueless, lazy writing dominates the movie. For instance, a commonly cited example is Charlotte's mothering \"dilemma\". Charlotte is a wealthy mother who does not have to work for a living. Fortunate enough to have time home, she still requires the help of a full-time nanny, who whisks her children out of the room at any moment the children become too active. \n\nOver a pity party drinking session, Charlotte whines to Miranda how difficult it is to be a mother. She laments: how do \"the others\" do it without help? Miranda, states blankly, \"I have no idea.\" She then lifts her large cocktail and toasts, \"to them.\" A truly insulting moment to any one, any woman, armed with dignity and a brain. Perhaps King read somewhere that mothering can be tough. \n\nSATC2 is nonsensical and inconsistent. In Abu Dhabi, Miranda scolds Samantha for dressing too revealing at the hotel, although Carrie goes unnoticed sitting next to Miranda in a similar, sleeveless outfit. The script probably looked better on paper. Or, is the audience considered that stupid by Michael Patrick King?\n\nLater, Samantha makes herself readily available on a date. The series-Samantha would have probably reminded herself that she was on a high profile business trip and to take it upstairs. This SATC2 Samantha fellates a hookah for all to see, much to the dismay of the locals. A savvy business woman, series-Samantha would have composed herself with even a little integrity.

It's a book club comprised of materialistic Islamic fashionistas who end up validating the ill-mannered behavior displayed by these privileged New York socialites, when the middle east-end girls step out of their traditional \"hijab\" attire to reveal the \"haute couture\" fashions beneath like naughty Catholic schoolgirls. Now Carrie(Sarah Jessica Parker) and her gal pals become the role models that they proclaim themselves to be. At a karaoke club, the ugly Americans have the effontery to sing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem \"I Am Woman\", both for themselves as a pointed animadversion of this hyper-patriarchal society, and the local women whom the westerners presume are in need of some consciousness-raising and enlightenment, without understanding that the mobilization of feminist-minded Muslim women may have deadly reprecussions from their oppressors. Samantha(Kim Cattrall), the ugliest American of them all, not only offends the Abu Dhabi men, but the women, as well. In a very public arena, Samantha's demonstrative canoodling with her latest conquest, proves to be an affront to the female bystanders' inherent modesty, which is derived from a sheltered upbringing that deemed such forwardness as justification for an \"honor killing\". To some Muslim females, the headscarf and veil are personal choices. In Diane Crespo and Stefan Schaefer's \"Arranged\", the principal of a Brooklyn middle school denigrates a young Muslim schoolteacher's traditional apparel choices, and offers her shopping money for designer clothes. It never occurs to the culturally biased educator, or \"Sex and the City 2\", that some Muslim women, like American girls who exploit themselves sexually on their own terms, adopt the \"hijab\" without the stigmatizing effect of Koran-sanctioned female subjugation, in which both forms of self-debasement are post-feminist, but nevertheless, subversive acts of emancipation.",

It lacks carelessness and ease, not to mention it crosses over to ridiculousness one too many times. It doesn't have the wit and the smarts the original series had, and you can't find anything in common with Carrie - once always broke because of her shoe addiction, now living in luxury. Before, she couldn't afford to have her apartment renovated, now she's owning two and flying out to Middle East without a blink of an eye. I'm giving it 10, because when you peel all that off - the bad script, the over-produced schemes and the horrible product-placement - you kind of get what the producers wanted to do.

Carrie has ALWAYS been cheesy and could be whiny too when it came to Big. Samantha, is totally Sam, complaining about her age and focusing on how to keep herself young. Charlotte, really?

Very bold move taking the movie out of NYC... Stanford and Anthony's wedding was in CT (which is understandable, with their union not currently being possible in New York) and then the girls take off on their trip. I definitely would have liked to see more of the City featured in the film. I would have loved to see more Aidan, more Smith, and more Stanford & Anthony post-ridiculous wedding (I was not a fan of the Liza Minelli performance). The scene with Miranda and Charlotte bonding over mommyhood was the best scene of the movie by far. I could have done without the many braless nanny scenes (seeing those things bouncing around once was enough), the karaoke scene, and Carrie had way too many ridiculous puns and whiny moments. Charlotte was also pretty annoying... since when does this confident woman not trust her loving husband?? Samantha and Miranda were the best characters in the flick by far. Kim Catrall is absolutely hilarious, and I was happy to see Cynthia Nixon having a good time being Miranda again. I am hoping for a third installment where they focus on the ladies living their lives in NYC. We want that cozy feel of the series and the first movie that we know and love!",

I pretty much watched it to see something exotic to what I usually see, and it delivered on the entertainment front, as well as the peek into a world that I usually avoid. As such, I recommend checking it out, but there is no truth to the portrayal of Arabs, and there is no mention of the women who find the Arab (conservative) culture to be empowering. Instead, the movie depicts the non-excessive people as submitting to the excessive rich women. That is a false and borderline deluded message. There also wasn't any focus on solving anything. The only woman who comes across as analytically smart is the red-haired one, who also uses her professional knowledge to help her friends. There are also few showings of moral integrity. The lead character shows a few heroic acts, but apart from that, it mostly follows the women as they turn off their brains and act on instincts.",
