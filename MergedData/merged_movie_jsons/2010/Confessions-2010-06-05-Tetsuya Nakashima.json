            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Confessions",
            "content": "It's the kind of feeling all over again that makes it a delight to relive moments of a film that's just so steeped with brilliance. It's dark and it's disturbing, a psychological thriller to rival some of the best out there, tackling themes of poetic justice and revenge that's coolly served in perfect tones of subversion, grabbing you by the scruff of your neck with its extended hook from the start and lasting some thirty minutes, before things kick into full gear for a chilling, violent ride that's unflinching in its violence, laced with strong characters filled with perverted motivations all round.Written and directed by Tetsuya Nakashima and based upon the novel by Kanae Minato, the story's extremely hypnotic and sprawls points of views from multiple characters, each weaved intrinsically with one another and all being uncannily hypnotic in its stylish execution. The hook wraps up everything you'd come to expect from a great thriller, and that riveting introductory classroom scene alone is worth the price of an admission ticket many times over, orchestrating its sound contrast design to perfection where it seems a teacher is unable to control her class, and is nonchalantly attempting to do so until a bombshell is dropped to elicit an automatic silence, and fear.Takako Matsue (of The Hidden Blade and Villon's Wife fame) plays a schoolteacher whose young daughter was murdered by students identified in her class. Rather than challenging the judge's verdict and knowing jolly well that a juvenile is protected by the law against capital punishment, the plan she devices is so devious that it turns the class upside down turning classmates against the guilty, and yet still hitting them where it hurts most, slowly observing and scheming any exploited weaknesses. Probably the best strategy anyone can adopt when dealing with unspeakable evil, and it is this execution of her plan that forms the remainder of the film told from different perspectives in confessional style (hence the title), where a deeper character study gets presented, while smartly fusing social observations about the restlessness of today's misguided teenagers in wanting recognition and being one up against their peers.Mothers seem to come into play, and the film provokes thought into this aspect of human nature that's so universal. A mother loses her child, another maintains her protective blindness fending provocative charges against her son, while yet another proudly obsesses with wanting the best from her kid that it becomes detrimental to his development. One knows about the power of Mother's Love and the extent they will go to protect their brood, and here the school teacher's severe loss becomes the catalyst for revenge best served cold, while also becoming pawns in a plan best unraveled when you watch the film.Nakashima's assured direction keeps you glued to every gorgeous frame thanks to its beautiful cinematography and shots that make it picture perfect, supported by an excellent soundtrack to bolster the dark mood created visually, and I just fell in love with the plenty of slow motion used which brings a sense of calming rhythm that betrays the dark undertones that were constantly brewing in the narrative. There doesn't seem to be a wasted frame or scene in the film, each moving the narrative forward in an engaging manner, keeping you guessing what's the next curve ball to be thrown, and silently rooting for justice in whatever form to be meted out, and on the other hand cannot help but to check yourself since they're kids to begin with, albeit guilty ones whom the teacher chooses a punishment that will resonate deeply throughout their lives, which is obviously a very long road ahead.The predominant cast of teenagers also performed their roles admirably since one can imagine the kind of thought process they have to go through to play characters who are basically mentally unsound for doing what they did, and frankly these aren't things that are far fetched given notable crimes committed by juveniles here too. The violence can be unsettling here for those with weak stomachs, not so much whether there's plenty of gore put on screen, but psychologically when you're made to crawl under the perpetrators' skins seeing things from their viewpoints.Confessions lives up to every critical acclaim garnered thus far, and I too love this film enough to put it firmly in my shortlist as the best film of the year, where all the technical elements that make up filmmaking gelled perfectly together with excellent performances all round. A movie gorgeously filmed that justifies why I go to the movies. A definite recommendation!",

After each confession, a new detail is added into the story until it became a complete story at the end.I feel empty. Very disturbing. The movie remains dark and cold from the beginning until the end. A great thing in this movie is that you don't know who you should hate. Yes, it's obvious that they have done something terribly wrong, but after each confession, they suddenly became the victim, and then after the movie finished, you ended up feeling the sympathy for every characters.The acting in this movie is absolutely fabulous. Just look at those eyes of the students. Cold and heartless. I watched it with my mouth wide open. The plot is perfect. I don't know what to complain. There are even some bloody scenes added to it, which make the movie more interesting.I love it.",

            "content": "A surprise box office hit in Japan, 'Confessions' made its way to the Toronto International Film Festival, and also chosen as Japan's entry to the Oscars. However, it's a very Japanese movie I can only recommend to viewers who have seen over 50 Japanese films or prior experience with violent Japanese films. For everyone else, I would recommend less graphic Japanese value-of-life school films such as 'The Blue Bird' (2008) and 'School Days with a Pig' (2008).Although there is a lot of blood spilled in the movie, it's still a mainstream picture with violence that's nothing compared to films directed by pre-2003 Miike Takashi, pre-2001 Kitano Takeshi, or most Japanese B-movies. What makes 'Confessions' a truly disturbing film, is that the horrifying acts of violence are done by teens, and adults' reactions toward them.'Confessions' is the first non-comedy film directed by Nakashima Tetsuya, who is known for award-winning comedy films 'Kamikaze Girls', 'Memories of Matsuko', and 'Paco and the Magical Book'. The story is based on 2008 award-winning novel of same title, which tells the story of a teacher's revenge on two students who killed her daughter. The movie is thought-provoking as well as emotionally draining, and takes the saying \"kids can be cruel\" to a whole new level.The Japanese term for teacher is \"sensei\", a title given not only to teachers, but also as suffix to other honorable occupations in society like doctors, writers, politicians, and lawyers. Teachers in Japan have traditionally been a highly respected occupation because they guide students not only in the subjects they teach, but also supposed to be mentors in life. In essence, a sensei performs the tasks of both teacher and student councilor for his/her class. The occupation has been glorified and beautified in abundance of modern literature with modern school dramas such as '3-B Kinpachi-sensei', 'GTO', 'Gokusen', and 'Rookies', where teachers connect with delinquent students by relentless trust and hard work. In 'Confessions', however, the teacher played by Matsu Takako is depicted as an emotionless and cruel individual who sets out to take the matter into her own hands by teaching the value of life through horrifying revenge. It even pokes fun at the glorified teacher's image in media with lines like \"I don't trust any of you, you're all talented liars\", and the absurdity of the passionate teacher who was totally unaware of the situation. The student violence and coldness of the teacher is very reminiscent of 'Battle Royale' (2000).Acting and casting in this movie were superb. I have been a Matsu Takako fan for a long time, but it was by far her best performance ever, and handled her unlikely dark role surprisingly well. Her control of emotion was right on in the first half as a ruthless teacher who suffers from tremendous pain, but hides her feelings in front of her students. In the second half, her character break down a couple of times, and it wasn't very hard for me to sympathize with the character despite the horrible things she did. Kimura Yoshino, and Okada Masaki both played their parts brilliantly in supporting roles. The casting was ridiculously well-done because all the characters felt so real, which brings a chill down my spine because it seemed like such frightening events can actually happen in real life. The child actors also performed very well, depicting the ill state some of the classrooms in Japan, and the twisted thoughts juvenile minds can have. Teen model Hashimoto Ai, who played Student A's girlfriend especially shined. She definitely will have a great career ahead if she can continue to perform at this level.The story is unveiled through confessions of various characters in the movie, sometimes repeating the same event from different perspectives. Everyone expresses their own hopes and despair, sadness and hatred. The fast narratives combined with hauntingly beautiful slow motion imagery and mesmerizing background music gave this film an eerie, gloomy atmosphere that complimented the story, as well as an exceedingly engaging flow of plot development. My only complaint is that the movie is slightly overproduced with excessive use of slow-motion throughout the film that offset the climax scene, which used high-speed camera and CG. But overall, extremely well-directed and bold art house human horror mystery.The movie addresses common social issues in Japan, such as bullying, abuse of child protection act, discrimination, and suicide from a whole new angle. 'Confessions', like many fine traditional Japanese films, is very emotionally draining, but keeps up the suspense throughout the film.By taking lives so lightly and easily in the film, the director conveyed the true value of one's life.",

            "content": "This little stormer of a movie really takes Asian extreme movies in another direction. A revenge movie that will keep you intrigued and interested till the end. The Far East market has been the home of great originality in the terror & horror film markets, and this is one great highlight in that vein.The film begins in a school classroom where the teacher tells her pupils that she is leaving, and then begins to tell a long tale revolving round her life and the tragic death that haunts her (her \"Confession\"). This leads to serious repercussions for some of the pupils. Twists and turns in the story then unfold for the viewer as we are retold further confessions to piece it all together.A very cerebral movie, the direction masks the revenge story at its heart with a very art-house look and indie soundtrack. A very original film, the acting is exceptional especially from the young school kids. Our lead lady who plays the class teacher is mesmerising as she leads the opening long confession scene. It was a very well delivered scene by her and sets the tone beautifully.The film begins quite psychological but it then does slide into more graphic detail. Takes you by the hand and leads you down the dark heart at its centre. You don't ever seem to know what to expect.It's great to have such a fresh original movie. Acting, story and direction are superb. A film I'd highly recommend to all who enjoy dark hearted movies.",

            "content": "This movie really is amazing and left me awestruck, it really is a frightening beauty with really good cinematography and visual elements for a Japanese movie. The plot unravels slowly while giving away certain hints of what is going on bit by bit and is done really well and is put together piece by piece in a outstanding manner. The students are way more obnoxious in this movie than I would have expected from a Asian middle school but to some degree it was necessary. This film really shows the ugly side of human nature how it's sometimes the weak that bully the people that is weaker than them. It was a little bit difficult to believe students in a Asian middle school would act obnoxious as they did in this movie, although I seen far worse in the US but it wasn't difficult to just go with it or stretched so far it was not believable at all. This has different elements put together in a well crafted manner and the psychological aspects of it is very well done, it may seem like a revenge movie or a movie about grief at first but that is only a part of it. What I really liked is how almost none of the characters is nothing like how they may seem at first. It's like you need to be in their shoes or their point of view in order to understand. If this movie was only about revenge than the film would have been over really quick and wouldn't have been as good and would have lacked the character study it needed, but the emphasis on different characters that were involved makes this movie brilliant with good psychological aspects to it. Hatred leads us to look at a very narrow view of things without looking at the whole picture and this is a part of what the plot to this is about. There is no simple and straightforward character in this which plays a big part in this story. This movie really does fit it's positive reputations and is well deserved of it, this is one of my favorite Japanese movie of 2010 from japan. Don't miss out on this brilliantly crafted movie.9/10",

            "content": "CONFESSIONS is one of the most savage, brutal and poignant revenge stories I have ever seen. It doesn't start off all that great, but it by the end I was in awe. The movie begins in a Japanese classroom on the final day of classes before the spring break and the remainder of the movie are the events that follow the fateful day in this classroom.The point of view switches numerous times throughout to different people affected by the event in the beginning. As the movie progresses you revisit past scenes from different character's perspectives but the scenes are never monotonous because you know much more the second time around. Much like an onion, CONFESSIONS is multi-faceted and there is much to discover and re-discover as each subsequent layer is peeled back.A beautiful thing about this movie, at least for me, is how wildly my sympathy flip-flopped. Don't take sides too adamantly because as you learn more and more about the characters and events of the movie your sympathy too is bound to jump ship to the point where you're not totally sure who to side with. CONFESSIONS challenges you in this way. Some may find it frustrating but it just added to CONFESSIONS's charm and wit.Unrelentingly dark, this movie is bound to incite feelings of bleakness and perhaps is not suited to those with a weak heart. The subject matter is heavy, the characters are morally-reprehensible and the feel of the movie is wholly somber \u2013 from the greys and dull blues which saturate each and every scene to the melancholy (albeit perfectly-suited) soundtrack which works its way infectiously into your mind and makes the horrific scenes before your eyes resonate deeply.I will not spiel on for much longer, but in closing; the acting is top-notch; the storytelling is captivating; the cinematography is gorgeous; and the touches of violence and blood are done in taste and to immense effect \u2013 never feeling gratuitous.I have seen many Japanese films but this one takes the cake as one of the best I have ever seen. If what I've said so far sounds convincing enough definitely give this movie a shot because I am rather hard to please and it did not let me down an ounce.",

            "content": "Sometimes I feel like I have to watch a lot of Asian thrillers just to find one that really works. For every 50 or so I watch, there will be only one 20th Century Boys or Confessions. The film works on pretty much every level, though it might be a bit hard to follow for some.The story starts with a pretty simple event. What you're completely unprepared for is that such a simple act will spiral completely out of control into an incredibly twisted series of events. You see...this is one of those movie that will tell (relatively) the same story from different angles and perspectives. That bit may throw some people off, but I promise it all makes sense if you're paying attention. And you should be paying attention, because watching the whole thing unravel is a hell of a lot of fun.Every movie has at least a couple drawbacks, however minor. One minor thing that kind of irritated me was the frequent use of slow motion shots. I understand using it to emphasize the importance of a shot, but this is just a little out of hand. Also, I wish some of the alternative tellings of events happened more linearly at some points. In some cases results are shown before the audience has a chance to even follow the story line to what leads to said action. But those are both minor nitpicks, really. On the whole, the movie is just plain excellent.",

            "content": "This film is about a teacher in Japan, whose daughter is killed by two students in her class. She sets out to seek her ultimate revenge, using an impeccable plan.\"Confessions\" takes the form of various characters confessing their deeds and emotions, and it works very well. The first part of the film consists of the teacher, Miss Moriguchi, recounting the value of life and her pain of losing her daughter. Even though this lasts for 30 minutes, it is one of the most captivating monologues I have watched. Just like the students in the class, I went from being distracted to being completely engrossed by her confession.The second part is about Boy B and his mother. The psychiatric manifestations of Boy B is realistically enacted, and the pain of Boy B's mother is fully displayed - which is a stark contrast to the apparently calm and composed Miss Moriguchi.Part three tells a spine-chilling tale of Boy A. This bit is disturbing and thought provoking, and yet it evokes a slight bit of sympathy for Boy A due to his upbringing.Part four is the finale, which one can only marvel at the complexity of Miss Moriguchi's plot. Everything makes so much sense, until the final word in the film which sparks a frenzy of mental activity about what really happened.To complement the intriguing and captivating plot, the film is artistically shot and acting is top notch across the board. \"Confessions\" is a marvellous masterpiece that will be remembered for years.",

            "content": "Confessions, directed by one of my favorite Japanese directors, Tetsuya Nakashima, is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies I have watched this year. It is a psychological thriller of a grieving teacher turned cold-blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back the students who were responsible for her daughter's death.In the story, the major characters make confessions one by one. The more perspectives from which the murder is looked at, the more we know about the characters and their motives, which may remind the audience of A Stranger of Mine. As the story is unfolded, there are several surprising twists. While making confessions and sometimes touching on the subjects they are ashamed of, some characters refuse to accept the truth, tell lies and point the finger of blame at others to salve their conscience.The director tries to explore the reasons why innocent children become evil teenagers with no conscience. Some seek attention because they are abandoned or physically abused by their parents. Some become vulnerable owing to their overprotective parents. Some feel lonely because they are nerds neglected and bullied by their peers. Some commit suicide or other crimes because they follow suit. Some tragedies are also attributed to the internet which allows people to gossip anonymously, the mass media which places too much emphasis on violence, and the law which exempts teenage murderers from being punished. Thanks to the convincing cast, the characters become lifelike.The black-grey-and-white setting, which is very different form the flamboyance of Memories of Matsuko, is stifling and depressing. After watching the film, the images of crimson blood, white milk, snow-white sakura, the bleak classroom, the lifeless homes and the dimly lit school hall will linger in one's mind. Apart from these, the gloomy skies in the movie were reminiscent of the ones in Elephant by Gus Van Sant. Despite the ominous dark clouds gathering overheard, every cloud has a silver lining, which symbolizes that the director still believes in the goodness of human nature, despite its dark side. This belief is also reflected in the scene when the female teacher stares at the strawberry given by a kid and another scene in which she says \"your new life has begun\".The mesmerizing classical music, spiced with a hypnotizing female voice, not only creates a shocking contrast to the disturbing scenes shot in slow motion, but also adds eeriness to the story. The sound effects are also memorable. When the female teacher puts down the last stroke of the word LIFE on the blackboard, the ear-piercing sound chilled me the bone. When the bubble pops, we feel hopeless.The film would have been more gripping if the first confession had been shorter and less talky. Besides, the CG images at the end are mediocre. Also, it is a difficult movie for the faint-hearted to sit through.On the whole, Confessions is a darkly disturbing, visually stunning and thought provoking movie ruthlessly exposing the root of various teenage problems and the dark side of human nature. After watching the movie, I left the cinema with a heavy heart. It conjured up images of several parricides committed by Hong Kong teenagers recently and I pondered on what had happened to our post 90's generation.",

As the teacher recounts her horrific tale, the vacant students begin to pay attention. The tonal shifts that follow are so dramatic at times, it's hard to rally connect, with anything or anyone. The teacher delivers her story with such flippancy that it's hard to tell if this is real. Nakashima's style suits the happy-go-lucky type films he's used to, but here the slow motion is gorgeous but intrusive. Representing something so complex as a series of vignettes results in a patchy and grim effort. It builds towards a climax that seems very out of place, due to the distance kept between us and the characters. No doubt a brave and different film, but one where some focused storytelling could have really helped.",

Confessions is a disturbing film, a morbid film and what happens is mind-blowing. It is disheartening, scary even, to see middle school students who are close to demented, with no heartfelt mercy or sympathy, who can kill freely for baffling reasons. At the same time, the adult characters are just as heartless. The teacher, Yuko Moriguchi (played by Takako Matsu) is intimidating \u2013 her only purpose in life after the death of her daughter is revenge; far from the typical adult mentor and role model that we are so used to seeing.But the reason why I gave a higher rating to the film than the novel was because the director, Testuya Nakashima, did a marvelous job at taking a mediocre book with stagnant flow and transforming it into an intelligently crafted suspenseful film that maintains realism and proper flow. The 'blue' look (most obvious in the classroom scenes) and the ominous, monotonous soundtrack just adds to the film's darkness. Though the initial confession by Ms. Moriguchi is rather long winded, the rest of the film will consistently confuse, startle and even upset audiences. You will see children involved in relentless bullying and even cold-blooded murder \u2013 the middle school students' performances are astonishingly convincing. By the end of the film, you may feel cheated at such a disgusting and horrifying ending. You will be astounded and maybe even depressed at mankind's depravity \u2013 if that was the intention of both the author and director, they succeeded in playing a cruel joke on us all.",

            "content": "Lionel Shriver's novel, We need to talk about Kevin, went places where few novelists had dared to venture; she did a great job - that entire stretch where Kevin goes crazy was skillfully written and Ms.Shriver deserved the Orange prize. However, director Nakashima has pushed the boundaries further in this impressively shot and directed movie.Confessions begins with a long-drawn lecture from Yuko Moriguchi, a teacher at a school somewhere in Japan. Ms.Moriguchi is about to leave the school; but before that, she wants to impart one final lesson - on the value of life. In doing so, she shocks her students with a revelation: her young daughter (very young, heart-wrenchingly young), whose death the police concluded was an accident, was intentionally murdered by two of her own students. She not only reveals the murderers' identity but also explains how she plans to take revenge on those students. This brilliant monologue that lasts for half-an-hour is the best part of the movie; it is wonderfully held together by Takaka Matsu's restrained performance.Acts II and III present details of Moriguchi's actual scheme; it isn't as pedestrian as announced in class - it is much more devious and cruel. The movie scores because it creates an uneasy tension in the minds of the viewer: we realize that the kids' deeds are evil and are worthy of severe punishment. Hence, we don't find fault with the Mother's acts. However, it is very difficult for us to believe that it is their Teacher who is orchestrating these devious acts of revenge. It is in creating this constant discomfort that the writer's genius shines through.The director extracts brilliant performances from the entire cast. I wonder how he worked with those two kids - how did he train them? The cinematography is high on aesthetics and adequately conveys the required dark mood. I however thought the final sequences (flames, blasts) could have been toned down a few notches.While some might categorize this as a psychological revenge drama (which it is), I tend to view it more as a strong statement on the mental state of today's children and how they are affected by developments at home and relationships at places of education. It isn't a pleasant state of affairs, and Nakashima has conveyed so much in his unflinching dark- dark-dark drama.",

The film intrigued me in that I'm a big fan of psychological thrillers and that's what this movie is actually toted as. It goes quite dark, so I'm fine with clumping this in with horror. The synopsis is a grieving mother turned cold-blood avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter's death.A good portion of this film actually takes place in a classroom. We hear a song playing over a class of children as their drinking milk. We get the idea that they're a bit unruly and this is actually the end of a section of school. Their teacher, Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu), informs them this is the last day that she will be their teacher. She then goes about making a confession. She is a single mother and she can't work anymore with something that happened. We learn who the father of her daughter is and why she never married him. Her daughter is Manami (Mana Ashida) and we learn that she died.The police ruled it an accident, but the more that Moriguchi goes on, we actually realize that's not the case. Her daughter was murdered. She won't name the individuals who did it, but they're both in the class room. She does refer to them as A and B. Moriguchi then reveals that she did something to their milk and that causes both of them to freak out.From here we following both of these students, Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara) as he descends into madness for what he thinks he has now. We also see that he isn't the nice boy that his mother thinks and actually has a dark side. Yuko Shimomura (Yoshino Kimura) blames Moriguchi for these changes as well.Shuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii) has a dark back-story that makes you feel sorry for him and the reason that he is acting out. The problem is that he goes way too far and when his plans don't work like he expects, he takes them even farther.There is also Mizuki Kitahara (Ai Hashimoto) who befriends Shuya. She also tries to help Noaki with their new teacher, Yoshiteru Terada (Masaki Okada). The film gives us even more confessions from three students and the dark secrets and desires they all harbor. The law won't help Moriguchi, but she can definitely get her revenge.As I've kind of alluded to already here, this was something I came into pretty blind and I actually really love the deeper issues this film is exploring. The first major one for me is that in Japan there's a law that protects minors. I can see the applications of this, but with society how it is, we create monsters like we get in this film. It is wild that they could kill like they do and they really just get a slap on the wrist. It is really hard for me to blame Moriguchi for what she is doing in retaliation.Another aspect that is really good is the idea of society in Japan. Moriguchi becomes pregnant before she is married with her daughter. The man that she is in love with turns out to have HIV, so they decide to not marry and the daughter won't take his last name. This is in part to protect her, because children do not understand HIV/AIDS and will shun her. It turns out that Moriguchi and her daughter both do not have it. I actually like showing it this aspect that it isn't always the easiest thing to contract like many might think. This whole concept is also explored in Moriguchi's classroom as well. She is also looked down upon being a single mother, especially by Shimomura, who thinks that she is more worried about her own child than teaching the others.To look at the other way, this film also does explore the idea that children in Japan have lofty expectations to live up to. Shuya's mother gave up her dreams of being an electrical engineer to have him and when he wasn't living up to her expectations, she left her husband and child. This really messes with his head to the point that he will do anything for her to recognize him whether it is fame or infamy.I will admit that this film is a bit convoluted, but by the end of it, I realized that it really isn't. The plan that Moriguchi uses for the most part just plays on the fact that children are na\u00efve. There are the monsters that she has to deal with and wants to punish them, but she will be prosecuted if she does anything directly and they won't be. She instead knows they can be manipulated. I actually think that the editing of the film helps this as well. We get a long sequence to start the film in the classroom with Moriguchi confessing what happened to her and what she was going to do. It then moves around between her and four other characters to fill us in. I think this keeps the film going and my interest peaked. I love the ending and what she does to finally get her revenge, even more so with her final line.This then brings me to the acting of the film which I think is really good. I thought Matsu was absolutely great in her role. At first you feel horrible about what happened to her, but then when you realize what she is doing, it is kind of horrific. You then have to ask yourself, if the law isn't going to give you the justice you deserve, then should you take it into your own heads. Even more than that though, she doesn't actually do anything that would really implicate her. I thought that Nishii, Hashimoto and Fujiwara were all unique and different characters. It is interesting for how young they all are; because I think they were really solid as well. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.As to the effects of the film, there's not really a lot in the film, but it didn't require it. I like that this film does use images that flash across the screen to indicate us as viewers of something. This is a subtle way to get their point across. I think the blood we see looks good. I like the dream that Shuya has in the gym, it is pretty horrific. The film is also shot very well, so I didn't have any issues there.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I did find it interesting that this film, with how dark and depressing it is, actually uses quite a bit of happy, upbeat songs. I like this move actually to show us the duality of human nature. We all have things we've dealt with, but many of us put on a smile when around our peers. This is even truer for people that end up committing suicide. I think the rest of the soundtrack fits for what is needed as well.Now with that said, this is a film that I'm definitely glad I was told to check out. It really has such a dark feel to it and what this teacher does to get her revenge is great. I also like the social commentary here about this law in Japan, parents protecting their children and conversely the pressure parents put on their children. The film is edited in a way that keeps it from getting boring and I thought it had a great ending. The acting was really good across the board. There weren't a lot in the way of effects, but what we got was solid. Soundtrack for the film does bring a nice duality and fit the scenes for what was needed. Overall I'd definitely recommend this if you like dark, psychological thriller. I'd say this is a really good movie.",

Confessions is an expertly crafted ensemble drama/thriller about revenge and cruelty.\u00a0At the center is a teacher whose young child dies in a school pool, but the movie grows to include the narratives of the people responsible for the child's death, as well as others connected to them.\u00a0It's non-linear and the character focus cycles between several people. I haven't seen many other movies like it, actually. It's thoughtful and contemplative one minute, and brutally cruel the next. Confessions is very dialogue driven (hence, the name), but there are moments of shocking imagery sprinkled throughout that carry the story as much as or more than the words of the characters. I thought the whole film was beautifully shot, with various different camera techniques used to augment the narrative. There's a dreamy, surreal, Virgin Suicides vibe to the whole thing that gives it a sedate pace, but that absolutely works.\u00a0Will everyone like it? Nope. As I said, this is a fairly different type of film, even among the other Japanese films I've seen. It's hard to tailor my recommendation to the type of person who might like this, but I absolutely would hope that anyone interested gives Confessions a shot.",

According to the pre-movie announcement at the Japan Society the special guests to the film festival were happy to come to New York because they could actually see the film. I'm not sure that the film is as good as the hype but at the same time it is a dark descent into hell.The film starts off simply. On the last day of the term a teacher announces that she is giving up teaching. Her students for the most part couldn't care less. However her good bye speech begins to pick up steam as she explains why, it seems the recent accidental death of her daughter wasn't an accident but murder and that since the two students in the class who did it are too young to be prosecuted she would be getting revenge... and she does...and then things go even blacker than you can imagine.Its a dark cruel film that will make your jaw hang open in disbelief. The level of cruelty in this film will make you head spin.The question is how will this film effect you? Certainly this well made little poisoned confection will give you pause, but how hard it hits you is another matter. For some people in the audience it was like being hit with a truck. They were left reeling by what they saw. For me and a some others we liked the film, we admired it, but we found it kind of over produced and trying too hard to work your emotions. Yes it plays with you and yes you'll groan at some of the turns but the film is so slick that the emotional impact kind of slides off.I do like the film but at the same time I wish it wasn't so perfectly made.Definitely worth a look, I'd just try to steer clear of the hype and finding out anything about the film past the set up since the twists are too good to spoil.",

            "content": "Someone described \"Confessions\" as \"Grange Hill meets Oldboy\" which doesn't particularly make much sense to me, because yes alright it's set in a school like \"Grange Hill\" and it's main theme is revenge like \"Oldboy\" but \"Confessions\" is in its own league. Although not as good as \"Oldboy\" (in my humble opinion) \"Confessions\" is an extremely powerful and dramatically heavy tale of a teacher's revenge on two members of her class for murdering her daughter. It has an extremely strong opening which could be a powerful little short film in itself, as the first half hour is literally the teacher giving a speech to her class about her murdered daughter, yet it's totally gripping to watch, and so beautifully done with the flashbacks.\"Confessions\" doesn't stall from there, as it unfolds we get to hear different confessions by different people, we get Student B's mother's story, Student B's story and ultimately Student A's story with little bits in between. \"Confessions\" is told in a different way from most films, it isn't a straight forward linear film, it's more of one big monologue, gathering different views from different people as the story unfolds and it's enthralling to watch. I don't think there's a moment where you can stop reading the subtitles, it's like an audio book, with such a thrilling and intelligent, solid screenplay.The directing is also quite a marvel, although the constant use of slow motion does become a bit arty as it's over-used and so loses its meaning. However their are moments where slow motion is used brilliantly, especially in the gripping finale which I'll get to in a minute. Mostly the directing is good, he manages to make a 30 minute speech really lively and interesting to watch, with different flashbacks, using different and interesting camera angles and draining colours. Sometimes \"Confessions\" does look breath-takingly beautiful.The revenge also isn't an in-your-face bloodbath but more of a slow. drawn out and emotionally draining affair. A lot of thought has gone into the film, especially with its constant visual metaphors and symbolism. I also quite liked how the teacher had quite an under-developed character, so she just looks like an in control, calm woman who is completely fixed on getting her revenge. A bit like The Bride in \"Kill Bill Vol.1\", only obviously completely different. \"Confessions\" has a very murky and dark image, and is very depressing all the way through, and it makes you feel like you've been on a journey by the time it has finished.The final scenes are also absolutely cracking. It almost makes you sympathise with an evil murdering bastard, and at the same time has you cheering for the revenge-obsessed teacher. It's an incredibly clever rush of emotions and ultimately makes the film unforgettable. Its execution is beautiful to watch and is also really well acted. I think that \"Confessions\" ended perfectly, on a very dark note that makes you feel like you've really just watched something special.Unfortunately \"Confessions\" isn't perfect. Its constant use of slow mo and sometimes overly long and dragged-out scenes means that I'm restrained from giving it a full 10/10. However, that still doesn't stop it from being one of the best revenge films I've ever seen. It's very different, with excellent story-telling and character development, along with beautiful directing that makes the whole film enthralling to watch. It's a shame that only 44 reviews are on here at this moment in time, because \"Confessions\" deserves a wider audience. It's beautiful and definitely way above average.",

It wasn't an accident though; she knew that two of her students had killed the young girl; she knew which two had done it and she would have her revenge. She announced that the cartons of milk drunk by the killers had been spiked with AIDS infected blood! Not surprisingly that had an effect on the boys; and they people in the class. The next term a new teacher was taking the class and one of the boys was at home; ever since that day he had been paranoid about making any contact with his family lest he pass it on. The other boy returned to school but was the target of constant bullying from his classmates\u0085 this was just the beginning of Yuko's revenge; by the time she had finished with them they would be utterly destroyed; and she wouldn't need to lay a finger on them! I don't think I've seen another film quite like this; much of what we see is in slow motion giving everything a surreal dreamlike quality, this is increased by the blue/grey tint to everything. Like Yuko's students the viewer is likely to be shocked by the story she tells and stunned by what she says she has done. After her announcement we see the death of her child from the viewpoint of each of the young killers; their attitude to their actions is quite chilling. Equally disturbing is one of the boy's descent into madness and the way almost the entire class turns on them. Usually revenge thrillers are packed with action as the wrong party gets their blood revenge; not this however, it is almost entirely psychological and what action we do see is brutal and shocking rather than exciting. I would certainly recommend this to anybody who doesn't mind subtitles.",

It looks great, with clever lighting and colouring for effect. The film is too slow paced attempting to add to the emotions, but simply the characters are only surface felt and so much of it is left for the viewer and their perceptions. The complicated plot also gets lost at points so making it all too ambitious and confusing. Genius or trying to hard?The film is about a teacher, suffering after her daughter has tragically drowned. She is leaving but wants to exact revenge on her class of pupils, as some were involved in her daughters death. There are several flash backs and moments where the lead lady deals with paranoia and dream like sequences. The class also have half of the story, with several pupils losing their control too. I did enjoy most of the film, although some of it gets lost in subtitled translations, and it has been hailed for its cleverness, but for many its aims will be lost. World Cinema does not appeal to the mass and this arty music video like drama , although excellent in story and theory, leaves much to taste and individual mood. It is rather long, challenging and grim, but it is none the less commendable, individual world cinematography.",

Every method she uses to revenge is very clever and creative but still reasonable for ordinary woman like her. The footage of this film is very stunning and thoughtfully taken. Also, it fits with the soundtracks so much. The soundtrack of this film shows pop culture of Japan. They are fun songs but they use them in very sarcastic but interesting way. The movie also mention about Japanese society especially problem of students affected from schools and family, such as sexual harassment, bullying, neglectful teachers and domestic violence. However, at the first part of the film, there is a scene that teacher explains what happened with her daughter that I, personally, think that it is a little bit too slow since",

Well, these days, with everything already done story-wise, I'd say you'd expect a different angle to an established theme, and/ or to be entertained in a way that TV or home entertainment cannot provide. If that assumption meets your own ideas, then, by all means, go see this film in a theater. It is one of those rare pieces that manage to meet all expectations one could possibly have, and it's a big screen experience involving sound, visuals and atmosphere unmatched by any film I've seen released this year so far.The well-established themes here are revenge and juvenile delinquency, and the unassuming spectator would believe the climax to be reached after just about ten minutes into the film. What happens then is a narrative shift between the characters, examining their reasons for hating others, themselves, or the whole world. That may sound overly intellectual or even trite, but it isn't - it's just a very different way to tell a story.Towards the end the teenager's transgressions may appear a little far-fetched, but the main character's purpose - the teacher looking for revenge for her daughter's death and constantly finding that the suffering she inflicts doesn't amount to her own suffering - keeps the atmosphere afloat until the final, literally and figuratively bombastic culmination. Matsu Takako's performance is one of those rare examples of Japanese acting at its best, combining mannerisms quite impossible in any other culture with a topic that everyone can relate to.If you're familiar with Nakashima Tetsuya's earlier films, especially 'Kamikaze Girls', you may find yourselves shocked as to how dark 'Confessions' is. 'Memories of Matsuko' (2006) was already some sort of salt bar in a chocolate coating, but his last film 'Paco and the Magical Picture Book' (2008) was pure 'Alice in Wonderland'. 'Confessions' is the exact opposite, an unsettling stab at the heart and mind reminiscent of the hopelessness of Koreeda Hirokazu's 'Nobody knows', and just about as brilliantly done.",

            "content": "Confessions opens with a scene depressingly familiar in contemporary Japan - 'classroom breakdown.' A teacher stoically maintains a teacherly disposition in the face of apathy and hostility from her 40-odd charges. They text, shout, fight, enter and leave the room, throw paper balls - and milk. Those splashes of white, slo-mo'ing through the grey-blue muted frame, are portents of a greater darkness to come.The stylised rendering of this scene will fool some overseas viewers into thinking this is a heightened reality for cinematic aesthetics. As anyone who has talked to a secondary-level teacher out here will know, classroom breakdown is widespread and pernicious. Nakashima's visual rendering of this phenomenon in the opening 20 minutes seems unflinchingly accurate in capturing the dehumanization that mob rule engenders.Social critique gives way to plot demands as the teacher's monologue reveals she is leaving, views her pupils with detached contempt, and has identified amongst them two killers of her own infant daughter. At this point the audience is wrong-footed into thinking the film will be a whodunit. Instead, we find out quickly that Naoki and Shuya 'dunit' (though who is the leader and who was led will throw up some intrigue).The film then re-visits the scene of the crime Rashomon-style, offering up interpretations by the teacher/mother, both the perpetrators, and one of the perpetrator's mothers.Nakashima seems less interested, however, in exploring the psychology of the child murderers, than in representing Japan's current social malaise in heightened, graphic terms. The 'reasons' given - striving for popularity amongst peers, lack of motherly love - are trite and hackneyed. Even the search for revenge by the teacher/mother is left unquestioned, serving as a motivation to drive the plot when it could be examined in more critical terms.Perhaps, given the catalogue of matricide, patricide and random killings committed by juveniles in recent years, the very mundaneness and banality of such incidents is Nakashima's point. Perhaps, he seems to imply, the reasons are trite and insubstantial. Our incremental exposure to such amoral acts inures us to the next one.The film achieves a balance in its representation of the horror and yet commonality of petty cruelties. The murder itself, while wicked, seems overtaken by the viciousness of the retribution dolled out by the classmates. When innocence and rationality assert themselves, in the form of Head Pupil Mizuho, the price paid for such naivet\u00e9 is swift and brutal. This is a hard pill to swallow, but its resonance to greater concerns in contemporary Japan is undeniable.Less of a success is the film's attempt to marry this to plot concerns. The teacher's partner died of AIDS (note the casual racism in pointing out that it was contracted overseas), a point thrown up merely to give the teacher a weapon to use against her tormentors. When Naoki, the pupil-murderer less vulnerable to the teacher's revenge, decides to turn the tables, he does so by constructing a highly sophisticated remote control bomb triggered by his own mobile phone. There are nation-states who cannot master such technology. There are enough genuinely terrifying acts of violence to be gleaned from the Japanese tabloids without resorting to such comic-book machinations. The social critique of the film is ultimately undercut by this 'stop-the-bomb' clich\u00e9d ending.The blue-black-silver palette eloquently conveys the paranoia and social degeneration that classroom breakdown is the beating heart of. Unfortunately, Nakashima opts to eschew close-ups, a choice that distances us from any of the players. The still on the publicity shot is the clearest view you will get of Takako Matsu, who plays the relentless, chilling teacher. No doubt the lack of close-ups was meant to underline the dehumanizing effects of the actions portrayed, but cinematically it is less than satisfying. It is an annoying trope commonly found in contemporary Japanese film-making. I wonder if it is an aesthetic choice, or an element imposed by restricted budgets.I usually despair of films where there is no one to like. However, there is something about Confessions that captures an ennui, a sickness current in Japanese society, and education in particular. Capturing that atmosphere is the film's main achievement. However, the dark frames and lack of close-ups ultimately meant I felt no emotional engagement with the characters. Lack of redemption I can live with, but these choices also imbibe the film with a lack of humanity that is less forgivable. Nakashima is a polished artisan, and he knows his society well. Based on this outing, I am less sure he is familiar with the human frailties of the people who populate it.",

Of course there are always some tiny points to be improved in the movie but I can easily say that this is the real real masterpiece...First of all you see the difference in the directing when the movie just starts... just the first scenes tells that this movie is no ordinary one... and of course the sequel comes...The most brilliant directing since a long time... The only detail for me to be improved was that younger lead actors could do a bit better in making us feel their real emotions during the movie... it is a very tiny detail when compared to the story, directing and the rest of the movie but still made me expect even more... But we should also understand that building the movie on three unexperienced teenagers is a great risk... I think overall they acted brilliantly... but a bit bit more genuine acting (especially by the end) would polish this movie ... That's the only reason I'm giving 9 points to a definitely 10 point movie!!! Lastly this is no horror movie but a perfect thriller!.. (under 15 restriction is acceptable)Watch this movie and be amazed!...",

            "content": "While I admire the idea behind CONFESSIONS, a Japanese revenge drama that explores simmering vengeance within the seemingly ordinary settings of an urban high school, the format is all wrong. This is a lengthy film that seems to be in no real hurry to get on with its job, which is telling the plot; as a result, it all feels very long-winded and drawn-out, with lots of padding and extraneous scenes and characters that contribute little to the central storyline.In addition, the decision to have the entire film's structure based around various characters narrating their stories doesn't really work. It might have worked in the theatre; in a visual medium such a film, it feels stagy and dull. The whole first half hour is based around a female teacher telling her story and by the end of it you wonder why they didn't shave twenty-five minutes off that time to make it move a little faster. Add in some annoyingly-presented supposed teenage 'masterminds' \u2013 I could buy it in DEATH NOTE, but not here \u2013 and you have a film that I struggled to sit through.The film is marketed as a horror movie but it's really not. In fact, not much happens at all during the running time, and despite a few moments of graphic violence the film failed to arrest me or engage my senses in any way. The revenge story is potentially interesting, but I've already seen it done to death time and time again and we learn nothing more about the human condition that hasn't already been documented in other, better movies. Sure, it's well made on a technical level, and the acting is strong throughout, but in the end the combination of ridiculous plot twists documented in an entirely mundane way sink this movie despite its best intentions.",

The consistency of this movie is not very high, and movie is not a thrillfest some assume it is. However, it shows nicely depravity of a teenage soul, and the wreck selfish mothers and females can impose on vulnerable teenagers. It has some twists and turns, and a somewhat satisfying finale. It argues for cruelty against children, cruelty Asians are famous for, and it does so in a somewhat artificial way, but the misanthropy of this movie is heartfelt. It also proves that at the moment South Korean cinema is superior to Japanese cinema. Akira Kurosawa, Japanese genius, is turning in his grave, one ash droplet at a time. Still, not a bad movie, full of sarcasm, cynicism and Japanese culture.",

            "content": "\"Confessions\" is about Ms. Moriguchi (Takako Matsu), a young school teacher who plots and executes an elaborate plot to exact revenge on two of her juvenile delinquent students who were responsible for the sad death of her four year old daughter. This horror story happened in a seemingly \"regular\" school, where your own children are in right now. How are you to know if there are mentally-unstable schoolmates roaming around plotting the most evil of schemes for the most nebulous reasons? This is the main reason why this film is so unsettling and discomforting.The film also makes a convincing case against the Juvenile Law of the Penal Code stating that those 14 years old and younger are not liable for their crimes and cannot be punished for them. The film is highly stylized with liberal use of visual effects and computer imagery. It is also very graphically violent and shirked not from generously splattering blood in its depiction of the various deaths that occur in the film. The performance of Ms. Takako Matsu in the lead role of Ms. Moriguchi is so quiet and restrained, which makes her seem even more sinister, even as you can completely see where she is coming from. The creepy portrayals of the two troubled boys by young actors Yukito Nishii and Kaoru Fujiwara are very vexing in their realism. \"Confessions\" is a different kind of Japanese horror film especially since it has nothing supernatural going on in it. This is one film that is so difficult to watch because you get the feeling that this can happen in real life. It is a film that can make you lose faith in the future of humanity. Yet, despite it being so dark, so disturbing, so demoralizing and so depraved, Director Tetsuya Nakashima tells the story in a riveting way that you will be mesmerized to follow it all the way to the bitter end.",

It tells the story of a school-teacher who unleashes her twisted master plan to punish the students responsible for her daughter's death & is told through the confessions of different people as the story moves forward.Told in non-chronological order & shifting point of views that requires the viewers' attention from the very beginning in spite of the chaos & repelling ambiance present in its opening moments, the film is carefully assembled from start to finish & is effectively told. Smartly directed, deftly written & featuring magnificent performances from the child actors, the film makes its viewers sympathize with one character after another but where it delivers the strongest punch is in its final moments.On an overall scale, Confessions is one of the finest examples of psychological thriller mystery & this time, a classic revenge-themed cinema this good doesn't come from Cinema of South Korea who seem to be the undisputed master of it but another Asian cinema powerhouse i.e. Cinema of Japan. It's brutal, violent, disturbing, maddening & depressing but if you are game for revenge-thrillers like I am, then Confessions is just the right film for you to check out.",

            "content": "While apparently art-house in appeal, Japan's entry to the upcoming Best Foreign Language Oscar is not really hard to follow. A little bit of extra attention may initially be require at the start of each scene, but the audience, even those who are essentially exposed only to main stream cinema, will soon catch on and acquire the taste of the movie, so to speak.The somewhat lengthy establishing scene is packaged as a monologue, sometimes as voice-over and sometimes directly on screen, delivered by a high school teacher Yuko to her class at the close of the school term. She has resigned and will not return in the next term, she intimates. She then proceeds, almost nonchalantly, to make a shocking revelation: the recent drowning death of her 4-year-old daughter in the school's swimming pool is the result of nothing less than murder by two students, \"A\" and \"B\" as she calls them, who, being under the age of 14, cannot be touched by the law. She'll exact her own revenge, she promises them, even when she would have left the school.Following this pattern, development of the plot is presented through voice-over POV accounts (\"confessions\") of several individuals, including a girl student who is the class monitor, B's mother, B, and finally A. The order is not haphazard: B is only an accomplice while A, being the chief engineer of the crime, comes last. There are also other important characters, including A's mother and the young male teacher who replaces Yuko, although they are not utilize as narrators.Knowing in advance the details of plot's development, twists and turns will take away much of the pleasure of enjoyment of the movie. Suffices to say that this is a thought-provoking psychological thriller that will keep you spellbound. The subject matter is all too relevant. To put it in the most specific terms, it is first and foremost a study of how two specific types of mothers \u2013 the over-protective and the negligent \u2013 bring about blood-chilling consequences. There is more: how the entire generation's attitude (particularly that towards death and killing) is warped by failure of the education system, peer pressure and proliferation of electronic mass communication technology, among other things.The cast, headed by Takako Matsu, is uniformly excellent. The direction, while artsy, is not obscure. While there is crimson blood in abundance, the real violence is not so much physical as mental. It's a long way to Oscar and I don't believe the short list has been reached yet. This movie, however, is well worth watching regardless of Oscar.",

It's hard not to get impacted by the movie. It's a very bold movie with a story that is disturbing and making us uneasy on our perceptions of the movie but in a good way. Of course , it's a movie and a work of fiction, so clinging to the characters or the series of events is not necessary but a natural inclination is we are drawn with the characters and the story it's portraying. The screenplay writers and the writers deserve a very huge respect for the narrative and the directors for making it possible for this amazing movie to be the way it is. It's sad, brutal, and cathartic at the end making it a cold blooded revenge story. The makers invested good amount of time in the characters as a result we were able to relate with the characters, and the layers in the characters were done beautifully. It's a unique movie with a different narrative style which is rather a positive aspect of the movie. Overall, it's an enjoyable movie l.What did not work:\nI think the songs in the movie were, for me, distraction and they hammered the narrative rather than enhanced it, at least some of them. Somewhere in the movie , the movie shifts the mood and the climate of the movie, which I think is unnecessary and not a good idea.\nFinal verdict: highly recommended",

I don't claim to be an expert on Japanese films having seen only a few, but I can't help but credit the innumerable levels with which this film works. The direction, the acting and the story are gripping. I particularly liked how the overlapping narratives (or confessions) continued to paint a clearer picture of the events as they unfold or unfolded in the past and present. I found this technique very original, clever and extremely effective. The visuals, editing and photography are stunning.But on a deeper level, I was struck by what seemed to be a heavy-handed critique of current Japanese culture--unruly middle school classrooms where student attention spans are non-existent, parents placing their needs ahead of their children's (or the opposite extreme), and mostly, the film's assault on Japan's coddling obsession with juveniles who are essentially excused by law from any wrong-doing, including the murder of another human being. This film does not take it's opinion of these laws lightly.Because of it's strong sociological perspective, I find it hard to quantify this film as a genre piece (psychological thriller/horror, etc...) The film has a lot more to say than typically fit in those kind of boxes, and I highly recommend it because of this.",

She was killed by students from thiz class!\". One thing is for sure, the movie starts with a very interesting premise. I went to see thiz movie without any expectation and then boom! In the end, I found that thiz movie is one jaw-dropping psychological thriller. The movie is divided into several chapters, each of which tells from perspective of different character, like the teacher, student's mother, murderer A, murderer B and so on. We are able to see into the mind of each character, what is the motive, the secret and finally the shocking twist. The woman teacher is played by Takako Matsu. Takako Matsu can deliver a strong cold-blooded impression. The two suspects are played by Yukito Nishii and Kaoru Fujiwara. Although, both are still very young, they can create believable figures and definitely not corny or shallow. The other Cast members are Ai Hashimoto, Yoshiteru Terada and Yoshino Kimura. The movie is directed by one of today's respectable Japanese Directors Tetsuya Nakashima. He is widely recognized for \"Kamikaze Girls\" (2004), \"Memories of Matsuko\" (2006) and \"Paco and the Magical Book\" (2008). Something surely gets my attention. Thiz movie has a peculiar approach to storytelling. The Director Tetsuya Nakashima definitely has his own style. Sometimes he gives a bit of flashback image. Another time, he describes an event with a very strange slow motion sequence. The slow motion sequence looks so elegant yet realistic. Substantively, thiz is a movie with most of the scenes takes place in a school, there's really nothing special about the venue. But in the hand of Tetsuya Nakashima, everything looks completely different. The cinematography is gorgeous and beautiful. It surely leaves a very deep mark. Apparently, thiz movie also intends to teach us a lesson about life. When we can see what the motive behind every action and consequence, at that time we come to realize that no one should be labeled suspect. In fact, everybody is just a victim.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

And an intriguing return it is too. To start, the film feels disjointed and confused, in a fashion typical of the director, with switches between a noisy classroom and a musical number. But quickly the film draws in the audience as the first confession is revealed.School teacher, Yuko, starts proceedings by opening up to her class about her husband's contraction of HIV, their subsequent split, and her child's death; though the film really starts once she reveals that the killer of her daughter lies among her pupils. What follows in an intense narrative, charting how this revelation goes on to affect those involved, resulting in their own confessions and tales of woe.Never one for conventional techniques and styles, director Nakashima often cuts to slow-motion shots during the main confessions, before quickly moving to a mini-music video-style sequence, as in Memories of Mastuko. These well-paced shots (in high definition) give an intensity to the stories being told, breathing life to the words as they are spoken. Kokuhaku becomes a truly psychological piece from here on in, being both disturbing in visual and narrative, delving into the minds of the characters in a way reminiscent of All about Lily Chou-Chou, painting a worrying picture of today's world.If someone did you wrong, how would you react? This is the real strength of Kokuhaku: Leaving the viewer unsure as to how to take what is put before them. Should one sympathise, empathise or simply despise those involved? Each capable of wrong doing, yet similarly victims themselves, those confessing put forward their defence for their actions that they know will hard others, with good performances all round from the cast. If the film fails, it's in that as more confessions are revealed, the more outrageous they become, gradually detracting from the intense impact they have at the start.An eye for an eye; vengeance is Mine; Kokuhaku is a film that will leave you unsure as to whether to laugh or cry...I must confess, I don't know which.www.politic1983.blogspot.com",

Sadly this turned out to be a massive disappointment. Firstly i don't normally have problems with subtitled films but with this i really struggled to keep up with the fast paced dialogue. Secondly i felt that this looked ( and sounded) like a two hour music video. One which it looks great but you never really have any grasp on whats happening in front of you. To say this film needs quite a bit of concentration is an understatement as we hear the confessions of all involved in the story. The characters didn't feel realistic and the first 20 odd minutes where the teacher explains how her daughter dies to her pupils is just odd and the children don't behave in a way you would expect and the rest of the film doesn't get any better..

If this is a touch slow, the way the full truth about the murder is then given to us in bite sized chunks while revealing more about the psychological profile of each of the key players is exemplary. There are many surprising twists - not those that make fool's of the audiences expectations, but those that confound any effort to disengage ourselves from the unfolding drama. There is also a very effective use of music. I am no fan of Radiohead's insufferably introspective and glum catalogue, but the director here makes excellent use of one of their tracks, whose piano riff recurs as a motif on three or four occasions. Overall Confessions is very telling of Japanese society. The ill-discipline of the classroom is not a reflection of real Japan, but serves as a device to give an updated warning that those who callously break their duty of care to others will get the punishment they deserve.",

            "content": "Lately I've been watching a lot of Korean films and really liking them. They're completely different from what I'm used to and quite a breath of fresh air. Recently I came across Confessions and I must say, it's not just Korean films,Asian cinema in general seems to be fantastic. Kokuhaku aka confessions was directed by Tetsuya Nakashima and revolves around a grieving mother turned cold-blooded avenger with a twisty master plan to pay back those who were responsible for her daughter's death. The first thing she does is mix her husband's HIV contaminated blood in the culprits's milk. Don't worry, this is not a spoiler, this is truly the beginning of story and it turns into something much bigger and much more complex. I just want to give you an idea of how twisted the plot is. As in most Asian films, the main theme here is revenge but there's quite a bit of social commentary going on as well. Be aware that Confessions is bleak and depressing and definitely not a film for the squeamish. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The cinematography is probably the best I have ever seen in my life and I'm not exaggerating. There's a lot of slow motion and some clever conceptual scenes. Every shot is a small work of art and there's not one wasted scene. The look is very minimal which I love. The soundtrack is truly mesmerizing and fits the dark atmosphere perfectly. The acting was great, specially considering the cast was mainly composed by kids and I have no idea how they were able to play such dark characters. I also have to mention the direction and vision of Tetsuya Nakashima which is astonishing. I'll be sure to watch his previous movies. I'm in shock still. Still trying to take it all in. Confessions is an amazing sensory experience, just an incredibly piece of work. It really is one of those films you'll be thinking about long after you watched it. Asian cinema is pretty extreme but this film is almost unlike anything I've seen.9.5/10",

            "review_title": "A complex revenge saga..",
            "content": "What drives a wronged person to revenge? What initiates a thirst for retribution? It is when the powers that be fail to deliver a \"fair judgment\"; when the hunger for getting even remains unsatisfied; when one is convinced that justice has not been done and decides that they just can't remain helpless, mute spectators to the wrongdoing inflicted upon them or their loved ones.But to what extent should one go? How much is enough? Is death the ultimate penalty? Not at all! What is more potent then? A fate worse than death, perhaps; something that could make life a living hell for the perpetrator! Japanese filmmaker Tetsuya Nakashima 's \"Confessions\" (2010), which tells a rather twisted tale of one such act of revenge, begins on a rather random note with a somewhat disoriented scene in a noisy classroom full of boisterous and mischievous thirteen year olds on the final day of class before school closes for the Spring break. A young teacher, Miss Moriguchi (Takako Matsu), says that it will be her last day in school and is delivering a long monologue which occasionally gets drowned in the accompanying continuous drone in the background score. The viewer suffers distraction too, with the camera cutting to the shots of some students playing mischief, hitting each other with a baseball, and chattering away, hardly paying attention to their teacher, while she continues addressing the class. The whole class (and so does the viewer) suddenly starts paying attention when she begins to make some startling revelations about what happened with her little daughter Manami.She reveals that her daughter was killed in an incident which was considered to be \"drowning by accident\" and was soon dismissed. But in reality, two boys present in the class at the time, were responsible for the daughter's death. She further adds that she is aware that the laws for juveniles are too soft and the boys would escape severe punishment. The students are taken aback at these sudden shocking confessions and are further subjected to a deadly surprise when Miss Moriguchi reveals her diabolical plan for exacting revenge and establishes that she has already set the ball rolling as they speak \u0085.! It's a fantastic twist that catches us unawares in this one scene in the beginning but it also raises a whole lot of questions immediately. What next? Is this it? This almost seems to be a closure to the story. A girl killed, culprits revealed, and the mother takes her revenge! That kind of wraps it up, doesn't it?! But not so soon. Writer-director Tetsuya Nakashima has more in store for us! The meaning of the title \"Confessions\" now starts taking shape. For this is not merely about the confessions of the mother, Ms. Moriguchi! It is also about those of others who are somehow tied to the incident in question.In a rather intricately layered and engaging screenplay, Nakashima shifts focus from one viewpoint to the other. A motley of characters, people connected to the incident make their own 'confessions' in voice-overs that narrate their side of the story. Nakashima presents us one picture in the initial few frames, from which we form an image of a particular character. Yet later, he forces us to see the same picture in a different light, a completely different perspective that makes us rethink our initial judgment of the character. It is a classic representation of the \"other\" side of truth and how appearances can be deceptive. It is about how it is awfully difficult to distinguish the right from the wrong, the good from the bad, because in the end, it is all a matter of perspective. One could stop at what seems to be the absolute truth. But dig beneath, and there could be more that could turn a 'fact' on its head! \"Confessions\" is a fascinating play on the viewer's judgment and overall impression about a person or a happening; an impression that doesn't seem to attain stability and finds itself shifting in the labyrinth of these strange episodes happening in each person's life. Nakashima also succeeds in putting the viewer in a hypnotic trance with his stylistic approach of beautiful cinematography that is gorgeous and bleak at the same time, a haunting soundtrack that plays with the senses along with a very prominent drone that fills the atmosphere, and slow-motion camera-work that more or less occupies most of the running time of the film, rendering a spacey, dream-like mood. One might wonder if more style means less substance, but so is not the case, as there is enough meat to balance the style and a perfect equilibrium is achieved in the overall construction of the film. Thankfully, graphic, gory violence, which is a characteristic of most Asian revenge dramas is kept to a minimum and is not exaggerated. There is more reliance on the trance-like atmosphere rather than the gore.\"Confessions\" boasts of an intriguing script and commendable performances, especially from Takako Matsu and youngsters Yukito Nishii and Ai Hashimoto. The film does falter slightly, though, from some overdone and contorted scenes drawing dangerously close to being gimmicky and just too many twists crammed in the final act, some of which aren't as shocking or compelling as some better ones that appear midway through the film. Hardly any reason to sideline it though; for this is surely one of the finest thrillers from recent times that you'll have the pleasure of viewing.Score: 8/10",

And yet when I finished watching it about 30 minutes ago I thought 'Hmmm, watch shall I watch now?'Two obvious things that I didn't like: 1. If you've ever seen This World of Ours (oretachi no sekai), which was written and directed by then-19 year old Ryo Nakajima, this film seems like a bigger-budget film which simplifies complex problems in order to make the adults feel better.2. Kind of related to the first one: Battle Royale looked at the issue of young people 'misbehaving' with the underlying assumption that kids have a sense of humanity. In Confessions, however, everybody is essentially mean and cruel (apart from one girl). Having done my secondary education in an inner city school, having had friends that robbed people, burgled, took (and sold) drugs, etc..., I would say from personal experience that Battle Royale is a far more realistic representation of young people than Confessions.Overall then, the film is quite a superficial story, but given a sense of gravitas thanks to the amazing production values and cinematic techniques. But on closer inspection it's a fake: a silly thriller with nothing to say pretending to be more profound.To top it off, it was all too predictable. I never throughout the film felt any genuine surprise by the obvious twists and turns.",

            "review_title": "Nakashima's latest film is an absolutely stunning and dark drama that challenges the notions of morality",
            "content": "Nakashima's visually stunning \"Kokuhaku\" is a tour de force of emotionally charged drama and engrossing visuals. Its thought-provoking and often times controversial storyline will haunt one's senses and challenge your notions of morality.In fact the story's ambiguity is cleverly represented in its title \"Kokuhaku\" which in Japanese can be defined in two ways - not only to confess one's sins but also to confess one's love.The story inventively starts in the middle with pretty Middle School teacher, Moriguchi Yuko (wonderfully realized by J-Dorama favorite Matsu Takako) announcing to her homeroom class that she is retiring. Of course, her apathetic and unruly students snidely celebrate her departure with laughter and high-fives. Yuko proceeds to then tell the students of the reason of her departure. In flashback we see the devastating and tragic loss of her five-year old daughter Manami (cute Ashida Mana), who drowned in the school's pool one night. While authorities label the death as an accidental drowning, Yuko discovers to her shock a more sinister explanation. Her daughter was intentionally drowned by two of her own students - the emotionally troubled \"mama's boy\" Shiomura Naoki (Fujiwara Kaoru) and the emotionally distant yet intellectually gifted Murakawa Shinya (Amami Juri), whom she just calls \"Boy B\" and \"Boy A\" respectively. Knowing that the authorities will not take any serious action given the fact that the two are just 13 year old minors, Yuko nonchalantly explains that she has already taken her revenge on the two by tainting their lunch milk with a syringe containing blood from her ex-husband who has HIV (she is also HIV Positive). Thus begins the story proper which examines the shattered lives of these two students as well as the tragic aftermath of this \"confession\" and of the cruel horrors that transpire from it. Like \"Pandora's Box\" Yuko's revenge unleashes an evil more darker than she could have ever imagined.\"Kokuhaku\", based on the best selling 2008 Japanese novel of the same name by author Minato Kanae, is a blunt indignation of Japanese society and takes particular critical aim at its increasingly apathetic and narcissistic youth. Nakashima's screenplay drives this hard portrayal in by showing us that despite the unspeakable crime committed by the two students, the true evil lies in the resultant bullying and social ostracizing that results at the hands of their classmates. Despite all the information that has been distributed by the media on AIDS and how it is contracted, the ignorance and social stigma shown by the students is truly horrifying.\"Kokuhaku\" is not a standard revenge movie and Nakashima masterfully deviates from the norm by focusing not on Yuko's rage but rather on the \"monsters\" that Yuko holds responsible for her daughter's death. As the movie unfolds, I unexpectedly found myself actually pitying these two poor souls as they were more-or-less victims themselves of unfortunate childhood traumas. While it doesn't excuse them of their crime, it does go far at explaining their motives and forces audiences to feel sympathy towards their plight.The story's emotional impact is very much due to its extraordinary cast headed by the wonderful Matsu Takako (Long Vacation, Hero). I can understand now why Nakashima insisted on only having Matsu Takako portraying the part of the vengeful Yuko as she brings both a sense of tragic sadness and darkness to her role. Her quiet and understated portrayal is very effective (almost similar to Kaji Mieko's \"Jyoshu Sasori\" character) and if fact makes her character even more effective in a sense as it's almost like a slow, seething anger. Fujiwara Kaoru and Amami Juri are also quite good as the two juveniles. While Fujiwara tends to overplay his of part Naoki to the point of hysterics, Amami is the one who stands out as the intellectually brilliant Shin whose anti-social persona is just an affront to hide his need for his scientist mother's love and approval. Amami plays Shin as both a tragic and frightening character study. Hashimoto Ai is also great as Kitahara Mitsuki, Shin's only friend and kindred spirit who develops a compassion for the troubled youth and who foolishly believes that her love alone can change him. She is absolutely beautiful and is a definite star in the making. Kimura Yoshino is also wonderful as Naoki's devoted mother. Her performance is very unnerving and showed the unyielding love that her character had for her troubled son (a nice mirror to Matsu Takako's devotion to her character's daughter). Likable actor Okada Masami gives a good performance as the hopelessly optimistic and naive substitute teacher Yoshiteru Terada who attempts to reach out to both Naoki and Shin but whose general concern and good intentions soon become another destructive instrument in Yuko's revenge scheme. While only a small role Yamada Kinera's portrayal of Shin's estranged scientist mother was touching.The cinematography compliments of Nakashima regular Ato Masakazu and Ozawa Atsushi are breathtaking and beautiful. They add to the emotional impact of the story and are absolutely stunning. Even the gory bits were beautifully rendered and shot (which seems almost strangely ironic).\"Kokuhaku\" shatters the perpetual foreign stereotype of Japanese students as polite, docile, overly respectful and timid children and shows us that like in any other countries, some of today's youth have succumbed to the stresses of peer pressure, sense of self worth and purpose and have become selfish and disillusioned. The film is a cautionary tale of those dangers and also challenges the audience's notion and senses of morality. Are Yuko's a actions justified or has she become even more despicable, irresponsible and reckless as the students she holds response for her daughter's death? Does the ends really justify the means or does society really create its own monsters?",

Director Tetsuya Nakashima selects a lurid story and uses his surreal visual combination of innocence and violence, produces a distinctly stylized animesque film both disarmingly entertaining and questions the substantial capacity of vengeance and the social bottom line of the morality of human race. The film gives me goose bumps non-stop by its disclosure of the vicious revenge plan, more frightfully is the inner logics of the two murderers, as under-13 school kids, they mercilessly took the life of an innocuous girl's life for their particular reasons, which severely underlines the abnormalities lie in the family, the system and the society. How to dilute the appalling premise into an acceptable solution without having a sting in the tail, is the main obstruction in front of the director. Thankfully the film bracingly brakes before turning into a massacre hodgepodge. The cinematography here sufficiently takes advantage of one's imagination to take tons of MV-tagged shots to fabricate a meaningful yet unholy urban fable. Frankly speaking, the acting is semi-cartoonish, but Takato Matsu emancipates an astounding power from her deadpan-cum-ruthless performance as the mother/teacher seeks for a just retribution; on the contrary the juvenile cast is fitting but a little bit strained as the subject might be too formidable for them grasp as a whole. All in all, the film is uncompromising, novelty-ejaculated, meanwhile offers its viewers some contemplation on what happens today in the world, which not only apply to Japan, but also to the whole globe.",

            "content": "\"Confessions\" is a different, one-of-a-kind thriller. It has nothing to do with most of the movies that Japanese cinema is reputed for to the big public, and this is not necessarily a bad thing.It starts very strong, very powerfully; the first 30 minutes will keep you still in your seat, unable to look away for a second. They are, in fact, the finest part of the movie: sober, realistic but delirious at the same time, with a magnificent management of color, few scenery elements, and tempo, to make great impact on the viewer.Sadly, from that moment on, it all goes downhill. I suspect that many are tempted to ascribe their liking of this movie to the fact that it is certainly \"different\", sometimes downright weird, but I have to say that neither the story nor the whole of the movie stand a serious analysis. It starts as the story of a vengeance of a mother against the teenagers who killed it, and it also hints at social commentary of a certain age, a certain culture, a certain way to educate children, etc. However, the movie opts for the more commercial way by weaving a plot of great commercial value, lots of twists, and constant surprise, but with little substance. I have the impression that if this movie had been made in Hollywood and with a cast less capable, it would have been labeled as yet-another-brainless-product directed at angsty teenagers.The end, while quite enjoyable for its surprise and impact value, has little more to offer than that. I could not quite tell what point this movie was trying to make -several thoughts come to mind, but, in my opinion, none of the hinted messages, all of them very interesting and provoking, come to fruition.Add to that the -in my opinion, excessive and annoying- use of the ralenti and of commercial music (Radiohead...) which doesn't seem to serve any real motive other than appeal to the young audience.I enjoyed this movie for what it's worth, but, to me, it is just another thriller. Quirky, different from the usual lot, but just a thriller.My score is 6 / 10.",

            "content": "\"Confessions\" by director Tetsuya Nakashima is an effective socio thriller that won't leave any viewer unaffected. I give it that. But it is also a stone-cold, calculated movie without a heart. Its primitive morality is covered by an artsy fartsy coating which, sadly, makes critics believe that the movie had something profound to tell.The movie starts with a bang of an opening scene. A teacher tells her class of 7th graders about the value of life. Keeping the same calm tone throughout, she then tells them that her little daughter died; that she got in fact murdered by two students currently attending the class. She elaborates on how the two students will get away with their heinous deed because they are below the age of criminal responsibility. Before leaving, though, she reveals a nasty surprise for them: She has just infected the killers with the HIV virus. The film proceeds with showing from different perspectives what is going on in the kids minds and how the teacher's twisted revenge plan unfolds.It does so with demonstrative artistic style. Whereas the cold color scheme and the frequent shots of dark clouds may be reasonable gimmicks to create a dark atmosphere, there are also countless slow motion shots that seem to have no purpose other than make the film look artsy. The same goes for the odd choice of music and some scenes that are deliberately out of place, like one where the students almost perform a musical act.With its artsy style, \"Confessions\" apparently tries to mimic Chan-Wook Park's revenge trilogy, \"Oldboy\", \"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance\", and \"Sympathy for Lady Vengeance\". One could argue that those movies are also somewhat pretentious. But below the surface, their morality is complex. Park's revenge trilogy is about people who are basically good but who heap guilt upon themselves, and the revenge doesn't lead to redemption.Contrary to that, Nakashima's world is simplistic and strictly divided into good and evil. All the kids in \"Confessions\" are monsters devoid of empathy. Not just the killers but even their peers, who are obnoxious brats trying to give their teacher as hard as a time as possible. Even when the teacher tells them about the death of her little daughter they don't care. Only the fact that the killers are among them raises their interest, as that seems a welcome opportunity for bullying.So there is the message of \"Confessions\". All the kids are monsters, and the most psychopathic of them deserve to die. And then, I guess, the viewer is supposed to leave the theater with a feeling of satisfaction because the revenge unfolded so well. This ugly little package is all that \"Confessions\" has to offer below its aesthetic surface. I have to admit that the movie impressed me at first. But then I realized just how corrupt it is. I would take revenge movies of the \"Death Wish\" kind over \"Confessions\". Because at least those movies weren't as pretentious as this film that blinds the viewer with a shiny artistic surface to make them believe it was art.By the way: Hey, directors, leave them kids alone! They are alright. This should be obvious, but I've seen comments from people who now believe that Japanese kids really were like this. Quite stupid of those viewers, but also quite a questionable achievement of a movie.",

The process of giving us a bit of information set both before and after the events of the murder were quite engrossing to say the least.Considering the narrative is jumbled around quite a bit, as in the movie jumps back and forth in time revealing tiny pieces of information, there are times when the story is sort of difficult to follow. Remembering who said what and how other characters were affected by certain characters actions are at times difficult to follow. But that is not to say Confessions is bad, in fact, it's this type of storytelling that makes the movie tick while being simultaneously compelling. We may know who the murders are, but we don't quite know why they did it nor their fate now that they have been exposed. And it's these questions that get expanded on in great detail as the movie progresses to a wonderful climax. At times, the movie is a bit more improbable than it probably wants to be, but it sure makes for good storytelling. Eventually, all the pieces come together in the final act and we are now left with two very bizarre, ending scenarios.On a side note, what kind of school are they at where kids run rampant at all times? The entire class was so out of line, they showed no signs of respect, nor did there seem to be any type of repercussions for their actions. I have no idea how society works overseas but if it is anything like in this movie, their teachers should be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Seriously, everyone in the movie was either talking or texting while the teacher was talking or leaving the classroom at any given moment to go bully some other student. The amount of bullying in the movie is staggering (but I'm sure that's the point).Confessions is a very dark movie about revenge that works quite well because of how the director structures the story. It's both shocking and quite moving and fed to the audience in an unusual way that makes it worth watching. Because of this type of structure, Confessions has plenty of tricks up its sleeve and it works at keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.",

            "content": "What a completely diabolical story. I am one of the fortunate ones that do not have children. But, I wonder how close to reality this is, in it's fabulously dark and nasty portrayal of today's youth. This film portrays kids who are without hearts or souls, totally disconnected with anyone who is not within their age range, and completely lacking in empathy, compassion, and kindness, and possessing amazing degrees of cruelty, and a withering sense of narcissism and self absorption. The story is told from a point of view of different people who are somehow related to the murderers or the murder itself. I think it is quite an interesting way to tell a story. Seeing it through the eyes of different people gives us a little more perspective on how and why they are feeling that way. It is a story of a mother seeking revenge. Its makes us question humanity and the importance of preserving life. The ending is quite ambiguous, thus it leave the viewers to speculate how it really ended up. The story touches on heavy subjects such as bullying, peer pressure, absentee parenting, poor parenting, troubled youth, violence, and the devastating effect a lack of good role models can have on the kids of today.Children that are led astray by their guardians or their peers can do really frightening things. My guess that the writer/director wanted to show awareness of bullying. It is after all, a huge problem worldwide. This is the type of movie that will make you think twice about being a complete fool, and acting out in ridiculous ways.It starts with a stunning scene, where the teacher makes it known, that she is aware of the culprits amongst her class. These unruly, disrespectful kids, seemingly without a redeeming quality in their entire beings, are shaken up, and subjected to some of the kinds of verbal brutalization they inflict on others, without giving it a second thought. This is a really excellent film. Very well crafted, with great direction. It did not appear that it was a big production, but the effects were quite convincing, the acting was great, and the kids were scary as hell. Is this our future? Are we really in the hands of these souls? I am afraid.",

The (for a revenge thriller comparatively few) blood splashes are shown with a grotesque labortary-like curiosity while romantic scenes are presented with an old grainy analogue film look. Sometimes the somber atmosphere is even juxtaposed with a unique japanese comical eccentricity, making it feel like a dark comedy. Although I have to say that I thought the scene at the climax of the film was a bit too over-the-top with its effects, within the context of the overall dark but eccentric vibe it wasn't too disruptive.The entire cast shines with amazing performances. The soundtrack was also pretty interesting with some really noisy and distorted doom rock guitars adding onto that feeling of uneasiness and cruelness.Captivating till the very last second, Confessions is one of the best japanese films I have seen and a definitive recommendation to everyone who enjoys thrillers.",

It presents a cast of narcissistic sociopaths, casual child killers, and psychological torturers, so that initially we feel only revulsion- we want all of the characters to be punished. But as the plot unfolds, as we learn the back story and \"confession\" of each character, we realize that their narcissism actually derives from the basic narcissistic concept of \"family\" itself. We care about our children but not those of others, our parents but not the parents of others- our family is not to be judged by outsiders. Only *we* are allowed to judge and hate the members of our own family. The empathy these \"confessions\" engender for the characters in no way takes away from the horror of their murderous sociopathy. By explaining the genesis, the logic, of their sociopathy, the characters become more human- less monstrous- and in this respect they become even more terrifying. The film's poetic style is ingeniously contrapuntal: its use of flashback, foreshadowing, slow motion, and music is ethereal and poetic, and ironically functions to increase, rather than soften, the true horror of the story. I think this is a masterpiece- 10/10 for me.",

What she tells them is thrilling. \"My daughter died, police says it's because of an accident, but in fact she was killed by someone in this class.\" The class is to be very quiet, and the teacher's confession begins. I do like this kind of story. It makes me want to know the truth, and what happened to her daughter. What I don't like very much is that there are some grotesque scenes in it. For me it is acceptable, but I think there are some people who don't like these things. Also it's scary when I think of it I were one of the students.

This is far from the joy and fun of the director's earlier Kamikaze Girls, even if that too threw up plenty of awkward questions for a confused populous, indeed this appears almost to be a Sadean reverse. Nobody comes out of this well and the film that begins on the dark side just gets darker and bloodier as it progresses. There is an 's' at the end of the single world title and this means that the lengthy and seemingly authoritative, initial confession is but the first. Slightly confusing, here and there, wit similar looking girls and first names, nicknames and last names waved about but well worth your attention for a disturbing but enlightening look at the lot of schoolchildren and their parents in jolly Japan.

            "content": "As a fan of Japanese anime and films, I was expecting to get another quirky taste of Asian fiction molded into the form of a thriller. I was surprised therefore to find some kind of badly executed Hollywood exercise. The first disappointment came with the setting of the plot. A Japanese high school and all of the clich\u00e9s that come with it doesn't make for a very original or interesting backdrop to a murder story. The setting and genre remind of the anime 'Deathnote', which actually had a more believable following of events and cast of characters (which is saying something as it featured Death gods and a magic notebook).Looking past the setting and onto the characters things do not get any better. Three thirteen year old psychopaths who happen to be in the same form, manipulating and killing each other (and a toddler) off without remorse but still want their classmates and parents to love them just doesn't seem very likely. The teacher's controlled revenge is somewhat believable until she blows up an entire university to get back at one of her daughter's murderers. This brings me to the pacing of the story. Within the first hour most of the plot is revealed in a monotonous confession by the teacher which takes away most of the tension from the plot. By this time the storyline dissolves into various characters' perspectives of the events. I found it impossible to really feel for any of these people, no matter how sad their stories were, as you already hate all of them for killing the teachers' daughter, their own parents or some cats. The climax involves the teacher devising a scheme in which one of the murderers' mother gets back from her honeymoon just in time to accidentally be killed by her own son. Also the computer generated clock in the second to last scene displays a different time than is seen on the real thing. So \"Confessions\" certainly wasn't thrilling in any way nor was it very well executed. Did I at least get my fix of Japanese quirkiness, then? Well, no. The themes of existentialism and loneliness often present in Japanese cinema greatly appeal to me. The problem in Confessions lies in the people dealing with those issues; all of them are unconvincing psychopaths.",

The classroom is rowdy in ways that you wouldn't expect, setting an artistic tone for how much like a jungle growing up can feel, which was interesting to me. Here and throughout the film, I liked how it gave us some of the perspective of being this age and subject to peer pressure; there was the bullying, sure, but a lot of the time it was in the silent stares or online commentary. Director Tetsuya Nakashima also tells Kanae Minato's story in an engaging way, with a lot of visual flair.What I didn't like about it was maybe what others found appealing - to me, it's far too dark and depressing. There is quite a level of sadism on display here both from the \"boy genius\" and the teacher bent on revenge, and it's compounded by extra violence in the story lines involving his sidekick and love interest. Absolutely no one is likeable in this film. The result is to take away from any semblance of realism, and while the film tries to show us motivations for some of these actions via backstories, they felt pretty hollow.The film seems to be taking aim at lenient juvenile sentencing laws, bad parenting, and the online fame that comes from violent acts as the root causes to disturbed, dangerous youths, but all of these aspects felt heavy handed. If it had gone into more emotional depth or shown some compassion in at least some of these characters instead of serving up extra murders and darkness it could have been a fantastic film.

This movie is more of mental murdering than the physical.Asian movies are sometimes seem very weird, given their different culture and society. Different people have different levels of conscience. This movie shows how little remorse you can feel, after killing someone,and that too for no reason at all. It is not explainable. But, how much lower you can sink just to reach your silly objectives. This film shows the confessions of the main characters. It shows what is their psyche and how proud they are for the despicable things they did. More than regretting they want to brandish it.The thing that makes this dark is that the revenge taken by the main character is not the usual kind we see, but very vicious. It is very difficult for me too review this film. I can't find words to explain what you feel after you watch this film.

This post-modernistic thriller manages to land on the latter side and then some! However, its absurdity consequently increases its implausibility. A teacher confides in her class with regards to her daughter recently dying in an accident, convinced that some of her pupils actually murdered her. The narrative soon explores various confessions of characters involved in the mystery that rapidly creates a complex web of deceit and jealousy. An increasingly interesting plot structure that consistently shifts between these characters and possible motives. We view different perspectives from numerous relatable persons including teachers, students and mothers. All still relating to the thrilling plot. Nakashima bravely identifies the culprits early on after an outstanding twenty minute monologue that contains more tension than most Hollywood thrillers put together. He then proceeds to unravel the motivation behind the crime where psychological strands and moral compasses are heavily tested. Frequently shocking, forever engaging and incredibly stylistic. Yet, the second and third act are so overwrought and elaborate, in an attempt to neatly tie up the mystery, that the tension depreciated far too quickly. Its cold calculated exterior prevented any warmth to seep through, ultimately making it difficult to become invested in some of the characters. A few individuals though, the avenging Moriguchi and prodigy Shuya especially, are fleshed out and thematically portray the preciousness of life. The excessive utilisation of slow motion may seem derivative at first but surprisingly propels a stylistic purpose to the drama. Taking its time to fully render the inner darkness amongst these delinquents. I must confess, despite the several implausibilities, my admiration for the creative narrative and dark nature further cements my love for Japanese cinema.",

Its straight story telling with facts one after the other. There is no spoon feeding, the sort of dumbing down that we are so used to in Hollywood movies. I am so used to it that initially I found the story hard to understand. But the sheer beauty and passion of the people who made this movie pulls you in, and you start paying attention............The result - this movie is better than Memento! Its so rare to see a movie and feel, wow this movie was special...... wow this movie was different......... Confession does that! There is no English version, so we have to read subtitles, so you need to be into that, sorry........But I did find something interesting to make things easier, in some media players(eg. potplayer) you can move the subtitles up, so that its in the upper middle part of the screen, then we need not have to look down and keep missing parts of the video, we can read and see the movie at the same time. Try this idea, see if it works. In this movie we really need it, the talking is too fast. :-).........Cheers to you movie lovers. :-)...........",

The acting is good all round and it is atmospherically shot on DV. It seems to me however that the story overall is unconvincing. I believed in Mtsu's icy focus but could not believe that such a focus could be directed at 13-14 year olds. I could not believe in boy B's breakdown, nor in boy A's psychological state which seems to suggest a transparently simple origin leading in one easy step to master villainy. The elements of the plot seem to be there more to keep us guessing at an intellectual level rather than to get us to engage with the characters emotionally, in fact most of the telling of the tale seems to deliberately and uselessly disengage us, except perhaps for the input of one doomed teenage girl. Certainly an interesting film and worth a watch if you like POV stories (I do) but ultimately unsatisfying.",

            "content": "Based on a best seller novel that deals with a juvenile crime, Kokuhaku (Confession) written by Kanae Minato, the film version has been rolled out in 2010. Kokuhaku (Confession) - is \"A formal statement admitting that one is guilty of a crime\" according to a dictionary. In Japanese, a term of confession is often used for a declarer before someone wishes to start having a sweet relationship. In this movie, although this word is meant as the former and the story is created along with several confessions, these are somewhat like a declarer of love when they are telling about hidden past behind the crime, where may be caused by a lock of love or twisted love behind. The story is about a junior high-school teacher, Yuko Moriguchi played by Takako Matsu, whose daughter was murdered by students identified in a class. She confesses in her last class as a teacher that that 2 students (as Student A and B) killed her daughter at the swimming pool. She describes the story in details about how they killed her daughter and the murderers had not been punished due to the protection of the right of the minority as if she tells a novel or something to her students. But it's just a beginning of her revenge in order to teach how precious \"Life\" is as a teacher. The revenge toward the students are precise, calculated and cruel but this is somewhat understandable when you think of her previous little life been deprived - it must be a hatred. Even if this revenge makes the students' and others' relationship broken, her decision would be somehow acceptable. The bottom line of the story is underlined one of the controversial issues across the right of minority on crime, however, the scenes used many slow motions, hypothetical storyline, and confession by the students and his mother make the movie more stylish and pop.",

            "content": "The movie feels like \"All About Lily Chou-Chou\" (2001) meets \"Battle Royale\" (2000) and \"Oldboy\" (2003)I initially didn't really get the hype when I started watching it, but after finishing it and watching a second time, it's quite an unforgettable experience. It's quite tragic how one thing turns into another with a domino effect. It's sad but very true to reality how attention seeking cowardly criminals involve innocent victims to try to fulfill their empty void. It definitely stays with you. I would say it's definitely one of Japan's best films along with Battle Royale (Confessions' story is much deeper). I heard this film was similar to 2003 film Oldboy (incredible and one of my top favorite movies), so I decided to check it out; the similarity being that it's supposed to be a sweet revenge story. Actually even the editing cut from one similar action scene to another scene transition is used in both films. I wouldn't say this film is better than Oldboy. Personally, Oldboy was more engaging/mysterious from start to finish, but Confessions is psychologically also great in its on way with a right-back-at-you payback. Both films have brutal violent scenes. While Oldboy's curiosity is experiencing and wanting to know who the bad guy is just like the character is feeling, the movie Confessions straight out exposes who the bad guys are right from the start of the film; the movie's hook is finding out why the students did what they did and how the teacher is going to get her payback. The movie covers topics like bullying, vulnerability, puppet teacher, manipulations, parental trauma, the value of life...To be honest, the first time, it didn't really engage me from the start of the film, as I had a hard time getting into it because it felt more like a dream world/sequence with lots of student distractions going on while what felt like the teacher was just rambling on forever. However, when you watch the movie the second time, it makes a lot more sense and it's easier to follow. The entire movie image is stylistically shot as if it's a surreal dream/slow-mo music video, which can feel quite odd or distracting the first time around. I believe this style/surreal dream/feeling actually gives misdirection to the audience during the final scenes. (read spoiler if you've seen it) Great acting by the kids. Shunya fits perfectly as the troubled student. Ai Hashimoto is super cute.------------------------------- SPOILER ENDING: ------------------------------- When I first saw the film, I thought the explosion actually killed the mother. However, it seems to just be a point of view of the child's vision. It seems the teacher does not want to stoop to the child's level and physically harm anyone; just like she didn't actually put the HIV in the milk; she even mentions she had easily disarmed the bomb. (it's a bit slightly hard to assume she actually twisted/taped it back together and made it working again) Two things that bother me and maybe perhaps a plot hole, but the kid isn't too bright; first of all, he should make sure his bag/bomb is there before even making the speech (of course I know at the same time that would have less movie dramatic impact); second, he should call her bomb bluff again since the HIV milk was fake knowing he was HIV negative, especially since she said she disarmed it. ----------------------------------",

Because of it, this film is also based on some narrations by the characters. Therefore, we can watch this movie as if we read a novel.

The story from the original by Kanae Minato's bestseller novel that was a glorious achievement such as a bookshop grand prize at 2009. The story is composed of tensions which the confess by the person concerned sheds some light on the real facts of the case. Ms.Takako Matu acts the main character that is the teacher and she embodies the insane mother. The acting ability of the cast like her is the highlight of a film. Professor, Moriguchi, a homeroom teacher of a first-former, begins a talk quietly at the class after a closing ceremony in disorder \"my daughter was dead. The police judged an accidental death, but it is wrong, because she was killed by someone of this class member\", when she said it, a hush fell over the classroom in a split second and the story starts with the shocking confession. The main problem is that children do not distinguish between real and virtual reality in today's society. They want to be loved and approved. Everyone has such emotion, but children are more exhibit obvious desire than adult. Their parents and teacher can not deal effectively with a tense situation. They can not express it simply and accept it, so they distort own thinking and acting, as a result they make a big mistake that no amount of regret will mend matters. However, I do not think they have all obligations to it. I want you to watch this movie in expectation of the last scene and a film atmosphere directed by Nakajima.",

            "content": "The director, Tetsuya Nakashima, was unknown to me before this movie, so I didn't quite know what to expect. Reading the plot line will probably make you expect something entirely different, than what it really is. Especially if you are used to Korean revenge (or Hollywood for that matter) movies. It's not an action packed movie where a grieving mother goes on a killing spree ala Kill Bill (of course it isn't) or (what I expected) a movie where you watch a grieving mothers plan slowly coming to realization with a satisfying, justified execution of the antagonists at the end ala Sympathy for Mrs. Vengeance. This movie ends the story from the mothers perspective about 30 mins in, and this is where it gets interesting. You now get the history told by 4 other characters, the two \"killers\", one of the girls in the class, and one of the \"killers\" mom. First of, the cinematography is spectacular in this movie. The lighting is also really well done. The soundtrack fitted very well at some scenes, but it also became a bit corny at times. My main critique lies with the use of slow motion. For the first 10 - 15 minutes of this movie, the slow motion effect is constantly being used along with a very noticeable soundtrack. You normally only see this in scenes that is supposed to stand out from the other scenes, or be some kind of climax. The use of slow motion in this movie became a bit overcooked in my opinion. But now to the good stuff: The plot is great. You just need to get past the first 20 - 30 minutes, and you will become involved in the plot (in the beginning it's a bit hard to understand what is going on). The characters are also very interesting. There is 5 main characters whose story is being told individually in different segments. There is the teacher whose daughter recently got murdered, the \"genius\" that wants to be acknowledged for his skills, the unpopular dropout, the confused mother, and my favorite, the very perceiving and intriguing girl. The movie is very dark. As a frequent watcher of both Japanese and Korean cinema, I have seen my fair share of dark movies. But this is up there with the darkest ones. That does not mean that it's sulky. There is a lot of great comedic moments (altough they are dark as well), such as when the \"genius\" gets renowned for finding a way to uncensor porn (as some of you porn-watchers may know, porn is censored in Japan). There is some great and intelligent dialogue that I found very interesting. It does however also get emotional at some points, though avoiding getting corny (apart from the soundtrack at some particular scenes). All in all a very intelligent movie, with intriguing characters, interesting plot, great cinematography, mediocre soundtrack and sometimes overuse of the slow motion effect. Some people on IMDb also criticized scenes with overacting, such as scenes where a character burst into manic laughter. I don't quite agree with that. It was meant to seem \"overacted\" because the character (not the actor) did in fact not genuinely laugh. Overall I liked the movie a lot, and the good outweighs the few flaws that I think it had.",

            "content": "This is one of those days when the Sun never rises, as this film offers you a one-way ticket to abyss. Without promising any hope or joy, this also happens to be an excellent case study of the situation behind today's youth where undesirable behaviours such as violence are prominent. A disturbingly graceful depiction of the dark side of humanity in style and post- rock soundtrack (think Radiohead). This film is depressing and violent in theme, you have been warned.Confessions opens with an interesting chapter, where Matsu gives one of her last lectures in class about the essence of life as she gradually steered towards a sinister angle. Initially frustratingly rowdy as she begins amidst the din created by the students, it was difficult to actually catch on her lecture until the moment when she reveals some truth about her life. I was slowly able to focus on her conversation.This was when the students began to settle down in silence.In my opinion, this scene is one of the best re-enactment of real life as it made me feel like one of the students sitting there in class trying very hard to listen to her. This goes on for a good 20 to 30 minutes, but no, it is no dull monologue given her dreadful expression and petrifying aura towards the students that keeps you on edge with engaging visual narration.Just before this chapter of \"confession\" closes in awe, we learn that a couple of students in her class has ended her daughter's life. She refers to them as Student A and Student B, hinting a sense of irony in her tone and choice of words as she is desperately trying to show resentment within the boundaries of education.The rest of the film degenerates and carries a strong tone of angst, sorrow, hatred, and cruel insanity.And there's no turning back.Tetsuya Nakashima's shocking thriller is definitely relentless in dragging its audience to Hell for open house orientation, revealing the potential dark side to all of us, especially during puberty where one's direction in life is extremely volatile. With a dark blue and gray palette smeared across the screen for most of the part, everything feels cold and bleak.We begin to learn how hatred begets hatred, and the possibilities of an endless vicious cycle.Upon venturing on to the subsequent confession chapters of Student A and B and a few others, we begin to realise something. While being lenient to and accommodative of the youth generation in order to ensure that they always earn a second chance to redeem themselves despite their rash teenage wrongdoings, the kids seem to be exploiting this value in society to do as they fancy.They have every reason to retaliate against every loving adult in their lives, including raging hormones.They have got issues, of course. Who will choose to be such rebellious ingrates when everything is going well for them in life? However the society and its system do not cater for their issues, they merely accommodate the consequences. As a result, the teenagers hold no regards for the society and moral values that should be well-defined within them. They exploit the legal system that relieves a minor of criminal contempt even when he or she commits grave crimes.Is this the so-called teenage revolt?Without remorse, they seek to commit one after another. The juveniles just don't learn anything at all after countless guidance by the adults in their lives. All they care about is themselves and constantly seek self-gratification (it's mentioned in the film that all they desire for is to be praised and recognised). Are they domestic pets to the adults, or what?This gets on my nerves.In the final ambitious revelation when Matsu's brilliantly devised plan of revenge unfold itself in highly stylised fashion via deliberate slow-motion sequences (that seems to glorify all the sick traits in grace) and incoherent nightmarish montage edits, we also learn one more lesson from Nakashima.Responsibilities may be shirked, but consequences have to be beared.That includes the minors as well, the future rulers of our world.",

I recommend that anyone who wants to become a teacher should watch it once because it makes us think about what education is.

You will definitely be attracted by the performance of the heroine, Takako Matsu, who is one of the most famous Japanese actresses. If you are Japanese students, please watch it.

Gradually, she draws the attention of her class when she declares that she is resigning the same day and further confesses that her 3 year old daughter who died, a few months ago, by drowning in the school swimming pool did not die by accident. The class is stunned by the time she declares that she now knows that two of the students in the class (referred by her as A & B) were indeed responsible for the death. She also expresses her anguish that she cannot register a complaint with the authorities because the law does not hold anyone below 14 as responsible for their actions and accordingly, cannot be punished for whatever they do. However, she states that, irrespective of the law, she is determined to punish the culprits.\nThus begins this psycho thriller wherein the teacher adopts a twisted way to avenge her daughter. The events surrounding the death and the teacher's punishment unfold through a series of confessions of the students who recount the happenings. The narrative style may remind us of Rashomon which also used multiple accounts to reconstruct a set of events. However, unlike Rashomon where each account narrated a different version of the events, here it is a singular version which is narrated from the perspectives of the individual confessor.\nAlthough the movie succeeds as an effective thriller, one does not particularly feel much for any of the characters. The characters appear to be emotionally bereft and also guilty of harbouring dark motives (not that dark/grey characters can never evoke feelings). This movie was Japan's entry for 2010 Academy Awards and was also shortlisted a final nominee. The entire movie is picturised in a sombre tone though a scene towards the end where an explosion is captured in reverse slo-mo stood out for its magnificence.",

But still ... being so extreme (and quite surreal) serves the in bold letters written message quite well: Be nice to people, they are a very fragile bunch. Great film! For me a masterpiece as well. I highly recommend it!Additional thoughts: From the recent two decades there are many dark Japanese films and animes, which focus on egomania and psychopathy in context with society. Many of them fairly mainstream ones. It seems many people started to feel the downsides of a tightly organized and packed society only after the economy crashed in the 90's. Stress, anxiety and especially the inevitable need to keep silent helped brewing a state of panic and purposelessness in them.The reason why all these novels, mangas, art exhibits, animes and films etc pop up is probably simply nature. Trying to reverse certain developments, pointing out large areas of society which needs healing. One thing \"Confessions\" certainly underlines is the need for reliable moral guidance when human beings are small, vulnerable and quite irritable. In a nutshell: the need for love.",

            "content": "If you appreciate cinematography and a plot with lots of twists then this is a move you will enjoy. The acting is good. The characters are contrasting and therefore interesting. It's quite a dark movie, definitely not something to watch if you want to be uplifted. Some of the scenes are quite brutal and sadistic. This lack of respect towards others and inflicting pain on others without remorse seems to be a common theme in Japanese movies. I think this kind of fits with the Japanese stereotype of being cruel (particularly with their World War 2 shenanigans that we often see in movies).One of my favourite Japanese movies 'Battle Royal' springs to mind. Despite being a different genre and leaning towards comedy/action, we see school children savagely ready to take each other out while the teacher tries to teach them a lesson on the values of life.The main message here is about revenge. And revenge is sweet..... :)",

            "content": "\"Confessions\" is a conscientious work of reasoning. The murderers are absurd, but there are social causes. The Avengers are cold, but they are meant to be alert. There are not many characters in the story, but the pattern is huge. There are a lot of paragraphs and angles, but the narrative efficiency is very high. Compared with many stories that emphasize murderous tricks and tricks, this is a good story that really pays attention to reality and is not out of the ordinary. From the clergyman to the preacher, Moriguchi never simply understood the goodwill. In her bleak heart, the world is like the classroom in the movie, with a deep blue lead color. So in this small world like a blackboard, she began to tell the truth.I personally feel that the original novel of \"Confessions\" is more popular than \"Suspect X's Devotion\". The point is not that it is a reasoning novel, but that it chose this extreme genre of all-first-person genre, and the author's strong control power between sensibility and reason. In the book, you can clearly see the results of each person's view of the problem from their own perspective through the first-person confession of each person. This is the strongest true, non-lie interview record.What is the problem with the campus? The campus described by Minato Jiamiao is not a hell of living sacrifices. It is more like an embarrassing distribution center where everyone is going to the wrong door. Everyone is trying their best to communicate to get rid of the infinite embarrassment and loneliness. This is the essence of the campus. Terrible.Nakajima Tetsu is also the best director of the visual department in contemporary Japan. The so pretentious picture styles of \"The Story of the Next Wife\" and \"Life of Matsuzuki's Disgust\" were expressed smoothly and reasonably. In the movie version of \"The Confession\", it took a lot of thought to reduce the use of color, emphasize the contrast between light and dark, and carefully narrate. It can be called Nakajima's most converging movie to date.The most difficult part of adapting \"Confessions\" is that the novel uses the first person and the narrative is compact. This true power attracts readers to read. Ordinary copying is not impossible, but it is impossible to reproduce this one-way chatter, and it is easy to change into a particularly boring horror movie. Nakajima 's approach is to use vision to manage, and it does not rule out some of the external scenes (such as the opening of a bullying scene on the roof) that are very technical and lively, and the amount of shots is huge. , But the amount of information is just right, just to meet the need to eat for the first time.On the other hand, the greatest advantage of the novel is that it brings campus issues out of the campus. It does not use the contradiction between students and teachers or the education system to make simple and rough judgments, but directly confronts complex personal situations. This became the guiding ideology of the entire movie, and it did a good job of learning and using it. The director only used some highly visual scenes to express the atmosphere of the campus itself, while others paid attention to the complete performance of the plot, which is a good habit of Nakajima.The explosion at the end of the movie is undoubtedly the culmination of the climax. The sparkling fragments fall like raindrops. This is a bright firework for Moriguchi, but it is an elegy for Xiuzai despair.",

If this is what Japanese teenagers are like then they deserve to be bullied and murdered. The only redeeming thing about the whole film is some good music, but even that is now ruined for life as I'll permanently associate it with this god awful film. Chances are you'll watch it anyway, but at least now you won't be left feeling like every single person reviewing it here must be insane.

This movie needs to be watched until the end, NOT half way so that the secrets and twists are revealed. Each person has their own confession, and everyone is in despair. It is like a combination of sad stories of lost souls. I feel sorry for them rather than only blaming them for their action. They all have experienced the feeling of losing what is precious to them, and the students long for being recognised. If you only accuse them, you sure are ignorant people. It is not merely for entertaining, it sparks the real problems in Japan, such as school bullying. If you only like funny and simple story plot movies, don't bother with this one.

Our opinion on the characters shift from love to hate every minute and even at the end, we're not exactly sure what to think of them and their actions, and it leaves you empty.The direction of the movie is astonishing. It is not the gift-wrapped-easy-to-watch movie we see everyday. It feels as if the movie was filmed from point A to Z in slow-motion and it sets a pace I've never truly seen before. It was refreshing and gutsy, yet incredibly good. Not only it is refreshing, it also is delightful to watch (special effects are great). The music helps build this pace perfectly and we \"really\" feel like we're watching a thriller all along.

And for people who don't like to watch international movies but was recommended to watch this one, you will be positively surprised! Throwing a glance on the cover might seem less interesting. You will see the face of a woman and something reflected in her eyes. The story starts off in a middle school classroom. It's lunch time and all the students are being loud and silly while the teachers tell them that it was her last day of teaching. She didn't mind it though and starts explaining about the relationship between teachers and students. Followed by a story about her personal life and eventually stating that her daughter was killed by one of her students. If you see the first part of it, you might think that this is some sort of a crime genre, where she will uncover the killer step by step. You'd be surprise that it's much more than that. This story goes on with a couple confessions. As one of the confession ends, another confession by another person will proceed. Eventually all pieces and confessions turned to be one whole piece and solves all questions that the viewer had all along the movie.It is cast from different angels. Not only is it a twisted story, that keeps you interested, but all the shots are made beautifully and a little eerie as well. The movie is kept in a gray tone, and only certain objects stands out with its color. It is more serious and not like most of the Asian drama, which are exaggerated and teeny in their behavior and production. \u0084Confessions\" is not a Hollywood production, which is identifiable by the feature of the production, and made for thriller-fans. The story reflects Japanese students mentality towards family and society, mixed with a little sickness and suspense. Since the movie last over two hours, you should take some time for watching it. These two hours will pass by faster than you'll realize. Once you have watched this movie, you will never forget it.

The first thing that I noticed is the way this movie is shot and directed. Rather a dark tone with dark colors using mostly wide and long shots. ( Kinda like Sin City where the blood stands out). Interesting how they almost never show sunlight which reminded me a little of \"The Machinist\" too. Now props to some of the actors, but at times they tend to overact certain scenes which is totally unnecessary. Another thing that bothered me was the dialogue/conversations between some of the characters. It just felt unnatural. Almost NOBODY talked like that in real life. And the way some people behaved in the movie was just out of this earth. Now, I don't want to say that the movie felt pretentious at times...but man...did it force those slow-motion shots at us. At times it worked...and at other scenes not. But where \"Confession\" gets most of the points is its story! Man...once it kicks in...you can't stop but asking yourself how its going to turn out. Most of the time it keeps you on the edge of the seat, especially the last 20 minutes of the movie which were amazing! It might be predictable at the beginning since I'v watched it with a friend and he saw some things coming which I didn't but it didn't bother any of us. The music also adds a certain atmosphere and vibe to the movie that kept screwing with my emotions and brain. Some scenes I didn't know how to feel about since it had taken a really different approach. But one thing is sure...this movie is not afraid to show THINGS !All in all a really spectacular psychological mystery-thriller film that is in my opinion a little slower then most in its genre but worth watching...and a MUST watch for mystery fans.
