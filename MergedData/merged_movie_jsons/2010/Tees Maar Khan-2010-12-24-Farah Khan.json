            "review_title": "I Feel Cheated",
            "content": "There are different expressions and feelings one has when he comes out of a theater after watching a film. At times I am thinking, at times smiling, at times in awe of what I just saw and at times thanking myself for not being one of the characters. When I came out of the houseful theater on the first day second show of Tees Maar Khan (TMK), the only emotion I had was anger. Sheer anger. I felt cheated and betrayed and disappointed. This is going to be the worst review I will ever write for a movie.Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om did not go too well with me either and I am not too agreed with the Farah Khan way of filmmaking but TMK still managed to shock me. Farah is a fantastic choreographer but as a director, she just killed a cine-goer inside me. The best thing about this two and a half hour was the promo of 'No One Killed Jessica'. I am so looking forward to that.Apparently an official remake of After the Fox, TMK is a story (if it can be called a story) of a con artist pretending to be a film director to put his hands on 10 tons of precious antiques. During this process you come across Three Gay partners of TMK: I don't know why they act gay but they do. Probably it was supposed to be funny. Two Gay cops chasing TMK: they don't act gay; they are gays and they even hint at marrying each other. Three Gay villagers: they become friends with Katrina Kaif and she calls them girls. Twin Criminal brothers: and they are not just twins, they are conjoined twins. Not to forget, they wear gay clothes and act gay too.With all this overdose of gay jokes, there are idiotic police officers trying to nail TMK down and they crack unbelievably horrible jokes. There is TMK's mother who is slightly better than the rest when it comes to being funny. The film starts with a lousy animated title song of a baby in the mother's womb and he has his eye brow pierced even then. In the time when special effects have gone to a new level, TMK brings a basic animation which makes you wonder where the film is headed to.Songs come out of nowhere and are forcefully fitted in to the scenes. The overly hyped Sheila comes and goes in the first fifteen minutes. A scene finishes and TMK decides to call his friend Salman Khan of Dabangg for a song and dance. Are you serious? The choreography, however, is good. 'Wallah Re Wallah' and 'Bade Dil Wala' were enjoyable.The film has Akshay Khanna as Aatish Kapoor in the worst possible supporting actor role. He plays a film actor who wants to win Oscar just like Anil Kapoor did for Slumdog. Interestingly, Anil never won an Oscar for that film. Aatish also comes up with his own version of Jai Ho called 'Day Ho'. Yes, Day as in DAY TIME. He thinks it's funny and dances on this song with great zeal. He is probably mocking Saif Ali Khan because he is also seen in a Saif like bandana.Katrina Kaif has lost a lot of weight and looks good with her navel show throughout the film. She is one actress who follows the director's brief to the tee because she knows she is not talented enough to improvise. Here too, she seems to be following the director's brief and overacts as much as possible. Actually, she overacts more than it's humanly possible for any actress.Actress, I said, because Akshay Kumar is also there. What was he thinking? I have no idea. To start with, 50% of the times he also acts gay and delivers his dialog with lady-like hand movement and voice. Mostly when he is playing the movie director. It seems to be deliberate a take on Karan Johar though. Here is an actor who was touching the pinnacle of his career a year back with highest grossing and enjoyable films but since Singh is King he has come up with one dud after another.The less said about Farah the better it is. My main culprit, however, is Shirish Kunder. Mr. Kunder is trying to pull up a one-man-show here. He is the writer, editor, lyricist and even the producer of TMK. As an editor, he has a credible history but as a writer his previous work is 'Jaan-e-man' which he also directed. That Akshay starrer was also a pretty lousy show. I would strongly suggest Mr. Kunder to remain in his limits i.e. editing.TMK is likely to have a 50 crore opening weekend which has so far been achieved only by Dabangg. It will be a shame if it grosses more than Dabangg did because Dabangg was a very highly entertaining effort. TMK will for sure recover its cost and make profits for the producers (which is unfair) but I don't expect it to do well with audience in the second week onwards.I go to the cinema with the expectations to at least get value for my money and time. In that regard, TEES MAAR KHAN is not a movie. It's a CRIME and the people behind it need to be punished in such a way that it becomes example for others attempting to create such a shame.",

Akshay Kumar's brand of comedy seems completely out of sync with Farah's brand of humor and the result is a disaster only made tolerable if you are salivating over Katrina Kaif grooving to 'Sheila Ki Jawani' or seeing Akshay and Salman dance together. The script is pretty nonsensical and a stretch even by outrageous plot standards (a conman making a fake movie and convincing a big Bollywood star that it will win an Oscar? Seriously, give me a break!!) and the jokes are pretty weak all through. Tees Maar Khan, for lack of a worser word, is utter trash!",

Apart from Akshay Kumar nothing is this movie is good. Some of his cheeky dialogues will make you laugh but again its not worth to watch the movie.Movie has copied several scenes from various movies and Farah has tried to put all Masala in the movie for which she is famous for. But unfortunately story don't have the weight to carry this movie. Senseless jokes are not going to make a movie entertaining.Don't watch the movie. That's my verdict. Forget about previous movies of Farah Khan, they were good because of SRK and the direction tips she were getting from Karan Johar. This movie seems good only during the songs.Worst movie of 2010.",

            "review_title": "Inane and Pedestrian!",
            "content": "TEES MAAR KHAN Bollywood is replete with examples of fetishes of film makers who closely associate these fetishes with the success of their films. The earliest example is that of film maker J Omprakash who always wanted his movie titles to begin with A; and in recent times we have the example of Karan Johar, who has a similar fetish with the letter K. Farah Khan, who began her career as a choreographer and quickly moved into the shoes of another Khan choreographer (Saroj Khan) quickly won a lot of acclaim for her work and then decided to expand her role to include film direction. Having got the box-office ringing with her first two ventures, MAIN HOON NA and OM SHANTI OM (both of which had Shah Rukh Khan playing the lead), she perhaps concluded that since both the films had three words, three is a lucky number for her. So soon after the success of the first two movies, she gave birth to triplets and her husband, an electronics engineer, Shirish Kunder and she floated a production house called Three's Company! She also perhaps knew that the presence of Shah Rukh Khan in the first two movies was a big factor for the success of those movies, but because she was not having him in her next movie (I will not go into the reasons for that here), she felt that the word KHAN appearing in the title would help. When she was finding it difficult to combine the word KHAN with her fetish for \"TEEN\" to get the title of her new movie, I presume a well-wisher perhaps told her that using a multiplication factor of ten would triple the chances of the movie's success; thus the word \"TEES\" came into the title. The choice of the third word was relatively easy, since the phrase TEES MAAR KHAN connoted a braggart and which was in tune with the character of the script itself. The next exercise was to find an inspiration for this tale and happily for her, that was also a three worded Peter Sellers starrer: AFTER THE FOX. Also, perhaps other well wishers suggested to her that she must have as many Ks as was possible in the film crew and therefore had her husband Kunder work for the background music, write(?) the story, co-produce and write some of the lyrics. The star cast also had a number of Ks: AKshay Kumar, AKshaye Khanna, Katrina Kaif, Sachin KhedeKar and special artistes like Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor! Now about the movie itself. Claiming to be a parody, it turns out to be a rather inane effort. Several scenes of the movie looked utterly pedestrian both in conception and execution and the only saving grace is the performance of Akshaye Khanna in the role of an Oscar hungry actor. Of course, the review will not be complete without the mention of the much touted Sheela Ki Jawaani number by Katrina Kaif; but Katrina with her innocent looks doesn't ooze with oomph despite the raunchy lyrics and the dance movements. I would rate Munni Badnaam from Dabangg (also choreographed by Farah) as a better song although the joke which I heard when I was coming out from the theatre was: Agar Sheela Ki Jawaani Pehle Aati, to Munni Badnaam Na Hoti!",

Then I heard that SRK and Farah Khan had fallen out with each other and that Akshay Kumar was in along with Katrina Keif.Written by Farah Khan's husband, Shirish Kunder, the theme of the movie is based on an old Peter Sellers movie, \"After the Fox.\" A thief gets his chance to plan to rob a train and he does this by hiring a actor and a movie shoot in a village nearby.Starring Akshay Kumar, Katrina Keif, Anil Kapoor, Akshaye Khanna and Arya Babbar, the movie is directed by Farah Khan, written and Produced by Shrish Kunder and Ronnie Screwala. Vishal Shekhar provide the music score.Farah Khan has had a previous \"flop\" on her hands - \"Janemaan,\" though it was not directed by her but by Shirish Kunder. That movie did not star Shah Rukh Khan either but the other two, \"Mein Hoon Na\" and \"Om Shanti Om\" did and proved to be successful for her, though the latter did have some problems.Katrina Keif, though has lost a lot of weight and ensured that her style of dancing could be compared that of Malaika Arora Khan in \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" compared to \"Munni Badnaam Hui.\" Serious roles, such as the one in \"New York,\" suit her better then the one she plays in this one.Akshay Kumar, perhaps needs to consider doing serious roles than this. Certain types of comic roles do suit him and he does execute them very well. But unfortunately, this cannot be said here.The music! Well the only thing that can be said is that at least one song - \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" is a memorable number, though it has come under a lot of criticism since the release of the movie. One other member of the industry that Farah Khan had always had but didn't this time was the music director, Anu Malik.The plot fails to lift off, the comic lines and the dialogues could have been written well and its with this that I conclude that this was a movie that was riddled with disaster from the moment it was announced.",

            "content": "Watching Tees Maar Khan was an underwhelming experience. I went in to this movie with mixed expectations. I had high expectations based on Farah Khan's previous efforts - \"Main Hoon Naa\" and \"Om Shanti Om\". At the same time I was not fascinated with Shirish Kunder's \"Jaan-E-Mann\".Tees Maar Khan sets a new low in story telling, narration, poorly conceived characters, direction....the list goes on. The movie revolves around Akshay Kumar playing the title role of a conman who steals antiques by tricking the police. While this seems like enough meat for the story to make a 2-hour movie, however watching the movie proved otherwise. To start with there are not enough sub-plots or situations that highlight the mastery of a con-artist. Perfect example of a movie that highlights this need is \"Catch me if you can\", where there are multiple sub-plots that highlight the skill of the con-artist. There are not enough twists and turns in the story to keep the viewer interested. In general the narrative does not stick to a focused plot; there are miscellaneous gags, unwanted songs, meaningless sub-plots which only add to the misery of the viewer. All the above can be ignored if this is a movie that is not to be taken seriously. There are examples of movies that thrive on frivolity where twisted humor takes center stage and captures attention of the viewer (Austin Powers, Main Hoon Naa are good examples). But this movie is not funny either. There are a few good one liners and hysterical situations that do tickle the funny bone. But even more irritating are the umpteen attempts in the guise of painful dialogues and gags that are intended for humor, but do not really evoke laughter. Trying to laugh at some of the sequences in this movie is like an aborted sneeze which I want to get out of my system, but cannot.To exacerbate this pathetic movie, there are half baked, loosely defined characters that are acted out by clueless actors. Akshay Kumar tries hard, but has very few opportunities to excel. Akshaye Khanna actually does a good job of playing the role of a self-adulating actor who is obsessed with the idea of winning an Oscar award. But his character is too one dimensional to keep the viewers interested. Katrina Kaif gets the award for playing the role with maximum screen time with minimal relevance to the movie.To summarize.... save your self the time and money this holiday season by giving this movie a skip.",

            "content": "TEES MAAR KHANEntertainment is a tricky affair. On one hand, film makers present their conviction in an idea or story that can be moving or heart warming whereas some choose the shorter path to success by giving the audience a mindless mess of comedy that can only be short-lived. Careers have been established with the former ideology but disaster has struck when in the name of entertainment, what was served to audiences was a garbage truck full of forced humour, mindless plots, overacting and trashy dialogues. That has happened far too often lately. In retrospect, 'Main Hoon Na' was at least sincere with its story and performances. The actors, music and comedy combined to produce a refreshing entertainer. 'Om Shanti Om', at least the first half, was funny, musical and refreshing as well. However, while riding on the success and fame of two somewhat convincing successes, one does not gain the right to take the audience on a ride. Farah Khan has done just that and brought the audience down to her own level with 'Tees Maar Khan'. A supposed con-artist named 'Tees Maar Khan', along with his aides \u2013 Dollar, Soda & Burger is out to execute their greatest job so far: Looting the royal treasure from a running train with the help of villagers who have been beguiled into believing that it's all part of a movie being filmed. Get the point? Right from the beginning, nothing seems convincing at all. Akshay Kumar lauding his character with a multitude of dialogues indicating that 'capturing him is pointless' has no effect. DON says something similar but with lasting effect. It's because of something called 'direction' which is missing from this movie. The greatest Con- artist who fools Indian Police and the Interpol is so unconvincing that one would wish he would take up another job. Akshay Kumar overacts his way through a character that has no life, background or foreground. Numerous flops in the last 2 years still has him playing the repetitive roles in brainless flicks. Hopefully, 'Patiala House' can change things for him. Akshaye Khanna. What can one say for him. The Oscar hungry character of Atish Kapoor is funny at first but when he hams through every incoherent scene, it becomes an overkill of the once wonderful actor from 'Dil Chahta Hai' who was unforgettable as Sid. Some of the supporting cast that includes Arya Babbar, Sachin Khedekar, Murali Sharma and Apara Mehta have done better justice to their roles than even the lead actors. The only reason why people will knowingly spend money on this movie is because they were lured by Sheila Ki Jawani. That song is worthy of its hype. Rather, Katrina Kaif is worthy of her position in Bollywood right now. Her moves, classy attitude and to-die-for looks in the 'item number' will thoroughly entertain and Farah Khan has done her primary job of choreography quite well. We only wish for Katrina's versatility to be challenged as she was in 'Raajneeti'. Vishal & Shekhar will only ride on the success of Sheila and nothing else. Compared to Farah's previous two, this film's score is a dud. Even Salman Khan's cameo cannot save the mediocrity of Wallah re Wallah. The editor in the film must surely be the security guy outside Dhuliya bank since he was asleep all the time. The dialogue writer churned out only a handful of witty one liners before they too were lost in between the hamming, overacting, repetition and senseless situations. The key to successful comedies of late, has been in dialogues as one cannot really create funny scenes without a screenplay in existence. Cinematography was very average and this film lacks the big budget feel if at all it had one. In case it did, UTV will have to rethink Farah Khan's calibre as a director they can invest in. Farah Khan literally showcases her stupidity on multiple occasions. Take the airplane scene for instance where it all seems so over-the-top. The prolonging of the train's arrival in Dhuliya prepares you for the worst. The headless horse rider sequence was among the most incoherent of all, while the in-film director Tees Maar Khan's clueless behavior on the film's set must be an enactment of Farah Khan in reality. Finally when the train is stopped and the heist ensues, it all seems tragic as there was nothing funny, glorious or memorable about the basic premise of the 3 hour ordeal. The actors too, look weary of the proceedings in the end and one cannot help but dread Farah's intention of making a sequel to this time-wasting garbage of nonsense. 5.23 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Ever since Dabangg rocked the screens, Bollywood has been racing to come up with the next pure Masala entertainer. Tees Maar Khan promised all this and then some. Alas, the wait just got longer...Before I start on TMK, let me assure you I am a big mas ala movie freak \u2013 Wanted, Dabangg, Houseful, Singh is King, you name it I loved them all. Gosh I even liked Chandni Chowk to China! And didn't have too many problems with No Problem either... Tees Maar Khan however is not half as good as even the last two films mentioned. Which is why unabashedly promoting this film by linking it with Dabangg records makes me sad. And angry. More so, as it comes from a director whose last two films (Om Shanti Om and Main Hoon Na) were superb.The problem with Tees Maar Khan is... well, everything! Let me start with the storyline. A master thief who is smarter than everyone get his life's biggest challenge, of robbing a moving train. Not just some small treasure, but the whole train. So he makes a plan by getting a movie star and charading a movie shoot at a village next to the railway line, so that the villagers will stop the train and provide the manpower to take away the loot. Original? Well so it would seem in case you haven't watched the 1966 Peter Sellers' After The Fox. Which, by the way, was among Sellers' forgettable ventures, and is not even pure Hollywood \u2013 rather an Italian film. Anyways, our film makers picked up this DVD one fine day and decided to Bollywoodize it, with some item numbers and a mas ala touch. Could have been a cracker, but for that you need a great screenplay and rock solid direction, both of which are sorely missing out here. While watching the film, it seems the director went directly from the basic story-script to the dialogue writer asking for some memorable witty punchlines . You see, we're making a mas ala movie here, and Wanted worked, maybe only because of the dialogues... or is it? So \"Ek Bar Maine commitment kar Di...\" becomes something like \"Tees Maar Khan Ki Zabaan aur...\" uff whatever! Then there is the heavily promoted line of \"Tawaif Ki Lut ti Izzat Bachana aur Tees Maar Khan Ko Pakadna...\" which could really have been a nice memorable line. If only it did not come every 5 minutes in the movie. Now for the acting part. Or whatever passes for it. If you thought SRK hams, wait till you see Akki in this one. It is so over the top that a few minutes into the film you feel whether Farah Khan directed the movie, or was she busy tending to her triplets at home. Never expected Katrina to 'act' so it is not a let down at all. But Akshaye Khanna was fine. Not a great performance, which we expect of him, but given everyone else around this definitely deserved an Oscar!!! ;-) However, both he and Kat do not have much footage, and neither do the others. Why not? Read on...Okay so whats good? Need I tell anyone that Shiela Ki Jawani is one cool item song? Or that Wallah re Wallah has Salman dancing in pure Munni Badnaam Hui style. But what is even better is that if you are going to the theatre for these two, then you might as well come out in the first 45 minutes, once these songs are over. Yes, the director does not make us wait too long. And do watch out for the Sallu-Kat chemistry in the second song. Another saving grace is the editing. The poor screenplay and pathetic performances largely are subdued by crisp and fast editing which make you not realise the absurd crap you're watching. At least not till the last half hour of the movie when the editor probably fell asleep. Cant blame him, except for the fact that this guy is also credited with the story and screenplay too (Yeah they probably didn't realise too many people would have seen a 1966 Italian film dubbed into English) Considering the film is barely above 2 hours, cut out another half hour of songs, credits, etc you are left with an hour of complete nonsense partly saved by the editor. Although this chopping off large portions of footage probably consisted of everyone in the cast except for Akki's scene. Which mean unbridled loud acting \u2013 even by his standards. The inspiration of keeping the film short probably came from Dabangg. Good thought, but crisp editing is like a Tadka. Out here the Daal is missing. And rotten.",

The so called gags are not funny at all. There is oodles of overacting by all actors and full use of clich\u00e9s. Having seen Main Hoon Na and OMO, I know that Farah Khan likes to make brainless masala movies, but TMK is beyond brainless. The entourage of Burger etc. that follow Akshay Kumar, the stuck to each other brothers who speak at the same time, the gay CBI officers - it is NOT funny.What does one want from TMK - slapstick comedy - None ; humor - NONE ; great acting - NONE. I don't think Akshae Khanna will take much time to pull out his newly weaved hair when he sees this movie in a multiplex.Watch this movie only for 2 reasons: 1. You want to compare it with the worst movie you have ever seen 2. To watch Shiela ki Jawani on a big screen",

            "content": "Don't worry I don't intend to dish out spoilers, giving away the synopsis or plot or even a hint on the story line. The movie opens with Sanjay Dutt narrating the hind sight into the protagonist's current state of affairs. I was wondering why Sanjay Dutt's voice was chosen, my roommate was kind enough to educate me on this choice. To start with Sanjay Dutt's voice is kind of synonymous with the comical negative character (read gangster, thief ...), attributed to the fame of Munna of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The start to the movie though does not leave a bad taste in the mouth, is not what a comedy flick should begin with.The movie lacks a theme or story line that would inherently support the intended comedy. For most part of the movie it seemed that the actors are trying in desperation to make the audience laugh. For example, a meeting of top cops of Mumbai chaired by the commissioner discusses the possibility (or a lack) of ancient treasures getting stolen. Gibberish is introduced in the form of a participant interrupting the speaker every few seconds. These puns cry for a few laughs at best, and in time become annoying.Akshay Kumar seems to have made a resolve to sink deeper with every new comedy flick; TMK adds value to that resolve. With such frivolous plot, the burden of carrying the movie rested solely on the shoulders of the actors, and they have done a fine job of letting that slip. Katrina Kaif with little or no role in the plot was intentionally brought in for her dancing prowess. I would suggest she take more dance classes before venturing this path again. Moving on to Akshaye Kanna, I'm not sure as to the link between his role and comical intent of the movie. His claim of donning a guest role in this movie is weak, he is present on screen through most of second half. This movie probably will do more damage to his acting career than fix it. The background scores and the songs are definitely not worth mentioning, half the numbers are remixes thus taking away the need for remix artists and DJs. None of the songs are worth humming, even the sticky \"Sheila ki Jawani\" with its bad hinglish lyrics. The movie sports an occasional burst of a kid shouting \"Tees Maar Khan\", ruining the few laughs for your money.TMK is bad rip from a 1966 movie \"After the fox\", which was a fun movie with character. TMK's story line is like evoking laughter by beating below the belt. The script fails to build the lead actor's character and hence does not muster any sort of harmony from the audience; it fails to evoke any kind of sympathy for the lead role as the story line jumps from comical to scary and to serious. The transitions, being abrupt keep the audience guessing the genre of the movie through its length.Half way through the movie the story line, actors, guest actors completely lose direction and wander in different direction. Some sequences either have no bearing on the movie or lack the chaining required in storytelling. The director seems to have lost the purpose when it crosses the half way mark. Many of the obvious realities have been over looked or abandoned to make room for mindless comedy which by the ways fails to make people laugh.A few takeaways from the movie, There are many ways to make the audience laugh; this probably is the worst way. Now that the benchmark for the worst, other would only need to just do incrementally better. This movie is a must watch to expand your scales for rating movies. I have expended time and money in watching this movie, I urge you to watch this movie to make me look less gullible.",

The story strength in her movies has been on the downward graph since Main Hoon Naa and has hit a new low with Tees Maar Khan. Evidently, SRK carried both these films on his shoulders with his presence and aggressive marketing. Though these movies were over the top, they were entertaining. Shirish Kunder, Farah's husband is credited for the story, dialogues, lyrics, editing, background score and music for this movie. Thinking of it, he should have played the item number Sheila ki jawani as well and honestly, it wouldn't have made a big difference to the out come of the movie.The whole movie is based after an Italian movie 'After The Fox' released in 1966 which was not very successful. Farah Khan makes a complete mockery of the original by trying add nativity and more comedy to the movie. Akshay Kumar makes a jackass of himself playing Tees Maar Khan. Katrina Kaif is just there for the skin show in Sheila ki jawani.

The film has good elements like comedy, songs, performances etc but the overdose of comedy, however, acted as a negative point for the movie.Akshay Kumar performed well. He did full justice to his role. The script is not bad at all. Katrina doesn't have anything much to do except for her glamorous part in the song \"Sheila Ki jawani\". The story and screenplay are also good. Inother words, TMK has a good script and director Farah Khan does justice to it. But however adding too much comedy was bad, otherwise the film was good.The music is good, with songs like \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" being crowd pullers. I wonder if people were only there in the theatre for watching the song. When the song came, people were delighted and cheered up even more than they did for Akshay Kumar's entry. Seriously they cheered for him as well, thanks to his powerful star presence and the fact that it was a \"House full\" single screen theatre in which we all were watching the film.But still, despite of whatever the negatives, TMK has its own elements of Masala. There are some bits of comedy which would make you die with laughter. Many might not find it a big entertainer, but yet everyone can pick up what they like, in this film. For those looking for Akshay's comedy can enjoy his comedy, those rushing to cinemas only for the song \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" can pick it up as their fun element, and those looking for a festive entertainer, like me, can enjoy this film.On the whole,TMK is a one time comedy film that can be watched, but you have to leave your brains at home! I was going to give a rating of 3 out of 5, but a 3.5/5 for the overall presentation. Worth a watch.",

While watching it, I had a strong feeling that it's a parody of some kind. But the hard hardest part of making a parody is preventing it from becoming what they are paroding. Tees Maar Khan is a victim of it. It's far worse than any of the old comedies.Without insulting any actor particularly, I would say all of them were poorly written. They were caricatures, they were overly dramatic, they were very unlikable and acting was over the top.But does it deserve to be in the bottom. I don't know but I have seen movies far worse than this. Humshakals, Race 2 ,Judwaa 2 to name a few. Infact, most of the Punjabi comedy films are worse than this. Also, RGV ki aag, Himmatwala, Humshakals have ratings well below 2.0 but still not part of this list (they used to be, earlier) .Definitely not the worst I have watched. Also, that overrated Main Hoon Na is just as bad. It's not even Farah Khan's worst. As for Akshay Kumar, he has Joker, Mr. and Mrs. Khiladi, Sabse bada khiladi in his kitty. These films deserve to be in bottom 100, 250 or whatever, before Tees Maar Khan.",

His journey from the moment go, is an insult to the word 'logic'.Shirish Kunder and Ashmith Kunder's Screenplay is full of loopholes. Sure, the film begins ably and the first hour somehow manages to hold your attention. But, the second hour goes for a complete toss. The jokes fall flat, and the culmination also doesn't leave any sort of an impact.Farah Khan's previous films, 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Om Shanti Om', were genuinely entertaining films, but 'Tees Maar Khan' isn't half of the entertainer one expects it to be. Her direction is hen-picked, due to the weak screenplay.The soundtrack, as well as the background, both are good. Acting wise, Akshay Kumar as 'Tees Maar Khan' is effective. Katrina Kaif doesn't get much scope, but she still manages to make her presence felt. Akshaye Khanna, however, is the real surprise packet. He is truly outstanding as an Oscar-Hungry Film Star. Sudhir Pandey is superb! Arya Babbar registers an impact. Salman Khan, Chunkey Pandey and Anil Kapoor appear in brief cameos.On the whole, A Half-Baked Entertainer, that fails to live up to it's gargantuan expectations. Watch it, but only if you must!",

Heres an Example: Mohan Night Samalan (also know as M Night Samalan), the director of Sixth Sense...

In fact, this film feels more like a troll movie , kind of short videos you see nowadays youtubers make regarding trolling someone, so i feel Farah Khan intended to take a dig at oscar films. In fact, many got offended by this film solely because it shows indian villagers as mere fools. Those days the concept of troll was not well known amongst Indians and hence they took such films seriously and got offended.If you can keep aside your critical viewing eyes like I do everytime i watch it and treat the film as a mere troll film, you will enjoy it quite a lot from moments like --> 1. Confusing Danny Boyle for Danny Danzongpa 2. Akshaye Khanna and Akshay Kumar's interactions were hilarious especially his constant assurance that he will get an Oscar and literally the Jai Ho tune starts to play 3. That milk like white guy who is told to chew a gum making him look like he is speaking constantly cracks me up.Overall, this is my personal veiw, not affected by anyone's negative review or anything.

            "content": "I watched the movie while vacationing in India with 5 others between the ages of 21-28 (three men, two women, and I was the only NRI). Each of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie, laughing from beginning to end. We were joking about the movie days after watching it. On our recommendation, our uncles and aunts watched TMK, and they returned with the complete opposite view -- like many of the reviewers on this site, they hated it. Immediately it occurred to me that this might be a result of a generation gap, or an open-mindedness gap. This movie shares many similarities with Austin Powers or Anchorman or any other \"absurdly\" funny movie you're familiar with (note: I hate most Bollywood \"comedies,\" so I bring up Western titles. I loved 3 Idiots but it's a different type of comedy.) Yes, the storyline is unrealistic, but that enhances the comedic value of the movie -- it's not supposed to be serious. Yes, Akshay Kumar \"overacts,\" but that's his character and he plays that role exceedingly well. Yes, the jokes sometimes lack depth, but the movie is replete with memorable one-liners. I'm dumbfounded as to why people hated the movie so much. At the risk of sounding insulting to others, my only explanation is that many of the reviewers were simply not ready for such a film. It does feature several homosexual characters, but most younger generation Indians, I'm guessing, can roll with that. Maybe it takes a certain level of experience with absurdity or sarcasm that maybe the younger folks are more experienced with (I apologize about the \"maybes\" but I'm trying my best to provide possible explanations as to why so many people disliked this movie). I urge you not to write this movie off. Watch the trailer on this site -- if you find yourself chuckling at some of these scenes, then I guarantee you will find yourself cracking up at the movies. Like myself, you may even buy the DVD and put it in your comedy collection (next to your Friday and Big Lebowski).",

            "content": "The story is simply the telling of international master con artist Tabrez Mirza Khan aka Tees Maar Khan (Akshay Kumar), who gets contracted to rob a moving train full of antiques under the watchful eye of the police who's on board to guard the national treasures. He hatches an audacious plan which involves his own cover of being a director, and ropes in an entire unsuspecting village of naive villagers to aid in his scheme, even convincing a desperate superstar actor Atish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) that he's the real deal with a film that can make Atish finally reach out for his obsession of winning an Oscar award finally, after inadvertently passing on a role that went to Anil Kapoor for Dumbdog Millionaire.Yes you read that right, and that's only the tip of the iceberg in the number of references the film makes to the industry of Bollywood and Hollywood, though while Farah Khan's OMO had a barrage of cameos in part thanks to the number Deewangi Deewangi, here the cameos are limited though no less an impact nor taking away any of the fun when mentioned, from Danny Boyle to M Night Shyamalan with comedic spoofs to names, places and films. Some may find fault that the composition of the film may remind one of her earlier effort such as the film within a film structure, in essence, this is a filmmaker's film and Farah Khan aces in making it something that you'll need to see more than once to catch everything she throws into it which all worked in a magical manner. Even her crew become extras on the set, and like an ode to her industry and co-creators whose industry is recognized in the same way she closed OMO.But the fun boils down to the fantastic item numbers Farah puts into Tees Maar Khan, scoring plenty of points with the coup she managed with Katrina Kaif, highlighting her sensuality and sexiness all at the same time through the much talked about Sheila Ki Jawani. While I had half expected the audience to break out into a boisterous mood, I swear the hall was stunned into silence as everyone gawked at what I would put my money on as the Item Number of the year, period. And what a way it was to introduce Kaif's Anya, the live in girlfriend of Tees Maar Khan who's in on his secret, an aspiring though talentless actress wannabe. While Kaif nails this bimbotic, airhead role to perfection, it is her musical numbers that impressed all the time.And to top that within the same film even, Farah Khan pulled off another coup, which again stunned the audience a second time round with audible gasps of disbelief, before breaking out into laughter for the very wry and sly manner in which reel life mimicked the real, or at least whatever the tabloids want us to believe. We know Salman Khan, who had a successful year with his Dabangg, will make a cameo appearance here, but to have him perform in a number and sharing the same frame with both Akshay Kumar, and especially ex-flame Katrina Kaif, was a sight to behold in Wallah Re Wallah, especially when Akshay in character almost always become protective of Anya from other hot blooded male predators. One word: Amazing.While Akshay Kumar may be one of the more industrious actors from B-town, not every film turns out a classic. I had high hopes for his pairing opposite Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Action Replayy last month, but the story unfortunately tanked. I suppose he has more luck almost always opposite Katrina Kaif, and here he's back to what he does best, playing macho characters. His Tees Maar Khan possesses this impossible swagger and a master of disguise, relying on his wits to get out of sticky situations and dexterous skills of thievery to earn a living, emerging always one step ahead of the cops in pursuit. The introduction to his character came right from the start as an animated baby before and during the opening credits, influenced by his film loving mom while watching cop and robber films with the fetus deciding to live a life of crime instead.If there's a minor flaw, I'm complaining about the lack of English subtitles before the opening credits, which thankfully was a short scene. Certain subplots also weren't necessary at first, until you realize they were pieces to wrap up the third act to paint a more sympathetic picture of Tees Maar Khan as the half Robin Hood who develops a heart of gold for the villagers he intended to snook, but influenced slowly through the pangs of guilt and compassion to embody and enrich the character. Split down the middle with the intermission separates the film like the recent Ashutosh Gowariker outing Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey, with character introductions and planning before the actual commencement of the action in the latter half, Tees Maar Khan screams Fun with a capital F right from the start, with very deliberate over- acting, an audacious plot and over the top presentation that makes it the right film to end this season with plenty of laughs and a reminder not to take everything so seriously. Farah Khan is in top form with her direction and vision on how TMK is to be presented, ensuring repeat viewings for many reasons at many levels, be it to catch certain scenes again, or to count the number of easter eggs inserted. Relax, have fun, and take it away, Kat!",

There is no story n the jokes r too idiotic. Even the dumbest of the person may not laugh over that kind of jokes. The 1st half of the movie passes briskly thanks to the Wallah Wallah and Shiela Ki Jawani and some funny moments. But it is in the 2nd half the movie fails miserably. So much so that the actors start screaming their lines. SCREAMING Doesn't MAKE THE DIALOGUES FUNNIER, And in the end there's a misplaced song \"MERE DESH KI DHARTI\" which I felt was completely futile and kinda disrespecting such a patriotic song. I wont talk much about the story because FRANKLY there is nothing to talk about it.Vishal Shekar duo have given good music for the movie and the songs \"Shiela Ki Jawani\" and the title track have already been chart-busters. Akshay Kumar has tried hard to maintain the tempo and get into the character. But given the poorly written character and mediocre jokes even he couldn't help this movie from sinking.Katrina Kaif has nothing to do but look good. She slips through her lines just like a robot. Though she looks smoking hot in the number 'Shiela Ki Jawani' which was nicely choreographed. Though, Akshaye Khanna has done a good job as a Oscar-hungry over-the- top actor . Other actors are passable.TMK neither has good jokes nor connects with the audience emotionally as her previous movies 'Main Hoon Na' and OSO.

TMK,a screwball farce revolving about a conman conning pretty much everyone around him is neither funny nor clever. Akshay Kumar plays his usual comic self we now associate him to from his earlier films with great elan,while Katrina looks hot but lacks any sense of comic timing. The only surprise is Akshay Khanna who manages to make the best of the very little that is offered to him. He is definitely one of the most underrated talents in Bollywood.TMK offers a few giggles here and there and thankfully Farah keeps the running time short and we are spared from not having to waste anymore of our precious time. By the end you feel the director herself had conned us the viewers by making a movie which is a complete farce from beginning to end and sadly doesn't rise to deliver anything exciting.You know things are not looking well,when the guy sitting in front of you at the cinema is busy playing 'Angry Birds' on his Ipod.Bring back the colorful dramatic musicals Farah,we love them!",

            "content": "The Indian film industry is bigger than Hollywood...producing about 800 movies a year. Yet, despite this, IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List only has two Indian films which earned this terrible distinction. \"Tees Maar Khan\" is the lowest rated of the two....coming in at #34. So why would I choose to see it? Well, I have been trying to see all 100 of the Bottom 100...and this film makes it my 91st such picture. But is it really THAT bad? Is it bad enough to deserve inclusion on this list of big budget crappy films? You betcha!Instead of recounting the plot of this film all about the master thief, Tees Maar Khan, I'll point out why I eventually turned off the film before it was so incredibly annoying. The acting was among the worst, if not the worst, I've ever seen...and I've reviewed nearly 22,000 films on IMDB. Almost all the actors seemed amateurish and childish....with lots of caricatures instead of folks who were believable. Heck, the folks in \"Airplane!\" seemed much more real and well acted compared to \"Tees Maar Khan\". Add to that the most hellishly annoying theme song in history, a horrible opening which included a terribly rendered CGI baby and the character 'Jagtap' and you have a recipe for career suicide....and I can only assume director Farah Khan was tired of making films and he made this one to permanently derail his career! A chimp would have done a much better job than Farah...and the acting could only have been more subtle had they gotten the chimp!! It's a pretty looking film...but one that constantly annoys the viewer and makes you wonder WHY...why make a film that deliberately provokes the audience to turn off the film and find something better to do...and ANYTHING would be better!! Sticking toothpicks in your eyes would be better than having to watch \"Tees Maar Khan\" and shoving flaming spears into my ears would be better than having to hear that godawful theme song one more time! Avoid this film like it's the Bubonic Plague!!",

Having just seen it, I have to say that it's a 'leave your brain' at home type film. Even the monster hit item song it churned out ('Sheila Ki Jawani' sung by Sunidhi Chauhan and picturised on Katrina Kaif) was very mediocre.The film's plot in a nutshell: international criminal Tees Maar Khan(played by Akshaye Kumar) eludes the police with trickery and convinces his dim-witter girlfriend(Katrina Kaif), a down of his luck actor(Akshaye Khanna) and an entire small village to help him rob a bank and a train filled with prized possessions under the pretense of shooting an epic movie. There is nothing here that we haven't seen before which is why Khan needed to take it to the next level which she did not. I have heard that the film is a bad remake of some other films like 'Catch me if you can' and 'After the fox' but I did not see any elements of those films here. TMK was just a lazy film churned out by a brilliant person who just wasn't on her A-game this time around. That's all.If you must embark on this journey, get ready for spoofs of every Indian movie ever made with the Oscars in mind (i.e. Lagaaan, Mangal Pandey & Slumdog Millionaire etc.), jabs at actors like Aamir Khan and Shahrukh Khan, director M. Night Shymalan and more. It is narrated by Sanjay Dutt with special appearances by Chunkey Pandey, Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor and Twinkle Khanna as themselves. The Akshayes (Kumar and Khanna) did the best with the horrible scripts they were given. As for Katrina Kaif who might as well be the longest running joke in Bollywood history...a bad actress playing one is just that.",

Likewise, director Farah Khan's third baby Tees Maar Khan is a joke stretched too far, with she poking fun at all and sundry from Hollywood to apna Bollywood, be it Manoj Day Ramalan shooting a jingoistic Brit-bashing period piece in rural Dhulia, or an Oscar-obsessed actor Aatish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) ruing his missed chance to work with Danny Doyle in Dumbdog. And ah! there's also Chunky Pandey in chaddi dancing to the raunchy cameo 'Choli mein Holi'.If you haven't got the drift yet, let's take the lid off this part-funny-part-frustrating piece of campiness which is clearly the remake of the 1966 Italian clunker 'After The Fox' (starring the inimitable Peter Sellers), but quite absurdly credits Farah's hubby and the film's editor Shirish Kunder for writing the story.Like Farah's previous film Om Shanti Om, TMK too has a few in-house jokes on Bollywood. The character of Aatish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna), an intense, overacting superstar, coming pretty close to being a spoof of Shahrukh Khan. On the other hand, Salman Khan walks away with claps and catcalls after a spirited cameo in the song Wallah-re-wallah.All said, TMK may not be Farah's best work to date, but it sure does not entertain for half its running time before coming to an expected Happy Ending.After seeing the film I thanked GOD that Farah Khan didn't approached to SRK for this futile crap.",

One star is to the song SHEILA KI JAWANI(although it is awesome to watch but sadly it lasts for only 4 minutes or so) and the another star to Akshaye Khanna and Akshaye Kumar(yes, both deserve half-a-star).It revolves around one con artist (Akshaye Kumar) who can never be kept in prison and whatever the circumstances he manages to escape every time. He gets a contract to commit a heist of Indian antiques by two brothers who are connected physically(Raghu and Rajiv)and he accomplishes it with the help of residents of a village and an actor aspiring to get an Oscar(Akshaye Khanna) in the most ridiculous manner. Then TMK is double-crossed by his bosses and he overcomes it to a HAPPY ENDING.This movie revolves around a heist which is supposed to take place from an unstoppable train. But the biggest irony is that the train stops in just 10 seconds and the robbery thing is just plain rubbish. Akshaye Kumar has just stuck to the same expressions and behavior since last year or so and it is not funny anymore. Akshaye Khanna as an Oscar-crazy actor is over-the-top but induces laughter in some scenes. And now, Katrina Kaif. The only reason i suppose she did this movie is to show her toned body. The song Sheila arrives quite early in the movie, and after that all Katrina Kaif does is show some skin and tries to act like a bimbo. And oh yes, she also does a Marilyn Monroe.There are so many more absurdities that it is impossible to point out why i disliked it.

The promos gave an indication that it could be a funny film spoofing Bollywood, the title song and Sheila Ki Jawani became huge famous and one expected the film would be equally great.Sadly the film is a big fiasco and an insult. Farah Khan earlier made some watchable films, MHN was quite decent and a homage to 70's(which she got stuck with), OSO was theek thaak but this is completely nonsense.The film is a remake of AFTER THE FOX(1969) but it's such an insult to watch that you beat your head. The plot is juvenile, handling is even worst. Farah Khan makes every actor overact, tries to make every scene funny but sadly the film makes you exhausted.The start is okay with the Sheila number but sadly as the film proceeds it gets tiring to watch, the spoof part is overdone terribly and stands out for it's foolishness, the entire headless daaku angle is so stupid it makes you fall on the ground.... The entire con angle is treated so badly that it makes BUNTY AUR BABLI a masterpieceDirection by Farah Khan is terrible, she is mostly thought as an intellectual and holds pride that she is a 70s movie buff something she herself has maintained but sadly she lacks skills to make such a film Music by Vishal Shekhar) is decent, Sheila number is superb(don't miss Vishal as the director), Walla Re Walla(with appearance of Sallu) Title song and Bade Dilwala are decentAkshay Kumar normally a fine comedian here gets on the nerves with his over the top portrayal, his girly like walk and expressions in the first half don't really work Akshaye Khanna too perhaps felt it was a nice platform to show his comic side but sadly he is made a carricature though he does contribute to some funny moments. Katrina Kaif sizzles in the Sheila song sadly she doesn't do anything worthwhile rest Apara Mehta is funny, Raghu Ram and Rajiv Laxman who normally beat the out of everyone in Roadies here are made to resemble Tin Tin cartoon conjoined twins and they irritate.

            "content": "Talking about Farah Khan and her TMK, I already knew that the film was heavily inspired from Peter Sellers AFTER THE FOX (1966). But sadly, there was no declaration of any sort anywhere in the starting titles or in the ending ones from the makers about its copyrights. Therefore I would take TEES MAAR KHAN as another shameless copy from the West which is surely not a decent gesture from anyone involved with the film. Coming to the movie itself, in simple words it's a very pale and mediocre interpretation of a very exciting plot. Revolving around the character of a wanted criminal Tees Maar Khan, the story mainly deals with a big heist planned by him fooling a whole village of innocent people including a policeman. The plot is as it is taken from the Peter Sellers famous Classic Comedy and even some jokes are adopted like a true remake. The only difference in both lies in the character played by Katrina Kaif.TMK starts as an uneven ride right from the start with a long plane sequence which is not able to raise enough laughs. The first half has no story development as such and the actual heist plan starts post intermission. As I feel, Farah Khan knew that she has got a weak first half and that's why she very smartly included both the item songs, \"Shiela Ki Jawaani\" and \"Wallah Wallah\" in the first half of the movie itself to keep the viewers hooked in.The second half starts off on a brighter note and does manage to entertain the viewer for a few moments. But then everything starts happening so easily that you lose the interest in the proceedings and the weak climax leaves you in a confused state where you start thinking, that what was it all about? From the performances view-point the film is one of the best guidebooks on hamming and overacting. In fact kudos to the director, Farah Khan for directing such a unique movie in which almost every single actor is hamming and overacting like never before. Yes, we know that this is her own style of making a film, but at least it has to be entertaining for the audience, as it was in her last \"Om Shanti Om\".Reviewing TMK in it various departments, I would like to write more about the movie in the following straight forward points.A. The film simply wastes a great potential comic plot in all that hamming and overacting by its entire star-cast.B. The only saving grace of the movie is \"Shiela Ki Jawaani\" song along with \"Wallah Wallah\".C. Akshay Kumar does show his old comedy sparks at regular intervals, but here I would like to convey him that \"there is a very thin line between confidence and over confidence which clearly shows off on the screen very easily. So please be aware of that\"D. Katrina Kaif should unarguably include TMK in her weakest or worst movies ever, as she just remains a mere show piece in the whole movie and has not got even a single good scene except the famous item song. In fact, I think some of her fans might question her that \"Why you had to do it?\"E. Akshay Khanna can easily forget about this venture since he has done only shouting and hamming in all his scenes which is far away of being termed as Acting. F. Raghu and his brother Rajiv, unexpectedly play complete contrasting characters on the screen moving away from their famous small screen images. And somebody tell them that they both look like fools in the movie, as the joined villain brothers, who just have to giggle and speak together in their few scenes. In the supporting cast Akshay's three con friends are funny at places and Arya Babbar makes a feeble impact. But both Murli Sharman & Aman Verma in the role of two Officers try too hard to be funny.G. Truly speaking, from the entire cast if any person made me laugh loudly in just a few scenes then it was Sudhir Pandey in his short role of Akshay Khanna's secretary.H. Musically, I didn't find anything exciting in the soundtrack other than its innovative and catchy title track sung in different voice textures. Interestingly this track is credited to Shrish Kunder and the rest of the songs are from the famous musical duo Vishal-Shekhar who have done just an above average job. Frankly speaking, I even didn't like \"Shiela Ki Jawaani\" a lot as I strongly feel that the song surely would not have become so famous minus Katrina Kaif in another project not backed up by any Akshay and Farah . I. It was really amazing to see Shirish Kunder taking the whole credit of STORY and SCREENPLAY in the titles where in reality it is all copied.J. Farah's love for Manoj Kumar and his works continues in TMK too. But what a degrading way to use the hugely famous national integration song \"Mere Desh Ki Dharti\" in the climax.K. Overall, coming from FARAH KHAN who gave us \"Om Shanti Om\" in the past, this is a weak project which works only in parts and fails to connect with the audience instantly. With neither the lead character of a thief winning over the viewers nor his heist making the things exciting, the film fails to give you a wholesome entertainment as expected from its successful director.Rating : No Rating (Since its just a Shameless Copy and even if they have bought the rights, they had no guts to openly admit it in front of the viewers by writing that in their titles.)",

For starters, every character in the movie is loud, over-the-top and at their hamming best! Seems there was a competition amongst themselves for a trophy, sadly everyone wins!Akshay Kumar: Should seriously apply brakes to his career rather than risking himself getting trapped into Govinda's shoes. Instead of sleep- walking its a good idea to keep an eye on the proceedings if you have put in your moolah. Katrina Kaif: If you negate \"Sheela Kijwani\" there was nothing about her in the movie. Akshaye Khanna: I have never seen him in stooping to such low-levels in his career. And mockery about Anil Kapoor/ Jai Ho could have been more aesthetically delivered (on that note, the mist is now cleared how the original choice is shaking the foundations of mannat on his decision about Slumdog M).Arya Babbar: Hardly leaves an impact.Vijay Maurya: Appalling to see a powerhouse of talent reduced to an inconsequential role of a sidekick. To see Vijay Maurya and Ali Asghar in the same frame is an insult to the Indian Cinema. Plot is thinner than the pringles and comedy appalling. Con-games depicted were not childish, but baby'ish. Voice-over seems to a latest trend in Bollywood these days and Sanju Baba's contribution is merely a novelty. Likewise for Mr. Anil Kapoor.Marriage and motherhood have taken a toll on the taskmaster director. Its evident that her hubby Shirish Kunder has donned multiple hats to fill in the gaps which sadly doesn't rescue titanic hitting the iceberg. If not anything SRK did a brilliant job of Quality Assurance when collaborated with Farah.

If there is one thing we have learnt from her earlier works is to expect plenty of senseless plot developments, action sequences without a purpose, beautifully choreographed dance numbers and the absence of any storyline. All in all some serious entertainment minus the all so serious perspective. The fact that her previous works were runaway hits in the box office, almost assures us, that her next would follow suit. If the promos were anything to go by, it all looked rather amplified, with a certain \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" ruling the Indian music charts in the last month or so. Katrina oozes sensuousness in the video.Akshay Kumar replaces SRK as the main man in the enterprise after AK had assured the cash registers rang big time in Farah's brother Sajid's \"Houseful\" earlier in the year. Add the other Akshay of the industry (Khanna) with a ridiculous wig and a plot thinner than wafer. Than punctuate the narration with rampant digs on almost everything You can fathom from Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle, Anil Kapoor, Steven Spielberg, Sleepy Hollow, Aamir Khan, Manoj N Shyamalan to Manoj Bajpai and then to Manoj Kumar\u0085 As for events there is a hugely popular song which I have hinted about earlier, a couple of robbery scenes and in a style only Farah Khan can pull a few cameos from Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan & Chunky Pandey. Editing is the weakest aspect of the production and the song sequences the best.The most intriguing part of the movie is the acting. It all looked like a lot of goofing around was captured in a camera and eventually put together as a movie. The irony is; that sums the better part of the story. A particular scene describes the 2+ hrs long narration of the movie beautifully. Akshay Khanna's character after the director says \"action\" is at a loss as he has no idea what he is to supposed to do. The director enacted by Akshay Kumar chews his hands and pulls his hair in disgust and eventually comes up with something as incomprehensible as the movie itself.Well that is \"Tees Maar Khan\" for You. Go and watch it for \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" because its on 35mm and sounds better than Your home theater. Let me know if You agree with Farah about mindless being a tough job !!!",

Although Housefull was a hit film, all his other films flopped. Tees Maar Khan was Akshay Kumar's last release in 2010. The movie is an example of a D Grade Film with absolutely no sense. The movie is about Tabrez Mirza Khan aka Tees Maar Khan(Akshay Kumar) a conman who likes to con people and get all the goods. He is very clever(but stupid for choosing such a film), he never looses. He has an old mother and his lover Anya Khan(Katrina Kaif). The movie goes on like this until Akki gets an offer to do the impossible. The story's main focus is on this impossible con job which Tees Maar Khan has to do and when he succeeds, the badguys ditch him and he gets caught. But, he manages to catch them and the ending is retarted with a filmfare award series. Story wise, the movie has no sense. The story is basically a pile of silly scenes put together to make you laugh. Acting wise, Akshay Kumar repeats his loud comedy from his previous film Khatta Meetha which also flopped, Katrina Kaif does good in her item number but she's wasted, the rest are all terrible and should go back to acting school however the reason why I gave the film a 1 is Akshaye Khanna. Him as the hungry Oscar actor is really good. Besides his performance, the movie is a stupid comedy and a waste of money. Please avoid at all costs, even No Problem was better than this.",

            "content": "After two successive hits, 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Om Shanti Om', the bare minimum that you expect from Farah Khan is a pop-corn entertainer or at least a fare that you can tolerate for a couple of hours. Well, that didn't happen with 'Tees Maar Khan'.If it were so bad, one would wonder, did she keep up with Akshay Kumar's track record of mindless comedies especially those with Katrina which raked in moolah? No way! She just took his comedies to an all time nadir sure to fail miserably at the Box Office.While Farah Khan stands to take all the blame for being the Director, in fact, Shrish Kunder seems to be errant. Juggling writing, editing, lyrics and production proved to be too much for Kunder whose previous outing with Akshay, Jaan-E-Mann had flopped baldy. She probably had a tough time melding family and business. Based on a 1996 Peter Sellers starrer, TMK is about Tabrez Mirza Khan (Akshay Kumar) who calls himself semi-Robin Hood, for he steals from the rich but gives not to the poor. Obviously, catching him is a tough act for cops. He is hired by con-men Johari Brothers (Raghu and Rajiv of 'Roadies' fame) to steal a train full of antiques. To accomplish this, he masquerades as a Hollywood Director Majoj Day Ramlan and stages the act of making a film. He casts an Oscar-obsessed star (Akshaye Khanna) and his B-grade wannabe actress girlfriend Anya (Katrina Kaif) and deceives an entire village into accompanying him thinking that they're acting out a crucial scene.Although the premise itself may not be a bad thought, considering that it worked for an earlier film, incoherent scenes, poor dialog, taste- less humor et al lead to the most worthless two hours of your life. Farah the Choreographer excels with songs Sheela-ki-Jawani and Wallah- Re-Wallah, but they do too little to keep the sinking TMK afloat. For the filmmakers, disability, color or gender preferences seem to be source of their humor. While one was a joke on a dark robber being visible only when he smiled, the others included Siamese twins who seem to talk simultaneously and a villager with a skin condition being cast as a Briton. Three villagers dressed in Pink act effeminate and a cop- duo chasing Khan are shown to be amorous. True, brainless comedies often work, but TMK seriously undermines audience intelligence. If Farah Khan and Shirish Kunder thought casting a hit pair, copying a foreign film, a couple of songs and silly gags are all that movie should have, they've been caught on the wrong foot. To keep your sanity, just stay away from this flick.In the closing credits, the film-makers are seen awarding themselves. Let them, for they won't be able to lay their hands on the real stuff anyway!",

            "review_title": "Nonsense comedy at it's worst",
            "content": "Director Farah Khan will stop at nothing to get a laugh out of you. No disability is too sensitive to make a joke of, and no stereotype too overused to flog one last time. In a scene from her new film 'Tees Maar Khan', a dark-skinned thief nicknamed Ismail Koyla who only commits robberies in the night, is finally arrested when his shining teeth give away his hiding spot. In another scene in which a movie is being cast, a toothless villager presumably suffering from leucoderma is selected to play a British officer because he has white skin. A pair of conjoined twins only speak in unison and repeatedly hi-five each other. And three effeminate village boys forever dressed in pink assist a heroine with her make-up, and roll their eyes longingly at a hunky filmmaker. If you're outraged by such low-brow humor, 'Tees Maar Khan' is going to be a long, hard slog for you.Adapted from 'After the Fox', a 1966 comedy starring Peter Sellers, this film stars Akshay Kumar as Tabrez Mirza Khan or 'Tees Maar Khan', a master criminal who learnt to steal even before he was born, because his mother was addicted to classic Bollywood crime films while she was pregnant with him. When Tees Maar Khan is hired by the notorious Johri Brothers to rob a train stuffed with roughly 5,000 crore rupees worth of antiques, he pretends to be a Hollywood filmmaker named Manoj Day Ramalan, and under the guise of shooting a period film, enlists an entire unsuspecting village to help him with the heist.Despite several staggeringly silly set pieces - including a sequence in an airplane in which 'Tees Maar Khan' escapes from the clutches of two police officers - the film's first hour races by briskly thanks to breakneck pacing, and at least two energetically choreographed dance numbers. But by the time you've settled into your seat post intermission, the screenplay begins to come apart. There's a particularly awkward gag involving a headless horseman, and that leads to a supposedly poignant moment in the film that is entirely contrived. Even the train heist sequence isn't filmed dramatically enough, and the Manoj Kumar tribute at this point seems forced and overstretched. Tees Maar Khan, surprisingly, doesn't match up to the standards set by Farah Khan with her previously directed films. Both 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Om Shanti Om' were smarter, funnier films that benefited from the writer-director's irreverent humour. But for this film she hands over the writing responsibilities to Shirish and Ashmit Kunder who appear to have drained the film of any smartness. The dialogues are repetitive, and the jokes in 'Tees Maar Khan' are mostly puerile and not very funny at all. In fact, it's an arrogantly written script that seems to take the audience for granted. However, it's a testament to Farah Khan's directing skills that she makes even this disappointing film work on at least a few occasions. She draws out a winning performance from Akshaye Khanna as the Oscar-hungry filmstar Aatish Kapoor, who's still hurting from having lost a role in 'Slumdog Millionaire' on account of his foolish secretary. Despite the incessant hamming, Khanna easily emerges this film's best joke. Katrina Kaif, in a smaller role, as Tees Maar Khan's struggling actress girlfriend, submits herself completely to the silliness of her character, and at least succeeds in evoking a smile out of you. In the choreography department, there are few who can rival Farah Khan. The 'Sheela ki jawaani' number is one of the film's early highlights, a sight to behold not only for the dance movements but for the complete staging of the production - the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the editing. The 'Wallah wallah' set piece too, featuring Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan, has an infectious energy that is indisputable. Even if you go in willing to suspend your disbelief, 'Tees Maar Khan' is not an easy film to enjoy. Akshay Kumar works very hard to make the buffoonery look like fun, but he's saddled with such poor material, it's no surprise it doesn't work.Working with Akshay Kumar for the first time, it's surprising she delivered not the trademark Farah Khan entertainer one expected from her, but a typical harebrained Akshay Kumar comedy instead.",

He was caught in France and was deported back to India. Two police officers Chatterjee (Aman Verma) and Mukherjee (Murli Sharma) took him but he escaped.He is in love with the struggling actress Anya (Katrina Kaif). TMK takes a job from the Johri brothers to rob a non-stop train loaded with precious antiques. He cons the people of Dhulia village into helping him by saying that he will make a historical film about their village. He approaches the greedy but popular actor Aatish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna), who is eager to get the Oscar award and fools him into working in his film. The robbery goes well but all the villagers and Tabrez Mirza Khan get arrested. TMK claims they are innocent, but he gets arrested anyway.The movie is completed and, at the premiere, Aatish, Anya, TMK's mother, Dollar, Soda, Burger and all the villagers walk the red carpet with Tees Maar Khan and the police. After the film, Tees Maar Khan escapes. Later, at his private jet, the Johri brothers enjoy what they got until Tees Maar Khan and his gang throw them out of the plane. The film ends with TMK and his mother becoming rich, Aatish receiving Oscar awards from actor Anil Kapoor, Anya becoming an actress and the whole Dhulia village opening their own saloons, party halls and the village inspector opening a poster signing stall to all the people from America.The story is bad.The screenplay is very bad.The direction is bad.The music is bad.The dialogs are awful.None of the actor's performances are worthy of mention.All in all Tees Maar Khan is awful and painful both combined!I am going to give it a zero on ten(0/10)",

Obviously, it wasn't worth spending even a single cent on a movie that has Akshay Kumar as the main lead and is trashed universally. I was lucky enough to be able to borrow this movie from the public library.The movie sets its low standards right from the opening credits - a dancing foetus in scenes that are just a rip-off from opening credits of Bond movies. The movie just keeps trying to fathom the abyss of movie making and never tries to redeem itself. Reminds me of what late Roger Ebert wrote about \"Freddy Got Fingered\" - \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.\" There is nothing in this movie that is worth mentioning - because this movie lacks anything that has semblance to the art of movie making - acting / story / direction / dialogues. This movie does not even fall in the category \"so bad it is good\". The movie is just based on the recent Bollywood premise that if you hire popular actors, spend money on promotion and promote it as a \"brainless entertainer\", there is a certain demographic that will flock to theatre to spend their (or their parent's) hard earned money. It is just like flipping a coin - some movies end as winners, some end being losers. Equally disappointing is the fact that movies that were released after \"Tees Maar Khan\" have followed this formula and have earned big bucks.I do not have any admiration for Akshay Kumar's acting skills since I saw \"Deedar\" in theatres 20 years ago. And after 20 years, his wooden face and expressions haven't changed a bit. To expect any acting from Katrina would be akin to expect that mortal can create miracles and cure human beings. But what is painful is to see talented actors like Anjan Shrivastav, Sudhir Pandey or Apara Mehta in roles that are an insult to their acting talents. And somehwere along the lines I have a suspicion that this movie, although credits Farah Khan as director, is ghost directed by her hubby, Shirish Kunder (who has four or five other credits to his name in this movie). Farah has done a decent job in \"Om Shanti Om\".I have given one star only because a)IMDb does not allow negative star ranking b) you can see Farah's choreography skills in the \"Sheela\" song.",

            "content": "Almost all of us are ruing about the fact that we had gone to watch TMK with a lot of expectations after all the hype and anticipation surrounding Farah Khan's latest third movie. The problem is that Farah Khan took it for granted that what most viewer's look for in a movie is a great star cast, nicely choreographed songs and a comic like story. All of these were also widely used to great success in her earlier movies which was done sensibly around a visible story. But the problem with TMK is that it does not tell anything that the viewer can relate to and like other Farah Khan movies she adds an artificial humor to it only excessively this time. Her earlier movie characters had some true to life feel although there were unusual things happening to them but their reactions seemed real. Like SRK's emotions in Om Shanti Om when he enacts receiving an award or when he first meets his dream girl. Here Akshay Kumar plays the role of a big-time crook or con-man but his con jobs seem completely unreal and so does the way his character acts through it. There's absolutely no sense in watching someone with a brain of a monkey do feats of a rocket scientist. It's as if there was already a movie with the same concept that was made with a serious tone and Farah is trying to make a spoof out of it. The viewers don't have a clue as to what she intends to make fun of as the spoof is on an original movie that doesn't exist or no one watched.While no one expects real acting in a spoof, the role of an actor of Akshay Kumar's caliber is required to have some substance to it. It would have been perhaps better suited to cast some unknown or small time comedian in this completely silly role than to waste Akshay Kumar's skills and star image. Also instead of dressing up this mess with senseless scenes and songs Farah Khan should have made an effort to make the characters look real and get some sensible acting out of her cast particularly Katrina who will only be noticed for the item song. The viewer's watch comic movies to forget their worries but they're not stupid. So Farah Khan should sit down with those who write the story before deciding how to make a comedy scene than the other way round. Also the gay concept is getting kind of old but she seems to still live in the last decade. This is certainly not a good way to end a decade in Bollywood!! Its the viewers who pay the price of a ticket and they are the ones who decide if a movie is really worthy of appreciation. Patting oneself on the back and creating fake hype is just a way to cheat and insult the earnest viewers who unknowingly fall in the trap of watching these duds. A over hyped movie like this is nothing but a bad elaborate joke on the intelligence of those who spent their money on buying the tickets. But right now no one is laughing.",

Rest of the cast: tried their best to over act, to over react, and they had passed with 100%.Pluses: Sheila Ki Jawani.. song is electrifying, thanks to Katrina's charm, and choreography is extremely good and the song Wallah Re Wallah... is also good enough to catch your attention for few reasons.Minuses: Irritating court room sequence. Johri brothers (Twins) - uniform in bright shirts and converse the same sentences in chorus. Arya Babbar \u2013 A village cop with thoughts of becoming popular / an actor. Three men in pink shirts, as Anya's make up assistants. Lot of unpleasant jokes on the color of skin is included, ( Manoj Night Ramlan's skin color) and its horrible to see in a movie with the popular stars. Usage of the name like Danny Doyle, Manoj Day Ramlan. In addition to all these there is few insensible gay jokes. - To be continued.....Many slapstick comedies are releasing these days, but they fails when actors act like idiotic and mentally challenged people. Teez Maar Khan \u2013 Main Characters, Police Officers, Criminals, and all the other characters emerges as foolish cartoons. The whole cast is acting like there is some Oscar's for 'over acting'. Everything is over the top here. The TMK have many needless situations and odd characters. Tees Maar Khan just refuses to make any sense at any point of time.",

I must admit, initially, I found that the actors were over-acting and the storyline seemed ridiculous, but THAT was the beauty of this movie.Tees Maar Khan is a full-blown comedic Movie. Its very ingeniously disguised as overacting and pointless. IF you think about it, a con-artist getting a group of villagers along with a big-shot-Actor to be a part of his grand scheme of things pretty much sounds like all BOLLYWOOD movies. I think its about time Bollywood comes out with movies like this.A Bollywood Movie usually drags on a simple storyline through hurdles and hurdles of endless disappointments just to get to the obvious ending. I can't sit through a full Bollywood Movie at any given time without being bored out of my mind. But Tees Maar Khan occupied every single minute of my time and I honestly thought the movie was only an hour and a half.It was the overacting that made this movie simply beautiful. Its like a \"Scary Movie\" version of all Bollywood movies mushed up together.I found this movie very strangely charismatic with the cast and storyline. It was out and out entertaining! It was honestly worth watching, but keep an open mind. Movies that doesn't revolve around love and its hurdles are just overdone and boring.",

The main characters will be tricking an entire village full of idiotic dimwits and buffoons, and cut to a song.If you haven't heard the title song, you cannot say you know what the word \"annoying\" means. As for the ever so hyped Sheila (which is done within the first twenty minutes of the movie), we get introduced to Katrina Kaif's character and never see her again except for a few ditsy lines here and there.Don't get me started on the so called humour. The worst screenwriter of the year goes to Shirish Kunder. Housefull (2010) is intelligent compared to this garbage crap.As for the two male leads - the less said the better. Akshaye Khanna's career has reached an all time low (we're talking lower than the Marianna's Trench). As for Akshay Kumar, this movie really took a toll on his career.Finally, the worst director of the decade award goes to none other than Farah Khan.

If you are looking for fun, time-pass entertainment than you will certainly enjoy Tees Maar Khan! This movie is SUPPOSED to be dumb. That is what makes it brilliant. The silly puns and obvious jokes... they're supposed to make you roll your eyes and laugh while thinking 'Oh my God, did they just really say that?' Each character is larger than life, from the \"blonde\" bimbo Anya (Katrina Kaif) to the suave, catch-phrase using, wanna-be \"Don\" Tabrez Mirza Khan (Akshay Kumar). The plot is your average story of a conman attempting the heist of his life. The clich\u00e9s are what make this movie great... I guess some people just don't get that. Those people need to stop taking themselves so seriously.Am I perhaps giving Farah Khan too much credit for creating a brilliant satire when really it is just a poorly made comedy? Maybe. But even if that is true you will find moments where you can laugh, even if you're doing it while thinking WTF? I do agree that Akshay's brand of humor and Farah Khan's style do not mix too well. I think both are fantastic at what they do, but in this movie their skills clash and are ultimately compromised. It was painfully obvious at points that this movie was made for Shahrukh Khan in a sort of slapstick version of his \"Don\" flick. If only he had not gotten into a fight with the director...The best performance by far was that of Akshaye Khanna as the Oscar-obsessed superstar trying to give his ultimate performance. The exaggerated intensity and self-importance with which he performs every scene is hilarious. Even the long, flowing \"hero\" looking hairdo was spot on.No, it's probably not the kind of movie you would watch again unless it came on TV, but if you need some Bollywood over the holidays just go see it. Don't think about it too much. In fact, think of it as a mental break. If nothing at all, go and enjoy the songs! Vishal and Shehkar do it again with \"Sheila Ki Jawani\" and \"Wallah Re Wallah.\" The beats are awesome and Katrina Kaif is sizzling.",

The funniest part is that the movie fails to tickle in all those areas where it was supposed to. All scenes featuring Akshay Kumar alone are unbearably boring. His timing and use of subtle symbolic devices to create humour was conspicuously absent . The story wasn't written, it was scribbled on a discarded Platform Ticket by an uninterested imbecile. The screenplay is a disaster. Even the potentially funny situations were converted into dreadfully un-funny scenes . The movie however redeems itself through the herculean comic effort by Akhshay Khanna, a man virtually ignored if not boycotted during the movie's promotion. His performance is quite good and adds life to the dead script. He delivers the payload when required. His gestures, actions, diction is immaculate. The only character who actually plays the character he he was assigned with intensity and conviction. Cameos by Raghu Ram (ok they are two individuals) also help the viewers to stop looking at the price tags on their tickets.

And I do not like how this movie is trash talked, like yeah Khan experimented, and it wasn't well received. But it really killed and demotivated creators from experimenting. And now we have tasteless remakes.Back to Tees Maar Khan, with great non offensive comedy, it's a film that doesn't pretend to be overly smart. And just wants everyone to have a good time.

I can't even comment on it, the whole movie is a big fat idiotic joke. Sheela ki Jawani was the only thing in the movie even worth listening to, and it definitely isn't the best song you've ever heard.

Rather it falls flat . As the promos and the preview suggest , th story is about Tabrez Mirza Khan aka Tees Maar Khan. A con artist ,a thief who is capable enough to open any lock , in any place of the world, let that be on a flying plane or a running train. the story revolves around how he undertakes a job to rob a running train containing 10,000 kilograms , worth antiques. well , routed to be as one of the biggest hits of 2010, TMK turns out to be one of the biggest flops of the year joining Ravaan and Kites.With silly one liners and awful con tricks TMk is one of the worst con movies i have ever seen till date. With a little or no use of the acting skills of Katrina Kaif and Akshaye Khanna , Farah Khan wastes them totally.the only interesting part of the movie is the song Sheila Ki Jawani that might drag the audiences to the theaters but if you take my opinion friends don't go for it if you have no intentions of wasting your money and time on one of the awfully scripted,directed movies of all time.i would rather call it as FARAH KHAN KI AAG rather than Tees Maar Khan it worst than Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag.",

Intelligent one liners , few of them, and in first half primarily... Better go with your better half !!! The story is not very strong, but the screenplay comes alive with our beloved Akki's delivery and his body communications. Raghu and Rajiv add a bit of a flavor to it, but then even that wears off after some time. Definitely not the best works of Farah, good surprising guest appearances and a lot of intended spoof of almost entire bollywood helps you curve your lips every now and then.

            "content": "My love for Farah Didi knew no bounds after watching Tees Maar khan:\nSome very obvious reasons:\nCharacter\n1. The Characters can't be more appealing, from Tees maar Khan alias Tabreez Mishra who is a con artist with magical powers to Aanya, a good for nothing wannabe actress and acrobat dancer to Johri Brothers, two twins who can't be separated from each other to a Sasta Leo Caprio without any acting skills who is obsessed for an Oscar; they all transcend boundaries of great character.\nStoryline\n2. If there is one movie that rightfully comes close to enigma and beautiful portrayal of this movie, then it has to be inception. The plot of the film is unbelievable; I mean literally unbelievable.   Managing to develop a con artist who is blessed with such magical powers that he stole watches and jewelry the very moment he was born. And leaving no stones unturned in making us believe that a whole village can be fooled to do a robbery of a train full of antiques.\n\n3.Dialogues \nDialogues were up there with Shashank Redemption, to give you a taste of few:\n\"Textbook se copy karta hua student and tess maaar khan ke bheje se nikla hua plan kabbi fail nahi hota.\"\n\n'Tube se nikla hua toothpaste or tees maar khan ke die hue jubban kabhi wapis n jaati'\n\n\"Kuute ke muu se haddi or tees maar khan ke haatho se gaadi dono cheene Bakar h\"\n\nAnd my personal favorite was \nBoss, dhoop aa raha hai.... Accha? Jao Suraj ko bolo thoda baju me hat neko!\" \n\n4. Cameo\nIf there was any scope of brilliance left in the movie, it was filled by Sallu Bhai's cameo in 'Wallah re wallah.\"\n\nSome  not very obvious reasons to love Farah Didi\n1. So, Bollywood has the habit of subtly glorifying Racism, but Farah Didi managed to do it so openly without any repercussions, which is commendable.\nIn one scene while referring to a criminal the dialogue says, \" Ismail koyle se kaala h, ya koyla ismail se kala\" and \"Ismail ke pass do hatyar h, ek. Raat ka andhera, dusra Ismail ka smile.\"\n\n2. In one dialogue which is repeated more than once Tess Maar khan says \"Tawaif ki lutti izzat bachana; aur tees maar khan ko qaid karna; dono bekaar hai\" and you can't expect anything more from the movie now.\n\n3. In one scene Farah didi wasn't able to find a white man to play a Britisher's role in her film, so she takes the help of a person with albino and stuffs bubble gum in his mouth as a language barrier again without any consequences. \n\nConclusion\nThis is one such movie that should be kept in a museum to tell people that this is a quintessential masterpiece and this is the only movie one should set as a standard for a perfect movie.",

Tabrez's love interest is played by Katrina Kaif as Anya Khan who nails her bimbotic airhead role to perfection.\r\n\r\nNot my cup of tea.

It really has no \"value\" for adults, unless you're just skipping between dance routines.\n\nOne joke was pretty silly though: The idea that a criminal is pretending to be the brother of director M. Night Shyamalan...by calling himself \"M. DAY Shyamalan.\"",

BUT, for those of us who've taken a liking to Farah Khan's style of movie-making, one can actually 'see' her behind every scene/frame having fun practicing her craft, trying to create a slapstick cult flick (but of course falling flat), and that's some consolation. After all, a couple of good laughs she extracts from us with the 'Oscaar'-crazy Akshaye Khanna character count for something! :-) \"Go Farah! Don't be beaten down by this debacle . But, next time, make sure you grab a script before you head out the door with your camera! In fact, you should have beaten Rohan Sippy to the punch to grab 'Dum Maaro Dum' to make yet another fun celebration of the 70's and 80's\".",
