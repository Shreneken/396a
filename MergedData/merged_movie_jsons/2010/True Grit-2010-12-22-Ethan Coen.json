            "content": "Jeff Bridges gets to put his own spin on the character of Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn, first portrayed by an Oscar-winning John Wayne in the 1969 film adaptation. Rooster is hired by a very plucky 14 year old girl, Mattie Ross (debuting Hailee Steinfeld), who wants to avenge her father. Dad was murdered by the cowardly Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who made out for Indian territory and who may now be riding with an outlaw, Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), and his gang. They are joined by a determined Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who wants to arrest Chaney for a crime committed in the Lone Star state.This new version of the Charles Portis novel was scripted and directed by the great filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who treat the material respectfully, even reverently. The dialogue is antiquated, yet quite literate, and it truly comes to life when spoken by this well-chosen cast. The story is straightforward and without filler, the pacing very efficient. Serious at times (and funny at other times), the film never veers too far into melodrama. It hits the ground running, with an older Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) narrating and giving us the back story of Mr. Ross' killing. Two frequent Coen brothers collaborators work some real magic: cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose widescreen compositions are wonderful, and composer Carter Burwell, whose music is breathtaking.Bridges completely disappears inside the role of the surly, tough, hard drinking marshal, while Damon gives one of his better performances. Brolin and Pepper don't show up until around the 80 minute mark, but do extremely effective work. As soon as you meet Chaney, you know you loathe him; he's that much of a heel. The strong supporting cast includes Dakin Matthews, Paul Rae, Domhnall Gleeson, and Leon Russom; it's also great to see Jarlath Conroy from George Romeros' \"Day of the Dead\" as the undertaker. But young Steinfeld leaves the greatest impression, giving us a heroine who is capable, determined, and very mature for her age, a girl who can hold her own dealing with a character like Stonehill (Matthews).\"True Grit\" 2010 is sometimes violent (and strikingly so), but is basically just a good, solid example of impassioned storytelling that maintains viewer interest for the better part of two hours.Eight out of 10.",

            "content": "After her father is murdered fourteen year old Mattie Ross is determined to bring Tom Chaney, his killer, to justice; to this end she hires US Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn drinks and has a reputation for shooting the people he is meant to be arresting but Mattie believes he has 'true grit' and is the man for the job. A Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf is also looking for Chaney in regards to a murder in Texas; a murder with a larger reward\u0085 Mattie however is determined that Chaney will hang for the death of her father not for what he did in Texas. She insists on accompanying Cogburn, something he initially objects to but as they travel deeper into Indian Territory, where Chaney is riding with a group of outlaws. Before catching up with Chaney they come across other members of the gang and reunited with LaBoeuf.All too often when a classic film is remade the new film is a disappointment; thankfully that is not the case here. The Coen brothers' take on the story is every bit as good as the original. Young Hailee Steinfeld does a brilliant job as Mattie Ross; making the viewer believe that she has the force of will to do what she does and persuade others to go along with her demands. Jeff Bridges is on fine form as the grizzly Rooster Cogburn and Matt Damen is solid enough as LaBoeuf although his role is noticeably smaller than Stienfeld and Bridges. The early part of the film provides some action but is mostly concerned with introducing our protagonists. Later on there is more action including shootouts, a nasty encounter with a rattlesnake and the inevitable confrontation with Chaney and the rest of the gang. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film to fans of the genre; I'm sure people who enjoyed the original will enjoy this too.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers are known for being one of the best filmmakers of our time. They both compliment each other perfectly. When I heard they were remaking the 1969, John Wayne classic True Grit, I was extremely excited and had incredibly high expectations of the film. Being a major fan of Western movies, I was really interested how it would turn out. I wanted the movie to be more faithful to it's original source material, Charles Portis novel, than the 1969 film had been. I was also hopeful that Jeff Bridges would fill the huge shoes of the classic, legendary John Wayne. I was hoping that they would blend the humor of the original 1969 film with some of the suspense or thrills from earlier Coen brothers films like No Country For Old Men or Fargo. But not become way too violent that it causes to stay completely unrecognizable to Charles Portis classic novel. After seeing the Coen brothers new film, I have to say. My extremely high expectations were surpassed. The movie actually surprised all the hype I had, what an incredible film. The atmosphere, clothing, and the buildings reminded me of the old classic Hollywood westerns they used to make. I had a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie through the end. I felt transported to another time period of the old western. Hailee Steinfeld was amazing in the movie, I truly believe that this is her breakout performance. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin were as usual amazing. But the true star of the film has to be Jeff Bridges, in all respects ( I don't mean to offend John Wayne or anything), I think Jeff Bridges did a better job than John Wayne in portraying Rooster Cogburn. His performance showed much more experience, strength and power, the performance was pretty much unforgettable. Jeff Bridges handily reinvents the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers' back-to-the-book-remake. I congratulate the Coen for bringing back the western genre, that Hollywood has ignored so much the last decade or so. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this movie to people.",

            "review_title": "Good ol' fashioned storytelling",
            "content": "As is to be expected, the film has all the classic Coen flourishes, first and foremost its use of language. The Coens have always been impeccably tuned in to language and accents, from the most creative use of swear words in The Big Lebowski and Burn After Reading to the colorful, stylized prose of The Hudsucker Proxy and The Man Who Wasn't There to the very distinct accents in Raising Arizona, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men. In classic Coen fashion, the use of language is very much emphasized in True Grit. The characters have a very distinct use of words, lifted right out of the novel and, as it feels at least, right out of the time period the film takes place in. Unlike something like Deadwood which features a very modernized and stylized version of 18th century speak, the dialogue in True Grit sounds completely authentic and, along with the impeccable and accurate-feeling costume and set design, really adds to the realism of the world True Grit creates. Accents are also very important \u2013 the harsh Southern drawl that the Coens have always been attracted to is very prominent and plays a very large role in the film.As has become expected of the brothers, especially in recent years, the film looks incredibly beautiful, mainly thanks to regular DP Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. All of his trademarks are in place: harsh but very naturalistic lighting, washed-out colors, especially in the outdoor scenes, smooth camera movements, and just a generally beautiful palette he uses to paint the world of the film with. Also very prominent in the film is the beautiful score by Carter Burwell. It hearkens back to his more melodic work on the Coen brothers' earlier films, especially Miller's Crossing. Using themes from classic hymns from the time period of the film, the soundtrack, along with the language of the dialogue, helps add a very strong feeling of authenticity to the film. It is a beautiful piece of music: dramatic but not heavy- handed, whimsical but with a hint of darkness to it. These two long-time Coen collaborators, as well as the costume and set designers, with whom the Coens have also worked with many times before, all deliver top-notch work and show once again just how strong the power of long-term collaboration can be.Other returning collaborators are a number of the cast members. The Coens seem to have grown distant from most of their long-time regular cast members (Jon Polito, John Turturro, John Goodman, Steven Buscemi, and others), but Coen regulars still make appearances in some of their recent work. In this case, it is \"The Dude\" Lebowski himself, Jeff Bridges, who makes his triumphant return in a Coen brothers film, filling the very large shoes of John Wayne, who gave an iconic performance as Rooster Cogburn in the first adaptation of True Grit, from 1969. Bridges brings his own unique style and sensibilities to the role, combining his drunken goofiness with the demeanor of a serious and very skilled hunter and lawman. It is a wonderful performance playing to all of Bridges' best abilities as an actor, and it is just a joy to watch. Also playing to his best qualities is Matt Damon, who delivers one of the loosest and most fun performances of his career as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (or \"La Beef\", as he is referred to, by himself as well, in the film). Damon is clearly having fun with the role, although like Bridges, he, too, manages to find a very excellent balance between the humor and the seriousness and skill his character has. But the standout performance has to be newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, who beat out 15,000 other girls for the part. Open casting calls often provide disappointing results, as nonprofessional actors tend to be just that \u2013 not professional. 14-year-old Steinfeld proves she is a talent to watch, though \u2013 she totally commands the screen with her strong-willed, stubborn character, and manages to hold her own against Bridges, Damon and Josh Brolin, who makes a brief but memorable appearance later in the film. It is a fantastic, powerful performance that is an absolute joy to watch. I foresee great things from Steinfeld in the future.Many people will be turned off by the straightforwardness of the storytelling in True Grit. I have already heard complaints that the film lacks poignancy. But that isn't what it lacks. What it lacks is irony. It's actually quite amazing to see a film so completely and utterly devoid of irony such as this one \u2013 it seems like most films these days, including the Coen brothers' recent output, all carry this air of cynicism about them. True Grit hearkens back to a more classic form of plot and character-driven storytelling, and in that sense, it succeeds immensely. Ultimately, True Grit is a piece of pure entertainment \u2013 and it is quite an entertaining film: thrilling, engaging, and very, very funny. I have read many opinions claiming that this \"doesn't feel like a Coen brothers film,\" but its storytelling style and techniques actually remind me most of another classic Coen film, Miller's Crossing. That film was also completely stripped of irony and instead focused on telling a good old-fashioned yarn, nothing more, nothing less. So while True Grit is not one of the very best films in the Coen's oeuvre, it is still just a darn good film overall.",

            "content": "I wasn't sure how to take the news that the Coen brothers were remaking the John Wayne film True Grit and I remained unsure even when it was clear that they were not so much remaking the film as making a different version of the original book. How would their humour and oddity sit in this story, how would their normal arch cynicism and cleverness work here? Well in reality it doesn't really come into play because they have made a film that is surprisingly free of that side of their work while also containing just enough in terms of characters and dialogue to make it their own. Mostly though what True Grit does is deliver an enjoyable story in an engaging and satisfying manner.While I don't agree with IMDb observer-in-chief tedg's overall rating for the film, he is correct when he says that the western as a genre has really been thoroughly explored and it is hard to bring freshness to such a film. The Cohen's struggle with this a little bit because it doesn't feel like \"their take\" on a genre so much as it does just feel like a western full stop. This perhaps limits them in terms of their own style but it does mean that they are focused on the telling of the story rather than anything else they may have added for colour. The end result of this is that the film is actually a really solidly told story that perhaps doesn't soar or have flamboyance or colourful touches but it does still engage as a tale. The story will be known to those familiar with the Wayne film but the slant very much onto Mattie makes it feel like a different story, albeit with much familiar about it. It is well told though and I found myself engaged by it just as much as I was never really thrilled by it. It has heart in its main character, it has a forward motion and it has a nice touch of humour throughout.The key to it is the performance from Steinfeld. She may well have been put forward for Supporting Actress in a political move by the studio but she is the heart and soul of this film. Her performance makes her Mattie a stubborn youth but one with juts enough vulnerability about her to suggest some of it is a front to cover herself in this regard. While she never struck me as a person that would exist within this story, she did convince me as a character and she was a delight to watch \u2013 this is her story and she makes it such. This puts Bridges in the supporting role and he is great there, having fun with the role and adding colour to things. Damon underplays wisely \u2013 sparking nicely off Bridges but letting these two having the light. Brolin, Pepper and others all deliver solid turns without stealing anything. Perhaps aware of what the genre is best known for (the landscapes) Deakins is restrained; where he made art with Jesse James, here he focuses on the smaller moments \u2013 the light from a campfire, the falling of snow \u2013 and he captures them excellently. At some point he will win his Oscar \u2013 maybe this is it but certainly his body of work cries out for it.True Grit is not quite the brilliant piece of work that the \"for your consideration\" campaign would have you believe but it is a great piece of storytelling. The Coen brothers deliver some fine dialogue and colour but leave the telling free of cynicism or snideness (not a word, but you know what I mean). The story engaged me and is only made better by the strong pair of performances in the lead \u2013 but particularly Steinfeld, who makes this film in the same way that Portman made Black Swan this year.",

            "content": "Few directors working today in America have mastered form like the Coens, I discover this with every new film they make. True Grit is a commercial film made to please but I don't see a compromise in the making and it's still a distinctly Coen film if you pay notice. Try to take out the Coen character from the film and the film breaks apart, it's that tightly woven in the fabric of it.A Coen film works for me in the face of it, but I'm always on the lookout for what goes on behind, for the unseen cogs that grind out the fates of their characters. As with No Country, I came to this film looking to see is there a statement on violence, does it happen in a certain way and is the universe indifferent to it, is life worth a damn?This one here works very much like the Henry Hathaway film from '69, except everyone's better, where John Wayne played a character, Jeff Bridges plays a man, and even Barry Pepper betters my beloved Robert Duvall's turn as Ned Pepper. This probably won't do it for Jeff Bridges because we've been accustomed to expect a certain degree of po-faced seriousness from a great performance (he snarled and staggered in Crazy Heart but he was serious about it), but he's one of the great actors of our times and I find this again in his Rooster Cogburn. Clint Eastwood also fell from a horse in Unforgiven and couldn't shoot a tin can to save his soul, but Munny \"was\" a scumbag, Cogburn still is and I like that. I like the courtroom scene where it's gradually revealed that he won't only bushwack those he needs to bring to justice, he will lie to make himself out to be the hero.Another interesting aspect here is how the concept of the gunslinger and the western with it has evolved. When John Wayne played Cogburn in the Hathaway film the reward for the audience was the smirk of watching John Wayne be that drunken failure. The casting mattered in our appreciation. In the remake, most comments seem to point out that it's a fairly traditional/entertaining western. The dastardly revisit of something that was revisionist in the 70's oddly seems to give, in our day, a traditional western. We've been accustomed to heroes who are not heroes, and maybe the erosion of that heroic archetype says something about the way we view the world now, as opposed to 30-40 years ago. Then we were beginning to realize that wars are not gloriously, justly won but survived and endured, now we know there is no clear struggle between dual opposites and have grown disenchanted as that knowledge has failed to prevent the same wars. Now we know there is stuff about the legends that don't make the print, or we are suspicious enough about legends to imagine them.Is this a traditional western then? Watching True Grit through the eyes of the brass 14yo girl reminded me of Winter's Bone, another film from the same year. In both cases a young girl is determined to plunge herself in a dark world of hurt and walk a path fraught with perils on all sides to achieve a moral purpose, both films maintain an appearance of realism, but what I get from them is a magical fantasy. This becomes more apparent when Mattie falls in the snakepit, but what about the hanged men who are really hanged high? The Hathaway film, ostensibly based on the same material, missed that note and played out a straight western. The Coen film unfolds as a hazy dream of that West. Although I wished for more open landscapes, it makes sense then that film narrows our gaze and clouds the margins. Perhaps we are even seeing the film as Mattie relives the experience in her old age, an affair shaped by memory and time.This is the marvellous touch effected by the Coens on the material; the minute recreation of the Old West as a historical place and the odd, incongruous moments found within it annihilate any authority over the material.The epilogue is important in that aspect.It's not only that Mattie's revenge didn't accomplish anything, that it was for her merely another practical inconvenience to be bargained, paid for, and settled, like her father's ponies and saddle or the service of the US Marshall before, but that she clings to the memory of it so fiercely. What's horrifying then is not so much the violence of the West but the idealization of that violence. The film closes in a time around the turn of the century, people like Cogburn roosted in Wild West shows for a cheering audience, and Mattie is one of the people who lived to tell the tales. Out of those tales, the western of John Ford and Raoul Walsh emerged to print the legend. In a roundabout fantastic way, the Coens give us the true account, the creation myth behind the western.",

            "content": "True Grit isn't really a remake as such, but as a more faithful take on the novel. And even if it were a remake, it is one of the better ones if so. While I did like the 1969 very much, although I didn't like Kim Darby, this version does make some improvements, such as the pace and Mattie. But it also has some hindrances, the ending is abrupt, and some of the characters perhaps are not quite as intriguing as they are in the 1969 film, Rooster especially has a more somewhat cantankerous personality there.Like all the Coen Bros movies, True Grit is beautifully shot, the scenery is stunning and there are some typically quirky moments in the cinematography. The story is compelling, and the dialogue is surprisingly droll which enhances the bleak atmosphere even more. The direction is superb, Carter Burwell's score is wonderfully atmospheric, the pace is more secure here and the final shoot out which stood out in the 1969 film is glorious. The performances are also really good. Jeff Bridges had the great John Wayne to compete with, not an easy feat at all, and while he is a more monotone Rooster Cogburn he is a revelation charisma and performance wise. Matt Damon impresses too, and Hailee Steinfeld is a big improvement on Kim Darby and comes very close to outshining her co-stars.All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Get the comparisons out of the way, then give the film its due.",
            "content": "Let's get the comparisons with Henry Hathaway's version of the Charles Portis novel out of the way. The Coen Brothers certainly knew that, however much they want to 'go back to the source material,' their film would play against Hathaway's version.The Hathaway version, while tampering with details from the Portis original, remains strikingly true to its story and theme. This is most clear in the dialog - the decision not to tamper with Portis' language was decisive for the making of that film. The Coens' tampering with the novel is more subtle than Hathaway's film, but no less an interpretation.Approaching the characters and composition of the Coens' version without reference to the Hathaway film apparently proved impossible. For instance, the shoot-out at the dug-out cabin was re-written for a night-scene, but the camera angles remain pretty much the high-elevation shots Lucien Ballard provided Hathaway, inter-cut with full body shots of people getting wounded and horses running (etc.)also similar to Ballard's.Two performance stand out as striking examples of reference to the original film. Dakin Matthews seems to struggle mightily not to recreate Strother Martin's interpretation of the horse-trader Stonehill - and fails. Apparently Martin had the character down pat and there's nothing but to reproduce his interpretation. Far more to the point is Barry Pepper's interpretation of the desperate outlaw chief, Ned Pepper - it is pure Robert Duvall. Pepper can only match Duvall's self-aware determination - and he does - but he can't surpass it; nor can he find another interpretation to set off against Duvall's.As for the Coens' own re-interpretation of the Portis novel, what was most noticeable to me were the minor points simply dropped out of the story telling. The most irritating to me were a pair of lapses that are interconnected and combine to make an important point about the characters. 1. We never get to see Mattie tell Rooster that Chaney has linked up with Ned Pepper (later Rooster does remark the fact, but how did he learn of it?); 2 We don't get to hear Rooster's remarking how he shot Pepper through the upper lip (because he was aiming at the lower lip). These two incidents combine to let the audience know that Cogburn's hidden agenda on the Chaney hunt is really Ned Pepper, he and Pepper have something of a feud going on - which information fills out the background detail for their final shoot-out. Except here we don't have that connection.Finally, the whole Mattie - Rooster issue: many critics are saying that Mattie is more at the center here than in the Hathaway picture, which focused attention on John Wayne's Cogburn. Not true. When we add up screen time and lines of dialog, we discover that Mattie not only has as much time and dialog in the Hathaway film but it is in much the same proportion to Cogburn's as in this one. If most remember the Hathaway film as a 'John Wayne film,' that is due simply to Wayne's bravura performance.Well, enough of the comparisons. Does the Coens' version measure up as film worth seeing on its own accord? Yes; we are presented here with a beautiful, frightening, amusing piece of 'Americana.' There are scenes approaching dream-like states, as in the meeting with the bear-man, and during Rooster's desperate drive to get Mattie to a doctor. Hailee Steinfeld is quite engaging, and Matt Damon develops an intriguing complexity that makes one wish he had more screen-time. Bridges' performance is the most problematic - Bridges plays Cogburn as a a kind of whimsical brute - as he rambles on with his life-story on the trail, we get the gnawing sense that, if we were not along for a dangerous manhunt and dependent on his abilities as a master man-hunter, Cogburn would be someone we would not like to know. This develops a distance between the audience and Cogburn that is actually rather on par for the Coens - there are no 'heros' in the Coen universe.Perhaps that's a good thing here. Mattie in her experiences with the wild men of the old west has encountered something larger than her life on the farm could ever get her. These are men who make their own laws and are not bound to statutory codes or biblical decrees, and adapt their own law to the wilds of the frontier that surrounds them. Mattie is a confirmed church-goer with a good lawyer, and if she weren't so determined on her revenge, she would actually be impossibly small-minded and dull. This is a subtext to the novel that both films attempt to convey, but neither quite captures, because it's difficult for any film maker to admit that the central character of the story is the least interesting.The age of such wild-men has passed. It is not that wild-men do not exist - wild-men show up quite frequently in Coen Brothers' films in contemporary settings - but now they are corrupted by moving outside the law and outside the commonplace, they grow sick and psychopathic. The killer in \"Fargo\" feeding the partner he's killed to a wood-chipper is as wild as one could get, but he is no longer larger than life, and evokes only the sickness at the heart of modernity, not any adaptation one would want to live with.We look back at historical moments like those of the Old West because anything seemed possible to them, whereas very little is possible for us. But that might simply be a wishful delusion - and the Coens' clear suspicion that it is really determines the limits of what they accomplish here. They don't present the West as 'it really was,' nor do they present what we want from it, rather they present a disappointment with it. Rooster Cogburn is indeed 'larger than life,' but we wouldn't want to spend any more time with him than we do.",

            "content": "True Grit is not a remake, but a re-imagining. Narrated by Mattie Ross, played by Hailee Steinfeld, who makes her feature film debut, we find Mattie picking up the pieces following the death of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (Brolin). A headstrong girl, Mattie isn't looking for a handout; she's looking for justice. She is directed towards Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), a Federal Marshall whose reputation for shooting his prisoners makes him the right fit for Mattie's cause.She is discovered soon after by LaBoeuf (Damon) who is also looking for Chaney for a crime committed in Texas. Mattie's plan of riding off with Rooster and LeBoeuf are short lived when LaBoeuf refuses to go out into Indian territory with a \"girl.\" Rooster, though reluctant at first, escorts Mattie into the territory.Though I am not familiar with the novel with which it is based on, I would say that the Coens have done the story justice. Though you can't replace John Wayne's take on Rooster, Bridges gives a different, more rugged approach to the character. It wasn't \"The Dude\" or Bad Blake from last year's Crazy Heart. He was Rooster Cogburn the way the Coens wrote it. He doesn't step on Wayne's toes, but rather makes the character his own.One upgrade from the original film (one of several) was Damon's portrayal of LeBoeuf. In the original, Glen Campbell played a much more cooperative LaBoeuf than Damon. Damon is more independent and clashes with Rooster more often. They're chemistry is much more believable and enjoyable.Another major upgrade is the music. Though the original has the classic, big, sweeping score by Elmer Bernstein that many westerns of the day were accustomed to, it just didn't fit the story. It made is much lighter than it needed to be. Carter Burwell, whose previous work for the Coens is simply sublime, gives yet another stellar score, creating just the right mood and tempo. Rooster's charge at the end is accompanied by a wonderful piece of music that brings you right in the saddle with Rooster, guns-a-blazing, hollering and rooting for the good guys. Burwell's sense of both the time period and the mood of the film couldn't have been better.Where would a Coen Brother's film be without some stunning visuals. Roger Deakins, whose work is up there with the best of the day, does a fantastic job capturing the sights of the wild west, in a way that films of the 50s and 60s couldn't do. The way sunlight coats the landscape, snow falling through the trees, and the shadows of a flickering fire are just moments that stand out.Lastly we come to Joel and Ethan, who might be the finest pair of filmmakers working today. They are gifted in telling a story with images and dialogue. Though not working with an original work, still springs off of the screen. Not to mention the performances they get out of their cast is second to none. Everyone is on board for this picture, and it shows.True Grit is a better film than the '69 version. The photography, supporting cast, and all around production is better. Still, I have no doubt that Rooster Cogburn will be remembered as John Wayne, I have to hand it to Jeff and the Coens for putting on a spectacular film, both a delight for the eyes and ears.",

            "content": "Sadly I am one of the very few movie fans that never got around to seeing the John Wayne movie. But I will now remedy that, it will be in my BD player soon. (Edit: I saw it and to me the 1969 original is a better movie, mostly for John Wayne and, although not authentic, the scenes in the Rocky mountains.)The Coen brothers are unique in that each of their movies seems to take a different look and a different tone. Two of my favorites are \"Fargo\" and \"The Man Who Wasn't There.\" Now I will add this one to my list.Arguably the focus of this movie is young Hailee Steinfeld, 13 during filming, as 14-yr-old Mattie Ross. It is 1878 and lawlessness still pervades the west, as defined by Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and New Mexico. Mattie's dad is shot and killed by an outlaw, who also stole his horse and two California gold pieces.Mattie is an unusual 14-yr-old, not one for \"girlie\" pursuits, and with an unusually high intellect, seemingly an expert in law, she takes off for the nearest town to find and hire a US Marshall who will bring the outlaw to justice.There she encounters an unwilling Jeff Bridges as drunkard Rooster Cogburn, who has the reputation for killing the outlaws to avoid the trouble of bringing them in. But Mattie's promise of $100, a fortune back then, gets Rooster on board. She was told that he has \"true grit\" and that is the title reference.Other main characters are Matt Damon as Texas Marshall LaBoeuf, who joins in the search in Arkansas. And the outlaw they seek is Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney, who has joined a gang led by Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned Pepper.I can't praise the casting enough, every one is ideal for their roles, and young Hailee is superb, worthy of the Oscar nomination. The script and cinematography are also superb. Overall a very enjoyable movie.",

            "content": "The least \"Coen\" of all of the Coens films is also one of their finest. It has a few Coen inflections to it (Damon's twang of a voice, a few random mustached characters crossing paths with our heroes) but for the most part it's a lot more straight forward and less humored. Surprisingly this doesn't detract from the film at all, which is a riveting character journey in classic old school Hollywood fashion. And while generally \"old school Hollywood fashion\" would be something I would cringe and run away from, the Coens make it enjoyable, emotional and breathtaking. The technical qualities are all astounding; fantastic costumes, a beautiful score and some of the most exquisite cinematography I have ever seen, courtesy of the always reliable Roger Deakins. It's such an entertaining film, with some emotional power that resonates afterwards. There's a lot of twists that I didn't see it taking and none of the characters ended up being what I initially expected them to be. There's a real lack of obvious arcs for these people and that was a nice surprise. The Coens do what they can to avoid Hollywood conventions in what is, at it's core, a very Hollywood film.Above all else, the film is a character piece and what a wonderful one it is. Unsurprisingly, these people are written very intelligently, given lots of depth and room to grow and surprise. There's a constant battle over what grit truly means and over the course of the film the balance shifts back and forth over which of the three has the truest grit. From the very opening, we see that Mattie Ross has a whole mess of it, this headstrong girl who won't back down to anyone, despite her small stature. Hailee Steinfeld is remarkable here, an actor with talent well beyond her years. She's entirely convincing, taking a character that could have been this annoying little brat and making her simultaneously strong, whip smart, endearing and adorable. I enjoyed watching her in every second. Jeff Bridges was different than I had expected, but I love his arc throughout the film. Maddie goes to him because she believes he has the most grit of all and that he is the right choice for her, but as the journey goes on she doubts her decision and Rooster Cogburn plays with our perception of him quite a few times. Bridges was my least favorite of the three, performance-wise, but that's not a huge slant given how highly I thought of the other two. Matt Damon gets arguably the most interesting role, a character who is detestable when we first meet him and then has the large task of making us realize that he just may have the truest grit of all. LaBoeuf is a silly man who thinks too highly of himself, but as the film progresses it becomes very hard not to care for him. He's a good man at his heart, as are Maddie and Rooster, and it makes it easy to root for all three of them to come out of this alright.This is a film that I enjoyed even more than I thought I would, a Coen film in the most un-Coen of ways (which was a nice change of pace given that their previous effort, A Serious Man, is probably the most Coen film out there). I enjoyed living with these characters very much and wish that there had been more time to just be with them on their journey. The final confrontation with the men they are hunting is turns suspenseful, surprising and a little too short-lived. I didn't much care for the epilogue, but with the wildly entertaining journey that came before it, I can't fault the film that strongly for it. It's a real cinematic piece, surprisingly Hollywood for the Coens, but it doesn't fall into a lot of the traps that it could have. In fact, it does the opposite, jumping into holes where it could become clich\u00e9d and sentimental and then digging it's way out, surprising at every turn. I like that the story doesn't quite end after the basic plot is resolved, because it's not about hunting down the man that killed Maddie's father and hoping to bring him to justice. It's about so much more. It's about these characters and finding out who they really are when it all comes down to it.",

            "content": "Henry Hathaway directed \"True Grit\" in 1969, a routine western with a memorable performance by John Wayne as bastard gunslinger Rooster Coburn. The Coen brothers remade \"True Grit\" in 2010. That film went on to become their biggest box office hit.Much of the new \"Grit's\" financial success \u2013 it took over 200 million dollars at the ticket booths - had to do with the name \"Rooster Cogburn\" having a certain brand recognition. Indeed, polls show much of the film's box office being down to old timers visiting cinemas in droves, desperate to catch a glimpse of the new John Wayne. Cogburn himself is, like Dirty Harry and Paul Kersey, the kind of vengeful, idiotic, super right-wing American hero who shoots first and asks questions later. He's the likable bastard who embodies the American desire for swift, frontier justice. It's no surprise that President Nixon adored the original \"Grit\" and wrote a loving letter to Wayne praising his performance. Cogburn fits Nixon's fantasy image of himself: the outlaw lawman, an American hero who righteously endures a little White Man's Burden, a little barbarism and blame so that order is restored and wrongs are made right. No surprise too that the original \"Grit\" was released at the height of the Vietnam War, its \"shoot first, fix things later\" plot tapping into a kind of cosy fascism.So much of \"Grit's\" box-office seems down to nostalgic Americans looking to reconnect to some more Dirty Harry mythology. Like Scorsese's \"Cape Fear\", another remake which was praised by critics, became the director's highest grossing film, and which time revealed to be total crap, \"Grit\" perhaps also marks the point at which the Coens moved from being outsiders to insiders. No longer cult film-makers, they're now fully embraced by younger generations. Cue money, prestige and much awards.Both \"Grits\" are based on a novel by Charles Portis, and both tell a fairly straightforward tale in which a young girl (Mattie) sets out to avenge the murder of her father. Seeking help she hires Rooster Cogburn - played by Jeff Bridges in this re-adaptation - a hard-drinking Federal Marshal who prides himself on his ruthlessness. By the re-adaptation's end, we learn a message typical of the western genre: an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind and revenge takes its toll on the body and the soul.If you've seen the 1969 film, then the Coens' take is dull as hell. Virtually every scene is the same, the plot unchanged and most sequences replicated without an ounce of imagination or surprise. Whilst the Coens' remake of \"The Ladykillers\" was zany enough to warrant viewing, \"Grit's\" is a decidedly pointless affair, every scene matching Henry Hathaway's merely competent direction blow for blow.Even if you haven't seen the 1969 film, this is a sub-par western. The Coen's fail to convincingly evoke the feel, tone and expansiveness of the West, and for a film called \"True Grit\" the flick is surprisingly spotless, with slick CGI towns, CGI horses, clean, well starched clothes and supremely self-conscious dialogue. Unable to conjure up novel images, the Coens, like Tarantino, also find themselves playing formalist games with words, manicuring every line of dialogue and going to pains to remove all contractions (simple folk of the era used more contractions than we do now).Bizarrely, the Coen's \"Grit\" is typically treated as a \"serious\" and \"authentic\" western. But like \"Fargo\", \"Grit\" is a genre game pretending to be serious but played entirely for laughs. Portis was himself a precursor to postmodernists like the Coens and his novel was itself a work of satire, Portis formalizing western conventions to the point of absurdity. With his flamboyant and purposefully convoluted dialogue, comic business and deadpan humour, Portis took a century of Wild West writing and played prose games with the pieces. But it's been half a century since Portis, the genre now toyed with so much, and the era of sincerity long gone, that modern consumers sadly mistake the Coens' dry retelling as being earnest and Portis' prose as being canonical. But how could anyone miss Barry Pepper's deadpan mimicking of Robert Duvall (from Hathaway's film) and the film's cast of dimwits and buffoons? More than most Coen brothers flicks, \"True Grit\" is very verbose, packed with long winded dialogue, a kind of hillbilly Tarantino speak (a guy falls down, says: \"I am severely injured\") or flowery showing off. As for Cogburn, the Coens erase Hathaway's reactionary ideology almost completely. Where Hathaway offered a traditional revenge movie, the Coens are bound to post-Vietnam genre revisionism. Mattie thus goes through a watered down version of Bill Munny's transformation in \"Unforgiven\", another supposedly \"anti violence\", \"anti revenge\" Western. Elsewhere the film's revenge/hunt themes are treated rather superficially (see the westerns of Budd Boetticher, Anthony Mann, even offbeat westerns like \"Rancho Notorious\" and \"The Bravados\"); Mattie looks like she stepped out of a comic-book, not a world which forged a heart of hate.Of course Bridges is a better actor than Wayne, but his character is nevertheless less interesting and his relationship with Mattie less compelling. Wayne was shown to be violent, mean and alcoholic, but his various ruminations about his wife and past were touching and earned our sympathy. In contrast, Bridges' violence and alcoholism are undeveloped, and he earns no sympathy. He's just another Coen yokel, albeit with added screen time.6.5/10 \u2013 Reflexive cinema squared, behind its gloss this is arguably the worst Coen flick. Some great Jeff Bridges westerns: \"Wild Bill\" and \"Bad Company\". More interesting westerns: \"Open Range\", \"Shotgun Stories\", \"Meek's Cutoff\", \"Lonestar\", \"Lonely are the Brave\", Altman's \"Buffalo Bill\", \"Mccabe and Mrs Miller\", \"Flesh and Bone\" (1993), \"Ride With the Devil\", \"Hombre\", \"Hud\" and \"The Long Riders\".",

            "content": "True Grit (2010) is a new film by Brothers Coen for which they wrote the screenplay based on the eponymous cult western novel by Charles Portis. The novel was first brought to screen back in 1969 with John Wayne as the eye-patched, heavy drinking, trigger happy US Marshall Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn in Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1877, the possessor of \"true grit\" who was hired by a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father and to bring him to justice. During the last two weeks, I saw both films back to back and found them gripping, entertaining and very well made.I did not read the Charles Portis' novel and I can't say I am a big westerns fan even though I've seen and enjoyed some of them but I am a longtime loyal fan of all things Coen and I did not miss a single one of their movies. I sincerely believe that the Coens do not make bad movies for the simple reason they don't know how. True Grit is their first Western, and the first film since 2003 rated PG 13. For many fans that always wait impatiently for their next film, the brothers' choice of the material was a surprise. Coens have only remade one film before True Grits (The Ladykillers), and they never made a pure western before but after watching True Grit, it is perfectly clear that their latest film is a \"true Coens\", the western as only Ethan and Joel could have made it. According to Ethan Coen, before the shooting started, the Coens wanted to make a more faithful adaptation of the novel and to tell the story the way it was told in the book: from the point of view of Mattie Ross, the 14 years old girl who set her mind on hiring the right man for the job of finding and bringing to justice the murderer of her father. The newcomer Halee Steinfeld brings such incredible independence, sharpness, courage, intellect and toughness to the character of Mattie that she more than holds on her own in the scenes she shares with the true stars/talented actors, such as Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper among others. As wonderful as these actors are, this is Halley/Mattie's film, and she owns it from her first appearance.The Coens mentioned that the novel is tough, violent, and funny, and that's how they wanted to adapt it to the screen. I believe that they achieved their goal because their adaptation of the novel is a \"true Coens\" -very dark, violent (I personally could not watch the scene in the snake-pit and had to turn away) yet funny - thanks to another memorable performance from Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn and Coens 'unique dark humor which is in the dialogs and the characters' personalities. The screen chemistry among Bridges, Steinfeld, and Matt Damon as Texas Ranger, who is also in search of Tom Chaney for another murder, is very strong and watching three of them together is the viewers' delight. My only problem with the Bridges' performance is the way he speaks his lines. It was hard to understand what he was saying and some of the Coens'-Portis' writings were lost on me. In this regard, following John Wayne's Rooster was much easier.As always, Coens' cooperation with the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins, produced the film of indescribable beauty and authentic atmosphere of the time long passed. The scene close to the end of the film where Rooster rushes on the horseback to get bitten by the deadly rattlesnake Mattie to the doctor as the day light changes to darkness and the huge surreal stars lit the sky is breathtaking and its beauty brought the tears to my eyes. It is without doubt the most memorable shot in the Coens-Deakins movies for me. I realize that the awards may not be important in order to recognize and to admire Deakins' vision but it was upsetting to find out that in spite of having been behind the camera for dozens of the greatest films from over 20 years, he has never been awarded the Oscar for his work. This is a criminal oversight from the Academy of Motion Pictures and I hope that he will be rewarded for his camera-work in \"True Grit\".Some viewers and critics find he end of the film rushed and somehow abrupt. Wrong. It is a perfect ending to a perfect film; besides, it follows the novel's ending faithfully. It is different from more optimistic final of the older version but both finals fit their films very well.Renowned film critic Roger Ebert wrote about Ethan and Joel Coen's \"Fargo\": \"Films like \"Fargo\" are why I love the movies,\" I would say, it is true about every one of the Ethan and Joel Coens' films including the adaptation of True Grit.",

            "content": "WARNING: If you have a severe phobia about snakes, you might just want to skip this one!WARNING: While no animals were harmed in this production, there is a scene with a seemingly dying horse being killed. Some might want to turn their heads or not watch.WARNING: A lotta folks are very vividly killed in this film. This film is a remake of the 1969 film by the same name. Now, with a new version of the movie in theaters I was intrigued--especially since it was made by the Coen Brothers--and EVERYTHING they make is infused with quality and is worth seeing.I won't bother recapitulating the plot--after all, by now there are a bazillion reviews for this film and the original. Instead, I want to talk about what I liked about the film that make it transcend the genre. Unlike the average western, this one is great historically speaking. As a history teacher, I was thrilled to see a more realistic version of the old west. People wear a wider variety of hats (with more than just the stetson), the clothing colors are much more drab and hair styles are not at all neat--they ALL look like they could use shaves and haircuts--like most people did in the west. Also, there are no stereotypical gunfights on main street and immaculately groomed streets--it's dirty and the killings are without honor--and the deaths are bloody and vivid. I loved this about the film--it lacked the Hollywood glamor that really never existed out west in the 'ol days. The Coens really deserve kudos for this.As far as the acting goes, it was excellent--and again, without glamor. Matt Damon was nice--and a lot more believable than Glen Campbell in the same role. The same can be said for Jeff Bridges--he was excellent. But the best acting was the very restrained and credible acting by Hailee Steinfeld in the lead (though, oddly, she was billed fifth!!). You could easily see why she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress--though, as I said, she really was NOT a supporting but should have been nominated for Best Actress. I don't know WHY teenagers and kids get such billing when they clearly are THE centerpiece of the film like Steinfeld was in this one.Overall, there is really nothing I disliked about the film and think it's among the best westerns I have seen--and the best made in the last few decades. Not to be missed.UPDATE: A week after seeing this, I re-watched the original. Here is what I think:I loved the Coen version and heard what made it so great was that t was so much closed to the original story. Imagine my surprise, then when I saw that the original film was, in many places, practically the same film! So, if you like one you are bound to like the other! However, the films are not exactly alike and each has advantages over the others. So, in an unusual move, I'll list the pluses of each. For the first film, the 1969 version, I think it is better because: 1. The story is original not a remake. It took a lot of work to bring Charles Portis' novel to the screen and Marguerite Roberts did a fine job. In fact, her screenplay was so good that many times the Coens took her exact lines and used them in the remake.2. John Wayne was good. His version of Rooster Cogburn was a lot more like John Wayne than anything else, but he was bigger than life and fun to watch.3. The film took a risk by killing off Glen Campbell at the end instead of sparing his character (like the remake). You might like this. As I did NOT like Campbell's performance at all, this was a serious plus for me! With the remake (2010), I liked it because: 1. It really got the look of the west right. It was much more historically accurate--with more muted colors, guns that were accurate to the time in the film and the costumes were more correct. Now, more correct meant more subdued in color and a lot less glamorous.2. The main character, Mattie Ross, was MUCH better. 13 year-old Hailee Steinfeld was great and nearly the age of the character (a year younger). The original Mattie was too old and a bit whiny--almost like a cute little girl pitching a cute fit periodically. Steinfeld was stronger and more believable.3. Matt Damon was a much better actor than Glen Campbell. I have no idea why, but starting in the late 1950s, John Wayne's westerns often featured pop singers in supporting roles--such as Fabian, Frankie Avalon and Ricky Nelson. While they weren't bad, they were not particularly good in most cases.4. The film looked better. The winter scenes and starkness of the location shoot really stood out and looked great.The bottom line is that both films were very good. If I had to pick one as the best, I'd say it's the new one--but not by much and I am not sure that the new one is THAT much of an improvement to merit the remake. The new one is a bit more graphic, though for a G-rated film the original is awfully adult (with cursing and some somewhat graphic scenes of violence).",

            "content": "When her farmer father is killed by the fleeing Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), exasperated by nothing being done about it, decides to hire someone herself. The man she hires is tough, one-eyed US Marshall Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a boozy lawman who is a law unto himself. Joined by Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Matt Damon), who also seeks Chaney for another crime, the three of them head off into the Indian territory on a quest for justice. When news of a True Grit remake was announced, it was met with the now standard grumbles that accompany any such news. Eyebrows were further raised when it was known that it would be the Coen brothers taking on the job of reworking the much loved, but hardly a genre classic, John Wayne starrer of 1969. After all, who can forget their previous poor foray into remake territory with The Ladykillers (2004)? But after the critical and financial success of their \"contemporary\" Western, No Country for Old Men, the source material for True Grit looked a nice fit for the Coen's, and with them announcing they were to cleave close to Portis' novel, hopes were high of a modern Western fit to sit alongside the likes of Unforgiven in terms of stature and widespread appeal. The film duly delivered. Even though the initial interest in the film was no doubt helped by the ever increasing fan base of the Coen's, True Grit went on to be almost unanimously acclaimed by the critics, making over $200 million in profit Worldwide and garnering 10 Academy Award nominations in the process. For once, all the praise and back slapping is warranted.It's a film where everything just comes together because all the big decisions have been called correctly. From inspired casting, technical prowess and the biggest decision of them all; following the book and telling it from Mattie Ross' perspective, True Grit is as close to perfection as a new millennium Western is going to get. The Coen's have managed to craft a classic old time Western rife with stock genre characters, and infuse it with evocative beauty, mythical tones and Biblical undercurrents. Not forgetting a narrative that is propelled forward by a revenge core and coming of age wonderment. The script pings with lyrical smarts that hark back to an era long since dead, yet bringing with it an elegiac poeticism that plants us the viewers firmly in the period. Helps of course that the source story is so strong from which to launch such delights. Mattie Ross, indomitable at 14 years of age, is forced to grow up faster than should have been needed, and story involves the critical passage of play in her life. Yet as she is awakened to the harsh realities of her era, evidenced by the tragic murder of her father, she also comes to see the flip-side of bad humanity, and it's this, with Rooster Cogburn in tow, that gives the film its key ingredient: big heart. Come the emotional stirrings of the coda at the end of the film, the heart is the organ that feels it the most.There are very few film fans who would deny Jeff Bridges his new found acceptance as a top draw actor, here he cements his reputation with a wonderful turn as old rascal Cogburn. Wisely not channelling Duke Wayne's take on the role, Bridges puts his own stamp on it, playing it lovably slobbish and with a voice gravelled by many years of hard drinking and tobacco smoking. Once the layers start to come off, after being exposed to Mattie Ross' courage and determination, Bridges gives Rooster an emotional depth that didn't seem possible in the beginning. A double hander from Bridges, the end result being a classic case of character acting. He is helped no end by the chemistry with Steinfeld, who in light of it being her first big screen outing, turns in an astonishingly mature performance. She gives Mattie a steely determination, quick of mouth and mind, yet always remaining one inch away from the melancholy brought about by the sudden change in life circumstance. It wouldn't have been hard for Damon to improve upon the inept performance of Glen Campbell as LaBoeuf in the 69 version, but he plays off of Bridges with unassuming ease. Playing the cocky bravado and comedy at just the right tempo, he knows just when to underplay the critical scenes. In support, Brolin as Chaney is just dandy, himself orally challenged, while Barry Pepper, himself a fine character actor, turns in a memorable treat as scuzzy outlaw Lucky Ned Pepper.Rounding out the list of achievements is Roger Deakins and Carter Burwell's respective work. Both of whom are now well established as important pieces of weaponry in the Coen's armoury. With the Coen's favouring a Biblical tint to proceedings, Burwell came up with the idea of playing on hymns and church like flecks to soundtrack the film. An unusual \"score\", it flows sweetly with the narrative. Most potent is the strains of \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" used to form Mattie's theme, fans of The Night of the Hunter will need no introduction to that particular piece. Deakins' photography is gorgeous, and it's not just about capturing sprawling vistas either. His close photographing of bare trees and parched land is pin sharp in detail, while the winter setting that dominates the last quarter lets him showcase the skill of lighting for best possible impact. More memorable, though, is his ability to utilise outdoor light for interior scenes. As touched upon in a sadly too small extra on the home format releases, a court room scene has Rooster cloaked by shards of light, giving him an aura of mysticism to the watching Mattie. A stunning piece of work in what all told is a stunning film. 10/10",

            "content": "For those of you miss the star power of John Wayne, don't think that Jeff Bridges tried to imitate the Duke in this version of True Grit. Though the novel was in fact written with the Duke in mind for the lead it had to be adapted to fit his larger than life movie star image. In this version Jeff Bridges is considerably less than larger than life.As happened back in 1969 in the first version young Mattie Ross played here by Hallee Steinfeld goes to Fort Smith, Arkansas to look for the murderer of her father. She is determined to bring him to justice, but being a young lady barely into puberty she wants a man of True Grit. She seeks out US Marshal Rooster Cogburn of the one eye who has the meanest reputation and that would be Jeff Bridges. Texas Ranger Matt Damon declares himself in on the hunt for the murderer who is played by Josh Brolin. A whole lot of the script is lifted bodily from the 1969 classic with lines given a whole different emphasis. Damon's character is a good deal darker than Glen Campbell's was, he meets up with Mattie Ross as she awakens from a night's sleep as opposed to over the boardinghouse dinner table. That scene can lead to all kinds of speculation for an even slightly prurient mind.Bridges wisely does not attempt to imitate John Wayne, he creates his own Rooster who is menacing enough as he is. It was good enough to get him an Academy Award nomination though not the big prize that the Duke got. But as I said in my review of the 1969 True Grit, Wayne's award was for the work of a lifetime and a tribute to the man who still compels more folks to watch film than any other.What this film really lacks is the colorful supporting players of the first version. I truly enjoyed scenes with Strother Martin dealing with Kim Darby over the horses. Her lawyer J. Noble Daggett is completely eliminated accept for J.K. Simmons over the soundtrack as Steinfeld reads a letter. One of the best scenes in the last film is John Wayne finally meeting John Fiedler as lawyer Daggett who brought that railroad to its knees. And John Wayne's scene with landlord J.W. Kim besting him at gin rummy. They even eliminated the cat General Sterling Price, that's unforgivable.Still I did enjoy the different interpretation Jeff Bridges put on the role and this film will also stand the test of time.",

            "content": "Joel and Ethan Coen's True Grit (2010) is undoubtedly one of the best films I have seen all year. Westerns seemed to have fallen off the wagon in Hollywood these past few decades, but the Coen brothers have truly worked their magic, once again, to resuscitate this genre. In this beautifully constructed Western remake of Henry Hathaway's 1969 version, 14-year-old girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) sets out with an eye-for-an-eye attitude to capture Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who has mercilessly killed her father. In order for justice to be served she teams up with Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a man of \"true grit\" and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). True Grit is simple, straightforward (not words one would typically use to describe a Coen Brothers film), but as usual, it's an f-ing masterpiece. What struck me the most about this film was its skillfully crafted ambiance. Everything presented from the costumes to the settings to the dialogue\u2014 I felt completely immersed in the narrative. Thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins for that visual thrill-ride! It's pretty apparent that Jeff Bridges had some major shoes to fill in his role originally played by John Wayne. It's safe to say it was a job well done. His style was completely powerful in this unforgettable performance. Every step he takes or word he speaks is done with thought. If there was an Oscar for 'baddest ass' Jeff Bridges would clearly hold the title, hands down. I was also quite impressed with Hailee Steinfeld's performance. As a newcomer to the Hollywood scene, she makes it pretty clear she means business. Even next to Damon, Bridges, and Brolin, she holds an extremely professional and talented composure. This is most definitely not the last time we will see her on the silver screen.",

This is a movie making at it's best. Every single aspect of this movie works, works like i haven't seen in a long time. Cinematography by Roger Deakins is amazing. If i wouldn't be a fan of \"Inception\" i would say that this is the best cinematography of the year. And writing of Coens are something... almost brilliant.And once again, J.Bridges, man, dude, you just FEEL his presents on the screen, now THAT is real actor, REAL person man, it's not like these new shining pretty \"Twillight girls/boys\" if you now what i mean.

In that regard, it reminded me of another Coen Brothers film, \"No Country For Old Men.\" The biggest difference between that film and this, however, is the amount of violence. Overall, this western was not very violent; it was mostly dialog-driven. I question whether a child as young as \"Ross\" would have the extensive vocabulary she has in this film, but I sure enjoyed listening to her. Actually, I enjoyed listening to everyone.It's an entertaining re-make and lived up to the hype.",

            "content": "Okay, having seen the entirety of the first filmed version of True Grit on YouTube last night which starred John Wayne and got him his Oscar, I finally watched the recent version that stars Jeff Bridges and is directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. I'll say this right now: Since this one is more closely adapted from Charles Portis' novel and therefore has more details of plot and characterization, I felt this was the better one. Certainly the fact that the Coens are more artistically inclined than the commercially conventional-though still entertaining-Henry Hathaway has something to do with it. Also, Matt Damon gave his LaBoeuf more texture in his portrayal than the \"just read the lines vibe\" of Glen Campbell though since the latter was actually from the southwestern states, he was still adequate enough. And actual young teen Hailee Steinfeld more embodies 14-year-old Mattie Ross than the young adult Kim Darby though the latter was good enough. Likewise, Dakin Matthews compares favorably to Strother Martin as Col. Stonehill, Josh Brolin is a bit more frightening as Tom Chaney than Jeff Corey was, Domhnall Gleeson as empathetic as Dennis Hopper when playing Moon, and Barry Pepper-what a coincidence concerning the same surname for both actor and character-is just as compelling as Lucky Ned Pepper as when Robert Duvall played him opposite The Duke. In fact, Barry sounded just like Duvall so he was perfect. Oh, and while we saw J. Noble Daggett played by John Fiedler in the original, here we only hear him in voice-over as enunciated by J. K. Simmons. And unlike the previous one, this one has an adult Mattie as played by Elizabeth Marvel as she narrates looking back to the events of the movie before we witness her condition at the time of her telling. In summary, this movie deserves the 10 Oscar nominations it got especially those of Bridges, Steinfeld, and the Coens and the music of Carter Burwell was just as compelling as the previous one's Elmer Bernstein. So on that note, this version of True Grit is well worth seeing.",

Against his wishes, she joins him in his trek into the Indian Nations in search of Chaney.They are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who wants Chaney for his own purposes....The first thing that struck me about this remake is how traditionally Coen the movie is. This is there most accessible (highest grossing) movie, and yet none of the wit or charm we come to expect from these geniuses is lost in translation. To be honest, when i heard they were remaking another popular film, i was a little anxious, but then the cast list came, and it settled me.Bridges again is excellent as Cogburn, and although his drawl is very authentic, he is a warm and funny character. He has a knowing swagger about him through the film as if to say 'look at me, i'm one of the most famous movie cowboys' and it's too his credit.But Steinfeld steals the film from everyone. She is classy and exudes intellect whenever she spouts a line, and the fact that she can do deadpan humour is to her credit. Damon is good in his limited role, but i think the film would have been just as good if he were absent.The film is laugh out loud funny at times (although the humour is very black), especially at the initial hanging, and Cogburns reaction to two young children beating on a horse.But it's also very tense and very heartwarming at times.

            "content": "I had never seen the original True Grit when I saw this. I have now seen the original and I am even more certain that this remake is everything it could and should have been. It does not only pay homage to the original and even go so far as to recreate almost identical scenes but adds true grit to the film and I'm not only saying that to be clever. The film is dark and gritty and powerful. The lead performances BURY the original (and yes I know that's blasphemy for Duke fans) but these performances are superior in every way. The Coen brothers took a legendary film (over-rated in my book) and made it their own and brought the story to a whole new generation. I wasn't sure what to expect from The Coen brothers as writers and directors. They are certainly unique and often out there film makers and I have seen some of their films but certainly not all of them. Sometimes I think they go too far to be 'unique' but there is no doubt their style and substance and ideas fit True Grit like a glove.Certainly I was most excited to see the legendary Jeff Bridges in the role of Rooster Cogburn. He was magnificent. His performance was a little more subtle than I expected it to be but his one eyed growling drunken ranger was terrific. He has some amazing moments in the film and leads the cast flawlessly. However, after saying all that he is not the best performance in the film. I believe the moral behind True Grit is that while the young girl whose father is murdered is looking for someone with 'true grit' to help her find the killer when in fact she is the one with true grit and no one proves that more than the absolutely mind blowing, Oscar nominated performance by Hailee Steinfeld as the fast talking, brilliant, incorrigible, Mattie Ross. Steinfeld gives what I think is one of the performances of the year at least. She destroys the performance of the original actress Kim Darby who I thought was not good at all. She was robbed of this Oscar!! Matt Damon plays a supporting role as Texas ranger LaBouef. He does a solid job and him and Bridges have good solid chemistry but he is a little underused but then I felt like LaBouef was overused in the original so I guess this balances out. Josh Brolin plays a very small role as the object of their search, Mattie's father's murderer Tom Chaney. He does a good job but his role is very small and he doesn't stand out in the cast.The three main characters just click so well together and have this amazing chemistry that they truly carry the film. As good as the direction, cinematography, and writing is the cast carries this film and makes it what it is. It is astonishing to see Steinfeld hold her own and even surpass both Damon and Bridges like an absolute pro. This is really her big screen debut and she isn't 21 playing 14, she was actually 14 during this film. If you love Westerns, or drama, or just a tightly wound thriller you will love True Grit. It really has a little of something for everyone who loves the genre and if you have never seen the original just skip it and aim for this incredibly superior remake. 9/10",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, True Grit is a good movie. In a time when most films seen in cinemas are made for teenagers, it can appeal to anybody regardless of age. The gunfights (not much) and talking (a lot) give it a nice pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat while not being chaotic enough to confuse your father.Mattie Ross is a 14-year old girl who gets a US Marshal Rouben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help her track down and bring to justice her fathers killer (Brolin). Tom Chaney is also pursued by a Texas Ranger by the name of LaBeouf (Matt Damon), who wants to punish him for the crimes committed by him back in Texas.***Spoilers start here, i guess.*** While the movie starts at slow and a little bit annoying pace, it soon picks up after our unlikely team leaves town. The director was obviously well aware of the saying that chasing a hare isn't about catching it but about the chase itself. True Grit makes you want to catch Tom Chaney along with it's heroes, but when they do actually get him, it does not give you the expected satisfaction. That is weird, because the character was obviously supposed to be given a personality. When he talks to Mattie you might even reconsider thinking about him as the bad guy - The bandits have emotions and Tom gets desperate after his team leaves him. But then, he quickly reverts to his \"I'm this pictures' villain!\" pose, tries to kill the girl and gets shot. Boom, that's it. Not even any last words that would make him more human and less two-dimensional. Nope. He gets shot point blank with a rifle. That's it. The force of the bullet causes him to fall off a cliff (Not very naturally, too) and that is the last time you see him. Did he have a personality? Or was he just trying to get Mattie to lower her guard? We'll never know.Then, suddenly, a plot hole appears! It seems Mattie and Rooster have to leave LaBeouf, because he DOESN'T HAVE A HORSE! Yup, that's right. It doesn't matter much that he just shot a bandit off a mount 400 yards away, and that the horse is still standing there, saddled and ready. No. Instead, Rooster and Mattie (now bitten by a handy plot device, rattlesnake!) ride her horse to death and end up in a middle of a field. Cogburn, a weak old man then proceeds to carry the girl in a scene that was surely envisioned as touching, but still makes you wonder about why exactly didn't they take the horse with them (or LaBeouf, for that matter). If you can ignore some plot points that don't feel right and the general lack of soundtrack in most scenes, you will find yourself captivated by the plot of True Grit, a motion picture that is by no means mediocre. Great acting skills of not only the main characters but supporting cast (such small roles as Dakin Matthews who argues with Mattie about a price of a horse) make it a memorable experience that I will be happy to watch again some time. You will enjoy it as long, as your expectations aren't too high.",

            "content": "If there's something to be said for classicism, it's certainly proved in Joel and Ethan Coen's 2010 Western drama True Grit. The adventure begins in 19th century Arkansas, where 14 year old tough-as- nails cowgirl Maddie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) sets out to avenge her father's murder at the hands of outlaw Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). With the most relentless local bounty hunter by her side in Reuben J. Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), she is determined to bring justice to her cause. Complications arise when the pair cross paths with the hotshot LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), a Texas Ranger who is confidently taking aim at the same man. After a series of alliances and realignments Maddie finds herself face-to-face with Chaney; her quivery hand clutching a silver pistol and her mind wrestling with the most important decision yet.True Grit is a more than worthy successor to it's 1969 predecessor, as the Coen Brothers have followed more strictly the original 1968 novel by Charles Portis. The retention of the female narrator gives the plot an intimate personal aspect, encouraging the audience to root for Maddie throughout her adventure.Hailee Steinfeld is a surprisingly mature newcomer to the screen, holding her own next to the incomparable talents of Bridges and Damon. With cowboys, outlaws, gun fights and plenty of hard boiled dialogue, True Grit is a classically made conventional western, whose brilliantly raw cinematography transports the audience to the dusty plains of the old west; a land of revenge, passion and grit.",

            "content": "This must be the least \"Coenish\" of the 10 or so movies of Ethan and Joel Coen that I have seen. At first impression it is a straight-forward adaptation of Charles Portis's novel, including the use of much original dialogue which is distinguished by its lack of crude language. It is not a remake of the 1968 film for which John Wayne got an Oscar for best actor, though Jeff Bridges has been nominated as best actor for his take on the same character, Rooster Coburn. I thought he mumbled too much, but was otherwise very impressive.Several things stand out. One is the sumptuous production values \u2013 the 19th century frontier is painstakingly re-created and the rugged landscape captured. Another is the authentic dialogue, even though one of the characters, the vengeance seeking 14 year old, Mattie Ross (a very convincing Hailee Steinfeld) is wildly improbable. The story itself, the hunt for the father's killer, is told without too much contrived drama, though there are some suspenseful moments and a certain amount of bloody action. The film is also beautifully paced. Some may find the opening scenes in Fort Smith drag a bit, but they are essential to the realisation of the characters. As the search gets under way there is enough action to keep us interested.The wild west is long gone and westerns are no longer fashionable, though the Coens did a successful modern version of one in \"No Country for Old Men\". The rugged frontiersman, of which Rooster is a shining example, is no longer a heroic figure. They were brutal times - justice was rough and public hangings frequent \u2013 and Rooster was no better than he ought to be. Yet he is capable of heroism, unlike his opponents (leaving aside Indians, who do not feature in this story).The relationship between Rooster and Mattie evolves from service provider - customer to something more like father \u2013 daughter. At least you feel she is the sort of daughter Rooster could be proud of. But in the end he is too emotionally stunted to persevere and he slips out of her orbit.Anyway, this is a very fine \"late western\" and very entertaining. But it reminds us that myths fade, and what was admirable 50 years ago may be semi-barbaric today. \"How the West Was Won\" is a bit like Bismark's sausages. Its better not to watch them being made.",

But somehow all these fine elements didn't ever seem to come together - I kept waiting for it to happen and it never did except in the most slap-dash and corny way. Even the last scene failed to ring true: it was possible to suspend disbelief over Mattie's character for the sake of letting the young actress show her stuff and the director to add a curious dimension to the character, but in the end I didn't care about her at all.There was a real tension being built up to the confrontation with the villain but from then on the move just seemed to run out of gas and depend on clich\u00e9s to get it thru to the down-beat ending.Cinematography was excellent, script was good, cast was good, but somewhere in there the directors lost interest and failed to do a professional job of making a movie.",

What they are able to do is take us to the edge of a genre, showing us the limits and the outside while at the same time exploiting the mechanics of what we know is simple machinery. It is not the sort of self-aware or ironic stance that lessor filmmakers use. It is the balance that appeals because it gives us the visceral pleasures we seek with the satisfaction of knowing what is happening.What they accomplished with Bridges in Lebowski may not fully be appreciated in the future, because the conceptual hooks they hang from change over time. The film will likely be remembered as a string of quotes and be clumped with \"Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" But it changed things in an essential way.They like challenges, these brothers, and are not afraid of failing. But failed they have here. The problem has nothing to do with their skills; it comes instead from the fact that the western genre has ceased to be a genre. There are no edges to take us to, no novelty in proving to us that they can stretch and exploit because the western is where it was done first.Here is an example. In a powerful Coen film, the \"crossing\" scene would work. Our spunky girl has decided to risk her life swimming a river with her newly acquired horse rather than be left out of the story. Deakins dives fully into the genre. Burwell's score is pure; both call up John Ford. This is as deep as it is possible to go. Meanwhile, our two men who will compete as observers are together for the first time watching. This is typical Coen and it always works, but not here.Even Kevin Costner did this. It is hard to convey energy when you know someone like Costner can get the same from the convenience store shelf.Bridges isn't up to this. I don't know who could be, but he fails. You are constantly aware that he is trying to walk and speak outside his range because that is what he has been told to do. He actually pulled off a similar challenge: loser country singer in a genre similarly at risk, but country singing has denial of reality built in, whereas the Coens depend on recall of its coldness.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

            "content": "Going to any Coen Brothers is always unpredictable and a sure treat. Their films have always given the audience their money's worth, with intelligent storytelling (not overwritten, but suitable to their themes and situations). They are artists who don't regard their audiences as a focus group, but as men, women, and children who yearn to see an intelligent, exciting, and literate cinematic experience. For years, they have made amazing films such as \"Fargo\", \"No Country for Old Men\", and \"Raising Arizona\", exploring and succeeding in just about any type of genre. I'm dying to see what they'd achieve with Science Fiction. Their second turn at exploring the American West is practically a flawless enterprise, a beautiful, haunting, funny, and exciting movie, a story with heart, a solid intelligent storyline, and terrific acting, one that introduces the birth of a very talented performer, a 14-year old young woman who someday will become a star, Ms. Hailee Steinfeld, in her movie debut, something that appears an unbelievable feat since she has only done shorts and TV shows until now.Steinfield commands the screen with her perfect diction, and she matches every single performer with her understanding of her character, an intelligent and precocious teenager who wants to avenge her father's murder. In a few words, the film is about her quest and the various situations she encounters along the way. She realizes from early on it's impossible to complete her mission with a professional's assistance, and she engages the services of Mr. Rooster Cogburn, (Bridges giving another sensational performance).As they reach the climatic scenes, we are treated to a series of episodes and vistas rarely seen in recent Westerns. Here is a movie that gives us the feeling of taking a virtual trip to the Old West, a place full of the stereotypes so prevalent in this film, but exquisitely and masterfully presented and shot through the eyes of Roger Deakins outdoing his previous work. Here are desolate vistas, births of new towns, a palpable depiction of the tough, lawless early days of the Western frontier. We see the recreation of the growing settlements, the restrictive gender situations and social differences. No detail has been left out or spared. It takes almost a documentary feel, but this is contrasted with the realistic approach and the attention to the speech of the times. Yes, the words and their delivery was different. People went beyond \"see ya\" or \"talk 2 u, 2\" back then. They knew specific terms for particular emotions and items, and though a bit unsettling at first, it's very impressive how the young Hailee Steinfeld completely commands the screen whenever she is in front of the camera and must speak her part.The film is not a staid work of art; it's a living, pulsating, and very exciting piece to see, something that will delight just about everyone in the audience, with the depiction of our heroes' quest for justice. As they get to know each other, meet good and bad characters, face the harshness of the world they live in, we are constantly in awe of the beauty and emotion in every frame of the film.There is one remarkable scene after another: the trial that introduces Cogburn, her exchange with the businessman to settle her late father's accounts, visiting the undertaker, her first realization she is now in the midst of a battle for survival, where the only way out is a life or death move. The closing scene has a haunting quality, a suitable ending to a film that is both intimate and epic, a scene that shows the mythical quality of the West and how we recollect the essence of the soul that is a true American genre. A few years ago, one film try to demystify these qualities, and it impressed many, but it almost killed the beating heart of this type of films. The Coens have in their own unmistakable way given it its due rebirth, and it is bright, strong, and full of the right feelings. Here is a movie to enjoy and treasure, easily one of the best ever made.",

            "content": "I watched these two films consecutively, Coen brothers' remake first, Henry Hathaway's original came second. Overall, Coen brother's remake outshines the original in almost every aspect (which should not be too proud of thanks to the evolution of technology and mankind in these 40 years), its bleak locale disturbs more than the yellow-hued original version in guarantee a sense of grueling western lifestyle, particularly by several supplemental sketches such as the bear man and the hanging corpse. The resurrection of western genre has tumbled through a long and bumpy way, sometimes it seems to be a pipe dream because we all admit time is a ruthless bitch, but in the hands of Coen brothers, the clicking steps are by far the firmest one to satisfy our nostalgia for that era (who could forget NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN?).It's hard to believe that TRUE GRIT actually is my first John Wayne's film if my memory doesn't fail me (which partially testifies that Western film usually is not my cup of tea), also I discovered it got Wayne an Oscar winning for Best Actor, which honestly speaking, is far from academy's normal criterion, the performance is particularly unexceptional, to me it's rather a tribute to his entire career, which is a stock and unfair trickery using by the academy (Paul Newman for example), Jeff Bridge's interpretation also doesn't take my breath away as well, mainly because his weird accent does bug me a lot. The original version is more or less an eulogy towards Wayne's iconic heroism image, his absolute priority in the film never shivers, and releases a much more amiable stance all the way till the end, and in the remake, Bridge's Rooster is excelled by the audacious poise of Mattie (an awe-stricken 14-some Hailee Steinfield), whom I insist putting in the leading actress category (in both versions). Mattie's precocity indeed shows off two divergent impressions in two films, the original one is slightly obnoxious and naive in order to cast a comparison to elect a more morally agreeable image for Rooster, while the latest one maintains a tug-of-war between Mattie and Rooster, demonstrating a contemporary ethos of our generation.LaBoeuf is a character devoid of any further exploitation in both versions. A rookie Glenn Campbell in the old version serves merely as an eye-candy (the weakest link amongst the trinity); in Coen's version it adds some intermitted gusto to the lone pair by taking several French leaves, both times he acts the role as the savior, but ended in different ways. The plots are almost identical, apart from LaBoeuf's denouement, another major modification is the ending, Mattie sacrificed one arm to pay the price of her own willfulness in the remake, which I must applaud for its intrepidity (although I should not be too much surprised because of its under Coen brothers' name tag), the true grit not only sprouting in their films, also within themselves. As for John Wayne's version, hardly a masterpiece, but still a solid one to catch my breath within its lengthy duration, one fringe benefit is that it successfully arouses my curiosity of his other noteworthy films!",

Rooster and Mattie are at each other's throats from the beginning. Like Kim Darby's character, she has her agenda, her pot of cash, and won't take no for an answer. What follows is a series of episodes with the two searching for something they own within themselves. There are excellent bad guys, lots of plot twists, and a not-so- competent protagonist. There is little restraint which forced the former effort to be a bit sanitized. Here no punches are pulled. Of course, we don't have the Duke this time. He hit his stride in the first effort. But he always seemed a caricature to me anyway. After all, he pretty much plays John Wayne in everything he does. This is a more balanced effort where we don't transfer expectations to the main character from previous exposure.By the way, if you get a chance, read the book. It will give you some good insights.",

In truth I am not an uncritical admirer of their output,a fair amount of which is - in my view - cinema for Philosophy Majors,not for the ordinary man or woman in the Multiplex.I found \"No Country for Old Men\" tremendously overblown with comic book performances and pretensions towards turning a good novel into a work of significant art;which it wasn't. Happily they left their tendencies towards self - importance behind with \"True Grit\" which is funny,touching,exciting and a little bit clever,but not too much. Pwersonally I loved the speech patterns that made it sound as if they had hired Jane Austen as script consultant,they emphasised that the movie,with its timeless theme of revenge was set in the past despite the sentiments being bang up to date. Mr Jeff Bridges is extraordinarily good as Reuben Cogburn,ornery,drunk, violent,dishonest and a cold - blooded killer when necessary,but - somehow - and Mr Bridges conveys this wordlessly - courageous,loyal and resourceful. The whole ensemble cast is remarkable. The Coens' West.much like their Fargo,is a bleak unforgiving place where human warmth is not abundant.Cogburn,Ross and LeBoeuf are cold and determined but eventually their mutual need binds them together in a perhaps rather unlikely fashion. As a Brit I find it inexplicable how a pedestrian and over - acted movie like \"The King's Speech\" could be considered superior to this imaginative and brilliantly written one,but hey...what do I know?",

It was one of the most authentic westerns I've ever had the privilege of viewing, and I am a die-hard western aficionado, and true-west historian. The costumes, the buildings, the interiors, and the dialogue were so meticulously crafted that I felt entirely immersed in a world long since forgotten, and often misunderstood. The acting was unbelievable as you'd expect from such established, accomplished thespians, but Hailee Steinfeld was a revelation, holding her own, if not carrying the entire film on her relatively small shoulders. The Brothers Coen have justified their choice to adapt Charles Portis' novel, not remake the John Wayne classic. The impact, and visceral reality of life in such places and times, coupled with the abrupt, brutal violence is something you didn't fully grasp in the grandstanding, heroics of the 1969 version. I applaud the Coens for exercising restraint and understatement to allow the scenes and the situations to breathe and take there natural course. Overall, it was an amazing cinematic experience that truly transports the viewer to a very real and fully realized time and space that crackles with fire and true grit.",

However, the best acting in the entire film was done by Hailee Steinfeld. Hailee plays the role of Mattie Ross and she is incredible. She really is 14 and held her own with the likes of Damon, Bridges, and Brolin. This film was an excellent western and comedy. There were several times that the theater was filled with laughter.

            "content": "Building your expectations too high for a Coen Brothers movie often leads to disappointment. After striking out for most of the decade, the pair struck gold with the unflinching power and intensity of No Country for Old Men. They followed up with two films, Burn After Reading and A Serious Man, that were just sad disappointments in comparison. So now we have True Grit, which packs one of the best trailers of the year and marks their first film with Jeff Bridges since the cult classic The Big Lebowski. But should you build yourself up for greatness, or prepare for the worst? Thankfully, True Grit makes you almost completely forget the Coens have made anything since No Country.The father of the young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) has been murdered in cold blood by outlaw Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She wants Chaney brought to justice, but obviously cannot do the job herself. So she hires a U.S. Marshal, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help in her quest. A Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), has been hired to bring Chaney in on other charges, and together the three head into Indian country to find the outlaw and bring him in, dead or alive.Visually astounding. Those were the words that echoed through my head throughout True Grit. While the Coens have created many period pieces before (likely just as many as they have modern films), this film seems like their most elaborate and detailed to date. The costumes, the sets, the accents \u2013 everything is impeccably created to deliver a sense of gritty realism and authenticity. It may be a western made now, but it could easily stand beside any number of westerns made over a half century ago. The camera's attention to detail is unsurpassed, and the sweeping vistas of the mountains and forests are simply gorgeous. Coupled with the rather magnificent score, the look and feel of the film may just be their most ambitious work yet. I have never been one to be a fan of westerns, but this film easily makes me have a greater appreciation for the genre.The script is fairly well done as well. Everything we have come to know the Coen Brothers for is here: plenty of light and dark humour, a script filled with a wealthy amount of exposition (almost too much), a rather tightly knit story revolving around an odd cast of characters (and even more bizarre supporting characters), and a surprising amount of graphic violence. You know you are in the hands of master filmmakers the moment the production company logos disappear, and easily forget this is a \"reimagining\". The blatant western setting does not deflate any of the usual Coen traits. Instead, it enhances them, and brings to light where their styles and ideas have been inspired from. They really are unique filmmakers, and this film merely helps cement that fact even further.But even with the script praise, I take a bit of an objection to how slow the first hour of the film is. I know the Coens like to toy with their audience, and revel in letting their films really simmer until they boil over. But they also know how to keep a film moving at a kinetic pace, barely breaking or waiting for action and reaction. They really do not have a breakeven point, and while the first half moves at the speed of smell, the second half moves along with such ferocity and vigor, that it almost feels like they could not decide how they wanted to cut the film together. This never ruins the film, but it lessens the lasting effect of the film. I wanted to love each and every moment of the film, but the slow pace just easily could have been amended to not feel so agonizing in some sequences.I was rather flabbergasted by the PG-13 rating for the film, based on the Coens' track record. But rather inexplicably, the film still manages to be a fairly violent affair. People are shot, hung, stabbed and maimed, and the camera captures it all. One particular scene in a small log cabin stands out particularly as a pure moment of Coen bliss. It never lingers and never appears to have been compromised in the editing room, but the film still manages to fit in an unconventional amount of blood for a non R-rated film. While this may be yet another flub by the MPAA, it also shows that the pair has matured as filmmakers to the point where they do not need the gratuitous violence they usually stand beside to tell their tale.Acting wise, the film is solid across the board. Bridges brings his A-game, and proves his long deserved win for Crazy Heart was not a fluke. He is great as Cogburn, twisting easily between loving father figure and crazy old drunk with ease. It was great to see a bit of The Dude shining through too. Despite only showing up every so often, Damon does fairly well for himself in his first Coen role. He looks very at home with the material, and makes his presence known in every scene. Much the same goes for relative newcomer Steinfeld, whose work here is just excellent. She is a determined and nearly obsessed young woman, and she holds her own against every member of the cast (and also owns all of the best moments in the film). I just wish they used Brolin and a nearly unrecognizable Barry Pepper a lot more often.I am still unsure how to feel about True Grit a day after seeing it, but can say I was very pleased to see the Coens return to what worked in No Country for Old Men. It is a visually astounding and ambitious film that is imperfect, but still manages to be very good. Time to seek out more westerns.8/10.",

You guys should google the latter - it was pretty hilarious in its time :) True Grit 2010 was on my Watchlist for a long time but I never got around to watching it until recently. I am amazingly surprised!! Also, I was barely familiar with Hailee Steinfeld and from the start I kept wondering \"who in the heck is this SOLID, young, actress?!?\".True Grit 2010 is highly entertaining for many different reasons, it has an interesting plot & story & information about the old, wild west, includes some formal dialogue, great scenery, violence, and there's NO SEXUALITY REQUIRED which is RARE for Hollywood these days. The movie is ALSO entertainingly & wittingly FUNNY for a NON-comedy and often makes you \"LOL\" -- I LOVE THIS PART\u203c:)Within the first few scenes Hailee's (and others') acting reels you in, hook, line, & sinker, you immediately sense \"OK this is a high quality production\", and then you stay engaged & entertained for the remainder of the movie. Hailee also keeps up and on par with long term, distinguished actors like Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. Trust me on this. The character of Mattie Ross encompasses a pivotal role, of course, and is responsible for \"carrying\" the movie from start to finish.Afterwards I did some research and it turns out they auditioned around 15,000 actresses to play the character of Mattie Ross and Hailee herself had to audition around 1/2 dozen times. After all that they certainly selected the PERFECT actress for the part\u203cWay to go Hailee ~ it's awesome that from such a young age you discovered your true calling and NOW the world's your oyster! You're very well suited for \"unique\" roles, and movies from DIFFERENT ERAs, especially the past. Try to get roles from different and interesting genres, but ALWAYS MAKE SURE the screenplay is outstanding, the writing & production teams are extremely professional & first class, and team up with co-stars that are talented & distinguished actors. AVOID crappy plots, stories, and futuristic parts. You're gonna have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before you know it :)Good Job Folks\u203c Do you know which other movies Hailee Steinfeld gives a similar solid performance?

            "content": "Who says that \"true grit\" describes Rooster Cogburn first and foremost, and that Hailee Steinfeld deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination? Utter nonsense! The titular character is Mattie Ross and, portraying this 14-year old girl with true grit, 13-year old (at time of filming) Steinfled should get a nomination in the Best Lead Actress category. But this is good. She is now among the three highly favoured (the other two being Helena Bonham Carter and Melissa Leo), while against formidable Natalie Portman she would have had no chance.This is a good old heroic western just like what people saw back in the fifties and sixties, and the Coen Brothers even go to the extent of traditional technique of repeating things several times lest you fail to notice \u2013 the bit about the snake bite that is so vital in elevating the already excellent movie a notch higher.The movie opens with biblical overtone that befits a wild western town, where Mattie comes to identify and claim her murdered father. No time is lost in establishing her as a deserving \"true grit\" character \u2013 spending a night in a funeral home with a bunch of dead bodies awaiting burial, as well as hard-as-nail negotiations to get a fair settlement of the last deal her father made. In this as well as in all subsequent confrontations, her final court of appeal (both figuratively and literally) is that \"I have a good lawyer\". The rest of the story is generally known. She persuades a kindred spirit, another \"true grit\" character Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), with both eloquence and fifty dollars, to help hunt down her father's murderer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Forming the odd trio is Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who has an agenda of his own, to bring Chaney back to Texas where he can claim a reward.Bridges is good as ever and if he wins an Oscar (which seems unlikely), it would be back-to-back. It would also make history (although I'm not 100% sure) with the same movie character - Rooster Cogburn - fetching two different actors a Best Lead Actor Oscar (the other being John Wayne in 1969). Damon, being Damon, is not material for a mere comical sidekick. He elevates LaBoeuf from a flat stereotype to a role with character. But all eyes should be on Steinfled. Looking uncannily like Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\", she delivers an alternative version of Dorothy, with the same true grit, but also cool as a cucumber, if need be. And yet, at the same time, she also delivers a 14-year-old girl. She does all this splendidly, and without succumbing to excess bravado. Another talented actor, Borlin, is under utilized but I'm not complaining.The titillating dialogue is as expected from the Coens. You have to smile when you hear Mattie complimenting Rooster, when they are in a tight corner, by \"you have poise\". When LaBoeuf is dejected, being injured and losing the trail of the Chaney, he laments \"I am considerably diminished\". The movie is beautifully shot, generally in a soothing warm light brownish hue. It doesn't go overboard with spectacular landscapes, but they are there. This is uncharacteristically main-stream for the Coens but you do get a heart-breaking sequence close to the end that is sublimely poetic.More please.",

His death makes the outcome of the journey more bleak - the attempt to bring Chaney to justice costs yet another life - and makes Cogburn's rescue of Mattie especially urgent. It gave extra texture to what had seemed like amusing superficiality in Glenn Campbell's original performance. I wondered whether star-status made the Coens, or their money-men, think \"we can't kill Damon off - his public wouldn't accept it.\" Result: LaBoeuf's presence becomes mere comic relief, and this version of the film is weakened.I wish Tommy Lee Jones had been given the part rather than Jeff Bridges. Anyone who's seen Lonesome Dove or In the Valley of Elah (or No Country for Old Men) knows that Jones would have made a brilliant Cogburn, free of the Dude-ish baggage which burdens Bridges. And I wish also that the Coens had used that boarding-house scene from the original in which Mattie, after all her pugnacious bravery, at the livery stable and with Cogburn, cradles her dead father's pocket watch and weeps, becoming a little girl again. Kim Darby made that moment real, and it lent extra power to her resolve when Cogburn and LaBoeuf tried later to ditch her. The Coens let Hailee Steinfeld look sad, but mere sadness isn't enough, and the opportunity was lost. Much to appreciate and think about in the look of this version, but some sense of the opportunities missed.",

            "content": "\"True Grit\" is the Coen Brothers' most heroic, straight forward tale, and for me their most satisfying. I read that Directors and Writers Joel and Ethan Coen were passionate fans of the novel by Charles Portis. Their \"True Grit\" is more a reverent homage of the novel, than a remake of \"True Grit\" starring John Wayne, who won an Oscar for his role as U. S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn. Jeff Bridges powerfully assumes the role of Rooster. Still retained is the magnificent heroic arc as Rooster screams, \"I aim to kill you!\" as he rides his horse, guns blazing in both hands taking on 4 outlaw killers. Where the original \"True Grit\" took liberties with the book (which I was not aware of previously), the Coens' remain true to the cannon, including the first person narrative of Mattie Ross\u2014this time with Hailee Steinfeld reprising Kim Darby's role. Newcomer 14 year-old Steinfeld is amazing. Matt Damon solidly plays Texas Ranger LaBoeuf\u2014the Glenn Campbell role. Damon is such a versatile actor.In the original \"True Grit\" John Wayne won his Academy Award for playing his larger than life self as Rooster Cogburn with ease and grace. Contrastingly, Jeff Bridges authentically inhabits Cogburn as the drunken broken down man coming to terms with his own mortality, who still possesses the vestiges of grit. Bridges is inspired as the reluctant powerful protector. Young Hailee Steinfeld is a revelation. Steinfeld understatedly captures Mattie, who is also 14 years-old. She is no nonsense precocious and razor sharp. One can discern her disarming intelligence in her eyes. She displays this in a whimsical scene where she diffuses an argument between Bridges and Damon. She commands the Coens' dialogue with such \u00e9lan.Mattie seeks vengeance for the murder of her father by Tom Chaney (strong Josh Brolin). Chaney is in asylum with outlaw Ned Pepper (grungy evil Barry Pepper) and his crew in the Indian Nations, so only U.S. Marshalls have jurisdiction to apprehend fugitives there. Therefore, Mattie hires Marshall Cogburn, because he has \"true grit\". Mattie aims to see Chaney hanged in her home state or brought back dead. Steinfeld is brilliant as the teen unknowingly forfeiting her innocence for revenge with her eyes wide open. She naturally balances the stridence of youth, and the painful vulnerability of youthful ignorance. As often as she has Bridges and Damon on their intellectual heels, she is beholding to them for her very life. And Steinfeld lets us know that as well.The Coens' envision \"True Grit\" as stark and barren existential treatise. Our heroes weather the harsh winter storms and lifeless wastelands as they track down their wanted man. The cinematography of Roger Deakins is beautiful and mesmerizing. Paradoxically, \"True Grit\" is rock solid with stellar performances, but not awesome. Hailee will probably win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (strange in that she occurs as the lead). Their \"True Grit\" asymptotically approaches the masterpiece of Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\", but never touches.I think I have decoded the Coens' operating practice\u2014at least for me. As opposed to T.S. Eliot, the world does not end with a bang; it just ends. The end may be the undoing of the Coens' \"True Grit\". There is certain hollowness. I loved the 1969 \"True Grit\" including the heroic hokum. In the amazing epilogue Kim Darby's Mattie has a touching conversation with Wayne's Cogburn at her father's snow covered grave. Every time I see that I am in tears. The Coens' \"True Grit\" has a lyrical eloquence and resonance. However, it fails to touch your soul.\"True Grit\" is masterfully sculpted, uncompromising storytelling, and amazingly entertaining. Jeff Bridge is powerful. Hailee Steinfeld is awesome. That being said, \"True Grit\" comes up a little short in touching and inspiring. Ultimately, what is disappointing is that \"True Grit\" fails to touch your heart. Understandably, touching the heart is relative and local. And it is still the most noble intention of all.",

            "content": "Ethan and Joel Coen, more famously known as the Coen Brothers, team up with Jeff Bridges twelve years after he starred as The Dude in the Coens' \"The Big Lebowski\" and with Josh Brolin three years after he starred as Llewelyn Moss in the Coens' Academy Award winning \"No Country for Old Men\", to create their newest classic, \"True Grit\". The film is both a remake of the classic 1969 western starring John Wayne in his Oscar winning role and is based off of the 1968 book with the same name by Charles Portis. The film is all about the dialogue within the screenplay and furthermore the attention to detail in each perfectly crafted word by the Coen brothers. The film begins with a shot of Mattie Ross's (Hailee Steinfeld's debut movie role) dead father on the ground after being shot in cold blood by a man named Ton Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie Ross will stop at nothing to avenge her father's death and to fulfill the film's tagline \"Retribution\". She tracks down the meanest and most ruthless U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to hunt down Chaney. She also receives help from Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) along the way as they pursue Chaney and Lucky Ned Pepper's (Barry Pepper) gang. \"True Girt\" is a modern western that acts as a throwback to the classic 1940s, 1950s western film.Nominated for 11 Critic's Choice Awards, \"True Grit\" is a great movie all over the board. However, there are two aspects of the film that stand out the most: 1) The Acting and 2) The Coen Brothers. Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld have been receiving their fair share of award nominations for their performances, while Matt Damon, Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper have been recognized for their solid performances as well. Jeff Bridges has the potential to get back to back Best Actor Oscar nominations and even win back to back Oscars and Hailee Steinfeld could clean up all of the Best Young Actress Awards along with capturing either a Best Actress of Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars. However, the most surprising performance in the film is Matt Damon's. I for one was very excited to see him casted as LaBoeuf, but was also very skeptical to see him in a western playing a Texas Ranger. Needless to say Matt Damon was great! The cast is able to flourish because they had a lot to work with provided by the Coen Brothers. The screenplay that they wrote is one of the best of the year and is almost as sophisticated as \"The Social Network\" going hand in hand with their unique directing style.There really isn't much wrong with the film. The film starts out slow, but this is on purpose as it builds up slowly overtime until you are placed into the fast paced thrilling action sequences. The film gets better and better as you keep watching, however, the ending is actually kind of a letdown after the really strong beginning and middle. The film ends very abruptly, but I guess the Coen Brothers are known for making films with weird endings. Exhibit A \"No Country for Old Men\".\"True Grit\" is one of the best films of the year and is one of the most family friendly films that the Coen Brothers have ever made. However, even with a PG-13 rating it is on the cusp of being rated R, therefore, Coen Brothers fans will not be disappointed because the movie as a whole is better than the original. Go see it now and answer the real question is who played a better Rooster Cogburn The Duke or The Dude?",

            "content": "From Oscar nominated directing brothers Ethan and Joel Coen (Raising Arizona, Fargo, No Country for Old Men), I was intrigued that they were remaking the classic film that John Wayne won his only Oscar for, but this version apparently stuck more to the source material than the original, so I went to see it. Basically fourteen year old farm girl Mattie Ross (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Hailee Steinfeld) had her father murdered by hired hand Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), and she wants to go after and capture him. After collecting her father's body and putting it in a coffin, she enquires about hiring a U.S. Marshal to help her track the killer down, she is given three recommendations, and she chooses the most merciless, Marshal Reuben J. 'Rooster' Cogburn (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Jeff Bridges). Initially he doesn't seem interested, so Mattie goes to see Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who has been trailing Chaney for months wanting to take him back to Texas for hanging for another murder, but she is not interested unless he catches him for her father's murder. When she does get Rooster on board, he says that they will meet in the morning to begin the search for the wanted man, but he instead leaves her a note for the morning, telling her to go home, but she catches up with him, who has LaBoeuf joining him. After disagreeing on being a trio, and concerns with the reward money, LeBoeuf leaves them to search for Chaney alone, while Mattie and Rooster begin riding their horses for the manhunt. After a while they find an old shack where two outlaws are hanging out, and after dealing with them they know that Chaney and the rest of his gang could return, so they wait. They are surprised however to see LeBoeuf riding up to the shack, soon to be followed by the gang who lasso him, so Rooster and Mattie shoot as many as they can to save their friend. After Rooster has had a night of heavy whiskey drinking and LeBoeuf leaving again, Mattie is shocked to see the man they have been looking for right in front of her in the river, and he kidnaps her. Chaney is left alone with the girl, and he is ordered to not harm her while the rest of the gang go against Rooster in a showdown shootout, who manages to kill two of them, and the last, Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) is killed by LeBoeuf. He comes up to rescue her, but is knocked out, but Mattie quickly grabs his rifle and shoots Chaney dead off the cliff, only to have the force of the blast make her fall into the behind mineshaft. Luckilly though Rooster soon comes along to get her out, but she does receive a bite from a venomous snake, and only sucking some of the poison out, he races on her horse to get her to hospital. In the end, Mshe did survive the snake attack, but it caused gangrene forcing her to lose an arm, and at age forty Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) goes to the grave of Rooster who died only three days ago. Also starring Domhnall Gleeson as Moon (The Kid), Paul Rae as Emmett Quincy and Dakin Matthews as Col. Stonehill. Like Wayne before him, Bridges gives a brilliant performance as the sometimes hard to understand drunken Marshal, Damon is pretty good as the pompous and unusual ranger, and Steinfeld almost steals the show as the confident, young and spirited teenager wanting justice. The direction by the Coen brothers is splendid, the action sequences, included the remaining shoot-out scene made famous in the original, is great viewing, and I can see why the makers insist this isn't really a remake, but a faithful dramatisation, this is just as good, if not slightly better than the original, a must see western. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. Rooster Cogburn was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!",

            "review_title": "\"Grit\" is Coens' brand of film but with a wider appeal",
            "content": "The Coen brothers have delivered some of the most challenging films of the last few years, ever since winning Oscar glory for contemporary Western \"No Country for Old Men.\" The Coens' remake of the 1969 film (or as some would say, the second adaptation of the Charles Portis novel) \"True Grit\" does constitute as a bit of a departure for the duo in terms of cerebral thematic storytelling, but as filmmakers, \"Grit\" serves as yet another affecting and above-average entry to the brothers' canon.\"True Grit\" easily deserves a place as one of the greatest modern depictions of a classic Western. Certainly there have not been many, but the Coens' film possesses more maturity, natural humor and emotional impact than most films period. The genre tag of \"Western\" in some ways comes merely as happenstance; \"True Grit\" would receive sterling marks as any type of film with such consummate storytelling.Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old with maturity and intelligence well beyond her years determined to seek and apprehend her father's killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She seeks the assistance of a veteran marshal with some questionable morals named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who she's been told is a man of \"true grit.\" Mattie impressively twists Rooster's arm into leading her on an expedition into Choctaw territory to hunt Chaney. Though he plans to go it alone, the tenacious Mattie insists upon accompanying him.The story of \"True Grit\" clearly thrives on their unlikely relationship. Even the whip-smart Mattie must inevitably converge with a loss of innocence on so harrowing a journey and Cogburn's shoot- first attitude gets challenged by his new caretaker responsibilities. Matt Damon's Texas Ranger LaBoeuf also adds a nice third dynamic to the ensemble floating in and out of the action, but he also serves as a key piece in Rooster and Mattie's ever-changing relationship.Steinfeld goes toe-to-toe with Bridges like you wouldn't believe. Although the old-timey dialogue the Coens use makes about everyone in the film out to be a robot at one time or another, Steinfeld, in trying to play a smart kid who thinks she knows best, exudes a slight naivety that's simply perfect for the bravado of Mattie. Bridges gives a performance tons more memorable than his Oscar-winning one in \"Crazy Heart.\" That film might have earned him the hardware, but Cogburn is far more emblematic of his prowess as an actor. As with \"The Big Lebowski,\" it seems the Coens bring out the very best in the old- timer. He's hysterical as the stubborn old sharpshooter with a penchant for whiskey drinking. Cogburn fits his \"take nothing too seriously\" style as a person and actor, but by no means does it hamper his ability to dial up the seriousness needed to make \"True Grit\" a cutthroat Western.Yet the humor above all else resonates in \"True Grit.\" The climactic events provide the necessary gravity and intensity to make the film feel epic, but the Coens' true stamp here comes with the humor. So organic at times, you have to wonder whether the Coens intended the film to be so funny, but you appreciate it regardless. They write characters and situations so pitch perfectly that a grin constantly slips across your face throughout this film, especially as Mattie verbally outsmarts every adult that the movie introduces.Bottom line, the Coens set out to make a Western and their finished project delivers it in terms of scope and drama. They brand it with a cheeky and slightly irreverent humor that only they seem to know the recipe for, but with exception of Cogburn's jumbled speech all audiences will find it accessible. That's the trouble with the Coens: most audiences don't operate on their wavelength, but as \"True Grit\" continues to become one of their most financially successful films, the finished product provides all the evidence as to why.So where the Coen brothers have taken a step back in intellectually rich filmmaking for the sake of connecting with a wider audience, I for one will not lament the sacrifice given that \"True Grit\" embodies many of the great trademark qualities of their films regardless. No sweeter victory can come for a filmmaker when great critical reception meets high popularity. More so when the finished product casts a recognizable reflection of its maker.~Steven C",

            "content": "I haven't seen the original \"True Grit\" version starring John Wayne so I won't comment on any similarities or differences in the two movies. I have read that the Coen version is truer to the novel on which the two movies are based.The story begins as Mattie Ross (Hallie Steinfeld) arrives in Fort Smith, Arkansas not long after her father has been murdered there. It is thought that she is merely collecting the body but this is no ordinary fourteen year old. She is determined to avenge his death by bringing the murderer to justice. He is thought to have escaped into a nearby Indian territory and the local sheriff has no interest in pursuing him.He suggests that she hire a US Marshall to help her. She chooses Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), the Marshall with the most ruthless reputation. The youngster is determined to accompany the Marshall in the pursuit. Their cause is complicated by the presence of a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) who has been pursuing the same man for a murder he committed in that state.The Coens are nothing if not consummate filmmakers and \"True Grit\" is another well crafted, entertaining film from them. It is quite conventional in many ways. The characters of Cogburn and Ross are revealed us in two set piece scenes near the beginning of the movie. We see Hattie playing hardball as she negotiates with a trader over her father's affairs. Cogburn's modus operandi is shown as he testifies in the trial of one of the few men he didn't kill during a recent pursuit.The film is ultimately about the characters rather than the plot. Almost all the characters are shown in a sympathetic light, even the \"bad guys\". For that reason the film could be accused of being sentimental However the excellent script, direction and acting means that, sentimental or not, \"True Grit\" is a highly entertaining film.",

            "content": "Headed by an all star cast & one new comer True Grit is the story of a young girl looking for revenge for her fathers death in 1877 Arkansas. Directed by the Coen brothers in crowd pleasing mode much more akin to O Brother,Where Art Thou? than No Country for Old Men. Which is disappointing & misleading because the trailers framed Grit more like the latter rather than the former. The performers are all there up on the screen doing what they should be but are left hanging scene after scene with nothing to do. Except walk here,babble out dialogue there & look completely lost the entire length of the movie. Admitedly the Coen brothers have done some extraordinary work but lets face it they have done an equal number of crap pictures as well. The problem with True Grit is that it sticks too close to the source material never not once taking any risk in telling this story in a way that would breathe new life into it. It also does the western a huge disservice. Im not interested in bigger set pieces & loud action set ups but seriously utilize the talent you have guys. Character driven stories are what the Coen brothers are know for but True Grit is watery & perfunctory. It seems like this version was tailor made not for movie lovers but the short attention span crowd. Those that don't recall what they watch with any more enthusiasm than eating a sandwich & carrying on. Yet the approval ratings critically commercially & otherwise contradict that & its puzzling to me. This is a pay check to all involved & Oscar bait for the studio executives. I mean the ending of this infuriated me so bad that I had to get up & leave. Even without seeing the original it was badly written but aside from that this is Rooster Cogburn man! How they summed up his story was just disrespectful proving that the makers behind this remake truly not only have no understanding of the original story or story telling in general but clearly no grit what so ever.",

I disagree: this adaptation of Charles Portis' fine western novel shows their trademark touch.Has there ever been a weak performance in a Coens movie? Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is phenomenal as pugnacious 14-years-old Mattie, who hires dogged U.S. Marshall Cogburn to hunt down the man who killed her father. The great Jeff Bridges is compelling and larger-than-life as Cogburn, the role played by John Wayne in the 1969 version. Matt Damon (as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf), Josh Brolin (as the dim-witted killer) and Barry Pepper (as the leader of a criminal gang) round out the excellent cast.Camera work is stylish, precise. At the end of a climactic battle an incredible amount of tension is conjured by a long shot of two far-away figures, as we wait for the result of a desperate sniping attempt. See how the camera creeps into the point of view of a doomed character during a confrontation in a cabin to make his abrupt demise all the more shocking.Storytelling is masterful, dialogues crisp. I love the clever way the Coens handle exposition in the courtroom scene, as Cogburn's background and history of frontier justice are extorted from him in moments full of humour and conflict. Weird characters like the \"bear man\" and darkly humorous bits - like a condemned Native American's final words unceremoniously cut off by the hangman - are also classic Coens.Composer Carter Burwell, the brothers' long-time collaborator since Blood Simple, provides an elegant, elegiac soundtrack.True Grit does feel less misanthropic and nihilistic than the Coens' average film, with Mattie finding a surrogate father figure and the Cogburn/LaBoeuf duo eventually bonding with her. Still, the most emotional sequence - the \"ride to death\" to save the girl - results first in the killing of a beloved animal, then in the physical disfigurement of a main character; the epilogue is a regretful meditation about time and loss.So yes, it is a Coens movie, and it's a great one.9/10",

When the stubborn 14 year old Mattie Ross is desperate to find her father's killer and bring him to justice, she decides to hire the best Marshall in town. After a brief recommendation she puts her dime on the 'old' Rooster Cogburn. She forcefully tags alone in to the hostile Indian Territory with Cogburn and another lawman LeBoeuf who is also tracking down the same man for different reasons. Soon the two man hunter's starts to find their differences and quarrel over stuff like children and the 14 year old finds it difficult to keep them both in the objective.The strength of True Grit comes from two angles. The awesomely witty yet solemn script and the acting. The script and acting is so well knitted that you might actually wonder if it's really humor you're listen to or serious manly conversation. Some of the conversations happen between the men are downright funny but the actors pull it off with their most serious faces. Even the little girls get confused at time though she is well educated and brave for her age.The wonderful cast includes Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld and Matt Damon. Jeff plays the veteran one eyed man hunter Cogburn who is partially a drunk. Hailee plays the stubborn 14 year old and hard headed Mattie. Born in 1996 and coming from California with 9 movie/TV titles under her belt she was nominated for Oscars for this role. And no wonder about that because her acting makes the whole flick a novel experience. Then comes LeBoeuf who's played by the good Matt Damon. He has one big serious face throughout the movie and seems like he has forgotten to smile. At one point he bites his own tongue and gets shot by Cogburn. And then hit hard by a rock on the head. Quite a serious character but hilarious at the same time played very well.The story has a good flow and a neat ending. Worth watching! more at flickshout.tk",

            "content": "Please indulge me for my preface. Westerns are still being produced, still have a pretty good and devoted following and have in fact improved over time in the depth of the characters they portray as well as the authenticity and historical impact they now convey, correcting most all inaccuracies and false myths they once had a poor reputation for. The source of drama and cinematography the genre abounds with seems inexhaustible. I have been a born-again fan of the genre since 1992, when four times Oscar winner \"Unforgiven\" was released onto an unsuspecting public. I believe many like me have been rediscovering the classic westerns and a bunch of various western sub-genres; 148 westerns of all sub-genres have been released since 1992 up to \"True Grit's 2010 remake. You don't have to take my word for it; you just have to count them for yourself.The remake of \"True Grit\" garnished, like that of the remake \"3:10 to Yuma\", more high praise, box office and ratings than critics would have predicted. Other \"new classic western\" like \"The Proposition(2005)\", \"Hidalgo (2004)\", \"Appaloosa (2008)\", and many more I apologize for skipping keep the genre alive. Even HBO's \"Deadwood\" had a fabulous reception from the cable/ppv viewing audience. The most recent western to muster widespread accolades is True Grit.Let us not forget that, as in the 1969 original, the character of Mattie Ross, the young girl who sought to hire marshal Rooster Cogburn for his reputation as a man with grit, was herself displaying throughout the movie more grit than Cogburn and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf put together; hence my choice for review summary. When I viewed the 1969 version, a long time ago, I was already familiar with Kim Darby who played Mattie Ross then, so I was not all that surprised with her impressive performance, knowing her acting range. Hailee Steinfeld, who plays that role in the 2010 version, was unknown to me; so her performance was a very pleasant surprise. I mention that first because so much is written and said about Jeff Bridges' performance that it overshadows a very good performance of what I consider to be a co-starring role. The third role in importance, but a lesser role is that of Matt Damon playing LaBoeuf; I do prefer his performance to that of Glen Campbell. It could be because everyone likes Damon and Campbell had a voice I found annoying. Now, getting to Jeff Bridges; regardless of how much anyone may be a fan of John Wayne( I am) and how deserving he was of his best actor Oscar for his performance in the original \"True Grit\", Bridges delivered a superb version of Rooster Cogburn, living up to the character's traits in all the ways possible. He was nominated for the role, but the likelihood of a role landing a best actor award twice was almost predictable; the academy was not about to set such a precedent, not to mention the winner of that year's crop was as deserving (a relief to the academy I'm sure).",

            "content": "In the Old West a man is murdered by an outlaw named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) for his gold and horses. Looking to avenge his death is the man's fourteen-year-old daughter Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld). She is a tenacious young girl who arrives by herself in town to try and return some of the other horses her father bought. She also looks to employ a man who will be able to hunt down and capture Chaney. One of the men suggested to her is Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a drunken Marshall, in court for shooting someone in cold blood. Mattie also meets the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who is also looking to bring Chaney in for a different murder. LaBoeuf decides to team up with Cogburn and they take off without Mattie. True to her resilience and determination though, she takes up after the men to join them in the pursuit. The Coen brothers have touted this not as a remake of Henry Hathaway's Western but as a readaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel. There is some contention to this as many scenes in this version run parallel to the original film. However, the story and the relevance of its meaning today cannot be understated. The novel and the original film coincided with America's involvement in the Vietnam War and its sense of violent righteousness. Today, in a period of religious fundamentalism, extreme right-wing politics and America's involvement in global conflicts, the power and the messages of True Grit are sustained. There's a stronger critique than before of American justice as determined by religious fundamentalism. The film smartly opens with a quote from The Old Testament, The Book of Proverbs: \"The wicked flee when no one pursues\". This is followed by an early scene where three men are publicly executed. Their hanging is met by applause from the crowd. The notion of justice being drawn from the power of Christianity is continued and felt most heartedly by the Bible-quoting Ross. Her belief that nothing is free except the grace of God fuels her tenacity and her drive, thus embodying the notion of American accomplishment through Christian extremism. Aesthetically, the Coen brothers have rarely shown as much restraint and poise in their craft as they have here. They have stripped back their direction of bizarre comic characters to make what is most simply a beautiful period piece. Their attention to detail and their delicacy is at times stunning. Consider the close-up of LaBoeuf's spurs on the back of his boots, the crooked teeth of the outlaw Lucky Ned Pepper, or the way the snowdrops fall as Ross and Cogburn ride through the woods together. The Coen's never linger too long on landscape shots though. The film's quiet beauty is deliberately offset by the dark costumes and dusty gravel roads to remind us of the era's conservatism and its often primitive way of life. Equally authentic is the performance of Hailee Steinfeld, a fourteen- year-old in her first feature. Amidst the presence of several Hollywood heavyweights, she is extraordinary. The confidence and the self- assurance she displays is precisely what was intended for this role. She plays it perfectly. There is no better choice in Hollywood to play a drunkard than Bridges either. It might not seem too dissimilar from some of the character's he's played before, but beyond his dishevelled face he convinced me that there was once a more resourceful Marshall in Cogburn. Damon has more presence than Glen Campbell did as LaBoeuf. There's more feeling and tension amongst this group too which helps quell some of the sagginess felt in the middle portion of the original movie. In particular, I enjoyed seeing the change between Ross and LaBoeuf, from business rivals of sorts, to a gentle admiration. The only flaw with the performances is that it is difficult to hear what they are saying at times as some of the dialogue's diction has been written straight from the period. It becomes a problem when combined with the slurred speeches of Bridges. There is also the thought that those who have seen the original already will have a particularly clear idea of the arch of the film's narrative. Nonetheless, it's been beautifully crafted and performed and like all the very best Westerns, it's pitched with a timeless moral compass.",

But in True Grit, they seem to just want to make a solid western, and outside of a few quirky moments and a feverish final ride, the movie has little of the brothers' flash.It is a very well made movie, well acted, well filmed with an engaging story and characters. Jeff Bridges is at times hard to understand, but that is probably appropriate in a drunken, worn out lawman.The oddest thing about the movie, and I believe this is from the book, is that people talk in a rather formal way that at times sounds as though they've just wandered out of a Jane Austen movie. I saw some review saying people talked in the movie the way they probably did in the real wild west, but I suspect thieves and marshals both were not so articulate.A COMPARISON WITH THE ORIGINALThe general consensus is that this movie is far better than the John Wayne version, and that's probably true, although since I saw that movie 30 years ago it's hard to judge. Certainly Henry Hathaway was not a great filmmaker, so it is a better film. And the performances are less hammy and conventional. But I watched a film clip someone put together with bits of both films and there are some places where an argument can be made for the original. One is the character of Maddie. In this remake, Maddie is a cool customer who often seems like a full-grown adult in a child's body. In the original, Maddie seemed more vulnerable. In a scene in which the confronts a killer, the 1969 Maddie seems terrified but determined, the later version, cool and determined. And while Bridges is more an actor than Wayne, and thus creates a more nuanced character, the truth is, Wayne was a lot of fun in the role.",

            "review_title": "Hugely disappointing!!",
            "content": "Okay, I admit it. I have never had that much love for the Coen Brothers' films. Even \"No Country for Old Men\", which I did enjoy, was marred by its botched ending. Plus the original \"True Grit\" remains one of my favourite westerns. So you can probably already guess where this review is going. I'm sorry but once again I cannot square all the praise this film has received and its subsequent Oscar nominations against the film that I actually saw today.To be sure, there are some good things in it. Hailee Steinfeld is excellent as Mattie Ross and looks nearer the age of the character in the Charles Portis novel (if perhaps a trifle too young). British cinematographer Roger Deakins provides his customarily excellent photography (perhaps he will finally win the Oscar that he is long overdue - his work on the 1993 version of \"The Secret Garden\" is stunning). The fact that Mattie loses her arm as the result of the rattlesnake bite (as per the novel) is more believable than the 1969 John Wayne version (although the Coens' handling of the snake pit sequence is stunningly inept and robs the scene of the tension it should have contained - as with any other things, the combination of the Elmer Bernstein's music and the editing make the 1969 handling of the same scene far more exciting).I realise many people have a lot of passionate love for the Coens and their films and I may be a lone voice crying in the wilderness but I'm sorry, this has to be said. The Coen brothers are the cinematic equivalent of the Emperor's clothes. They are one of the most overrated filmmakers working today and the films they actually make do not merit all the lavish praise given to them. Jeff Bridges is a great actor but his interpretation of Rooster Cogburn does not hold a candle to John Wayne's (indeed the strong accent he gives the character makes it difficult to understand half the dialogue he utters). Matt Damon, another good actor, similarly suffers. It is hard to believe that in all the publicity for the film, the makers and stars have either claimed not to seen the 1969 version or claimed that the Wayne version was not very good. I'm sorry but you have to be kidding. The 1969 version is a classic film that will long outlast this \"re-imagining\". Still, in its own right, it's not a bad film and at least it isn't \"The Ladykillers\". But if this had been the film made in 1969, I'm not sure we'd still be talking about \"True Grit\" today.",

            "content": "Beau Bridges gives the best performance of his career in this beautifully brutal film that is the finest American Western since The Unforgiven. Skillfully blending classic traditional genre with todays allowances they take the Wayne original and feign right and left to give each scene its own individual humor and horror, seamlessly interlocking Shakespearean inflection and reference into this unforgiving wild western with bold and ironic turns.After her dad is murdered by Ned Chaney (Josh Brolin) in Texas, 14 year old Mattie Chase (Harlee Steinfeld) travels From Arkansas to claim her father's body and what rightfully belongs to the family, fighting along the way money grubbing undertakers and horse traders without deference or being intimidated. She is also there seeking justice for her father 's killing and without hesitation chooses the most cold blooded (Bridges) law officer to do the job. Rooster Cogburn at first rebuffs but eventually gives in to her hard headed persistence. Making an uneasy alliance with a pretentious Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) they take up the pursuit of Chaney, encountering a myriad of situations both comic and horrific, many times both combined in a breathtaking and hostile environment of hard characters.Bridges plays Rooster with a cold blooded stoicism who in between dispatching some hardcore looking dusty desperadoes likes to reminisce along the trail about ex-wive's and other harrowing experiences in matter of fact deadpan. You like him but fear his volcanic temper more. He is a homicidal Falstaff.Incredible as Bridges is, newcomer Steinfeldt is his equal as she not only demolishes astounded male adversaries with a knowledgeable self confidence, but also controls by the shear force of her determination the films tempo. Steinfeldt plays her at times like the heroine in Twelfth Night sparring with Damon proving she has the grit. Damon's tough dandy duels on equal if over matched footing with the duo before he redeems himself. Brolin's late entry Chaney is riveting; brief but not a second of down time. Ed Cohen's Bear Man attendant comic relief should also be noted among a fine group of sharply drawn Dicken's like minor characters that permeate the film.There's abundant amounts of graphic violence countered by subtle and harsh dark humor with a few homages to boot evoking Days of Heaven, Mann's Naked Spur and the original, though Bridges is is every bit as much Ethan from The Searchers as he is Rooster. For their part the brothers Coen tolerate little to no sentimentality. It's about attaining true grit. But in the same spirit of their approach to changing current within those polished and effective scenes, captured in the crisply muted compositions of DP Roger Deakins, they in turn generate a certain warmth of character.True Grit will not tolerate stragglers. Ms. Moss's impressive no-nonsense demeanor demands attention and Cogburn's shoot first ask questions later ethos brings an edge to every scene he's in. Keeping you engaged at all times, it demands for you to constantly turn corners in each scene for a better view which is either filled with a high pitched suspenseful unpredictability or Hattie's superior logic and verbal acumen confounding and vanquishing a variety of men of the West. By eschewing sentimentality and romance and retooling cinema's western mythic hero and heroine without tears it advances the American Western into a new era . Grit is the rear occasion where a remake can challenge a proved original and I believe in this case surpass it.",

            "content": "When I first heard about this, I immediately felt it would be yet another unnecessary remake (of the 1969 Western that finally rewarded John Wayne with an Oscar, albeit undeservedly). Given the Coens' involvement, I could not help recalling the fiasco that was their earlier retread of a classic film i.e. THE LADYKILLERS (2004). However, I was prepared to give TRUE GRIT the benefit of the doubt after it received a staggering 10 Oscar nominations...but, ultimately, my opinion did not change and it seems that many others feel the same (if anything because they thought the material restricted the Coens from applying their distinctive 'touch'). Incidentally, I recently engaged in an online discussion about their work, and I pointed out that the film I personally consider their absolute best effort \u2013 the Oscar-winning NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007) \u2013 was being completely neglected, and the reply promptly came that this was because it was not an original Coen Bros. script but an adaptation!As expected, the film under review treats the revenge-tale-with-child-interest in revisionist terms as opposed to the original's rousing adventure approach. To be honest, I have not checked out the latter in ages (though I did catch portions of its last act just a couple of weeks ago on Italian TV) and, in fact, do not even own it on any format \u2013 however, I certainly do not recall it being the low-key talk-fest that the Coens' version turned out to be (it is most ironic, then, that the climactic action set-piece is virtually identical to its 1969 counterpart)! Apart from this, the dreary visuals lessened the entertainment value considerably \u2013 while the maiming of its protagonists (the heroine loses an arm to a snake-bite and Matt Damon's characters bites off part of his own tongue!) are a bit much.As for the leading performances, I have to say that I was disappointed that Jeff Bridges opted merely to mumble his way through the central figure of Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn rather than invest it with something akin to the larger-than-life qualities which John Wayne had brought! That said, newcomer Hailee Steinfeld came on very strongly (especially impressive when bartering with a county judge over her murdered father's belongings) while steering clear of Kim Darby's tomboy-ish attitudes in the original; Damon, then, was his usual reliable self \u2013 ditto Josh Brolin in his brief role as the pursuing trio's quarry.In the end, this is a solid film as Westerns go in these arid times (no pun intended), and the Coens can notch another artistic success to their resume'; whether it will manage to dislodge the John Wayne vehicle from folk memory (however romanticized \u2013 in other words, outmoded \u2013 it may seem at this juncture) remains to be seen and, personally, I very much doubt it...",

            "content": "There's been doubt and reservation about seeing this keenly pitched, genuine work by some of my fellow Coen followers owing to its suspicious PG-13 rating, as if two of our most admirably offbeat filmmakers compromised for studio neck-breathing to broaden their audiences. Whether or not that's true, and I personally doubt it, they've made a realistically violent and hardnosed revenge story that is as mature as any R-rated one, but just needs no R. Its violence is unflinching, brutal, at times very sad, but frankly guns are used more often as sound signals and warnings than killing tools, brutality never occurs without desperation or necessity, and is always very sudden and pared-down. This isn't a lightweight or conceded film by any means.On the contrary: This bleak elegy exhibits that the Two-Headed Director's mastery of filmmaking is so total they're able to set aside the more radical of their legendary idiosyncrasies and still outclass Hollywood squares at their own game, both in quality and success, which are usually not good friends. However, True Grit has turned out to be the one mainstream movie of the awards season to surpass its producers' profit hopes. 2010 was a year full of commercially successful crap and top-quality failures, and finally at its 11th hour, only the third duo to be nominated for the Best Director statue remind us of American cinema's true standards. Granted, this literary western doesn't quite match the beauty and faultless audiovisual artistry of a No Country or Serious Man, but it's nevertheless distinguished by virtues of color, caress and texture perhaps distinctive to only two things, the art of painting, and the cinematography typical of a Coen film (please observe I'm obviously being hyperbolic), particularly their interpretation of figures and imagery in language of color or tonal associations as much or perhaps more than action or linearity.I think the one reason why we're all feeling like it's such a great movie but just for some reason not quite there is merely because Alias Roderick Jaynes is being so straightforward, not subverting any genre expectations or sidetracking into hauntingly esoteric grounds. And albeit the sibling duo deliberately sidesteps sappiness as habitually as possible in general, much like their shrewd heroine, True Grit takes on an unforeseen and modest feeling in its climactic wind-down.In the Hathaway version, John Wayne was the star, full stop. Here, while Jeff Bridges is the leading man in a western, it's as first among contemporaries with his co-stars such as a sincere Damon, Pepper and Brolin, and above all Hailee Steinfeld, who's first-rate throughout. Her biggest highlight is an early scene in which she barters with a horse trader for the money she believes is due her. Here the enchantment is the dialogue, which never labors, in fact stays even and rational, as Mattie, who generally \"give out very little sugar with her pronouncements,\" argues the offender out of his money by apparently using his own rationale. This taut verbal farce of Mattie's negotiation should convince you early enough of this movie's soaring linguistic sharpness.Bridges must be applauded for his crisp version of the wayward Rooster Cogburn. \"His throat retaining an unfortunate tumbleweed,\" you get tangible whiffs of Rooster's stench and his mean cleverness as well, and you never, ever, think of the Duke at any point, perhaps owing to the endless procession of gracefully outmoded locutions, reinforced by haunting kicks of Portis' text. The brothers are perhaps most widely known to general audiences for having loads of fun with cultural twangs and regional manner of speech, and True Grit is just as if not catchier than Fargo. So regardless of the source novel and the original film, this one feels almost exactly like a unadulterated Coen film. Joel David and Ethan Jesse have not just restored the western from cutting-edge revisionism to quintessentially traditional with this cool, efficiently lyrical entertainment, but have taken everything that came before and made it their own.Their fifteenth film and yet their first classically made crowd-pleaser, in which they always keep their contract with the genre of which they're normally doing an impression, this is certainly one of the finest westerns I've ever seen. That's also due in no small part to the above-mentioned violence. It may be PG-13, but it's unmistakably more truthful than its ancestor about the cruelty of the era, giving no misapprehensions about the \"glorious\" West. That and the irresistible nature of the beautifully biblical dialogue and utterly earnest, dryly comic performances are what audiences are responding to and have been waiting for all year long, to be in the gifted hands of momentous filmmakers who make an effort with even the most token particulars.",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers are great, making films that are dark and serious (e.g. Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men), comic (The Big Lebowski) and so that combine the two (Miller's Crossing and Fargo). Their remake of True Grit fits into the latter but their remake of The Ladykillers was reason to give some people concern. Luckily they know how to make a remake right this time.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a 14-year-old girl whom father had been murdered by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She plans to gain revenge and make sure that Chaney is tried and hung for his crime, so looks to hire a bounty hunter. She hires the most ruthless deputy Marshall she could find, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an elderly alcoholic. But a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) also wants Chaney for a crime he committed in Texas, working both as an ally and a foe. They go into the Indian territories to find Chaney and avoid bandits in the area.The Coen Brothers set out to make a more gritty, Earthy type of Western and this approach has been used in many recent Westerns, Unforgiven, The Proposition, Deadwood, 3:10 to Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James. The Coen Brothers made the violence realistic but did not linger on it, getting shot was nasty but they did need buckets of blood to show it. The focus of the film was on the characters and the journey they had to go on. For a mainstream audience it works as a simple revenge story but it is the focus on the Mattie character that truly makes True Grit an interesting film. There action is not the main focus of the film: for the most part it was kept at a distance. The world The Coen's shows is bloody, dirty and hard, this is not a glamour version of the Wild West and more historical accurate. There is also plenty of dark imaginary, with the use of a wintry landscape, the dirt road town and the characters' clothes added with a soft, piano based score.The acting is great in the film and Steinfeld is obvious talent for the future. Her performance had to hold the film because she was in nearly every scene. She should be nominated for Best Actress, not Supporting Actress. She made sure Mattie was a smart, quick witted character who was both funny and determined. She is a character who is still a young girl at the time. Bridges and Damon inject a lot of humour in the film and had excellent interplay with each other and with Steinfeld.The best way to describe True Grit is that story and the imaginary is dark and serious, but the characters are make sure that the film is not a dower experience.",

            "content": "It is almost general principle with me that I usually detest the idea of a remake. They are, from my experience, less a movie experience than a filmed deal. The exception, however, is when a filmmaker finds a new spin on the original material. That seems to be the case with True Grit in which The Brothers Coen seem less inclined to remake the John Wayne classic then to pry their story from the 1968 novel by Charlies Portis. That's wise because the original film was centered on The Duke's magnanimous presence. That film seems to have been put out of their minds - there are some acts you just can't follow.The Coen Brothers vision of True Grit never feels for one single second like a standard movie western. This is a movie in which all interiors and exteriors are sweaty, sun-bleached and coated in blood, sweat and tears - even down to the character's very souls. Nothing here seems plastic, or put-together. We feel as if we are visiting a time long gone. The actors here make the material work by speaking in a semi-formal pattern, a manner of speech that is long gone and forgotten. It is a joy to hear.The story isn't the point, it is merely the strand to pull us through a series of interesting weather-beaten characters. It is set in motion by fresh-faced Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) who comes to Fort Smith, Arkansas to collect the body of her murdered father and to find someone to bring the accused, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), to justice. With grief in her eyes and fire in her soul, she is dead set on hiring U.S. Marshall Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a scraggly old drunk who is never-the-less a dead shot. He doesn't take her seriously but she plants her heels and he relents.Also in the picture is LeBouef (Matt Damon) - pronounced \"La-BEEF\", a polished and professional Texas Range. He has been tracking Chaney for months and wants to join in the search. He has the professionalism but less the experience - he is needless-to-say not impressed by Rooster's reputation nor his drunkenness. He knows the job but Rooster is better at knowing the territory. These three make their way into Cherokee territory to find Chaney and his gang. That makes True Grit sound like a standard western. The plot is somewhat thin and that allows us to focus on the characters, which are specific and distinct.The discovery in this movie is Hailee Steinfeld. At 14, she occupies the role of Mattie Ross as a young woman who seems ready for the world. Her tongue is her weapon, which she uses to talk down a man whom she feels owes her money for her late father's horses. It is a scene that makes a star as she holds her temperament and argues her point in very specific terms. To look into her face is to see a girl who hasn't been beaten down by life but her eyes tell a different story. She knows the harsh terrain of the world in which she exists. She comes imbued with a level of maturity and a Presbyterian-Protestant ethic that keeps her heart strong. She is not taken seriously but soon changes the opinions of the men around her simply by speaking in plan, unbroken terms. What makes Steinfeld so effective is that is devoid of anything cute or phony, there are no \"actorly\" manners here. It is a wonderful performance.Jeff Bridges has the more difficult task. He is charged with recreating a role made famous by John Wayne. He overcomes that obstacle by simply playing Cogburn on a different level. While the original was a vehicle for Wayne, Bridges disappears into the terrain. Donning a battered old hat and a leather eye patch (which is never explained) he is a man who has had all the experience that the American west can cast upon a man. His voice is graveled by tobacco and whiskey. His gait is stammered by a weight problem. All that remains of his reputation is his common sense and his dead-shot skill with a rifle.Bridges never stands out as an actor in a role. Instead he is a man who exists as part of his environment. That environment is populated by a gaggle of people both professional and villainous who seem to have welled up out of the dust and decay of this western terrain. Not the least of which is Tom Chaney himself who, to my surprise, isn't the slick evil presence that I had suspected. He is, instead, a small man, a self-pitying whiner who we imagine killed Mattie's father but not exactly in cold blood.True Grit never feels like a Coen Brothers movie. They seem to be trying out new material here, as if the material itself was more important to them than simply an entertainment. Like their great movie Fargo, they have the confidence to know that they have such interesting character that the story doesn't need to be packed with heavy side-plots. It is straight down the line, following characters that we come to know, and come to admire.**** (of four)",

            "content": "Maybe it's obvious that everything in the Coen Brothers' \"True Grit\" is superior to the original, but then pardon me, I fail to grasp the obviousness.I liked the film because it's not a film to dislike, definitely, but I'm not sure I liked the way that \"True Grit\" quickly buried the reputation of a classic that prevailed for about four decades. Henry Hathaway's film was far from being flawless and even the main players didn't recall their experience with the same enthusiasm as their followers. John Wayne didn't like Kim Darby, who played the original Mattie Ross, Hathaway either, Wayne didn't get along with Robert Duvall who didn't get along with Hathaway and no one liked Glen Campbell who played Texas Ranger LaBoeuf\u0085 makes you wonder how the film ended up being liked at all. But the magic operated somehow, and it became the last hurrah of the classic Western at a time where the revisionist vision predominated. So, maybe John Wayne was fun, over-the-top and hammy but it was a part of the character (just like a Norma Desmond and Jack Torrance) that made him enjoyable, the ending with Cogburn jumping over the fence is like Wayne's epitaph to the genre that forged his legend. \"True Grit\" 1969 exhilarated whatever made the Western such a popular and appealing genre to the mass audiences, and as a matter of fact, the mark of its greatness is that it inspired the Coen brothers' to make their own version. Must be a reason if, out of all the classic Westerns, they picked that one. But what seemed like a blessing, something that would raise a new awareness of a classic, revealed to be a curse. Jeff Bridges stole John Wayne's thunder in a blink of an eye, the right one, and it's just as if the original was a first draft or a joke.Well, I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers and their adaptation of \"True Grit\" is nothing short of a masterpiece of filmmaking. Technically, I've got nothing to criticize but I won't go as far as saying that it's better than the original, just because of the editing, the cinematography, the setting and the acting. You've got to judge the film as a whole, and on that basis, I still prefer the original maybe because it had something entertaining about it, something that made the remake look bleak, austere and all with these voice-over monologues, something needlessly solemn about itself. It's just as if the Coen brothers were so focused on perfectly recreating the 'mood', the 'atmosphere', the 'end of an era' mindset that they avoided, by any means, to use their 'popular' trademarks.Maybe \"True Grit\" wasn't the kind of story calling for eccentric characters but a little dark humor \u00e0 la \"Fargo\" or \"Miller's Crossing\" wouldn't have undermined the seriousness of the story. I take it that the Coen brothers embraced the melancholic tone of revisionist Westerns, making Mattie a girl whose loss of a father already put her in the adult age, and she would be the real embodiment of that titular grit. Maybe, they had perfectly good reasons to snub all the humorous or 'superfluous' bits but at the end, you get a great and serious Western that is a bit too self-conscious for its own good. \"No Country for Old Men\" avoided that trope because it had surprising and unpredictable elements but \"True Grit\"'s conventional tone and format emphasized these flaws.So, we don't get the establishing shot of The Old Place where Mattie is seen as her father's bookkeeper, we don't see Chaney killing her father. We don't get the colorful bits like the cat named General, the episode with the rat during that first dinner with Cogburn, the priceless introduction of lawyer Dagget, and we certainly don't get that poignant and bittersweet conversation in the family cemetery at the end ending with that incredible jump. Well, I missed those parts, but it takes to have seen the first \"True Grit\" to notice their absence. Those who saw it will see the remake because they love the original, and those who didn't will love the remake because they don't have any point of comparison. Seems like a win-win situation for the Coen brothers, justifying that \"True Grit\" was their most commercially successful film.And if Halley Stenfield did a pretty good job and could even overshadow Kim Darby's performance at some parts, I'm not that enthusiastic about Bridges. Oh, he was good and certainly more believable a Marshal than Wayne but Wayne would have overshadowed anyway playing his role, except maybe, if the Coen brothers picked their most underrated 'regular': John Goodman: the physique, the voice, the accent, the more I think about it, the more I feel some great Cogburn vibes in him. I don't have much complaint about Damon, anyone could have done better than Glen Campbell. That said, I find it crazy that for all the drama the film carried, they made LaBoeuf survive. His death right after having saved Cogburn was the emotional highlight of the original, and the mark of the posthumous reconciliation with rival Cogburn, instead, we had to weep for a pony. I'm usually more enthusiastic about the Coen Brothers' movies but I don't think a fan would disagree if I say this doesn't look like a Coen brother movie anyway, it's an exercise in recreation darkening an already emotionally charged story. Mattie had to be shown as a crippled old maid in an ending that kills our mood with some killjoy existentialism, we had to end with Cogburn dead rather than him jumping over the fence and LaBeouf prevented from dying as a hero. My least liked Coens' film was also an adaptation, so \"True Grit\" confirmed to me that the Coen brothers are never as good and capable to draw you in their stories as when they deal with their own material.",

            "content": "Last summer when I saw the previews for \"True Grit\" and the exchange between Mattie Ross and Rooster Cogburn, \"What do you want girl?\" \"I'm looking for the man who killed my father. The man's name is Tom Chaney and I need someone to go after him.\" I waited for its release with great anticipation. I have not been disappointed. \"True Grit\" is a remarkably religious film exploring Grace, justice, revenge, retribution, law, salvation, etc.For me \"True Grit\" is one of those films that come along every so often that I \"have' to see over and over again. It repays repeated viewing because it is so deep and rich on many levels. I think every actor in the film is perfect in his/her role from Hailee Steinfeld who is in every scene, except when the \"adult\" Mattie appears and she carries the movie. There are scenes wherein she is the \"harpy in trousers\" the woman fixated on justice, law, revenge, and getting her way. Then there are several scenes where she gets to be the 14 year-old girl remember camping out at night, \"We had a good time,\" or her delight in wanting to \"double back over our tracks, and confuse the trail in a clever way\" and her looks of horror when she witnesses the chaos her pursuit of Chaney is creating. I will be disappointed if she doesn't win the Oscar but won't be surprised because the Academy's logic (or lack there of) is so often flawed. Then on through Bridges, Damon, Brolin, Pepper, onto the horse trader, the undertaker, Yarnell, the hanged men, the woman at the hanging, Bear Man, and on and on. Roger Deakins' cinematography is gorgeous especially the night lighting. The costuming, soundtrack, the art direction, and set decoration.are all brilliant. The Coen's commitment to being faithful to the Portis novel should put to rest peoples' concerns about this being a remake of the '69 \"True Grit.\" It is a very funny and yet very moving film. I, for one am glad the Coens made this \"True Grit.\"",

            "content": "By the time I was born, the Western had pretty much run it's course. I think the closest thing I'd seen to a Western for years was BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III, and that's hardly a prime example. The genre has started working it's way back into modern theaters but they're rare, and sometimes (such as the case of JONAH HEX) total crap. Well the Coen brothers, having touched on the vibe a bit for their 2007 film NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, dive in to retread the ground of 1969's John Wayne classic based on their novel by Charles Portis. I've never read the novel or even seen the John Wayne classic but, as a fan of the Coen brothers, I wanted to check this one out. The story is told from the perspective of young Mattie Ross. Her father was murdered in cold blood by hired hand Tom Chaney and the criminal has fled into Chocktaw territory where the law doesn't seem willing to chase him. Mattie hires disgruntled drunkard and U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to track Chaney down. With the assistance of a Texas Ranger who's tracking Chaney for a senator's murder, the three with cross into Indian land in pursuit.I loved the cinematography of this film. It's rare that a film's look leaves such an impression on me that it's the first thing that comes to mind, but Roger Deakins has done an amazing job here. I expect no less from a Coen brothers film. I don't think they've ever disappointed me. It's interesting that they'd chosen such an obsolete genre and were able to create such an awesome film that was able to rake in over $150 million in a time when Westerns are rare and often ignored. As I've said, I never read the book or saw the John Wayne film but there is one thing that stood out painfully to me in this film: the dialogue. I don't know if the novel had the same clunky dialogue or if it was a new addition by the Coens. Every time a character spoke, it sounded unnatural and sometimes it felt like they really struggled to get their lines out. Was there a single contraction used in the entire movie? I really think this film would've been better with a last rewrite allowing for more fluid dialogue because it's hard to capture the best performance when your actors are surely stumbling over their lines.I probably don't have to say this but Jeff Bridges is just awesome here. He's gritty, slovely, and perpetually angry. He plods around in a drunken stupor, his slurred words occasionally hard to decipher thanks to the clumsy dialogue. The man does a fantastic job and he deserved the Oscar nomination. Hailee Steinfeld is the young Mattie and she does an amazing job when you consider this is her first feature film. The supporting cast boasts strong performances from Matt Damon (as the arrogant Texas Ranger LaBoeuf), Josh Brolin (as Tom Chaney), and a near-unrecognizable Barry Pepper (as Lucky Ned Pepper). The movie is loaded with some strong performances and the chemistry between Bridges and Damon make for some of the best scenes as the trio of hunters break from their chase to make camp. There's a great scene about halfway through where the two are arguing over who's aim is worse as they take potshots at cornbread. The pace sort of meanders at times but this movie has helped grab my attention for a genre of films I'd never given a second thought to before.",

And thanks God, I did because it's undoubtedly one of the best movies I have seen this year. True Grit is nothing like typical western American movies comes time to time on cinema. It's witty, funny and brilliantly acted. From first frame till the last I was mesmerized by how the story goes ahead. Each and every actor in the movie leaves a really strong impact. I must say that among all the bigger actors 14yrs old new comer Hailee Steinfeld steals the show, she is epically strong and every time she speaks, as an audience I was left speechless\u0085\"how come a 14yrs old girl can be that strong and able to steal the scenes from veterans like Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin? That's Unbelievable! Jeff Bridges was amazing and initially it was really hard for me to understand his thick southern accent but as the movie move forwards, it becomes easy. The real surprise for me was Mr. Matt Damon, I have never been a fan of Matt Damon, so watching him blowing my mind away was simply out of the blue. Matt Damon sinks his teeth to it and his confrontations with Jeff Bridges are the soul of the movie among other things. There confrontations are brilliantly written and superbly acted. Josh Brolin and Barry Cooper in small roles were Okay. Overall, it's not the usual Western American movie, it's hardcore, entertaining and highly enjoyable at the same times. Coen Brothers did a fantastic job yet again though \"No Country for Old Men\" was way too serious and acceptable for my brains.",

What's new to say? In this case I felt moved to offer an opposing opinion to that of the Cohen Bros fan club that is too well represented here.================================I am suspicious when they re-make classics, but I watched this movie hoping that my scepticism would prove misguided. However, to those who said that this film has been made before, only better, you are absolutely right. Not only is Jeff Bridges (whose body of work I greatly admire) quite unsuitably cast in this role, but neither is the supporting cast up to scratch. My favourite and very funny scene in the 1969 version between Struther Martin and Kim Darby is only palely imitated here.For the rest, the pacing is too slow, Jeff Bridges' speech is often hard to understand, and the other male supports are wasted. And the photography? A lot of it is in complete darkness. You can't see what's the Dickens is going on. To be positive, the unpleasant and vindictive character of Matty Ross is portrayed very well by Miss Steinfeld. I hope she isn't like that in real life.Among the other bad points, I want to single out the frightful singing by the woman (somebody called Iris DeMent apparently) during the closing credits. Just toe-curlingly embarrassing. So bad, they should book her for the next Superbowl.There is just one improvement on the original, that we get to see Matty Ross in later life, grown up into a poisonous embittered old bag. Thinking about it, that was always a possibility but it's still a nice touch. Maybe that comes from the book, I never read it (and why should I, it's not likely to be Shakespeare is it?).Overall though, the original 1969 version with the Duke is otherwise better in almost all respects. Which should surprise nobody.To summarise, it's not the 1-star stinker some say, but it's certainly not worth seeking out or paying money to see. And, not knowing anything of Hollywood politics, all these Oscar nominations just have to be a joke, don't they? Just how the hell does that all work?",

            "content": "\u00a8You must pay for everything in this world, one way and another. There is nothing free except the grace of God.\u00a8 At first sight fans of the Coen brothers might not recognize True Grit as one of their works since it is a bit different from most of their other movies. First of all they never made a remake before and True Grit is actually one which stared John Wayne back in 1969. Sometimes we have so much high expectations from the Two-Headed directors that we expect original work from them, but I have to admit that this film is really superior to the original and the Coen's have made one of the best westerns of the decade. True Grit is based on the novel of the same name written by Charles Portis, and the Coen brothers did an excellent job with the adaptation of the screenplay. The language feels so real for the period the film is depicting (set in 1880) and it just adds to the authenticity of the story, along with the great performance from the entire cast. However in my opinion the highlight of the film is Roger Deakins's beautiful cinematography. Deakins is a regular collaborator for the Coen brothers and he is definitely one of the best in the field. True Grit won't rank among the Coen's best work (it isn't Fargo, The Big Lebowski, nor No Country for Old Men), but it is an excellent film nonetheless and I can't judge this film solely on my high expectations for it. True Grit is an excellent and perfectly executed Western and it will stand out as one of the best among the genre.The movie takes place in a small town in Arkansas where a 14 year girl named Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) narrates the story of how her father has been cowardly murdered by a thief who goes by the name of Tom Chaney (Josh Broslin). Mattie is not your typical teenager; she is very smart and mature beyond her years. She decides to hire a U.S. Marshall to help her catch the runaway fugitive across the Indian nations. The man she is looking for is Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a man who has proved over time to have \u00a8true grit\u00a8, although he looks more like an old and wasted alcoholic. Together they decide to chase Chaney across the Indian nation. Chaney seems to be working with Lucky Ned Pepper's (Barry Pepper) gang, and they seem to be hot on their trail. Rooster and Mattie are not alone in their chase however, as a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) is along the ride with them. He is after Chaney for a crime he committed against a Texas Senator a few years back. Mattie wants Chaney to be brought back to justice in her town in Arkansas for murdering her father and doesn't really want LaBoeuf to catch him and bring him back to Texas where he'll die for killing a politician. The three of them form an unlikely bond on their pursuit of the fugitive.The movie combines the right amount of action with comedy. You can tell Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges had a lot of fun with their roles, and they were great in this movie. Hailee Steinfeld had the most serious role as she played the uptight teenager, and she pulled it off really well. Her character actually did deliver some laughs due to her mature behavior. Steinfeld is the true star of this movie, although she has been considered for an Oscar in the Best Supporting category. There is no way she was a supporting character in True Grit; she had more screen time than anyone else in this movie and more than most of the actresses that are up for Best Lead Actress in the Oscars. I don't know how she pulled it off, but she managed to outshine both Bridges and Damon in this movie, who were really great as well. True Grit received 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and I do agree with those nominations although I don't think it will win many. If Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for Best Cinematography then there is no justice in this world. It is just amazing. The film actually did really well in the Box Office, which isn't usually very typical for a Coen brothers movie, but maybe Steven Spielberg's involvement as the Executive Producer had something to do with that. I actually enjoyed True Grit and I can't find anything negative to say about this movie. It is perfect even though it won't live up to Joel and Ethan's best work. True Grit is without a doubt one of the best films of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

If their purpose is to reinvigorate the public's interest in a lost genre in a way that braver movies like The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford couldn't do then perhaps it'll have been worthwhile.14-year-old Mattie Ross (impressive newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) hires past-it Marshall Rooster Cogburn (a gloriously grumbling Jeff Bridges) and self-promoting dandy Ranger LaBoeuf (an amusing Matt Damon) to track down her father's killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin, playing the simpleton flip-side to No Country's crafty Llewelyn Moss).It's a classical western: a movie crafted to show affection toward, without spoiling, the self-contained myth of the Old West. But this is a Coen Brothers Film\u0099! We're waiting for the sliding, floor-level camera, or the dreamy slow-mo, or the wittily contrived farce \u2013 but it never comes. Ethan and Joel have never tried harder to remove their combined signature from their material. Except, that is, with the script, which, with its elegant Victorian period tongue is often seductive, but too often pokes fun at the world around it, like a nervous friend try to protect us from all the damned ungodliness.As with Tarantino, the Coens make films about films. This isn't a problem so long as they don't venture far from the bubble they've blown for themselves. So, weirdly, True Grit \u2013 almost regal in its fondness for its place and time \u2013 suffers because the writer-directors' impulses have been reined in. In choosing to NOT subvert the western genre, the Coens have subverted themselves. The remarkable have become ordinary.As serious drama, True Grit is hog-tied by its tameness and predictability.

            "content": "I have read reviews and even interviews with the Coen brothers which claim this is not a remake, that it is a very different and more accurate adaptation of the book. Well I beg to differ! I am actually amazed by these claims as having seen the original many times I found this film to be a plain and simple remake. The film does not seem different to the original 1969 version in any clear way. Yes, there are small differences but the feel of the dialogue, characterisations and plot development are not clearly distinct from the original and it does not feel more true to the book or more realistic. If the actual words spoken are different I didn't notice because essentially they were saying the same thing as the dialogue from the original.For people to claim some sort of superiority over the original based on a supposed truer, more realistic feel is in my opinion showing blindness to the actual closeness in content between the 1969 version and this remake. I would say the strengths of the plot, script and characters are the same in both films so credit goes to the book and the original film as it is easier to remake something than to create an original.In comparison to the original the cast are generally less charming and less interesting despite good performances all round. On the plus side Matt Damon is probably about as good as Glen Campbell and in the role of the 14 year old heroine Mattie Ross I would say the excellent original was possibly equalled in acting ability. However the great original casting of Jeremy Slate (Emmett Quincy), Robert Duvall (Ned Pepper), Dennis Hopper (Moon), Alfred Ryder (Goudy), Strother Martin (Col. Stonehill) and Jeff Corey (Tom Chaney) would be difficult to reach and this version has failed to make any of these characters anywhere near as interesting or entertaining.The main problem predictably is trying to replace the great John Wayne. Jeff Bridges is a fine actor with screen presence but even at his best is no match for John Wayne who is one of the 2 or 3 biggest screen icons of all time for a reason. He was a greatly underrated actor (True Grit wasn't even near his best - see 'The Searchers', 'Red River' or the poignant swansong 'The Shootist') but his screen presence and delivery of lines with punch, humour and magic is second to none. How could anyone be expected to replace him. Bridges sadly turns in a slightly substandard performance for him by growling his lines unintelligibly and his lines often fall flat whereas Wayne made simple lines funny and memorable.If you ignore the fact this is a remake and judge it on its own merit I still feel there are issues. The flatness of performance and dull, drab feel of the staging makes it a rather boring drag. I find the frequent use of darkness in the cinematography is far from atmospheric or clever it is a vastly over used clich\u00e9 of modern film making. If you think about it, how much easier and less interesting to the eye is it to film a scene in pitch darkness rather than have a full colour panorama of scenery.Magic moments from the original are not equalled or are left out. For example: John Wayne famously jumping a fence on his horse, apparently unscripted or when Wayne rides, reins clenched in teeth, firing one gun whilst twirling to reload and firing a second rifle. Incidentally this scene is ripped off to good effect in Terminator 2 where Arnie again lifts an iconic John Wayne moment and rides a motorbike instead of a horse! (Another example of Arnie lifting from John Wayne is that Wayne kicked a door in and drawled \"Knock knock\" in 1975's Brannigan before Arnie's rip off in Commando).All in all this is just a remake and a clearly inferior one at that in my opinion. If people like it, fine, if they prefer it to the original then their opinion is very different to mine and if they haven't seen either film my advice is to watch the 1969 version first.",

This one is more based on the novel and it is it's own film. The only thing that is much the same as the 1969 film are it's characters names.There is no danger of a comparison as the story is told well. It is told through the eyes of a 14 year old girl whose father has been murdered. While Rooster Cogburn is still a main character, she is the main story teller. For trivia buffs, let me throw in this tidbit, Rooster & the Texas Ranger have an argument about the Civil War and who fought for who. The Ranger brings up being in the Army of Northern Virginia (Confederate) while Rooster brings up being with Colonel Cantrell (also in theory Confederate). The true history of Cantrell though is that he was a Missouri Rogue who basically went around in Missouri, a border state, murdering & robbing people for profit. This calls into question Cogburns real role in the Civl War. A delicious irony here in John Waynes career as in Raoul Walsh's Dark Command, Wayne plays a Texan trying to foil the very same Cantrell. If you have never seen this 1940 Western, you owe it to yourself to check it out. I wish the Coen brother would try to take Dark Command & do the film story & the real history.. It is one of Wayne's most interesting movies ever. The Coens could make a great film from it.True Grit starts after the father is murdered with the 14 year old girl out to avenge his murderer. She hires Cogburn to help her and a Texas Ranger who wants to bring the same man to justice in Texas kind of joins forces with her & Rooster.These characters are well drawn and the film is well acted, produced and directed.

In this Western there is no underlying dark backstory, you take the characters for what they are during the film, there is no hidden meaning, no lesson the film is trying to teach the viewers. It's simply a group of good guys, Rooster is complicated but is a \"good guy\", against a group of bad guys. It's a traditional Western, modernized, and shot to perfection with fantastic dialog and delivery. It's also not a \"Coen\" film, or it's very subtle in their traditional style and I appreciate the restraint, especially considering they were remaking a beloved John Wayne classic.The production was fantastic, all facets, and again the cinematography was perfect. I enjoyed all the performances, if anything Jeff Bridges Rooster felt closer to the book in character than the great John Wayne, and Matt Damon's Laboeuf was goofy and corny in a great way. The standout was the unbelievable performance by Hailee Steinfeld, she absolutely carried the movie and was robbed of an Oscar. Honestly, regardless of age, if that wasn't an Oscar winning performance that year I don't know what could have been, every time I rewatch this film I appreciate her performance more and more.I love this film, it's a top 5 modern Western for me, my only knock is some odd pacing issues leading up to the finish.9.5/10.",

            "content": "The Western. Arguably the single most recognisable genre across the landscape of all films. The plot, the physical setting and the larger-than-life, almost cartoonish characters defined Hollywood blockbusters during the late 1950s and the entire decade following. More recently, the Western has enjoyed a modernised resurgence through quality films such as 3:10 To Yuma, There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men, also directed by the Coen brothers.In 1969, John Wayne starred in (and won the Oscar for) True Grit. Over 40 years later, the talented directing duo have taken the same material and moulded it for a contemporary audience, oddly, through closer adherence to Charles Portis' 1968 novel than the original film. It follows the efforts of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a teenager wise beyond her years, who is intent on bringing to justice the man who killed her father. To do so, she enlists the help of Matt Damon's upstanding Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (pronounced 'le-beef') and Jeff Bridges' Rooster Cogburn (awesome name for a cowboy, by the way), a renegade bounty hunter who plays only by his own rules.The ensemble acting is a big positive for this film, with two actors standing out among the pack. Bridges is nothing short of a living legend at this stage of his career, and the growling, menacing persona he creates for Rooster is even more threatening than what John Wayne manages to do with the character. Hailee Steinfeld astounds, putting in the most complete, convincing performance I've seen from any child actor for a long time.Perhaps the only factor more impressive than the acting is the spectacular script. With True Grit, the Coens have constructed a flawless depiction of the way people back in 1880 would have conversed with each other. Because nobody alive today talks that way, the dialogue has a Shakespearean, almost Biblical quality to it that makes it a joy to listen to. And of course, there is the regular injection of black humour and strange side characters that make a Coen film instantly recognisable (wait for the arrival of 'Bear Man', in what is the most peculiar yet comical scene of the entire movie).Unfortunately, the film is not without its flaws. My biggest concern is the pacing, which appears off-kilter from the opening scene and never truly recovers. Some were quick to praise the way the film opened with the aftermath of the murder, rather than plodding its way towards the catalyst for the series of events like the 1969 version. That's fair enough, but from that point the film really slows down, and the trade-off for such an engaging screenplay turns out to be a lack of progressive, fast-paced scenes that really define the plot structure of the Western. Put simply, the action: dialogue ratio is similar to that of Inglourious Basterds. The difference is that that style suits Tarantino, but fails to accommodate this sort of film.There is a moment in the Third Act where Mattie comes face-to-face with her father's killer for the first time, which requires an immense suspension of disbelief. It feels as if the directors realised they spent too much time on the journey without offering ample screen time for the climax, and it results in a swift and lazy introduction of new villains who don't get nearly enough time to develop their characters into the kind that we desperately want to see beaten by the goodies. The conclusion is satisfying enough, but it's followed up by a 'twenty-five years later' epilogue that is just plain unnecessary. But ultimately, the acting gold on display coupled with a marvellous script manages to overshadow the negatives, enough to push this film from a possible six into a just-barely-got-there seven.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",

            "content": "I haven't reviewed anything in a long time. I've seen some notably good and bad movies but this one has a lot to be said about it. I went to this movie with my boyfriend who is a big fan of western's. I'm not as much a fan but I enjoy a good old western shoot 'em up flick every once in a while. It did look interesting and it was a remake of a John Wayne film- How could it not be good? So I bit the bullet and tagged along not expecting much but hoping to be entertained. Let me just start with this- Its boring! Plain as that. It has long, lengthy, tedious, monotonous, redundant conversations about mundane and uninspired normal everyday things. (Such as haggling over a horse... Come on that conversation did NOT need to last 5-10 minutes). The lead Mattie was pretentious. She was a deeply annoying kid trying to play big girl and it was frankly quite irritating. I didn't find her to be \"Tough as nails\" like a few people are describing her especially since when things didn't go her way she threw out the \"I have a good lawyer\" threat to help her out. Her performance was wooden to say the least. For a girl who's father had just died she didn't seem that upset. I'm not asking she cry her eyes out every minute but her frigid demeanor could have been broken at least once to humanize the character, who can really care about or sympathize for someone who just acts like a puppet for the director?None of the performances are anything spectacular. Jeff Bridges plays a drunk and Matt Damon plays an overcompensating jerk. There was no real action. It was a lot talking, horse riding, arguing... The most shooting done was a ridicules scene where the drunk tries to prove he isn't wasted and tries to shoot a bottle and cornbread. The movie didn't flow well. There were long boring drawn out scenes of nothing important. And then the important scenes were rushed. There was no time to savor the victory because it was so fast and sudden. The plot was just too thin. The very ending was a last attempt to add spice to this terrible film but nothing could save it. The plot needed to be thicker and more interesting, the characters needed more character, development and be less one dimensional, The script needed to be completely rewritten I don't even know where to begin on how bad it was and this movie just to be completely honest and blunt SUCKED.",

            "content": "(True Grit) has the potential to be a revenge story, a buddy movie, a road movie, and a western thriller. While the Coen brothers served all of that to fair extent, they put some of their trademark dark touch to the mix.Watch carefully moments like the 3 criminals get executed, the tale of capturing and killing the runaway criminal in the court, sleeping among the corpses; \"Would you sleep in a coffin?!\" as the undertaker asks ironically the girl, then the chain of killings till the very end. It begins in a mortician's place, and it ends in a cemetery. The girl lost her father, then her once-second father and protector. Moreover, there are many loses along the way; the girl's arm, the Texas Ranger's tongue, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn's strength; \"I'm going old\" as he tells sadly. So what did matter among this ocean of deaths and casualties? It's the beauty of unity, represented through the power of law, and its enforcement together.The movie showcases 2 different viewpoints. The rising pure law; through the girl who threatens everybody non-stop with her lawyer; as her always winning card. And the wild law enforcement; through the movie's 2 marshals; whether the old dusty expert who can improvise, or the younger clean-cut less intuitive. Obviously, they win together; Cogburn kills 3 of the gang single-handedly, then LaBoeuf kills their fourth, then the young Mattie kills the main goal Chaney, yet with referring symbolically that the law's arm can get short, and the law enforcement can get weak. However, being together provides a \"fun\" time; as the old Mattie describes the journey that she had once.The cinematography, enjoying shooting the nature aesthetically, must remind you of the classic westerns. It's something that has been absent for long time now. The cast did a marvelous job. Jeff Bridges was that gruff drunken hero. However, Elizabeth Marvel was the one who stole the show as Mattie Ross. My God, she was her character to scary extent. Matt Damon is originally not fit for his character, a 50 year old Marshall, and didn't convince me much, unless as a talkative silly! The gospel music theme \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" is used throughout the movie perhaps for achieving the meaning about the importance of having arms, arms like the ones that held Mattie at the end to be cured, arms that could complete her after losing one of hers, or arms that can enforce the law to be \"safe and secure from all alarms\" as the song says.Overall, it is memorably good. Personally, I adored the 4 and half minutes running sequence of trying to save Mattie from the snake's bite; it sums up the true grit as heroic feature, and the movie as wonderfully made.It's about being whole together, whatever incomplete we are. It's about finding a life in carrying out justice, as if it's some kind of getting even with death. And it's a long-yearned for western. A thrilling and sad. The Coen brothers did satisfy both the genre, and their dark touch.",

            "review_title": "Better than the 1969 classic with John Wayne",
            "content": "Below are few reasons why the Coen brothers' \"True Grit\" is so good \u2013 a better, stronger movie than the 1969 version.For me it all starts with the music. When I heard the timeless chords of \"Leaning On The Everlasting Arms\" in the opening scene of the 2010 version, a famous Beethoven's saying came to my mind: \"Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy\u0085\" To me it would be a blasphemy even to think about comparing the heavenly, simple and comforting melody of the old hymn with the fancy, but ordinary and outdated music score from the 1969 movie.The two adaptations differ significantly in their genre and depth. The 1969 version is more of a pure western kind, with the traditional Hollywood happy end, only slightly overshadowed by some minor collateral damage - human casualties. The movie does not give you much food for thought or any noticeable reason for reflection. The 2010 movie is much closer to the original novel. Without loosing a western feel, it also offers a deep and though-provoking main idea, tersely formulated by Mattie Ross: \"You must pay for everything in this world one way or another. There is nothing free except the Grace of God\". At the beginning of the movie naive and grieving Mattie understands this idea simply as a human justice and she is ready to carry out the justice with her own hands and take vengeance on Tom Chaney, the murderer of her dearly loved father. By the end of the movie, 25 years after the main events, it is clear for Mattie (and for us) that the concept is deeper than merely human justice, because the justice itself turned out to come at a price. Everyone had to pay, one way or another \u2013 not only criminals Tom Chaney and \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper, but also Rooster Cogburn, LaBoeuf, and \u2013 a bitter irony of the movie and of the novel \u2013 Mattie herself. I do not think it was an accident that the price that Mattie paid was the highest.It is not surprising that the two so different movies offer quite different takes on the same characters. The portrayal of the legendary US Marshall Rooster Cogburn, the one with \"true grit\", has of course sparked the biggest controversy.Some people would say that John Wayne, as a southerner with an outgoing personality, was a better fit for Rooster Cogburn than Jeff Bridges. The problem with the 1969 movie, however, is that Rooster Cogburn there is not authentic. In the beginning of the movie, we still can see some awkward attempts to show certain flaws in the Cogburn's character. By the end, however, he triumphantly emerges as a knight in shining armor, a hero, almost a Prince Charming \u2013 masculine, strong, exciting, charismatic, energetic \u2013 and counterfeit. Do not get me wrong - I think that John Wayne was great in the movie and I fully enjoyed his performance, but the person, who he played, although very, very likable, simply was not Rooster Cogburn.Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridgesis much less exciting. He is obviously very good at what he is doing, but most of the time he is drunk, untidy, grumpy, melancholic, weak, boring, irritated, and broken. In other words, he is not a poorly disguised prince temporarily bewitched into a Beast as played by John Wayne. Jeff Bridges is believable as a Civil War veteran who served in Confederate guerrilla, a twice-divorced loner, and a father who has not seen his only child for many years. He is believable as the \"meanest\" US Marshall with a \"true grit\" and a sad life story, who killed 23 men in 4 years. Unlike the John Wayne's character, he makes us feel sadness and compassion rather than excitement and admiration.Overall, authenticity is a big problem for the 1969 movie. The 2010 version, however, meticulously follows both the novel and the historical truth in everything, from the costumes to the speech, from the decorations to the geographical locations, from the time of the year to the important developments of the original story. The 1969 classic unfortunately misses the mark in almost all the elements above.I can go on and on comparing the movies, either holistically, or scene by scene, or actor by actor. The 1969 version is a fine western that is fun to watch and is worth renting even today. It has some good scenes and good acting by John Wayne, Kim Darby, and especially Robert Duvall in a small but quite memorable supporting role of \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper.However, there is probably not a single component where the 1969 movie surpasses the 2010 movie. Therefore, no matter how you slice it or dice it, the true winner is without a question the 2010 version of \"True Grit\". knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",

            "content": "It is rarely fair to compare a movie to the book it was based on, but remakes of films almost demand comparison, and \"True Grit\" is an interesting case study.The Coen Brothers, as usual, are more about technical skills than character or story, and their \"True Grit\" is technically at least the equal of Henry Hathaway's. The new version has more appropriate music than the orchestral Elmer Bernstein score in the 1969 original. And Matt Damon is a significant improvement over Glenn Campbell in the role of the Texas Ranger. But so far as I can tell, that's the extent of the improvements.The cinematography is admirable in both cases, Lucien Ballard's in 1969, Roger Deakins's in 2010. The supporting cast measures up surprisingly well-- Dakin Matthews may even improve on Strother Martin as the horse-trader, and Barry Pepper is a worthy heir to Robert Duvall as the outlaw leader, Ned Pepper. Hailee Steinfeld is steelier than Kim Darby, and younger than the 14-year-old character Mattie (Steinfeld was 13, Darby was 21), but both interpretations serve the story, in part because Mattie is an implausible girl to begin with, preternaturally self-possessed and sporting a vocabulary that stretches credulity for the daughter of a farmer in rural Arkansas in 1903. But never mind her. The 1969 version remains superior for at least two reasons.First, the locations in Colorado's San Juan mountains are glorious, especially in the fall when the aspens turn golden. Austin and environs can't compare. (Neither are true to the novel, which takes place mainly in Arkansas and present-day Oklahoma.) The original \"True Grit\" is worth watching if only for the locations, including the old courthouse in Ouray.Second, and crucially, John Wayne. I am not a big fan of the Duke's, though I admire his work in some films, particularly Stagecoach, Rio Bravo (another Henry Hathaway picture), and The Shootist. But he is the better Rooster Cogburn by a mile. He imbues the role with dignity, while Jeff Bridges presents a sordid has-been whom we first meet in an outhouse. What's more, although Wayne was more movie star than actor, he did at least manage to speak his lines intelligibly. Bridges is so proud of his acting chops (which are good for Hollywood) that he self-indulgently chews his way through the dialog. It's almost an act of contempt toward the audience, and certainly toward the writers, that he uses mumbling as character development. I missed half his lines, and only realized how terse and wise the character was when I watched Wayne's version again.",

            "content": "It is curious as to why the Coen brothers, two of the greatest directors in cinema history, have taken so long to tackle a western. Their style and feel is ideally suited to the grit and the mystery of the West, most evident in No Country For Old Men, Blood Simple and even The Big Lebowski. How I rejoiced when I heard that not only were they to apply their trade to the western, but were to film a re-adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name. Of course, it has already been filmed back in 1969 in the not-bad John Wayne version, but the original film always lacked that toughness, and the most important aspect of the film, the character of Mattie Ross, was messed up in the form of the highly annoying and 22-year old Kim Darby. The Coen's new adaptation sticks close to the source novel.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a 14 year old girl whose father has just been murdered and robbed by the notorious Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Lacking faith in the law to bring her father's murderer to justice, she seeks out a lone lawman who has the 'true grit' to tackle such a job, and finds it in the form of trigger-happy U.S. Marshal Ruben 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). Cogburn is a drunkard who always shoots first, asks questions later, but Mattie sees in him the ability to see her father avenged. After reluctantly agreeing, Cogburn sets out with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who has something of a financial gain with the capture of Chaney, and the two are eventually joined by the determined Mattie.This is all that someone who has seen the 1969 original will be familiar with, as the 2010 version is in some ways very similar to it. However, the Coen's have their fingerprints all over this, and features some trademark quirky humour and some magnificent cinematography. In my opinion, this is their greatest film since Miller's Crossing, which I consider their best. Their are some fine moments, such as a strange meeting with a man clothed in bearskin (complete with bear head) who tries to sell Cogburn and Mattie the corpse that they cut down not long before, and a shooting contest between LaBouef and a bladdered Cogburn.The biggest problem with the original, as I mentioned before, is the character of Mattie Ross and the actress who played her. She was frustrating and bratty, and the focus of the film seemed to linger on John Wayne's Cogburn. This is Mattie's story and the Coen's wisely make sure that she dominates the film. In Steinfeld, they have found an actress who will surely go on to great things. She is absolutely stunning in the lead, brimming with confidence, intelligence and Southern sass. She manages to hold her own with two Oscar winners, and if anything, blows them out of the water. It's simply one of the finest child performances in many, many a year. Not to say the support is slacking. Bridges, as well as Steinfeld, has received an Oscar nomination for his efforts, and makes for a much better Cogburn than Wayne. John Wayne famously received his only Oscar win for the original film, but it seems now looking back that it was more of a token gesture for a body of work than anything. Wayne had that lived-in look, but Bridges has the acting chops. Matt Damon seems to have been forgotten amongst the two main leads, but his performance is also great, bringing a welcome humour and slight sexual tension to the film.A trademark for the Coen's is the cinematography, here again working with their lifetime companion Roger Deakins. Never has the West been captured with such astounding beauty and terrifying menace. The final third of the film, in which Mattie encounters Chaney and his gang, led by 'Lucky' Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, no relation), eventually leads to a night-time dash through the night. The night is shot with a crisp and starry mystery and magic - it is simply beautiful. It is also a nodding homage to Charles Laughton's 1955 masterpiece The Night Of The Hunter.I hope that this cleans up at the Oscars, even though I know it won't. It's one of the finest films of the past decade, and one of the Coen's very best. Funny, moving, exciting, and absolutely stunning.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

There are many out there cussing and kicking up a storm by the idea of anyone attempting to remake a beloved film, which just happened to feature a beloved actor in a role that is now iconic. Well, I'm not against remakes and I personally find the original film to be merely good and not a true, 100% classic. With that said, I do think it's better than the film we get here, which is clearly a loving tribute to the Western genre but in my eyes it's very little else. There's no question that we're treated to some fine direction, great cinematography and some great performances but in terms of anything nearing a great film I just don't see it. Perhaps my reluctance to call the original film a masterpiece or this one here a great movie simply comes from the fact that TRUE GRIT just isn't my type of story. I personally find it rather simple but the performances in both films carried the day. I'll just forget the original film from here on out but this one here suffers some of the same problems. We can start with the story itself, which really isn't anything too ground breaking and it's simply a revenge plot with a spunky kid and a rugged old man. The relationship of the two is certainly where the story tries to find it's heart but I had a hard time here because the film, to my eyes, never really seemed to know what it wanted to be. The homage is all over the place but I could never put my finger on the Rooster character. Was he some washed up joke of a man? Was he this brilliant Marshall everyone in town made him out to be? There were several times in the film where I didn't see anything but a drunk and it appears the film just didn't know what they wanted. At one time Rooster will be seen as a hard but fair man but then he would be looked at as some type of joke. Just take a look at the scene where we meet him and of course it's in a toilet. Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and he certainly gives a good performance here but I'm really not sure if the rugged voice was necessary. It seems the performance really gets pushed to the side so that the character Rooster Cogburn can have his look and persona. Steinfeld clearly steals the film as the young Mattie as she really was close to the age of the character but she also managed to make you believe how smart and tough she is. The young actress does a remarkable job holding her own against the Oscar-winner and nominees that she finds herself acting with. Matt Damon plays the Texas Ranger but I was shocked to see how little he was given outside some comic banter with Bridges. Barry Pepper does a very good job as Lucky Ned but Josh Brolin is wasted as the murderous Tom Chaney. The screenplay really underwrites several of the supporting characters as none of them are fully written. I guess I'll lie and bring up the original film again but this remake just seems like it doesn't know if it really wants to go wild and be its own or try to stick close to what happened in the previous version. There are brief hints of violence as if the Coen's want to go all out yet even it's is held back. There are hints of a darker tone that simply never comes out anywhere. I think the screenplay is certainly the biggest villain here but as many negative things I'm saying there are still enough reasons to check this out. The performances are certainly fun and the film is great to look at but as I walked out of the theater I couldn't help but think I was watching something that didn't live up to its full potential.",

However, with the Coen name attached to it, I found myself longing for saloons, shoot outs, horses, and tumbleweed.Following in the footsteps of the 1969 Oscar winner starring John Wayne, True Grit follows the story of an impetuous young girl by the name of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld). She is determined to find the man who killed her father and see that he is hanged. Mattie seeks out the rootin' tootinest U.S. marshal she can find to join her on a journey to see that justice is served.Enter Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). With a gruff voice, a bad attitude, and an eye patch, Rooster turns Mattie down when she approaches him with her request that they set out together. After she tracks him down in an outhouse, a court-house, and the back of an Asian market, stinking of whiskey and unable to roll his own cigarette, he caves.Set to meet with Rooster the following morning, Mattie wakes up to a pipe smoking LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) watching her sleep. He's come to offer his assistance in the slaying of Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), whom he has been after for quite some time. Mattie, being the hard-nosed 14-year-old she is, firmly declines. She already has all the help she needs. Or does she? The day Mattie embarks on her journey, things get interesting and the movie takes off from there. In a story full of classic western charm, everything falls perfectly into place. Jeff Bridges is a hard one to read. Is he the good guy? Is he the bad guy? Is he really helping Mattie? All of these questions circle in my mind as the plot thickens.With an all-star cast and a few Coen brother favorites, the dialogue rolls along smoothly and Bridges is perfectly timed. His ability to be comic relief and the tough cowboy type simultaneously is uncanny. For a film like this, it would be difficult to write a lot about it and give very little away.I will say that Matt Damon shines as does newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. Her performance is reminiscent of a young Tatum O' Neal in Paper Moon which won her an Oscar at 10 years old.Coen standby Josh Brolin is fantastic, as usual. Barry Pepper, looking very menacing, has a short but very sweet role.True Grit has plenty of grit and delivers a superb movie-going experience. Jeff Bridges is sure to give the best actor nominees at the Academy Awards a run for their money. Saddle up and get to the theaters to see this one pronto, partner.",

            "content": "I got screwed tonight seeing the remake of TRUE GRIT. A truly AWFUL film. No remake is as bad as this one. The color was overly manipulated by computer. 99% of films today use that color manipulation to excess. You know it didn't look anything like that when they were filming. Bridges is and always has been an overrated actor. His performance is turgid, cartoonish and terribly affected. It's as if he mastered the redneck accent that sounded somewhat authentic for a line or two and then delivered it the same way for EVERY line on that very SAME note. His ENTIRE performance, like everyone's was done in monotone. The southern accents all on one note, no variations. Nobody TALKS like that. Certainly not in the late 1800's. It was if the actors were READING it ? The performance by Hailee Steinfeld sounds overly memorized and rehearsed. Very few, if any pauses within or between the dialogue. All the acting was ACTING. Nobody made their characters real or connected within themselves to bring them to life. It's as if they were repeating the same line over and over again. Then to make matters worse, they cast a handsome movie star in the role of villain Tom Chaney ?? I almost broke out laughing at the site of Brolin's ridiculous attempt at being a homeless outlaw. Another BIG fault of the script is it's failure to introduce Chaney at the beginning of the story, so when Mattie encounters the man who murdered her father later on down the road it's a shock to the audience. Introducing Chaney at the end of the movie has NO IMPACT or feeling of dread. Rather than authentic, the costumes were chic, designed to become trendy or to be photographed for a section in Vanity Fair or win an award at the fashion institute. Too much detail and expensive tailoring for these surroundings. The computer generated snakes may look believable to young children, but fail to look authentic to any trained eye. One redeeming element about the film is that they allowed the character of LaBoeuf to live. Otherwise, no charm, no excitement, no sense of suspense and worse, no humor. Just a blatant remake rip off of a classic from start to finish.",

            "content": "(www.plasticpals.com) The Coen brothers are a wonderful writing and directing duo, so despite my general lack of enthusiasm for Westerns I gave True Grit the benefit of the doubt, and I'm glad I did. I've never seen the 1969 original, but I doubt it would stand up to this modern retelling. Everything from the acting down to the costume design is about as good as it gets.Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn, a U.S. Marshal hired by 14-year-old Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) to find and capture the man who killed her father. Seemingly wise beyond her years, Steinfeld does a fine job of playing the calculating young woman and Bridges embodies the drunken old man. It turns out Ross' father's murderer is wanted for crimes in Texas too, and Matt Damon is in town as LaBeouf, a Texas Ranger who is also after him.Against their better judgement, Mattie's tenacity convinces Cogburn and LaBoeuf that she has what it takes to tag along. The ongoing clash between Cogbun and LaBeouf, and Mattie's inexhaustible stubbornness provide most of the entertainment. There really aren't that many action scenes, but the film maintains an enjoyable balance of humour and tension throughout. Along the way we're treated to the stark scenic beauty Westerns are known for.This is easily one of the better films I've seen in the past few years.",

            "content": "If you've seen the 1969 True Grit and enjoyed it (and I have, and I did), it is impossible to approach a remake without carrying out comparisons, no matter how much you want to.On my personal comparison scale, I rate the 2010 True Grit on a par with the 1969 version. It is fascinating to have two movies which are so very similar and yet so very different - apart from the bookending of the story and a few variations as the movies go along, the stories and, indeed, much of the dialogue in both films appear to have been drawn directly from the same source, there is so little difference in them. For the record, this version is excellent and is by far the most accessible movie to come from the Coen brothers (who irritate me more often than they please me).To turn to the differences, the look of the movie is one of them - this version is beautiful in a different way, being photographed in soft pastels rather than the vibrant primaries of the 1969 version.The performances are the other main differences. In 1969, True Grit was John Wayne's movie. In 2010, the film belongs to Hailee Steinfield's Mattie Ross. Where Kim Darby's stridency irritated from the moment she first appeared on screen, Miss Steinfield gives us wisdom beyond her years and steely determination in a person who we never forget is just fourteen. She acts everyone else off the screen which is no mean feat given Matt Damon's very human Texas Ranger, a real person as opposed to Glen Campbell's cypher - pleasing enough, but lacking in substance.And what of Rooster? Had there never been the first version of this story, Jeff Bridges' Rooster would have served perfectly well. But the fact that John Wayne's Rooster was his normal screen persona writ somewhat broader than usual leaves me looking at Bridges' version as a much more mannered performance, and the fact that it is a performance is, I think, the main criticism to be levelled at it. Using Spinal Tap criteria, his performance could have been usefully dialled down to 8 or 9 rather than cranked up to 11.And one more comparison criticism was that I never really felt Bridges' Rooster develop the genuine feeling of fondness towards Mattie which Wayne showed.But these are minor quibbles - I am delighted that both versions exist, and I like them both a great deal.",

It's in the mid 1870's and Frank Ross is murdered by a man named Tom Chaney. Chaney flees to prevent being hung. When 14 year old Mattie Ross arrives to take care of her father's business and to find Tom Chaney she is told Chaney fled to the Indian nations and in order to get him she's have to hire a US Marshall.

The journey is long hard and full of death and in the end they all find they possess True Grit. Jeff Bridges is outstanding as Rooster Cogburn Hailee Stansfeild is outstanding as Mattie Ross. The movie is so faithful to the book that when I read the book I expected to see a eye patched John Wayne Rooster Cogburn climb out of the pages and was disappointed to not find that. Here You can see the characters change you find Rooster Cogburn is very much a hero and that Mattie Ross changes him from a drunk back to a member of the human race. The Ending is sad and yet fitting as it was in the book. I hope Jeff Bridges gets a Oscar for his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn because he earned it.",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers' spectacular True Grit, a remake that surpasses the John Wayne original, is certainly one of the best movies of 2010 and is worthy of Oscar consideration. The cast is flawless, the vistas are starkly realized, and the dialog sounds like I imagine people talked in the late 1800s. And although its conclusion may not really seem in doubt, it's the journey that makes the film; the attention to detail regarding the Old West is granular in nature.Young Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) is a 14-year-old farm girl who's come to Fort Smith, Arkansas to collect the remains and effects of her father, who had been gunned down by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie is in town for additional reasons, though; she aims to contract with a U.S. Marshal to bring Chaney to justice. That man turns out to be Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a mean-spirited drunkard wearing an ominous black eyepatch. Cogburn accepts the teen's offer for the apprehension of Chaney; joining the duo is a Texas Ranger named LeBouef, played with dusty glee by Matt Damon.I have seen most of the Coen Brothers' films over the years and have found them to be terrific storytellers. They're filmmakers who revel in the intricacies of their movie's environment. Atmosphere, particularly in movies that are set in long-ago times in forgotten places, is crucial. Of course, we have recently seen how well the brothers can do Western pictures, with the great No Country for Old Men \u2014 but True Grit is a movie that has more of the trappings of a traditional Western, more no-good varmints, more spittin' and drinkin', more dirt.The acting is astounding. Here, Bridges is more like John Wayne than I think even John Wayne was, and it would be a surprise if he didn't earn himself another Oscar nomination. Damon brings his typical panache and is also a great fit. But the real highlight is young Steinfeld herself. She's mesmerizing in her delivery, using language you'd expect out of a much-older person. And I don't mean profanity, either; Mattie is clever, logical, and focused on one goal \u2013 the arrest or death of Mr. Tom Chaney. Her perseverance is at the very solar plexus of the film. She is adamant that everything occurs on her terms, and she's smart enough to know when she's being presented with a raw deal. She's even able to negotiate a deal for her father's effects, so she can use the money to offer as a reward for Chaney's capture. Mattie is not innocent of mind; she knows full well what could happen on the trail, but she is bound and determined to see her father avenged. That's not to say that the character is simple, or even one dimensional; as single minded as Mattie is, she comes across complicated, ethical decisions during her trek and grows up a significant amount. Steinfeld is a tower of strength and a bastion of morality and kindness. And although the movie centers around her anyway, she could easily have been overshadowed by her grizzled costars; instead, she rises above them all. This could be the sign of a fine career to come. Hailee Steinfeld makes this movie and embodies the mythical true grit.The violence in True Grit is brutal but never off putting. You shouldn't be disgusted, only amazed. Men are shot to death, men are stabbed. This is how the Old West was: frontier justice. Throughout the movie, there's talk about taking Chaney back to Arkansas or to Texas to answer for his various crimes before a judge. But in the back of our minds, that's not what we want to see. Like Mattie Ross, we want vengeance, we want justice, we want closure, and we want blood.True Grit has chilling moments and plenty of action, and there are also several sweet, tender moments as well. It is a glorious, old-school Western, a rare gem of a movie, one of the finest of recent vintage.",

Tailing Mattie Ross as she embarks to find the someone with 'True Grit' as to avenge the cold-blooded death of her father. Notorious Rooster Cogburn who is being trialled for his merciless shoot-sprees reluctantly accompanies her along with LaBeouf, played by a more dimensional Damon.Bridges talons the slobby, cocky, yet successful tyrant with mumbling prosperity; think how different Brando can be with subtitles in The Godfather, it would only be annoying if it wasn't a memorable trait of the character. Hailee though steals the show with her nigh-high maturity and an aptitude for trading, if either of them will win the Oscar, its almost certainly will be her (would be a tad harsh to ignore Colin, again).Compared to the Coen's last flirtation with Western this is more rugged and down to earth, dealing less with intense character portrayal and enigmatic tones, frequently breaking the ice quotable Bridges moments (there are many to be found) or a round of obliterating food that's tossed into the air. Either way it feels more welcome mainstream, and is a no brainer for Coen fans.",

Or four? At least, I can safely say, I came into 2010's True Grit with an open mind.My observations: great acting from the little girl \u2013 isn't that always the case? (SEE: Let the Right One In, Kick-Ass) And despite me hardly understanding half of what Jeff Bridges says in the movie (possibly my bad, but still) he did a good job as well.The movie on a whole: it was interesting. Opened some doors, but seriously\u0085it's nothing new. Remember, I haven't even seen the original and know this wasn't hardly original in its own right. Revenge? Check. Revenge in a western? Check. Causalities/pain and learning along the way? Check again.This is an opinion piece, so I have every right to state what I viewed. I understand what they did for realism: the (probably tobacco-filled) voice of Bridges as Rooster was distracting. The endless night/TOO-DARK shots where we couldn't see anything was annoying. And the overall slow scenes where we knew they were headed was tedious.Sure, this is gathering some good buzz, probably on the girl's (Hailee Steinfeld) performance and the fact it's another Coen Brother's film. Personally, I watched it for three reasons: Coens, Bridges and the buzz. But, honestly, I felt it was one of the weakest Coens efforts, it was a ho-hum Bridges and doesn't deserve the buzz it got.Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) is a little lawyer-threatening girl who lost her father to Chaney (Brolin) and wants to hire the best to track him, in this case, drunk & washed up marshal Rooster Cogburn (Bridges.) After several attempts and many scenes, he agrees and off they go and eventually meet up with rival bounty hunter/Texan Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to bring justice when all Ross wants is blood.Overall, the movie kept my interest\u0085to a minimum. It's obvious how it's supposed to play out \u2013 SCENE BY SCENE, so I was hoping to get more insight into the characters along the way. Bridges did a fine job of his character development, even though it was seen from a mile away.AGAIN\u0085I'm not into westerns, but the few I've seen, I've actually really loved: Unforgiven, Open Range, Wyatt Earp, Brokeback Mountain and the number one: Dances with Wolves. Those five I've mentioned aren't the only westerns I've seen, but they are the best I've seen and they left such an impact on me, I had to pause after each movie was over to digest the powerful films and experiences I just had. True Grit literally did nothing for me. That's not to say it was a bad film, it just added absolutely nothing to my life.",

For those concerned about a remake of the John Wayne classic, fear not! Joel and Ethan instead remain true to the Charles Portis novel. In fact, the Portis prose is what adds the uniqueness to this story of revenge.One may assume that Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn would dominate the movie, but I suggest to you that relative newcomer Hailee Steinfeld (as Mattie Ross) more than holds her own, and in fact, often carries the story. We never once doubt her commitment to the cause ... hunting down the man who shot her father. That man, Tom Chaney, is played in a most peculiar manner by Josh Brolin. Brolin's dim-witted Chaney borders on a cartoon character, except he has a real mean streak.There are so many wonderful touches in this film that I am not sure where to start. Obviously, the Portis dialogue jumps out immediately. Watching the grizzled, grungy cowpokes and this 14 year old farm girl spout off such beautiful prose forces a smile to your face. It is an enjoyable challenge just to keep up with the banter between Cogburn, Mattie and LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), a Texas Ranger who also happens to be hunting Chaney. There are also hilarious exchanges between Mattie and a local horse trader, and later Barry Pepper (as Ned Pepper) joins in with some top notch verbal sparring.DP Roger Deakins does his thing with the camera and landscape. We feel we are right there on the dusty trail or on a snowy ride. The wardrobe, guns and town all come across as totally authentic and add to the richness of the film. There are no hokey vista shots without purpose. Everything in the film has a reason and contributes to the cause of presenting a terrific western story of revenge and retribution. Watching the bond develop between the main characters is quite moving, and though I wasn't ready for it to end, I found the ending quite acceptable.The trailer for this film is one of my favorites of the year. Johnny Cash singing \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" is not in the film, but it certainly set the mood. So, no real surprise here, but another fantastic film from the Coen Brothers. You don't have to be a lover of westerns to enjoy this one and, please, no worries about Jeff Bridges facing off against John Wayne. There is room for both!",

That is probably the best thing to do, instead of risking to desecrate a revered Western classic.I am not much of a fan of Westerns. However, \"True Grit\" can really grab your attention up to the very end. Unlike other Coen projects, the storyline of \"True Grit\" is quite easy to comprehend and like. (Sorry, bu I totally did NOT like their Oscar Best Picture winner \" No Country for Old Men.\")The main protagonist in this film is Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld). She is a precocious, self-confident and strong-willed 14 year old girl who wants to bring her father's killer to justice. To do this, she hires the services of the toughest of Marshalls, \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), whom she decided was the one with \"true grit.\" Together with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), the three unlikely \"pardners\" brave the wild wild West to search for, capture or kill the outlaw Ton Chaney (Josh Brolin).For a second year in a row, Jeff Bridges tackles another inebriated character from the country, Bad Blake from \"Crazy Heart\" (which won him an Oscar Best Actor award) and now, Rooster Cogburn (which has him aiming for the same award again this year). He can play these souses very realistically, at the same time making their annoying characters actually sympathetic. Matt Damon is really amazing here as LaBeouf (which is pronounced in the movie as LaBeef). He plays pretty much against type, a rather comic character, the straight guy to Cogburn's humorous digs. You would not even recognize him here. I am glad he is getting Supporting Actor nomination buzz as well for this most offbeat role!As the 14 year old Mattie, Hailee Steinfeld (born 1997) stands equally with her illustrious senior co-stars in terms of acting chops and screen presence. She is believable as a fearless and headstrong youngster who stopped at nothing to avenge her father's death, despite the character being so totally unbelievable (especially the way we know 14 year-olds these days). The award-giving bodies are having trouble deciding whether her role should be cited as Best Lead Actress or as Best Supporting Actress. For me, there is no question that she plays the lead role here, her tender age notwithstanding.For all fans of Westerns and film lovers in general, this version of \"True Grit\" is a must-watch. As a whole, the execution of the story is quite wholesome, suitable for young and old. Everyone will rally behind Mattie's quest and cheer her on. Of course, as Coen Brothers' project, there are some pretty gruesome violent scenes (especially the scene about a guy's fingers), so be alert if you are queasy. Nevertheless, this movie is bound to be a classic on its own merits.",

Though a remake, it is unwise to underestimate the Coen Brothers. Yes, the story is the same as the 1967 release, (with some altercations), but what makes this film so great is the brilliance and effort that every single person put into the movie.The cast is perfect. I never was a Jeff Bridges fan, but he gives a solid performance as the cocky, cranky, mean, yet lovable Rubin \"Rooster\" Cogburn. Like John Wayne, he takes his own approach on such a memorable character. I can't compare both of them because they are different. The other noteworthy performance is Hailee Steinfield as Mattie Ross. I've never heard of her, but she pulls off the role marvelously, illuminating the screen with the witty dialog, provided only by the Coen Brothers. My guess, both of them will receive nominations at the Oscars (and I hope so). Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also meld into their roles with perfection.The filmmaking quality and techniques is a tour de force. Roger Deakins, probably one of the greatest cinematographers out there, crafts each scene with brilliance, making the movie look and feel like an old western. This is quite noticeable with the rich colors and wide shots of the open terrain. I hope he finally gets the Oscar he so desperately deserves. The set decoration is exquisite and authentic to the time period, the editing is crisp, and the sound design is flawless. On top of that, Carter Burwell's score (which is seldom noticed in most Coen Brother movies) adds an epic western feel.If I had to say one negative thing about this movie, it would be the ending. It happens to quick\u2014not drawn out to a final resolution as the 1967 release. This isn't really bad though, for when a movie is approaching the two hour mark, it's time for the plot to wrap up. The movie doesn't drag though nor does it fly by; it goes at its own steady pace\u2014my eyes were glued to the screen for every minute.In short, the Coen Brothers perfectly executed this film. The story is the same as the John Wayne movie in the 1960s, but the Coen Brothers deliver their own take at their brilliant best. This movie is close to perfect for this year's selection of movies. It has it all: great performances, suspense, witty dialog, and wicked humor. On a side note, this movie is not for the faint of heart. For a PG-13, it is very violent; I'm surprised that this didn't receive the R rating for the violence.My rating 4 out of 4",

The two interpretations of Charles Portis's novel are enough different to stand alone. Besides, Bridges is a true actor, and Wayne just a version of himself, as he admitted about being a well-known actor.Fourteen year-old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) engages Cogburn to help her catch her father's murderer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Along with the two avengers is Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). The three male leads have a challenge with this upstart actress, a treasure the directors unearthed after interviewing thousands of actresses. Watch for her at Oscar time as she may be rewarded for having the film's truest grit.The Coen brothers have crafted another original film in the spirit of No Country for Old Men with a bit of Oh, Brother, Where art thou? thrown in. In the midst of revenge and murder resides the Coen ironic sense of humor, for instance when his characters speak a formal English more Victorian than Texan. Even Josh Brolin's Cheney has dark elements of humor in his dimwitted insouciance. But it is Mattie's perseverance that dominates the film, a testimony to ageless devotion to the right thing without backing down.In fact, so much American Western folklore is centered on steadfast virtue in the face of evil, frequently the character like Gary Cooper's marshal Will Kane in High Noon (1952) left standing alone against the forces of evil. The 20th-century spin is Mattie enlisting help to create a communal cleansing as characters sympathize with her dogged vigilantism.True Grit's compositions and camera are in the best John Ford tradition that emphasizes the impact of the passionate person against an unforgiving landscape\u2014true grit.",

            "content": "A brutal murder, an escaped convict and a scorned kin avenging the death had been a running theme in yesteryear India cinema, especially the 70's and the 80's. What you get with Coen Brothers' True Grit is something similar, but with a Western flavor.After her father was murdered and robbed by his handyman, 14-year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is determined to find the killer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Wanting to settle for no less than the toughest US Marshall around, she hires the one-eyed, old and drunken Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) for his apparent 'true grit'. They are joined in the quest by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to take Chaney dead or alive to Texas where he is wanted for another murder. Cogburn and LaBoeuf are keen to do it themselves and keep the young girl away. The vengeful and tenacious Mattie wants Chaney dead too, but not for other crimes; she would rather kill him for her own reasons. It is her 'true grit' that we get to see.The film is based on a 1968 novel of the same name by Charles Portis. A film of the same name made in 1969 starred John Wayne as Cogburn, a performance that won him an Oscar. The 2010 version too bagged ten nominations but won none.Successful movie makers Joel and Ethan Coen ensure that there is never a moment where it loses neither its plot nor feels draggy. The sharp dialog packs in a punch; can't really have a western flick without slick dialog, you see. The story is about guts plus heart; and this one does it without overdone machismo or sentimental stuff.Hailee Steinfeld who plays the 14-year old Mattie Ross was cast for the role from among 15,000 hopefuls in a nation-wide casting call for a 'simple, tough-as-nails, young woman in post-Civil War Arkansas'. Her stellar debut performance holds the movie together. The Oscar nomination was thoroughly deserved.Acclamined Jeff Bridges makes a mark with Rooster Cogburn. Matt Damon's LaBeouf and Barry Pepper's 'Lucky' Ned Pepper deliver some of the movie's moments. We get to see very little of Josh Brolin. Probably, a few more minutes about his bad side would have helped the audience appreciate the emotional side of the protagonists.In all, what you have here is a well made western. It has an outlaw, three gun trotting folks on horseback and a chase through mountains and forests. Worthwhile!",

            "content": "This is a surprisingly simple Old West story that's presented beautifully by the Coen Brothers and a very talented cast. I saw original movie with John Wayne back in college, and as far as I could tell it was just another John Wayne movie. But this movie stands out from other Westerns in many ways, especially the dialog, which I take it is straight from the novel. The characters speak in truly Victorian prose, something one doesn't expect from an Old West movie. But the actors make it work very well, especially Jeff Bridges, who is somehow able to pull off such formal language while speaking half the time in a drunken mumble that's only half intelligible.The characters also offer a nice study in contrasts, with most of them (both good and evil) holding to an easily understandable code but the central character of Rooster Cogburn being the man who's got one foot in the light and the other in darkness. The cinematography is also beautiful, with some images that are right out of a Remington painting. The acting is excellent all around, but there were times when the LaBoef character seemed a little too flat and artificial. It's hard to think that a seasoned Texas Ranger, even one with a cavalier attitude like LaBoef, would stand his ground and draw a pistol on foot against four mounted bandits (running into the night and hiding with the intent of living to fight another day would be the saner approach). But overall, it's a very nicely done film with a good mix of gritty realism and memorable characters. Eight stars.",

This underlying tenet of True Grit will haunt as well as encourage you, just as it does for the story characters, by the end of the ride.As the chill and darkness of winter sets in on the western frontier a bright and straightforward teen girl, Mattie, is confronted with the murder of her father. The murderer is a hot-headed renegade whom Mattie pursues in order to take revenge. Justice for her is merely a question of time and commitment. Through a combination of stubbornness, wit, desperation and luck Mattie is ultimately joined in the quest by a hard-drinking and opportunistic lawman, Rooster, and an inexperienced but dutiful Texas ranger.\"The wicked flee when none pursue\" it is said in the Book of Proverbs, for they have more to fear in themselves. Such is the case with the unlikely trio of Rooster, Mattie and the ranger. As they zero in on their prey and even though they have good hearts, their conflicting motives, talents and values collide.Initially I was a little disappointed with True Grit. I expected more of the dark humor that I know and love the Coen Brothers for. Certainly there is some of this, but the Coens do something unusual here and something that took me a while to appreciate. They allow this amazing, classic story and its authentic characters to shine on their own. Contributing to the effect are the leafless cottonwood groves, the snowfall, the dark and forbidding outlines of distant mountain ranges, and other spare and visceral images of Roger Deakins. Hailee Steinfeld (Mattie), Jeff Bridges (Rooster), Matt Damon and Josh Brolin add to the realism of this character focused story. What is best about the film is that nothing gets in the way of this classic western story with gun fights, horses, snake pits, adventure, the search for justice, bad deeds, grace, and time slipping away.",

            "content": "TRUE GRIT is one of those rare films that I can give nothing but praise; if anything it's one of the few films in last year's Best Picture list that was actually worth watching. Hell it deserved to win at least one academy award at the Oscar's.The acting was superb with every single cast member fleshing out there characters and making them even more believable than any other cast in a movie released in the same year. Jeff Bridges did one hell of a job as the washout Rooster Cogburn alongside newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Matt Damon the Texas Ranger LaBouef. While effective given what little screen time he had, I honestly wanted to see more of Josh Brolin as Tom Cheney but then again, you can't get everything you want. Character development was very good as young Mattie Ross' story of revenge unfolded against the backdrop of the violent West with the dialog helping cement just that.Visually, everything fell into place; it wasn't hard to believe that the life in the frontier looked that nice but was hell to live in with criminals running about. Other small details such as music and costume design were spot on and did little to hinder the fact that the movie captured the feel of the classic cinematic West. Admittedly the pacing was slow but this paid off since this helped emphasize the feel of actual frontier life when chasing a criminal; boredom in between gunfights with lots of waiting. Action scenes are drawn out in between and in place of blazing gunfights we get character driven scenes which made the characters all the more human.Don't get me wrong, the 1969 version with John Wayne as the lead was great and I do love me a good John Wayne film but this version of TRUE GRIT simply stands out since it was able to make a mark of its own; it didn't succumb to being under the shadow of a classic and instead chose its own path.The only reason why I'm writing this is because for some reason, a lot of people hate it; obviously there's a lack of people who support it. I don't know if it's true for all people who've seen this film but seriously, why all the hate? I've read some forums mentioning that the Coen's TRUE GRIT is nothing compared to the John Wayne version due to a massive lack of gun fights and Rooster Cogburn screen time as the lead, others saying that the film was a total disappointment because of something as trivial as bad CGI backgrounds or slow pacing and debates questioning the possibility of a 400 yard gun shot. Speculations that Paramount Studios paid critics to say good things about the film were also rampant; all of a sudden the Coen brothers who've delivered crazy but great cult classics like THE BIG LEBOWSKI and FARGO are now too mainstream to appreciate. Maybe it's because it's cool to hate pretty much everything that's doing well on the internet right now as seen in the hype backlash against THE DARK KNIGHT and INCEPTION or maybe it's just because people are bored; I don't know.Sure, for a Coen Brothers film TRUE GRIT was pretty shallow, simple and straight forward even after they made a name for themselves by creating unique genre busting films and the fact that it was a PG-13 film didn't help much but the duo still managed to do what they do best; make a good film that's more than worth your money.Bottom line is if you don't like a slow paced Western and prefer the fast paced action ones, go ahead and watch TOMBSTONE or the 2007 version of 3:10 TO YUMA and the like; they're both good films that have heavy emphasis on action balanced with story. There's nothing wrong with liking an action filled Western since everybody has their own tastes that we should respect. But if you are the kind who can stomach a long, sometimes dragging film and trade all the action for good drama and character development, then TRUE GRIT is for you. Comparisons WILL be made with the John Wayne film but don't let the Duke's greatness blind you from seeing a good film. Go buy it on DVD.",

            "content": "After taking the philosophical path with the confounding but brilliant A Serious Man (2009), the Coens are back with a more mainstream picture, a remake of the film that landed the legendary John Wayne his only acting Oscar. More faithful to the novel by Charles Portis, then Henry Hathaway's iconic Western, the Coens' True Grit is a potent and well- executed film, not necessarily one of the brothers' best works, but still a film to be appreciated as a nostalgic Western with a big heart, which is quite the anomaly in today's cinema, and very much an eye- opening experience for many of us.Jeff Bridges plays Reuben Cogburn, a U.S. Marshall who is employed by Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a vocal, determined 14-year old girl to help her to find the person who murdered her father. That person is Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Coincidentally, Chaney is also pursued by a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who wants him for the murder of a senator in Texas, and the money that comes from capturing him. The trio of Cogburn, Ross, and LaBoeuf become the key characters of which most of the narrative is centered upon.What is most distinct in True Grit is its picturesque cinematography. The Academy has owed Roger Deakins an Oscar for a long time, and this is the best chance to reward the nine-time nominee. The framing and composition of shots are amazing, always focused on the characters, but never losing sight of the hostile environment that threatens to bury them. Carter Burwell's mournful score begins the film, immediately accentuating the setting, and foreshadows the events that would unfold later. These events unfold with logic and clarity, and are carefully set-up to milk as much suspense and drama as it is possible.Even though the film is a straight genre exercise for the Coens, True Grit not only reminds us of the brothers' extraordinary gift for writing clever dialogue, but also their trademark marrying of grim situations with offbeat humor. However, most of the film's narrative is structured in such a way that the average viewer could follow easily, and this might not please Coen diehards who would have expected the duo to somewhat reinvent the genre, given their penchant for twisting generic fare. Even then, this film version of Portis' novel is still the definitive one, with better characterizations (especially of its supporting characters), and a more beautiful cinematography to boot.True Grit features two strong performances in Bridges and Steinfeld. Both of them steal the screen whenever they are on, to the extent of leaving Damon and Brolin (who are only above-average here) in the shadows. Fresh from his Oscar-winning turn in Crazy Heart (2009), Bridges gives another towering display of the art of acting while under the influence of alcohol, most notably in the scene where he comically attempts to prove to Damon's character that he is an ace shooter.The lack of action may be a sore point for some viewers, but I applaud the Coens' decision to concentrate primarily on the friendship between Cogburn and Ross as this would have strong bearing on the film's subtle, almost stylized final act, which is as poignant as it is lovingly envisioned by two of American cinema's most treasured artists.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

His character does not embody any of the real grit, toughness, intensity and humour that Wayne brought to it. Matt Damon on the other hand brought in a different kind of Texas Ranger character with less humour and romance and a more realistic sense of duty than Campbell did.Mattie's character lacks the natural incompetence a girl her age would have had that Kim Darby brought to it. She played it with a sense of determination and natural humour that one would expect. Steinfeld just doesn't have it. She's too precise and self assured. In the original, Mattie whipped out her threat from her lawyer Daggert like a pistol. That in itself was quite humorous. Her sense of strength and growing confidence was dependent on her lawyer and on Rooster. Steinfeld was simply not believable.Even the ending is dark, melancholy and lacklustre.

            "content": "Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men, Fargo) have extended their filmmaking prowess into new territory by adapting Charles Portis' famous novel, True Grit, and their interpretation is a refreshing take on the western genre and compares favorably to the memorable John Wayne starring version of 1969. Purists who thought it would be sacrilege to remake a western classic have little to fear. Thanks to a smart script and strong acting, True Grit comes off as a very solid film with some similarities and noticeable differences from the original film.Told in flashback by a woman's voice, a 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wants to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (a grizzled Josh Brolin), and she arrives in a small town to hire Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an aged, hard drinking veteran lawman who has done his share of killing and more. Mattie is not one to be trifled with and as another pursuer, Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), realizes, not one to intimidate. Headstrong, she has grit herself. Together the trio search for Chaney and seek out a lead in another outlaw, Ned Pepper (an unrecognizable Barry Pepper). As friction mounts among the searchers, LeBoeuf strikes out on his own, and Cogburn and Mattie come upon a cabin. There, a couple of outlaws are smoked out, and this leads to Ned Pepper and his gang. Can Chaney be far behind? It all culminates in a final confrontation between Cogburn and Ned Pepper as Mattie comes face to face with her quarry and LeBoeuf reenters the scene with violent results.Bridges (Crazy Hearts) is utterly convincing in making this version of Rooster Cogburn his own persona. He portrays him as a proud, grumpy curmudgeon who just may be a crack shot and smarter than he lets on. This takes nothing away from the over the top performance of John Wayne who won an Oscar for his rendition. You could almost see Tommy Lee Jones in this role. We gets bits and pieces of Cogburn's past, and some of the tales make you wonder if they are utter fabrications or sheer exaggeration. Steinfeld is a marvel in her first movie role. She embodies Mattie as a take charge gal who will not be deterred and has enough smarts and spunk to strike a hard bargain with any man. Witness her amusing negotiations with a horse trader and wearing him down. Damon (Good Will Hunting) does well in a supporting role and adds more nuance than Glen Campbell's version of LaBoeuf did in the older version. Brolin and Pepper have what amount to small but memorable screen time as the bad guys.The dynamics of the trio are interestingly portrayed as LeBoeuf and Cogburn face off and trade barbs, while Mattie asserts herself every chance she gets. You even think there might be a hint of attraction between Mattie and LeBoeuf. The arc of LeBoeuf's character deviates from the 1969 film significantly especially at the climax. The only negative is that his fate is left open ended and unresolved.Much of the film is superior to the older version. There is really only one scene that would suffer in comparison to the original film, and that is the climactic charge by Cogburn against the bad guys. Bridges does well but he is not John Wayne. The scene lacks the heroic, mythic feel of Wayne. Also, when Bridges is shown in closeup carrying Mattie to safety, it seems a bit phony. But those are minor observations. A final sequence shows what happens many years afterward and serves as a melancholy postscript, and it has a final feel of a film like Unforgiven. The film could easily work without it though.Thanks to the Coens, the authentic sounding dialogue, which is laced with humorous moments including a shooting contest between Cogburn and LeBoeuf, is peppy and sharp, a marked improvement from standard western fare. There are times when Bridges' drawling and inflections are hard to understand but you get the gist anyway through context and body language. Technical crafts are standout especially a good musical score by Carter Burwell and beautiful cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins (A Beautiful Mind).The Coen brothers must have been drawn to the quirky characters and the language of the novel, and while this is certainly not their best film, it is a very entertaining western with some standout performances.",

            "content": "Had the original 1969 production of \"True Grit\" never been made, I would have said this new version is a pretty decent movie. HOWEVER, not only have I seen both movies, unlike most here, I ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK by Charles Portis. Matt Damon admittedly never saw the original film and the Coen brothers apparently say they only saw it as kids. Quite intriguing since they supposedly wrote the screenplay and manage to match much of the original film's dialogue word for word. Additionally, much of the acting here is nearly identical(Voice inflections and such. Hmmm).Right from the start, when Mattie Ross started saying she had hired Rooster Cogburn to assist her, I was eagerly anticipating the reincarnation of the Duke in some form from the great beyond. Seriously! What a disappointment! Jeff Bridges in an outhouse? Please!! While Jeff Bridges is a fine actor and his character here is quite interesting, he just does not replace or improve on the original in any way. Not even remotely! He mumbles incessantly through his dialogue and never creates the picture of a character of \"True Grit.\" Here he is much more akin to Otis on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" as the town drunk.As far as being true to the original novel(which has been stated frequently by the film's participants), that is accurate only in the ending. The 2010 production does in fact follow the novel to its conclusion many years later. In reality though, this adds little to the movie itself and in fact is a bit depressing. The book is not depressing. The original film ends on a cheerful note, whereas this one follows through to the inevitable end of every person that ever lives. They die! However, this has really nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie itself and adds nothing of worth.The original film is nearly word for word from the Portis' novel and has an absolutely outstanding conclusion. This new version is substantially less attached to Portis and ends poorly at best.The Coens change several scenes and even add new ones, that have nothing whatsoever to do with the original book. NOTHING AT ALL! This would be OK except for the fact, that they claim a close adaptation of the original novel. It is not, and it adds nothing to improve the overall value of the movie.As far as the acting goes, Hailee Steinfeld does a very commendable job of copying Kim Darby's nearly perfect performance. Unfortunately, she is NOT nearly as good or even remotely as entertaining as the original. Not a chance! The other 2010 version cast members are as equally NOT GOOD! Comparing Strother Martin as Colonel Stonehill in the original to the new guy is not an option. Dennis Hopper as Moon, Jeff Corey as Tom Chaney, James Westerfield as Judge Parker, and H.W. Gim as Chen Lee all added to the greatness of the original 1969 film. These were all great actors, that added their touch to an outstanding John Wayne film. To attempt to compare the new Ned Pepper to the original performance by Robert Duvall is absurd. Even Glen Campbell(who was reamed as the original La Boeuf) is FAR MORE INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING than Matt Damon's dull, dull, and flat disinterested performance.As intimidating an actor as was John Wayne, he ALWAYS allowed his supporting cast to let loose with their own unique talents, and it always was a great benefit to the final outcome. This is very much not in attendance in 2010. The supporting cast are in reality just reading old lines here, as they come across as completely boring and this movie is just HORRIBLY DULL in comparison to 1969! Even the scenic shots from 41 years ago are far superior. Hard to believe this reality in the new world of digital technology.I really hesitate to compare Jeff Bridges to a guy who was a top(if not always #1) box office draw for 5 straight decades(30's through 70's), because I nearly always enjoy watching Jeff Bridges. BUT, in this case he is way out of his league. PERIOD! As far as the Coen brothers go, for them to be able to come up with great films like \"Fargo\" and \"No Country For Old Men,\" should also give them enough intuitive foresight to realize, YOU DON'T MESS WITH CREATIVE PERFECTION! In regard to the executive producer(Someone who gets paid a substantial sum, but does little else)Steven Spielberg, needs to stick with \"Indiana Jones\" and \"ET.\" When it comes to great westerns, you are NOT at all with the program.The original 1969 production of \"True Grit\" was a fun and highly entertaining film, which is what movies are nearly always meant to be. ENTERTAINMENT! PERIOD! It is most worthy of historical significance in the archives of filmdom. To remake it with the intent of surpassing and basically spitting on the original production is the work of fools. Clearly the only object here is to make money. I'm sure they are very successful at that, but it is most assuredly at the expense of a real work of art from long ago. See the original and dare to compare.",

            "content": "In keeping in sync with the recent Coen sibling's filmic output, True Grit is an adaptation of a previously existing text. Away from nurturing original screenplays into engaging feature films (they've done around about two in ten years since The Man Who Wasn't There), the brothers have much more recently taken it upon themselves to bring to screen an array of previous pieces following their explosive start as a film-making duo whom started from scratch. These have ranged from incarnations of Homer's Odyssey to The Book of Job and have been varied in their success-rate. Pleasingly, their latest is a lot more along the lines of their adaptation of McCarthy's novel No Country for Old Men than it is their remake of The Ladykillers. The film, the second exemplar of a Charles Portis book after Henry Hathaway's stupendous initial 1969 adaptation of it, is a residing and fruitful western; a film enjoying the resurgence of such a genre which died off when mainstream audiences bayed more for hybridification and cut and thrust action which left oft-brooding-in-nature, late nineteenth century-based films set on sandy plains and in desolate towns somewhat struggling. The inability to conform to taste and hybridify the western with the likes of the fantasy; romance and horror (often of the \"body\" variety) genres, twinned with the fact characters were unable to envelope vast distances and shoot around all over the place al\u00e1 what they are capable of in science-fiction, saw the Western stumble and amble along for a great deal of time - rearing up only on occasion if it meant someone of Clint Eastwood's stature was starring in something like Pale Rider.Hailee Steinfeld plays that of Mattie Ross; a sure-of-herself young ranch girl barely in her teens whose father was mercilessly shot by a \"friend\" of family in the form of Josh Brolin's Tom Chaney, and of whom rode away clean. After travelling to the town by train within which the death happened, there is a poignant moment that sees her father's casket loaded onto a train and shipped out of there; she, without anywhere to stay just yet, spends the night in the undertaker's business quarters amidst the corpses and stench of death. It is a telling moment, that sense of her knowing that her father has departed her life, and that she is sticking around to do what she aims to do rather than going back with him, prominent; her loitering with the dead epitomising the nature of what it will entail, death being all around her in an alien place eventually coming to underpin the nature of her existence once out on the prairies and plains of a desolate Indian Territory.Her tool for justice, justice being a vulgar but morbidly pleasing item to Mattie when she observes three guilty men hang in the town's square, lies with Jeff Bridges' Rooster Cogburn. Looking out of sorts in a courtroom whilst giving a verbal account of a recent firefight, although highlighting his skills in this department during the reciting, Cogburn is a man fond of his drink and there are certain health issues dogging him enough to keep him in an outhouse for longer than is usually required. Also looking for Chaney is Matt Damon's LaBoeuf, pronounced in the English \"la Beef\" for the duration of the film; a Texan lawman on the hunt out of the fact Chaney killed a Texan politician once upon ago. I thought Damon, while delivering his lines with the desired 'punch' as he clashes with Cogburn over items such as the Civil War thus challenging masculinity as well as with Ross over her sheer presence thus questioning her ability as a female, was ultimately somewhat miscast; the man's reputation as someone all too often cast as a decent or upstanding individual (even when a heister in an \"Ocean's\" movie) clashed with the boisterous and often demeaning nature of LaBoeuf.Where the original was truly a success story lied in its on/off screen dynamic between heroine and hero. Kim Darby, the young and seemingly underexposed actress, went toe-to-toe with not only a cowboy of Rooster Cogburn's stature, but with an actor experienced enough within the field of Westerns in John Wayne so as to maintain a constant sense of this young woman challenging the patriarchy of the wilds as well as Wayne's own stranglehold as a legend of the genre. In casting Jeff Bridges, instead of someone such as, say, the aforementioned Clint Eastwood, this dynamic is lost; Chaney, on the other hand, and in spite of the claims the film treads closely to the book, is not in the film until the final act which I didn't feel worked as well as it did in Hathaway's. When he does show, he turns up resembling Pierce Brosnan, and sounds like him if her were to do an impersonation of Buffalo Bill.The film is an engaging series of episodes; encounters with Native Americans as well as dead men hanging from trees and one particularly memorable sequence seeing a doctor riding out through the snow in bear skin filling the time. In certain terms, the film did not grab me as much as Hathaway's nor the book itself; when, much later on, a character has had an argument with another once everything seems lost and goes off down past the brush to fetch water from a nearby river, they encounter something across the stretch of water which is both shocking and terrifying in its immediacy and nature. Such a moment jolted me upon seeing it for the first time in the '69 version; further-still, a later reading of Portis' novel saw the instance retain impact. For some, this will be their first exposure to such a text and the moment will no doubt strike them more than it did me in what is, overall, a solemn and bleakly toned movie hitting all the right chords and pushing all the right buttons.",

True Grit is a remake of the classic 1969 John Wayne film only this time its Jeff Bridges and he does an excellent take on the character, he doesn't copy John Wayne at all which I think is incredibly respectful. I thought the story was so intense and interesting at the same time, i had a feeling this was going to be good and I was right, how could a movie with Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon & Josh Brolin not be good? Its impossible as they are all amazing talented actors who I always feel entertained watching.Hailiee Seinfeld, the actress behind the chatacter of Mattie was so astonishing, I completely forgot she was a kid i was so engrossed in her scenes just as much as Damon and Bridges. She clearly knows how to make you feel what she's going through, such a splendid peformance which I would say goes beyond the bar of outstanding. I throughly enjoyed every aspect of this movie adaption of an incredible book doen to every little detail, i think everyone did a great job and I didnt find myself disliking anyone.Highly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, you won't regret it at all, such a phenomenal experience!",

            "content": "Film historians take note: True Grit was released in December 2010 in North America and was chosen to be remade by the Coen Brothers. In your study of Hollywood cinema in the uneventful year of 2010, you should not assume this film was produced following the typical trend of studios plagiarizing each other, sequels, and adaptations of popular literary works. No, the film discussed in this article is as unusual as you should anticipate. Do not forget this piece was published when True Grit was the most recently released Coen Brothers film. The subsequent discussion is written as a contemporary critique with the author's first-person preference applied.I recall asking myself many times what True Grit would have looked like had it been directed as a revisionist Western. John Wayne's presence as the bumbling, presumably incompetent-but-not-really sheriff and twenty-one year-old Kim Darby playing a fourteen year-old were two shallow criticisms I've always had of the picture. These two are followed by a paper-thin Texas Ranger who doesn't add anything to the story. Darby's Mattie Ross spews incomprehensible dialog less than 1% of people in her era would be capable of speaking. Her speech exacerbates the artificiality of the character, which is the same treatment given to Wayne's Rooster Cogburn and even the hapless Ranger. Now that I've seen another version of the story, by accomplished directors, I no longer wonder what True Grit would look like as a revisionist Western.This is a story that isn't capable of being presented as a revisionist Western or anything else. The (film) story is a piece of fanfiction, created by people with an interest in their preferred genre, with little desire to experiment with it. Nothing about either version suggests more than tangential interest in innovative filmmaking. Aside from a few plot points, all that differs in the new True Grit is the ending and omission of racist stereotypes. A colleague of mine read the source material, and insists that neither version is a worthwhile representation of the novel by Charles Portis. My suggestion is that there need be no third version of the story.Whole lines of dialog remain faithful to the first film. There a few new sequences involving an eccentric dentist and an absence of the La Boeuf character during the first part of the journey to find Tom Chaney. I also find it amusing how the first film's deus ex machina plot ending where the antagonist just appears out of convenience is kept. The new La Boeuf even says just before this happens that he is going to abandon the journey because no one has an idea of where Tom Chaney could be. After the indulgent confrontation, the new film takes an unexpected turn at attempting to bring serious closure to the story. Mattie loses her arm to the snakebite, and we see her at the end of Cogburn's life. Apparently none of the closing montage occurs in the novel, which at least corrects the fairytale ending of the first film. If only the new one didn't enthusiastically embrace its character archetypes, it would be worth its ending.It's odd to think of the first True Grit as being an exploitation picture. It was Wayne himself who was exploited. People enjoyed the opportunity to see an icon of masculinity be ordered around by a little girl. Maybe his Oscar was a form of cultural apology for our having so much fun at his expense. Jeff Bridges isn't iconic in the same way, so the movie lacks the non-thematic gravitas of its predecessor. I'll take the Duke over the Dude.2nd of 2011 Not Recommended.",

            "content": "**** out of (****)\"True Grit\", the latest Coen Bros. collaboration, is a remake of its iconic original. With that idea in mind, it doesn't sound like a very good one. Nevertheless, the outcome is marvelous. The film packs a strong punch and once it starts with a bang, it never lets up. \"True Grit\" is heart-warming, suspenseful, and quite thrilling. Sometimes even all at once. This isn't a film that you like, live, and forget. This is a movie that you love, live, and re-visit. This film is simply phenomenal and is definitely in my top 5 of 2010. True Grit is pure rawness.First off, the performances are ground-breaking. The 14-year-old, daughter victim, who serves as the main protagonist, is quite breath-taking. She is just so invested in her character, and she sells the role completely. It just goes to show that you should never underestimate child actors, unless they have the words \"Jaden\" and \"Smith\" in the same sentence. Furthermore, Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin are awe-inspiring. All bring something exciting and fresh to the table. To top it off, the script is very well-written, and has just the right amount of zippy one-liners and rich, layered lines. To put the cherry on top, the set designs are gorgeous. Not to mention, this film is very well paced. Scenes don't occur too fast or slow. Any problems? Nothing short of perfection. However, it's a little annoying to hear some of my friends say, \"oh, it's just another cowboy movie\". I find that's a very ignorant and ludicrous statement. Yes, one could say this is a cowboy movie, but it takes a typically generic plot, and turns it on its head, and makes good use for it. Not to mention the performances are what really make this film shine.All in all, I think while 2010 had its ups and downs, it wasn't so bad. I mean, we had \"True Grit\", \"Black Swan\", \"The Social Network\", \"Inception\", \"Toy Story 3\", and \"The Kids Are All Right\".\" Back on topic, \"True Grit\" is an incredible experience that should be lived. If a nearby theater is playing this movie, please try to catch a showing. It truly is worth your time and money.",

            "content": "[5 Stars] The Coens have many sides. Take the last four years to demonstrate this. They won a slew of Oscars for No Country for Old Men, a bleak, brilliant, brutal Neo-Western, with darkness in its soul. Then, they went utterly wacky with the bizarre, out-of-control hilarity of Burn After Reading. After that, they kept the absurdity and brought back some darkness, for the strange, existential, black comedy A Serious Man. There is no connecting line between these films, but now they appear to have gone around in a circle to the western with True Grit, though this time it is a very old-fashioned western.There has been some discussion about whether or not this is a remake of the 1969, John Wayne film, or a new adaptation of the original novel. I am fortunate, perhaps, in having neither seen the original adaptation or having read the book, so I came to this with fresh eyes. The result was to see the true side of the Coens, and the only side which matters: these two are utterly superlative storytellers.The film follows Mattie Ross, a fourteen-year old girl who is determined to see justice done on Tom Chaney, the man who shot her father. She is outwardly quite cold, cuttingly intelligent, moral and hard as nails. For the role, the Coen's found a very capable young actress in the form of Oscar-nominated Hailee Steinfeld. The nature of her character makes her performance somewhat restrained, but it is subtle and steely. She is utterly believable in every moment.Mattie forms an unlikely alliance with Rooster Cogburn, a drunk US Marshall with a personal history more colourful than Tony Curtis'. He, however, tries to have her taken home, whilst he goes in search of Chaney with a Texas Ranger on the outlaw's trail, LaBoeuf, but she chases them down and they go off on the hunt for their man. Cogburn and LeBeouf jostle with each other for Mattie's respect, both of them harsh and with their flaws. Cogburn is another triumph for Jeff Bridges (as if he needed one). Though it is very hard to understand all of what he is saying through his thick drawl, his face pierces through the darkness of the cinema and is enthralling. You can't help but be a little bit in awe of him.Matt Damon, meanwhile, appears to have been somewhat overlooked by the Oscars for what is another excellent performance. His LaBoeuf is the more human of the two in appearance, but is the lesser of the two parts. Cogburn gets more time, more depth and detail, whilst LaBoeuf's travails mean that Damon has not got so much to work with, but he is brilliant with what he has.The Coens let the film trickle along as they take their time, the stoicism of the central characters belying what is going on underneath. One gets the sense that every second has been meticulously constructed. It thrills when Mattie crosses a river, unnerves when a man in a bear-suit comes out of the snow, shocks when a knife is wielded without thought. Gun shots crack like thunder. Roger Deakins' cinematography takes the breath away. Carter Burwell's score complements every moment perfectly, All serves to keep the audience enthralled, but there seems to be an endless aimlessness about the film (which is kind of the point), but everyone should feel in safe hands. This is after all the Coens.Sure enough, the last twenty minutes are a brilliant climax, bristling with shocks and excitement, where its deeply moving emotional core develops. The climactic riding sequence is spine-tinglingly beautiful and tugs at the heartstrings with barely a word being said. It is brutal but wonderful.This may not be the masterpiece which No Country was, but it is a far subtler, more heartfelt piece. The effect on me has grown and grown since I left the cinema, its build-up leading to the most fantastic, if saddening, pay-off. It gave me tingles down my spine, beauty in my eyes, awe in my heart and a feeling of wonder in my seat. I urge you to go and see it.",

None of this is lost on the Coens, who always convey a deep understanding of American traditions. Yet, as always, in True Grit they view these traditions ironically and with a darker, more complex vision.Rooster Cogburn as played by Jeff Bridges is loud, smelly, crude, often offensive, and on occasion downright mean. Most of all, he has killed often and not necessarily well within the law as a marshall. Don't look here for a rascal with a heart of gold. Yet over and over he displays the \"true grit\" that is the hallmark of the western hero, and in the end he saves Mattie Ross for any number of plainly human reasons, all of them good ones.This is not a remake of the John Wayne movie but a direct adaptation of the Charles Portis novel. Portis's inimitable style, with its deadpan use of an overblown rhetoric and a fine sense of the ridiculous, is ready-made for the Coens' ironic approach to their material.All in all, True Grit is a western that looks, walks, and quacks like a western from days of old yet has a modern sensibility.

            "content": "I've heard it stated that the Coen Brothers remake of \"True Grit\" is truer to the Charles Portis novel than the Duke's original film back in 1969. I haven't read the book, but with some good luck and good timing, I saw both pictures only a couple of days apart. What struck me was how much the new version paralleled the earlier story, to the point where I was anticipating the dialog in my head before the characters delivered their lines. I guess you could say that this one was the 'grittier' version, and I would agree with that, in the same way that other recent flicks bring the Old West to life. I'm thinking of 2007's \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\", along with 2008's \"Appaloosa\". The Western is my favorite movie genre, and the Coen's do it justice here.Now if Jeff Bridges hadn't copped the Best Actor Award just last year for \"Crazy Heart\", I'd say he was a contender here with an even better performance. Now that I think about it, Bad Blake and Rooster Cogburn were very similar characters - big old fat men with a penchant for alcohol. A lot of alcohol. Wasn't Bridges great practically falling off his horse, barely hanging on with a reverse twist of his arm and body? I'd have to go back and check out John Wayne's marshal, but wasn't his eye patch on his left eye? Bridges wore his on the right.Then there's Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie. I was annoyed with Kim Darby's interpretation of Miss Ross, but that probably was because she did a pretty good job of being annoying. Steinfeld's Mattie had all the boldness, even arrogance that the character called for, but somehow she pulled it off without being unlikeable. Maybe it was the pigtails.With the 1969 film, I didn't quite get the casting of Glen Campbell as Ranger LaBoeuf. I might almost say the same of Matt Damon, but he acquitted himself well enough, and he wasn't expected to bring a hit theme song to the picture. Josh Brolin wore the powder burn well as Tom Chaney, something mentioned in the earlier picture, but never capitalized on in the makeup department. The other significant character comparison to be made would be Lucky Ned Pepper. Were the Coen's looking for someone with the real name of Pepper? Interesting. However I found myself thinking what a young Robert Duvall might have brought to the role, forty years after doing it for the first time.With all that, it's hard to come up with a favorite between the two pictures. Hard, but not impossible. I like John Wayne and have seen over fifty of his movies. His self deprecating turn as Rooster Cogburn was a bravura performance at that stage of his career, and one could argue either way about his Oscar win. But on the plain face of it, Jeff Bridges is the one old fat man who was made to portray Rooster Cogburn. He played it bad in the way the term is meant to imply good, and in the way his character was described in the film as a notorious thumper.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers latest outing comes in the form of True Grit. Based on the 1968 novel by Charles Portis and an update of the classic western staring John Wayne, True Grit is a hard hitting tale about loyalty and vengeance.True Grit follows 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) and her search for the Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) who killed her father. Mattie is seeking for someone to find Chaney and bring him in alive so he can be hanged for his crime. The man she hires comes in the form of Rooster Cogburn (The fantastic Jeff Bridges)to go and get Chaney. Another man interested in Chaney is LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) the Texas ranger who is pursuing Chaney for the killing of another ranger. The film follows these characters through their journey and asks the question, who really has true grit? The first thing to say about True Grit is that it is vintage Coen brothers. The script is full of their dark humour yet it never pushes aside the seriousness of the situations that the characters are in. It is a great story that is wonderfully written and directed with such skill and elegance. The cinematography is outstanding and is some shots moved my focus from the characters to the stunning scenery.The great thing about True Grit that makes the film stand out is the relationships between these characters as the film moves along. We never see Mattie with her family in the film, so it seems to the audience that her new father figure is the rough and tough Cogburn and her mother figure is the firm but fair LeBeouf. This dysfunctional family tale is very intriguing, but the Coens do a great job of not forgetting the story is at the heart of the film. The most interesting aspect of the film is the relationship between Mattie and Cogburn. He makes a big impression on her as her becomes her new father figure. She starts to wear similar clothes to him, she starts to pick up habits and traits from him and he even opens him self up to her as they search for Chainy. This is a strange but very interesting relationship to watch grow on the screen. At one point Mattie tells LeBeouf that she thinks she hired the wrong man. This is not because Cogburn is not capable of finding Chaney, but because Mattie has become so much like Cogburn that she is now wanting someone else to take charge of their mission and therefore turns to the mother figure Le Beouf.The film is more then just a great tale and a visual treat. It is a study of three very different characters and how they create an impact on each other. With impressive performances from all the cast and a real joy to watch, True Grit is proof that the Coens are masters of modern movie making who (in my mind) are two of the greatest writers and directors in modern Hollywood. Each actor shows their own bit of True Grit in this truly great film.",

Just sort of comes on the screen, meanders like a cowpoke for two hours, and heads off back to the barn.I won't involve the original (never saw it) or the Coen Brothers side of things (not a real fan). This'll be more stand alone than anything else. The umpteenth telling of an \"I'm lookin' for the guy who shot my Pa\" kinda deal, with a young girl the as the protagonist this time. She seeks out one-eyed, two-fist drinkin' Jeff Bridges to act as her trail boss on the road to her daddy's killer. Matt Damon intrudes as another interested party, and these three head out onto the frontier.The trio seek shelter, bicker, split up, save each other at the last second from the baddies (repeatedly). Ya know, your basic Western stuff. Fans keep pointing to that that was how this genre was normally constructed in the ol' days, but does that mean we're gonna go for it just one more go 'round? Much too tired a concept to really have any impact in these modern times.The cinematography is fair, the score is fair, performances as well. Bridges I got used to after about 45 minutes, though his put-on scratchy drawl was so forced, that I felt like I was watching Jeff Bridges, not a separate entity in Marshall Cogburn. Damon came off the most tolerable, not trying to do too much, which could've been his approach considering his limited role in this whole deal.But much has to be said about Hallie Steinfeld, who is receiving a great deal of break-out credit here. Yes, she's polished, yes, she's extremely skilled. But too much so. Her auto-pilot readings of massively complicated passages caused her to come off completely unrealistic as a 14-year-old girl (yes, I know she's really 14). And because of her lack of hesitation or a moment's thought to her words, she tended to slur a lot of her speech. Too mechanical.A supporting nod must go out to Barry Pepper as Ned Pepper (you're a Pepper, he's a Pepper...), totally unrecognizable but delightfully engaging as a late-arriving villain. I thought I was watching John Glover (a hundred points if you remember that name) the entire time. The thrashed face, narrow eyes, and Oscar worthy orthodontia.Josh Brolin? He pops in for a poorly telegraphed cameo as the dolt marauder in question. Some have argued that he's the typical depiction of an unrestrained, simpleton thug. But when you've built up this girl's dangerous quarry for nearly two hours, we want a real presence as the pay-off. Not what Brolin ends up being assigned as.By credits roll, a real sense of insignifigance swept over me. The film presents its dilemma, follows through on it, and fades away. Never was I bored (even with Coen's penchant for overwrought nonsense) or not intrigued by the next act, but it had no lasting effect when it was all over. Only in the last fifteen minutes did things get the least bit tense or exciting.No, I wasn't expecting more (again, Coens are not my thing) or less (it's another remake), just something with a bit more kick, substance. They approached it, but didn't quite cross that prairie into greatness.Ride with caution, buckaroos.",

            "content": "True Grit (2010)What a movie loaded with expectations! And the expectations tied it down, or tied it up, or just hung it from a tall tall tree. People I've talked to who never saw the original (with John Wayne) or who didn't know the Coen Brothers as movie makers (\"A Serious Man\" and \"Fargo,\" to name two) or who hadn't seen the Leone westerns of the 1960s, really loved \"True Grit.\" It is an archetypal story, with clean, broad horizons, tonally exquisite townscapes, beautiful (if restrained) photography, and excellent (if not amazing) performances.But westerns are nothing new, and the story, even if not literally a remake, was a familiar one, the small twist being the teenage girl driving the hunt for the killer across the landscape. This new \"True Grit\" just wasn't new in any way, and it wasn't even old in a new way, in some post-modern homage or deconstruction. So, to stand it up on its own, which may not be possible in this world, is to give it a fair shake, and it's a professionally made movie. No mistake there. Oh, sure, Matt Damon is terrifically different, and you sense he's having fun, but he makes a wimpy Texas Ranger. Jeff Bridges is his earthy best, pretty fun, though sometimes you feel like he's acting all the time. He is, I know, but we're not supposed to know that. And the leading girl, played by Hailee Steinfeld, is smart and stubborn and I know she's supposed to be extraordinary, but I found it a little short of terrific. I frankly just didn't believe her.The sets, the period believability, even the general scope of the story, are strong stuff. No mistake that this is a smart movie. But boy is it tidy.For a clue of what it could have been, there's a ten or fifteen minute segment right near the end where epic becomes truly epic, and magical, and really beautiful. This, this, is movie-making, and transforming. The whole rest of the movie is worth it for that. There is some animal suffering that is going to be difficult for some people (it's easier to see a man die than a horse, in a movie). But if only the whole movie had risen so high!Then, at last, there are the expectations. John Wayne had the advantage, the huge necessity for success, of being John Wayne. We felt not his performance, which was as you'd expect, but his history in the movie. With Bridges, it's just a good act. Then there is the history of the Coens themselves, who put together movies with much more humor and depth than here. And finally there are the other westerns, the Leone movies which really make the themes here pale, and even the New Hollywood versions (\"TheWild Bunch\" and \"Butch Cassidy\") where ideas are pulled open and taken apart, a little, and with elegance.No, this is weak, almost lazy competence. Not enough.",

They are than accompanied by Texas Ranger Le Boeuf who chases Chaney for another murder. Together they follow his past. Matie follows her revenge and is also going to learn that people have to pay for their actions.Acting: Bridges is very credible in his role as tough, permanently drunken marshal, he sometimes reminded me of Big Lebowski. Damon also plays his Texas Ranger smoothly and it suits him. Brolin is very good as Chaney, he seems to be so stupid he has trouble talking. Also Barry Pepper in the roles of smart and ruthless but fair desperado is good. But the stand out is Hailee Seinfeld as Matie, she is really great especially for fifteen years.Direction and camera: The film is beautifully shot in great locations. Direction is very smooth and film is holding a firm grip of the viewer. Also people who know work of Coen brothers will clearly see their \"signatures\" in the style of the film. It resembles number of them.Music: Music is quite subtle but very good and fits the film.Conclusion: Great western with great acting.

            "content": "True Grit is a very good western with a great story, great cast and two brothers who yet again churn out a film that is simply highly rated as so many of there other works are. The film is very good and can be thoroughly enjoyed from start finish with it's quirky humour and lovely chemistry between the main two characters what's not to love in this.We will start with the two I was talking about, the Coen Brothers, who's legendary status in film making is yet again pumped up in this film as well with some fantastic directing skill from the two and written well too. Based on the old film of the same name with John Wayne, the Coen Brothers possibly live up to the infamous Wayne version and the way they make the characters intertwine so well is fabulous.Jeff Bridges plays the infamous Rooster Cogburn with style and ease and know's exactly what kind of character he really is. Haille Steinfeld is the young Mattie Ross and her performance is well worth of her nominations for supporting actress and with Matt Damon bringing his A- game to the table too it make's for one finely acted film. I also enjoyed the thuggish like performance of Josh Brolin who portrays yet another fine character in a Coen Brothers film(he also appeared in No Country for Old Men),he does a great job albeit maybe not featured as much as he should have.The film isn't too long at all and any more possibly could have ruined it's integrity but I will say if any criticism come's it is in the way the film's action is left until the end and I felt a little more would have been brilliant to see but not too much or the Drama and dialogue would be ruined. Some I think will say the film is slow at the start and then get's into a little late, possibly true but the set up to the adventure the protagonists have is good all the same.I think people will enjoy this film and what Bridges and Seinfeld have is cinema gold and which modern westerns rarely have, an fun adventure that at the same time has dark people around who seem to stay out of the story until right the end. Recommended this to anyone who enjoys traditional Westerns too because it isn't too much different to maybe Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, but with just a little more drama than his, a fine film indeed and couldn't recommend it enough.So overall firmly a Very Good movie, I think some will even think it is Great and close to being pretty flawless but for me a firmly very good film, go watch it, sit back, and enjoy the old westerns we don't see so much of anymore, I think anyone can enjoy this film.",

            "content": "In this update of the original 1969 film, Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) hires US Marshal Rooset Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to kill Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father. They join up with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) to track Chaney, who was last seen in the Choctow territory. Mattie, despite both Cogburn's and LaBoeuf's objections, insists on tagging along to make sure that Chaney hangs for her father's murder.Despite her age and the prestige of her fellow cast members, Hailee Steinfeld absolutely steals the show. She gives an imposing performance as the unyielding Mattie Ross: at times the innocent child, at others the young lady full of sand. Steinfeld capably fielded both roles with expert precision, sometimes simultaneously (such as in the scene where she compares chasing Tom Chaney in the wild to a raccoon hunt she went on with her father).Jeff Bridges gave a stoically reserved performance reminiscent of the great Western stars of the past. His gruff personage naturally translates to the \"true grit\" of the man he portrays. Matt Damon gives a good, but ultimately forgettable, performance as a Texas Ranger. While it's nothing particularly notable, it does get the job done.The cinematography of the film is a perfect blending of the broadly defined openness of old Westerns and the intimate closeness of most contemporary film. It creates a landscape that, while perfectly alien to our more familiar urbanized world, seems comfortable and oddly familiar. It grants us a strong connection to the characters (rather than the land) while still keeping us aware of the world they inhabit. It masterfully satisfies genre expectations while not becoming a slave to them.Fans of westerns will find this remake to be a must-see addition to an already expansive collection of films, as will fans of historical dramas or revenge tales. This is a movie that deserves every bit of the critical praise it has received and there's hardly a cinephile who can turn down this film.",

            "content": "For once the Coen brothers played it according to all the rules of commercial cinema, and no wonder they did it as the producer of 'True Grit' is no other than Steven Spielberg. The film went out in time for the Christmas week (in the US) and for the Oscar season, and the result is 10 nominations including the one for the Best Movie, although I am not sure it will eventually get that many (it certainly deserves the one for the cinematography - the camera work is exquisite). It is also probably the most mainstream film the Coen brothers have ever made, so mainstream that I had all over the feeling that a twist in the action may happen, or a there are some hidden underground meanings that I am missing. Yet, the director brothers chose to do a very well made version of a novel adaptation already brought to screen in 1969 by Henry Hathaway with John Wayne in the main role, a classical Western with many moments of good cinema. Not little thing, just less surprising that I would have expected from them.Much of this story of pursuit and revenge in Texas and the Indian country relies on the actors. Jeff Bridges melts in the role of marshal Cogburn, a drunken but effective and heart-opened man of law. Hailee Steinfeld is the 14 years old girl searching for justice and her role has all the chances to launch a great career. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin act fine in the two supporting roles that fill in the human landscape of the film. They all do a fine job, and some beautifully written dialogs help in the way - watch the one of the bargaining of the young girl with the man that had a dept with her late father and remember it - or maybe you need not as film anthologies will help you do it in case you forget.As in many classical Westerns the landscape and the rendering of the atmosphere of the wild country in the second half of the 19th century America play a central role. As I already said the camera work is wonderful, and it creates the right setting for this very credible story of human solidarity. I do not like many of the post action epilogues in movies, especially when told with the off screen voice of the heroes quoting from the original book (so it seems) but here it fits movingly, but this is again the combination of the image and words that enhance the human feelings. Surprises may be missing but 'True Grit' is a piece of true (and good) cinema.",

Mattie Ross is the girl enlisting the help of Marshal Rooster Cogburn in her mission to find her father's killer. It gets going straight away and where similar films have had poor pacing aiming to utilise aspects like the soundtrack in trying to build an atmosphere. With True Grit however the atmosphere is already there and they didn't attempt to dump exposition in a seemingly non-stop fashion. It was also brisk without being short doing well to keep attention.There is a danger that they try too many 'landscape type' scenes trying to dump senses of symbolism in. We see even in a scene which has little to do with the overall plot the idea of our main protagonist's way of conducting herself and we know in spite of her youth she knows how to cut it general. That main protagonist Mattie Ross played by Hailee Steinfeld is excellent for someone her age and didn't fall into the trap of being irritating when her character easily could have done. Really stepped into the role well and we route from her from start to finish. Jeff Bridges was probably the highlight though, without meaning to use clich\u00e9s you really see Rooster rather than Jeff Bridges playing a character. Coming across as a fairly amusing but intimidating at times as well. Matt Damon does quite well in his role but out of those leads may be the least memorable. Supporting characters do well on top of these coming across as domineering when they want to be. The film also does well to have humour, I haven't read the novel so I don't know how much of it was inserted but there was enough so it didn't come across as too goofy meaning it could take dramatic turns when it needed to. Overall True Grit is an enjoyable film and while it is probably not the most memorable in terms of the genre I would recommend it as film by itself.",

Based on the novel by Charles Portis and on the John Wayne movie from 1969, True Grit defines the exception of a \"remake\" to be better than the original. It's a great achievement in filmmaking, especially in times when westerns are no longer what once used to be. Coens developed a great story and found the right ingredients to capture the public's attention. The story (for those who did not read the book nor watched the first movie) is about a young 14 years old girl named Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) which engages in a journey to catch her father's murderer. Being educated at that period of time, she found the necessary resources to approach the right men. In order to catch the criminal, she hires Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a tough U.S. marshal and LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) which was a texan ranger. Within this journey, the relationship between these characters, especially between Mattie and Rooster evolve. I found friendship and honesty to be very well portrayed in the movie. It was really well written from this point of view. While it is somehow dark, the funny parts were enough to make me smile and enjoy even more the film. Judging the emotional state of the movie it's emotional core it's not only a narrative under layer but it's more than that because it touches you without \"raping\" the tears out your eyes. I loved the approach and the execution of the movie. It was really a breath of fresh air.The acting was top notch. Jeff Bridges as the U.S. marshal did not only a great job but proved once again that he is a chameleon in terms of acting. This role was perfect for him, he managed to swing from kindness to badassness (if you allow me use this term). He balanced his performance and developed a great chemistry between him and the other leads. Should I mention his perfect accent?... No. I'll let you guys do that. Speaking of other characters, Hailee Steinfeld as the young Mattie does a terrific job. She has no fear on the camera, she delivers every emotional state of hers and each line with professionalism, probably the female breakthrough performance of the year. Let's not forget Matt Damon, one of the most underrated actors of his generation as LeBoeuf. He was mostly the fun part of the movie always delivering a good line when Cogburn seemed to be the rigid one. The only disappointing thing was Josh Brolin's character. He had only 3-4 minutes on the screen and I'm still looking forward to a great movie carried by Brolin's leading role. I feel that he could have been a more interesting character. It had no life and after the movie ends you kinda even forget you've seen him at all.True Grit is also greatly shot. The cinematography really impressed me. Those large gray and yellow tinted landscape shots and those upfront close-face shots made me forget that this movie was filmed in 2009-2010. The lenses used were perfect and the decors and locations were chosen wisely. The music was the only thing that could have been managed differently. It was good but it's usage was rarely which made the movie a little bit shallow and slow-paced at times. Though there was intensity, the lack of musical notes in the background may make some shots to not feel so important while in fact they are.Overall, True Grit is possibly the best movie this year. Possibly because with all it's beauty, it's engaging and intense characters, it's great acting and technical execution it kinda feels \"old\". Old because of the subject approached which might feel for some people to be boring or pointless. The movie however exceeds the expectations thanks to it's directing and Oscar-worthy performances. Remake or not, Coen's True Grit is one of the finest westerns of our generation but I'm waiting on that original Coen brothers movie that will send shivers through my body. I want to feel \"moved\" not only pleased or glad while walking out of the theater.",

Jeff Bridges as the seemingly-little-lazy-but-actually-not U.S marshal, Rooster Cogburn is brilliant. Matt Damon has, once again, delivered a consistent performance as the Texas Ranger(LaBoeuf),who is also in pursuit of the same man,Tom Chaney. He is certainly one of the most versatile actors amongst our times. Hailee Steinfield is wonderful as Mattie Ross, the revenge-seeking girl. The scene involving the bargaining of the ponies shows the excellence of her character and thus performance.

When I was a kid there were so few movies to choose from. Now they pop out like popcorn, so the ratio of good to bad has spread quite a bit. The good news is all this abundance. There may be a smaller % of good ones, but there are still so many Westerns, that there are more creative variations, too many to list.The West has just become a backdrop for a lot of great acting and creative ideas. From 73's Westworld to Cowboys and Aliens, Bone Tomahawk, The Quick and the Dead, The Unforgiven, The Long Riders, on and on, and here's another one.The Coen Brothers don't make boring movies. The Great use of sound bytes is signature for them, the attention to detail, and the quirky comedic\nsensibility that is always seeping in and out in their work is epitomized by Bridges, a kind of indifferently murderous comedian. He's not always deliberately funny, but he's so hard boiled that he doesn't need to try.Many memorable lines and moments. Mattie keeps her sass to the movie's very end, which ends on its only really touching note, which manages to be tough, tender, sad, defiant and profound at the same time. The best stuff (assuming you're an adult) always is loaded with layered impulse or \"meaning\", just like interesting people, and here we have, as in many pieces set over 100 years ago, external context changes too, and a final scene referencing (1903) the vast impending evolutionary social changes.Good stuff.",

            "content": "'TRUE GRIT': Five Stars (Out of Five) It's been a huge year and week for Jeff Bridges. He had two major releases within five days of each other ('TRON: LEGACY' and 'TRUE GRIT'). He also hosted 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' for the first time in 27 years on the Saturday in between. Both films are two of his all time best in my opinion. 'TRON: LEGACY' is a sequel / reboot to a cult classic sci-fi flick Bridges starred in 28 years ago and 'TRUE GRIT' is a remake of a John Wayne western form 41 years ago. Both 'TRUE GRIT' films are vastly different adaptations of the novel of the same name by Charles Portis. Wayne won the best actor Oscar that year for the film but it was widely thought of as an entire body of work acknowledgment rather than an award for that single performance (which was not the best of that year nor his best many thought). John Wayne was an immensely popular iconic movies star but by no means a great actor (much in the same style as Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood). Jeff Bridges is just the opposite, he's not one of Hollywood's biggest movie stars but he is one of it's most talented and greatest actors. His performance as Rooster Cogburn is one of his very best in my opinion and it could possibly lead to his second consecutive best actor Oscar (after 'CRAZY HEART'), although there's stiffer competition this year and back to back wins almost never happen so it's unlikely.Bridges performance is just one of the many improvements of this 2010 remake to the 1969 version. Joel and Ethan Coen write and direct this adaptation and they've said that they're big fans of the source material and wanted to make a more faithful adaptation to it (than the 69 version). The film has a completely different narrative and contains many scenes that were not in the earlier version although they are in the book. It's also a much darker, grittier and realistic film than the John Wayne vehicle, also staying truer to the book. Even so it's the closest thing to a family film the Coen brothers have ever done. It is graphically violent in places though and I'm actually pretty surprised it got away with a PG-13 rating despite the overall family friendly feel to it. The original film was a very light G rated western. This film has that classic western feel to it, more so than the original, and it truly is timeless (It looks like it could have been released almost any year of the last five decades). The Coens' writing is, like always, superb: every character is interesting and every line of dialog is entertaining. The directing is exceptional and the film has a truly striking visual appeal to it. Besides Bridges there's also great supporting turns from Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper and the young and very talented Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross (she should get an Oscar nomination as well in my opinion). The film is in all ways far superior to the original.The story revolves around 14 year old Mattie Ross and is narrated by her as an adult, like the book but unlike the first film. As the film opens her father has been killed by one of the men under his employment Tom Chaney (Brolin). Ross sets out to find her father's killer and bring him to justice. So she hires the toughest and nastiest U.S. marshal she can find (at the recommendation of the sheriff) Rooster Cogburn to hunt him down in the Indian Nations, where she's been told he fled to as well as joined up with another gang under crook Ned Pepper (Pepper). Against his wishes Ross insists on joining Cogburn in his journey. They're also joined by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Damon) who's been hunting Chaney for some time and wants to collect the bounty on him he's been working for. Cogburn's drunk more gritty ways clash with LaBoeuf's more traditional noble ones and complications arise.The film is about as good a western as I've ever seen, it's up there with the best of them like 'The Man With No Name' trilogy and 'UNFORGIVEN'. It's also one of the Coen Brothers' best films as well, arguably the very best (although I'm still partial to 'THE BIG LEBOWSKI' as well, also starring Bridges). The film has all the trademark elements that make the Coen brothers films so unique and memorable but it also has a truly great universal appeal that finally bridges the gap between the very select fan base the Coens are used to and a more widely assessable commercial audience. I myself have never been the biggest Coen brothers fan, I like their truly great work (like 'LEBOWSKI', 'FARGO', 'RAISING ARIZONA', 'O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?' and 'A SERIOUS MAN') but find too much of their work to be less than impressive (like 'THE LADYKILLERS', 'INTOLERABLE CRUELTY', 'THE HUDSUCKER PROXY', 'BURN AFTER READING', etc.). 'TRUE GRIT' is their greatest masterpiece, despite my personal fondness for 'LEBOWSKI', this is truly a great and classic film. It will be remembered and re-watched for many years to come by many, including myself, and will go down in history as one of the greatest remakes in cinematic history (far superior to the original).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PN3jnaP1Q",

            "content": "This movie has great potential for being judged, not based on its own merits, but on whether you are in the pro- or anti-Coen club, part of the John Wayne fan club, worshiper of the original movie etc.I have seen the \"original\" and thought it was a good movie but not a great one. John Wayne's acting never seemed more than adequate to me... He never expanded his repertoire beyond being himself so his Rooster Cogburn is just \"John Wayne\" as are Chisum, MacLintock, Brannigan, Cahill, McCandles and numerous other characters he played. Jeff Bridges is a far better actor with the ability to portray a wider spectrum of characters but he does not have the icon status and quasi-religious following that John Wayne has, and which invariably affects the opinion many will have of the movie.Thus I feel it best not to compare the two movie adaptations of the book to avoid the irrational emotions associated with what might appear to some as a blasphemous attack on the \"Holy Grail\" of John Wayne movies.The movie is a \"dark\" western, with excellent acting, very realistic settings, a depressing \"period\" look, brilliant dialogs, a slow pace and a compelling story. The Coen brothers have not put as much of their usual quirky twists in this movie as I expected. I see it more as their take on the Western genre just as Miller's crossing was their foray into the 1930s gangster movie genre, an exercise in style and movie making perfection without any other purpose than to see if they could make a great western... I think they did. I rank it with Unforgiven, McCabe & Mrs Miller and Once upon a time in the West as one of my favorite westerns of all times.",

            "content": "I watched the Original and the Remake back-to-back.The Original is better.I challenge all the other reviewers to do the same and argue differently.The Original Act I is vastly superior in establishing the characters and their motivations. We see Mattie bookkeeping, bossing her father around and sharing a tender moment with him. We see where she gets her values and her steely determination. We see her insisting on seeing the hangings. We see her experience heart-breaking grief at her loss.We see her negotiate for Cogburn's services at the unforgettable \"rat writ\" scene -- one of John Wayne's greatest. We see her dismissiveness at Le Boeuf's vanity.In the Original, the horse-trading scene is brilliant and fully executed. \"I will make money, my attorney will make money and you, Mr. Horse Trader, will pay...\" In contrast, Act I of the Remake is a muddled mess. Mattie comes off as oddly cold about her father's death. The horse-trading scene is truncated but Cogburn's court testimony goes on and on and on.In the Remake, the Girl Who Would Not be Pushed Around is literally pushed around by a snoring old lady. I ask you: would Kim Darby's Mattie give up the quilt? Of course not. She would have kicked Grandma out of bed before doing that.In the Remake, LeBoeuf sneaks into her room when she's asleep and confesses he wanted to kiss her while she's in bed. Talk about creepy! In the Remake, Mattie often looks terrified when she's on the trail.In the Remake, Cogburn gives up the fight. He emotionally surrenders. Where's the grit? In the Remake, we get that long scene of Cogburn and LeBouef shooting corn dodgers. How did that advance the story? In the Remake, we meet the Bear Man. How did that advance the story? What did the Remake do better? I can think of four things: Chaney is dispatched by the proper character.LeBouef's shooting of Lucky Ned is staged better.The scene down in the pit is handled better.The musical score is better.But so much was mishandled. In the Original, we hear that Lucky Ned only kills for a good reason. And so when Cogburn tells him to do with the girl what he thinks best, we understand why. When Cogburn tells him that in the Remake, it comes off as a lame joke.The same goes for when Mattie encounters Chaney. He calls her the little bookkeeper. But we never see her keeping books so it comes off as an idiotic insult.If I had never seen the Original, I would say this was a great movie.I will admit Bridges was better at playing the wastrel and scoundrel. But was he better at showing a man who could be moved by a young girl's determination and devotion? Was he better at illuminating the human condition? Judge for yourself.",

This movie by no means feels or flows like a Coen brothers' movie. The story and plot were lame and one could anticipate the next scene from miles away. From the start to the end, the movie couldn't captivate the attention of the audience the way \"No Country\" did in the first few minutes and several other of Coen brothers movies that normally do. Almost everyone over-acted, including the very talented Jeff Bridges. I am not as disappointed in the movie as I am embarrassed for the actors and the Coen brothers who picked out a bad script and ruined their track record on a remake. Matt Damon had little role to play and Josh Brolin, one of the most talented actors, had almost negligible part to play. Ironic that his screen name (Chaney) took more space than his actual appearance. The movie's anchor was this 14 year old girl played by Hailee Steinfeld and it seems the movie was financed by Steinfeld's dad or boyfriend to please her with the biggest part in the movie. This is a low grade production and too sad that Coen brothers will have to live with this low end, high budget failure for the rest of their Hollywood career.",

She is so annoying yet somehow the center of the whole flick.

Quite outlandish. Everything was downhill afterward (and it was not supposed to). You just watch and wonder why are they doing what they're doing? Matt Damon as a Texas Ranger was not the best choice. I just didn't believe him the whole time. I kept on remembering some of his stupid political remarks on the Internet and could not help but think: \"Why is Matt Damon wearing these clothes and tries to act like a cowboy? He is a liberal Hollywood dude; he looks funny on a horse with a gun.\" The truth is I nearly fell asleep on this movie, that's how dull it was to me.",

The film does not sin is more stupid, useless conversations. On the contrary despite what many dialogs and some of them quite long, they do not get bored and fly very fast. Also, from time to time there are very good jokes that cheer closing the viewer's eye. Throughout most of the film viewers have to listen to arguments characters in the movie. Even more say on this and keeps almost the entire first half of the film. Heroes, slowly but correctly go to the task. The plot, quietly begins to gain momentum, the characters start to meet on their way more and more obstacles and resistance. All this is pretty exciting and is just delighted.The actors would like to tell apart. The composition was chosen over stars: Oscar winner Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and fourteen Haley Staynfeld. Jeff Bridges received a year earlier for the film \"Crazy Heart\" Oscar playing country singer. He's one of those actors who is getting only better. In this film, he stood out the most. His hero has turned out to truly from the \"iron\" and the male character, the only thing to which he gave up the slack, it is to drink.Texas Rangers played another Oscar winner Matt Damon. Its hero time in a picture given to the lesser of the trio, but he appears in all the action-packed scenes of the movie. Adding this already pretty interesting stories the last and decisive chapter.Also, we have to watch the whole movie for fourteen young talent from California Haley Staynfeld. Do not know, as anyone, but I liked how she played. Behind the mask of a young child, she is hiding quite a stubborn and courageous character.\"True Grit\" yet another film genre worthiest western. I put it on one place with such box office hits as: \"Gold McKay,\" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, \"\" Unforgiven \"and\" Train to Hume. \" I hope this is not the last western, which falls in a row with these wonderful paintings.Western not dead!",

The Dude does an incredible job living up to The Duke's high standards and delivers a great performance that doesn't just try to impersonate John Wayne's previous portrayal. Matt Damon also delivers a great performance as LaBeouf. And as well, although the screen time was short, Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper did a fantastic job in their villainous roles.It also helps that the script was SO very good. The Coen's deliver the best script of the year, so far as I've seen. It felt very very authentic to the time period and still had that good Coen wit/humor that most people love. Obviously the cinematography was gorgeous. It had all the standard Western shots, of open ranges and towns of the west. I can't wait to watch it again to look out for more of the cool shots.Everything about this movie was spot-on. It left me feeling quite refreshed, a fulfilled feeling that you don't often get at the end of a great movie.

I think its a deliberately constructed film to appeal to a certain group as a throw back and homage to westerns of old, while being some what modern. Its made to be the \"ideal\" western in away.I like the film but at the same time I don't love it. Some of the Cohen traits of quirkiness (yes its there) kind of breaks the spell. Jeff Bridges is good as Cogburn but I kind of wish he didn't use a gruff voice, which to me is at least half his character (An aside Bridges has to stop with the voices because thats all he seems to do any more). Wayne was a physical presence and a force of nature, I'm not sure what Bridges is. Actually I kind of wish that several of the characters weren't odd voices and a collection of ticks. the only one who seems normal is our heroine- though she is clearly a wheeler dealer.The other thing that made me a bit nuts was the language. Yes its beautiful, but at the same time no one talks like that. There are passages in the film where the dialog sounds too much like a novel. Not surprisingly much of the dialog is supposedly lifted from the book, which is fine but NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. Actually it would be fine if the Cohens had everyone talk like that, but they don't they have these backward people who don't speak well babbling on and then you have these long languid passages and its like WTF.No its not fatal but at the same time I'm wondering why put on the affectations?

Their filmography's pretty amazing and their style full of wit, but a straight laced, good 'ol Western? And a remake at that which starred one of Western cinema's most iconic hero John Wayne? That's true grit, alright.But lo and behold, Ethan and Joel Coen did it again, with their sheer quality shining through the adaptation of Charles Portis novel without batting an eyelid, and never far away from the idiosyncrasies that make a film an identifiable Coen product. Granted I have a love-hate relationship with their films, but this film truly ranks amongst one of the greatest in its genre, with characters, cinematography, action, dialogue, heck the whole shebang that puts it right up there, with sheer entertainment balancing artistry.The crux of the story is that of revenge, where young 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) seeks out the renegade criminal Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) who had mercilessly killed her father, and fled to the Indian territories. She can't do it alone, and thus enlists the help of the one eyed US Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to assist her to bringing him to justice, if not for Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) to get in her way in their joint efforts to bring in the criminal. Expect powerful drama balanced with true blue Western shoot 'em up action, with excellent dialogue though a bit of a stretch since most of the macho cowboys mumble their way through.I am perplexed why Hailee Steinfeld only garnered a supporting actress nomination in the upcoming Oscars. From the onset her character carries the film from the beginning right through to the end, and I suppose if not for her rookie debut and her age, she'd rank up there and was quite the revelation in this film, carrying the film on her shoulders as the girl seeking out eye for an eye revenge. She portrays her character with plenty of heart, and showed how skilled a negotiator Mattie Ross can be, getting her way and not being pushed around town through her doggedness and cunningness, weaving her way around and literally having the two big burly men clearly wrapped around her finger. She's probably True Grit personified in all intents through the many scenes we see her in, even staring death squarely in the eye.Then of course there's Jeff Bridges, chewing up the role made famous by John Wayne, though with the eye patch strung across a different eye to probably make a statement that the Rooster Cogburn here is his own man. A man with questionable morals as seen in his opening scene in the courtrooms (well, that Coen touch of hearing him through the water closet doesn't really count!), he stands by the law as exacted by him, and forms a reluctant partnership with LaBoeuf, becoming a contrast of sorts. Cogburn becomes a mercenary as he plies his services under Mattie Ross's payroll, whereas LaBoeuf has been in pursuit of their mark for a long time under the auspices of the law. And of course Cogburn prefers the bottle for solace, while LaBoeuf through Damon's portrayal brings about a by the book persona. Their competitiveness and rivalry makes their road trip very much palatable, if you're already not enamored by the wonderful scenery and cinematography.The immense wit and comedy was also something not quite unexpected in a Coen film, but to see them fused so effortlessly in a Western without it becoming a parody or slapstick comedy, is what made this film stand out and shine. The cast get expanded to include Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper toward the last half hour when things get upped a notch when good guys meet the bad ones finally, but by then everything is just going uphill, and you'll be in for quite the ride. Don't let the thick accents prevent you from checking out what's probably one of the most straightforward, and accessible Coen Brothers film, and one of that the Western genre will be proud to include in its fold. Definitely highly recommended!",

Well, those Coen boys sure made a mighty fine movie and no mistake.The talent of Joel and Ethan Coen is legendary and their choice of subject eclectic. After the success of \"No Country For Old Men\", \"Burn After Reading\" and \"A Serious Man\", they have made their first western, although \"No Country ...\" could be seen as a kind of cowboy movie and, like that work, \"True Grit\" is based on a novel (in this case by Charles Portis). As with every Coen film, it looks wonderful and again the cinematography is by Roger Deakins who worked on that other beautifully-crafted western \"The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford\". The sound is brilliant too from the sharp lines of dialogue or the period music to the clinking of a man's spurs or the panting of an exhausted horse.The crowning achievement is the casting. Perhaps only The Dude - Jeff Bridges in a bravado performance - could outshine The Duke (John Wayne) in the central role as Rooster Cogburn. It was not so difficult to surpass Kim Darby's original portrayal of Mattie Ross, but Hailee Steinfeld - this time someone the same 14 years old as the novel's character - shows precocious talent. If Cogburn is the most hirsute of all the men in this movie, others are not far behind, notably Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Matt Damon in a refreshingly different performance from his Bourne-type roles) plus bad guys Tom Chaney (a convincing Josh Brolin) and Lucky Ned Pepper (a colourful Barry Pepper).In short, a rootin, tootin classic.",

It has great performances, very realistic and has great scenery. It's about a 14 year old girl(Hallie Stienfield) whose father is murdered by outlaw Tom Chaney( Josh Brolin). She hires U.S Marshall Rooster Cogburn(Jeff Bridges) and also has the help of Texas Ranger LaBouef(Matt Damon) to find Chaney. It's a simplistic plot but where the film really shines are the performances in this film particularly those of Jeff Bridges and Hallie Stienfield. Bridges is a bit like John Wayne in a sense but more unpredictable. He's great even though he does mumble his lines a bit. Stienfield plays her character very realistically and in fact does a better accent than some of her co stars. Matt Damon also does a good job and Josh Brolin is very good as well even though I wish he had more screen time. I like the ending as well but I won't spoil it for you. Let's just say it suits the tone of this film. Overall this film was probably the best film of 2010 and like the original film, is on it's way to being a classic",

            "content": "Let us already take for granted the following declarations from the Coen Brother's re imagining of the Charles Portis novel, TRUE GRIT: Jeff Bridges can pull off the Duke just as easily as rolling as the Dude; the Coen's steady camera work equally showcased both cast and scenery allowing both to become larger-than-life when so needed, Rooster's courtroom verbal brawl and the perfectly non-CG enhanced frontier town providing examples of both; and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld steals the show with her own grit.Moving forward, then, it is the themes of the film that perhaps become as intriguing as the story, straightforward as such films seeking justice, revenge or the thin line between both, are.The 2003 Costner-directed Western, OPEN RANGE, was a masculine film in every sense of the word. Two, rough-and-tumble, cowboy vets and best friends, played by Robert Duval and the aforementioned Kevin Costner, drive cattle, share a campfire and a lot of silence; silence and the open air that only a man can truly enjoy. When Annette Bening enters the story, her feminine presence intrudes, but not as a mere filly, but as an active participant in the on- going story. The result is a grand Western with slightly modernized ideals.Similar events transpire in TRUE GRIT. Although by no means friends, partners, and arguably even contemporaries, Bridges' Rooster Cogburn and Matt Damon's Texas Ranger LaBeouf are nearly cartoon caricatures representing mainstays of the Old West. Where Rooster is drunk, old, limps and relies on instinct and experience, LaBeouf hangs his hat on the respectability and tradition of the Texas Rangers, allowing that name to proceed his own, as well as his talent in most instances.The female that enters this twosome is 14-year-old Mattie Ross, who is keen on, and expecting, justice to be meted out for the wrongful death of her dear daddy. Instead of the clich\u00e9 teenage Disney-fied, or more recently Nickelodeon-ed, spunk, Steinfeld instead calls the bluff of her elders. She represents the new law of the time and offers reason. She seeks justice and is determined to uphold such, that is, until she meets the wanted man in question and finds a sizable rifle in the palms of her innocent hands.The end result, other than the simple answer to see if law and order triumphs over injustice, is determining who has true grit, this unshakable belief in your own infallibility. In the film, Mattie tells Rooster that he has true grit, perhaps from his legend alone. And it is the legend of this own story, the immortality of Rooster, LaBeouf and Mattie herself, that makes audiences introspect their own resolve.The Coens did not necessarily want a re-make, but perhaps a wake-up, or a remember when, or a challenge to find your own true grit.",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers show both class and grit in their new film, based on a novel by Charles Portis, which was turned into a film in 1969 starring John Wayne. True Grit is a great revival of a classic Western film by possibly the greatest team of brothers in film history.Mattie Ross (Hailie Steinfeld) is a thirteen year old girl who was raised in the eye-for-an-eye old west. After the death of her father she takes it upon herself to see to it that his murderer, Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin). In a small town in Arkansas Mattie hires herself a US Marshall, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). She follows him out across the river into Indian territory to hunt down Tom Cheney.Thrown into the mix is a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). LaBoeuf has been trailing Cheney for months and is less than enthused when an old man and a young girl begin in the search for Cheney. He wishes to bring Tom Cheney back to Texas to be punished for murder, while Mattie wants him to be punished back in her hometown, to properly avenge her father. LaBoeuf weaves in and out of the story until right when all hope is lost, Mattie finds Cheney getting water from a nearby river.For Hailie Steinfeld's first major film she is brilliant. Her performance is astounding for someone with hardly any experience, or actually for anyone with experience in acting. Mattie Ross shows true gumption, as well as intelligence in fields which most 14 year old have little knowledge in. Jeff Bridges is great, but he's sometimes a little hard to understand as he grunts Cogburn's lines. Matt Damon is also good in his role. Josh Brolin has a small role, but he's good too.The Coen Brothers have created another modern classic with True Grit, a modern version of the classic Western story. The script is written with skillful precision and some of the large camera shots of the Wild West are beautiful, making it seem less wild. However, True Grit does have it's share of violence, both in the modern sense and in the old western film sense. Overall, the Coen Brothers have created yet another great film, exploring a new genre with the craftsmanship of someone who has been making movies for years.",

            "review_title": "Remaking True Grit: The biggest mistake the Coen brothers ever made.",
            "content": "The 1969 True Grit ranks as one of the most iconic westerns in history. John Wayne's performance as Rooster Cogburn was both moving and memorable. The movie isn't exactly one of the greatest westerns of all time, the film had it's problems-Glen Campbell to name one-but it was John Wayne's legendary performance that made the film a classic. It seemed no one could even attempt to remake it-until the Coen Brothers stepped up to the challenge.It is of my opinion that remaking True Grit was a mistake. Many of John Wayne's other films could be remade, but not one as iconic as True Grit. Admittedly, I admire the Coen brothers' courage, and, looking at their careers, they seem to be directors more than able to take on the challenge. But let's look at the breakdown:Direction-The Direction for me was, surprisingly, disappointing. I heard the Coen Brothers were Oscar worthy directors, but I found the direction at times lazy. Scenes were narrated to save time, montages were put in when we should've seen live action, and worst of all was the editing. They cut far too much, the film easily could have been another half an hour longer. Scenes didn't flow together, we were simply thrown right into the middle of one scene and sent right into the middle of another. It was hard to become attached to the characters as character development was limited and simply relied on the ability of the actors. All in all, while the direction was fine at times, it was surprisingly bad for directors who've achieved critical acclaim.Jeff Bridges-Jeff Bridges had a tough job ahead of him. He had to play Rooster Cogburn, a one eyed fat man that the love of decency did not abide in. He had to play a character that already received an Oscar win when played by John Wayne. But I have to admit, Jeff Bridges did put a lot of effort into the role. Unfortunately, his best effort wasn;t enough. His accent was weak, obviously fake and put on. He simply mumbled and talked with a gruff voice. It wasn't altogether convincing. The character lacked the emotion that John Wayne's character had, additionally you didn't care for his character as much, though that might be due to the direction. Let's face it: Jeff Bridges isn't John Wayne. He's a very good actor, but not necessarily a western actor. John Wayne gave the impression that he was a cowboy, even though he wasn't. John Wayne looked more natural as a cowboy then as a 20th century actor. To be honest, when I heard that he was going to play Rooster Cogburn, I thought that was rather bold talk for an actor like Jeff Bridges. In the end, he wasn't quite John Wayne, he didn't really have True Grit. Hailee Steinfeld-Hailee Steinfeld played Mattie Ross, the girl who hires Rooster Cogburn to kill Tom Chaney. I'd say her performance was one of the parts of this film that was improved from the original. She gives an emotional portrayal in the film, and her acting is pretty good for a first film debut. Altogether she was one of the pleasant surprises of the film.Matt Damon-Matt Damon plays Texas Ranger La Boeuf. Damon's good in the film, but altogether he's underused. I never really attach to him in the film. It's sad to see an Oscar winning actor like Damon being wasted in a good role. Other Supporting cast members-The rest of the supporting cast was disappointing. It seemed that everyone was just trying to impersonate the actors of the first one in looks, accent and intonation. Josh Brolin seemed out of place as Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper was bland as Ned Pepper. It seemed he was simply impersonating Robert Duvall, who brilliantly portrayed Ned Pepper in one of his first films in the original True Grit. Screenplay-The screenplay was very good, keeping in line with the original film's script. It was in fact one of the better parts of the film.Story-I thought the story decreased in it's value with the remake. The changes they made caused it to be anti-climatic. You never felt like the characters were in danger. And additionally, the end completely fell flat. I was never really moved, touched or exhilarated in the entire film.Production-Costumes and sound effects were good, though not spectacular.Music-Bland and at times out of place.Final Breakdown- Direction-6 (out of 10) Lead Acting-6.5 (out of 10) Supporting cast-6 (Out of 10) Script-4 (Out of 5) Story-2.5 (Out of 5) Music-2 (Out of 5) Production-3 (Out of 5)Total score- 6.0 (Out of 10)Closing Remarks-In the end, I thought it was a mistake to remake True Grit. There will only be one John Wayne. The film had potential, but the potential was wasted due to directorial decisions. I don't exactly see what the critics are seeing when they rate this film so high. Personally I thought it was an average film that couldn't live up to it's predecessor. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this film, I'd recommend the original.So, come see the original True Grit sometime!",

            "review_title": "Grittier but less fun-loving version of the novel",
            "content": "The Coen Brothers' remake of \"True Grit\" is drier, darker and considerably less ebullient than the 1969 original that won John Wayne his Oscar. Well, it's definitely \"grittier.\"The Charles Portis novel on which both movies are based centers on Mattie Ross, a spunky, wise-beyond-her-years 14-year-old who hires the aging, drunken, one-eyed fat man, Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), to help her hunt down and capture the hired hand who murdered her father in cold blood. The two are joined in their endeavor by LaBoeuf, a Texas ranger (Matt Damon replacing Glen Campbell) who has reasons of his own for wanting to see Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) brought to justice.The real charm of \"True Grit\" has always lain in several unique elements: the incongruity between the idealistic, inexperienced and indefatigable Mattie and the cynical brutality of the Old West setting; the quaintly amusing way in which the characters speak without the use of contractions; and the larger-than-life figure of Cogburn himself. In their stab at the material, the Coen Brothers get most of those elements right, though the movie may be a bit more emotionally detached, dawdling and long-winded than it needs to be at times. And although Bridges brings a great deal of humor and bluff to his interpretation of Cogburn, in his single-minded attempt to avoid simply duplicating Wayne's signature performance, he seems to have come dangerously close to channeling Karl from \"Sling Blade\" instead. Moreover, since much of Bridges' dialogue comes out garbled, the viewer often finds himself at a loss as to what exactly the man is saying, which makes it rather hard to follow the plot at times. Damon, who's been given some fairly impressive jowls for the occasion, has some of the same problem, though certainly not to the extent Bridges does.The real acting triumph comes in the form of a then-thirteen-year-old bundle of energy named Hailee Stenfeld, who far surpasses what a likable, but far less talented Kim Darby was able to do with the role. It is Stenfeld, with her indomitable spirit and letter-perfect diction, who becomes the true heart and soul of the picture.As with \"No Country for Old Men,\" the Coens once again demonstrate their eye for detail and their mastery of long-shot composition, brought to vivid life by the crystalline cinematography of Roger Deakins. For \"True Grit\" is never anything less than gorgeous to look at.Perhaps it's pointless even to compare this version with the one from forty-plus years ago, since the Coen Brothers have gone out of their way to make it clear that they are not attempting a remake with their film. But one side-by-side scene analysis may be of some value here anyway. It is clearly the most familiar and fondly remembered moment from the earlier film, the one in which an aging, scowling, greatly outnumbered Wayne, all bulked-up and astride his horse, throws the reins into his mouth and, with a rifle discharging from each hand, rides straight towards the bad guys without a moment's hesitation. The reason it is such an iconic image is because it represents the visual culmination of Wayne's entire career as a movie cowboy hero. We laugh along at the audacious absurdity of the scene, yet can't help but be moved by its purity. Yet, when we see Bridges do the exact same thing, finely executed as the scene may be, it can't possibly have the same impact because we have no previous associations of Bridges to go along with it.Perhaps in keeping with the temper of the times, this \"True Grit\" is a more sober and serious (and faithful) adaptation of the Portis novel. It's just not as much fun.",

Never impressed me as an actor (although I do have his autograph which I obtained when I was young) nor did nor did I like his politics. Nevertheless, I found that he was perfect for the role of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit and played the role masterfully. That movie was extraordinarily entertaining as was the followup \"Rooster Cogburn.\" The entire cast of the original movie is far superior to that of its copycat. If you know Rooster Cogburn, you know that Jeff Bridges ain't no Rooster Cogburn. If you watched Kim Darby play \"Mattie Ross\" you know that Hailee Stein field ain't no Mattie.The original movie could be shown to children. I would not show the copycat to anyone under 17 years of age. Some feel the movie is a very authentic Western, however, I grew up in the old West and in those times you would not hear some of the language used in the copycat version. Also some of the scenes are unnecessarily gruesome despite their realism. The original version shows that a great Western movie can be made without overdoing the language and the gruesome scenes, which are added for shock value rather than to enhance the reality.The only reason that I can find for the copycat movie to get such rave reviews is that most screen critics hated John Wayne because of his right wing politics and they are pumping Bridges and the copycat movie in order to diminish John Wayne.",

Maybe they love the original and wanted their own spin on it, to play with it. Whatever the reason, they have come out with a mostly excellent film. The film is the Coens' most accessible and most simple film to date. That's not a bad thing, and it is actually a great thing when looking at it. They have played with film the way they want to, and its great to see them make a film that a lot of people will actually get to see. The screenplay is adapted by them and as usual, it is impressive. The film is less about what is going on and more about the dialogue, which is snappy and entertaining and at times funny. The film also has good performances from Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. However, the biggest and boldest is Hailee Steinfield. What I like about this performance is that it is honest, to the point. She is not baiting for awards but she is just doing what is best- creating a character. I am surprised that she has been deemed as Supporting, although I get why.

            "content": "I just want to know from all of you praise singers out there who keep on posting rave reviews for this wooden turkey, and then say \"Don't compare it to (the more accurate and much more watchable) 1969 movie\" made by John Wayne - how much did they pay you? I truly hope that all of you were paid by the Coen family, and maybe others in the Hollywood mafia to abuse this public information system as a scam to sell theater tickets. If so many of you really want to watch remakes which butcher the original story from great books, and much better movies which didn't hold back on real character development with the actors, dialog, scenes, and beautiful scenery which the hatchet-men Coens chopped up, then this bodes very poorly for the future of cinema, and humanity on this earth.That so many of you are fascinated by the most no-talent, wooden actors and actresses in the history of movie making is just depressing beyond words. Hailee Steinfeld, being just a child has my sympathy, and with decent influences she may become a fine actress. Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is just a dull stand-in for all the greater Hollywood tough guys (with real charisma) who have long retired). Is it the lack of talent in the business, or is it too much movie (and repetitive game-playing) violence which has so dulled the brains of your generation? How can you rave about \"beautiful outdoor footage\" which could just as easily be the trees separating an urban development in New York while snow is falling? This is why most of the scenes were made over in darkness, to hide this fact. Ditto with \"attention to detail\" on the set props. Whole scenes were completely flushed, beginning with the first scene which defined the life of Mattie Ross before she lost her father.The few added scenes were like a political ad campaign against alcohol, but you know that the Coens saved money on the extra actors.The re-tooling of the dialog was by far the worst crime of this remake, which made every character more wooden than Pinnochio.I've got news for all the brain-dead sycophants who rave about the accuracy of the realism in this horrible remake(which for good reason wasn't good enough for the book or the 1969 movie) - it's still just a movie, and there's really no point in making a movie more realistic than watchable. If you are going to continue promoting movies which are bleak, dull, and uninspiring, then you will do so without my movie-ticket cash. Anyway, if the reality of the old West was truly so depressing, and so ruled by incompetence as the Coens portray it to be, then none would have survived it.",

I have heard nothing but good things about this movie, but I am a huge John Wayne fan and did not think this should be re-done. I will admit that Jeff Bridges is a great pick to take over for The Duke. After watching this I noticed that it is nothing like the original at all (it has been a while since I have seen it though), so much so it's almost hard to compare the two. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie a lot more then I expected to. This is far and away the best western that has come out since \"Open Range\", and my favorite Coen Brothers movie since \"O Brother, Where Art Thou\". Bridges does a great job of making the part his own, and Hailee Steinfeld (in a break-out performance) does a fantastic job of holding her own against the heavyweights of the movie. If you go in looking for a re-make of the John Wayne version you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a different take on it then you will enjoy this one. Very, very good movie. Overall I would say that with all the hype behind this movie, it does a good job of living up to it. I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - I think I would, after watching the original again.*Also try - Goodnight For Justice & True Grit (The Original)",

I liked that Mattie Ross's role was somewhat played down in the beginning. And I thought Jeff Bridges was excellent. (I have heard that some think he is doing a John Wayne impression and I strongly disagree -- this was very much a Bridges version of Rooster Cogburn.) Mina Hochberg says this film is \"more commercial than many of their past projects\", and I agree. It has a polished, popular feel that I think made it less of a masterpiece. Frankly, I liked \"A Serious Man\" better. Hochberg ultimately says that the film \"is ultimately hobbled by an overall uneven quality that you acclimate to but never quite accept.\" That sums it up better than I ever could.I am not overly keen on the voiceovers, and I think the showdown was not as epic as it could have been. I think the original was funnier. And, having seen almost all of the Coen films, I believe this is not among their best work.

            "content": "As a standalone piece of film making it's very good but when compared to the rest of the Coens work it doesn't stand out as one of their best, which says something about just how amazing these guys are. Basically what we have here is an attempt, and a successful one, by the Coens at making a classic Western. I have to admit that I have never seen the original film nor read the book on which both are based. However one doesn't need to have done so to enjoy this film. The plot has us following extremely precocious and mature 14 year old Mattie Ross as she attempts to track down the man (Tom Chaney) who killed her father, who has fled into the wild west and has held up with a gang of outlaws. To track him down she has hired Sheriff Rooster Cogburn (well played by Jeff Bridges) a rough scraggly man, 1/2 alcoholic, 1/2 layabout, he would be a bum were it not for the fact that he genuinely does track down thieves and outlaws and clearly is an incredibly courageous man with a very good heart. Tagging along we have Texas Ranger La Boeuf (also very well played by Matt Damon) who has also been tracking Chaney. All of these characters are in classic western style larger than life, courageous beyond question, or equally heartless, tough as nails, bushmen par excellence, rough around the edges etc. etc. There probably isn't a famous western stereotype that isn't present here in some form or another. Mind you this isn't a bad thing as the Coens have obviously set out to make a Western with a capital W. And they have succeeded in this. Perhaps the unfortunate thing is that... well, they succeeded. We have many of the classic Coen Brothers touches here, black humour, excellently drawn characters, fantastic choreography, great music. But what IS missing that is so important to all of their best work is a sense of emotional investment. As good as the acting is, as good as the characters are, as good as the writing is, in the end it's not really about anything it's just a good story. Because of this there isn't that sense of emotional involvement that is so present in the best of their work. The sense of foreboding one gets from No Country, the emotional desolation found in Fargo. One could say that that just wasn't what they were out to make and I would agree but then one must raise the question of why they did make it. The Coens have shown that they can do fantastic comedy (see The Big Lebowsky) and of course fantastic Drama (see so much of their work) maybe this was their attempt at making fantastic but formulaic westerns?

There's absolutely no attempt to prettify anything\u2014even the landscape is dreary and ugly, a real departure for a Western. But, what really distinguishes the film is its attention to period detail. Those long black dresses look like a perpetual funeral and make me wonder how romance could ever get started. Actually, garments were uniformly black, as I understand, because the proper coloring process had yet to be invented. Also, scope out the array of beards and whiskers, in the courtroom scene. I expect that was because razors were hard to come by along with barbershops. Anyhow, it's a colorful array of shaggy styles and fashions.But what I appreciate most is what Hollywood always liked least\u2014bad teeth. That is, as you might expect, there wasn't much dental care on the prairie. For example, check out Lucky Ned's. I don't know why he's called \"Lucky\" because his yellowed teeth resemble a mob of corn kernels trying to exit his mouth\u2014a really good make-up job. Then too, from what I can make out, the one exception to all this is Mattie who unfortunately remains well-scrubbed and well-tailored throughout.A movie like this sort of takes the romance out of the Old West in a big way, whatever the story-line. In fact, I wonder how many frontier myths would have arisen had traditional Hollywood dared to show conditions the way this movie does. Kudos to the Coen Bros. for adding this important dimension to their re-make. And, after seeing this, I think I'll stick with the present century.",

            "review_title": "Another Fine Coen Brothers' Remake",
            "content": "Remaking a classic movie is often a risky proposition. More often than not, Hollywood filmmakers aim high but wind up shooting low. \"O, Brother Where Art Thou?\" co-writers and directors Ethan and Joel Coens' rehash of director Henry Hathaway's \"True Grit\" (1969) with John Wayne in his only Oscar winning performance qualifies as the exception to the rule. Not only do the Coens aim high, but they also hit the bull's-eye. They have done a splendid job with their first horse opera, and Jeff Bridges has filled some mighty big boots without stumbling. Strictly speaking, the Coens' \"True Grit\" isn't the first remake. Few remember director Richard T. Heffron's TV remake of \"True Grit\" with character actor Warren Oates donning the eye patch as Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Heffron's 1978 television pilot for a proposed TV series went belly up. Meanwhile, the salient differences between Hathaway's version and the Coens' remake boils down to the differences in the respective performances between Wayne and Bridges. Mind you, Bridges doesn't impersonate Wayne so much as deliver his own interpretation of the cantankerous protagonist from author Charles Portis' western bestseller. Indeed, Bridges sports his eye patch over his right eye rather than the left as Wayne did. The Coens have gone back to the Charles Portis novel and shifted the emphasis from the pugnacious Cogburn to plucky teenage heroine Mattie Ross.When family man Frank Ross is gunned down in cold blood in Fort Smith , Arkansas, his 14-year old daughter Mattie (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) leaves her ranch in Yell County near Dardanelle to avenge his death. Hired hand Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin of \"Jonah Hex\") murdered the Ross patriarch, robbed him, stole his horse and then disappeared into the Indian Territory. The Indian Territory here is what eventually became the state of Oklahoma . Mattie arrives in Fort Smith by train determined to bring her father's killer to justice. She learns that the Fort Smith authorities have issued a warrant on Chaney. Unfortunately, they can't arrest Chaney since the Indian nation lies beyond their jurisdiction. Eventually, Mattie finds the right man to help her. U.S. Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn, better known thereabouts as 'Rooster,' is described to her by the sheriff as \"a pitiless man, double-tough, and fear don't enter into his thinking.\" The sheriff adds that Rooster craves alcohol. Mattie manages to recruit Rooster (Jeff Bridges of \"The Big Lebowski\") with an offer to pay him $100. About that time an upstart, cocksure Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon of \"The Departed\"), shows up and derails Mattie's plans. LaBoeuf convinces Rooster to leave Mattie behind. Chaney, it seems, shot a Texas senator, and LaBeouf has been tracking him for the enormous reward that the family will pay. LaBoeuf promises to share the reward with Rooster.Tenacious little Mattie refuses to be left behind. She pursues Rooster and LaBoeuf, swims her horse across a treacherous river, and demands that the marshal return her money. She threatens to prosecute Rooster for betraying her, and LaBoeuf gives her a spanking to silence her. The sight of LaBoeuf whipping the poor teen changes Rooster's mind, and he allows Mattie to ride along with them. A disgusted LaBoeuf parts company with them. Later, Rooster and Mattie sneak up on two grubby gunmen inside a remote cabin. Rooster shoots one of them after the other kills his criminal cohort. The two outlaws fell out with each other after the younger one informed Rooster that they were holding fresh horses for notorious outlaw Lucky Ned Pepper. When Ned (Barry Pepper of \"Saving Private Ryan\") and his gang show up at the cabin, they run into LaBoeuf. LaBoeuf finds himself caught up in the cross-fire between Rooster and Ned. Accidentally, Rooster wounds LaBoeuf in the melee, and Ned escapes. This is the only scene that the Coens rewrote that Portis did not have in his novel.Mattie cannot believe they have lost their only lead to Tom Chaney. Earlier, the Fort Smith authorities said that Chaney had thrown in with Ned and helped rob a train. Everybody is set to ride their separate ways when Mattie stumbles onto Chaney. She has gone to the river to fetch water for Rooster when she encounters Chaney. Without a qualm, Mattie brandishes her father's black powder revolver and shoots Chaney. The villainous Chaney survives Mattie's shot and takes her prisoner. Ned rides up and warns Rooster that he will kill Mattie if Rooster doesn't ride off. Ned leaves Mattie with Chaney and warns the outlaw to refrain from harming her. Naturally, Chaney has other ideas.You'll have to look long and hard to complain about the differences between the Coens' \"True Grit\" and the Hathaway original. Sure, some differences are obvious. Ultimately, however, those differences don't amount to much. The opening and the ending scenes differ. Bridges doesn't leap a four-rail fence with his horse, and co-star Matt Damon fares better than country music crooner Glen Campbell did in the Wayne version. Josh Brolin is probably too luminous a star to be shoe-horned into his cameo as the villain that character actor Jeff Corey created. Barry Pepper has a difficult time banishing the memory of Robert Duvall who played the first Lucky Ned Pepper. As Mattie Ross, Hailee Steinfeld is closer in actual age to the heroine than 21-year old Kim Darby was in the first film. The audiences that may be most upset with the new \"True Grit\" will likely be those who have seen every Coen movie. \"True Grit\" doesn't bristle with their usual trademark helping of irony and eccentricity. Surprisingly, for a change, the Coens play things pretty much straight down the line. In other words, their remake of the Hathaway classic is reverential.",

I like over the top acting, but this was just too far. It was unnecessary, and his accent and voice were too hard to decipher. I also wasn't buying Damon's character, and his acting style didn't fit this movie, a western. But the film is also too slow and boring at many times. Just when I thought I was getting into it, another slow scene would pop up, and then another, and then another...I allow movies I'm not feeling much a few slow spots, but If there's too many of them, I just lose interest. The action doesn't really pick up until what feels like the end, and by then the slowness, boredom, and bad acting had already made me lose interest.The problem here is that the 1 hour, 50 minutes feels like 3 hours.

Jeff Bridges delivers a very poor effort. The strange voice he uses is very annoying. His acting could be best described as mugging. Matt Damon is likewise, very poor, his performance is almost invisible. The cinematography is very dull and lifeless. The script is what it is. Almost letter perfect,the same as the 1969 version. I haven't read the book. I'm assuming that they both follow the book quite closely. The Wayne/Campbell version whilst not the best western ever made, is at the very least a well made exciting movie. I know John Wayne is only playing John Wayne, however he does do it very well. The 1969 movie is also a very good looking movie. All things considered, the new movie is a very pale imitation.

Matt Damon's Ranger character is a bit flat and dull, but otherwise fine.That, however, sums up the good parts of the film.The rest, however, is just a pointless waste of time. It's the first movie, remade with different actors. The plot and scenes are virtually identical. The dialogue is similar, in some places word for word. There are also altogether too many needless shots of \"travelling\" that go on too long and certain dialogue instances that have no effect on the story but are drawn out for minutes more than they require.I think this is the first time I've watched a \"remake\" and really wished they had used more imagination and changed more things around.

Good cast aside, I can see no reason to recommend this version over the original.

The technology has moved on and there's a real chance of the remake outshining its predecessor. But to remake a western, or a contemporary film, where nothing changes but the actors......why?

            "content": "I've long been a huge John Wayne fan and hence I have seen the 1969 version of True Grit countless times over the years. So when I first heard they were planning on \"remaking\" it, I must confess, I was more than slightly leery. How can they remake a John Wayne movie? And who are they going to get to replace the Duke?. Then, several weeks (or possibly even months) later, I read that the Coen brothers were taking the film's helm. My confidence was massively boosted, as I have also long been a huge fan of \"the brothers\" (I heard Jeff Bridges refer to them this way, loved it and figured I'd adopt it). But, I still worried about that casting. John Wayne's boots are some big ones to fill. Who could they possibly get? The Dude of course! It's not an obvious choice, but the more I thought about it the more I realized how perfect it would be. After all of this, I awaited this film with much anticipation. I read all of the other casting news. I saw the first productions stills. All of this making me more and more excited. Then, a few months ago, I read the news I'd been waiting for: Teaser trailer for the Coen's True Grit released. And a few days later, they released the full length trailer. Needless to say, my expectations were quite high, to say the least. And boy, were they not let down. But, don't let me get ahead of myself. More on that in a minute.Before I continue, I want to clear up, what I consider to be, a huge misconception. True Grit is NOT a remake. It is another adaptation of a novel by Charles Portis. It took me a while to come to this too, and yes I realize it is a subtle difference, but it is an important one. Once remake thoughts have been exorcised from your mind, you realize that the casting of Rooster is not as big of a deal as it seems. Jeff Bridges was cast as Rooster Cogburn. He was not cast as John Wayne. I don't think they were ever trying to cast today's John Wayne (this would be impossible because I don't believe that person exists). Now that all of that is cleared up, let's continue.I don't want to oversell the thing and risk anyone being disappointed, but every aspect of the film was everything I had hoped for. The cast could not have been better. The cinematography, beautiful. The score, with the recurring musical rendition of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms, set the era and mood of the film perfectly. And, what I expected to be a familiar story, actually had quite a few surprises along the way (this version is supposed to slightly closer to the book than the John Wayne version).Jeff Bridges did not fill the Duke's boots. He went a step further and made the character of Rooster Cogburn his own. Bridges' Rooster is much more rough around the edges, much grittier if you will. And he takes a bit longer to grow on you. But this is how it should be, as it makes the character's transformation throughout the film all the more inspiring.The supporting cast all manage great performances as well. An aspect of Matt Damon's role as LaBoeuf the Texas Ranger (which I won't divulge here for the sake of spoilers) could have easily become ridiculous, but Damon played it with just enough subtlety to make it believable. Whether purposeful or not, as Lucky Ned Pepper, Barry Pepper (the fact that the actor and character have the same last name always amused me) does a spot on impersonation of Robert Duvall, who played Lucky Ned in the 1969 version. And finally, though a small role, Josh Brolin (the bother's No Country for Old Men star) makes Tom Chaney, the cowardly murderer, very easy to hate.But the actor that really shines, and almost steals the movie, is newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, the fourteen year old girl trying to catch her father's killer. Steinfeld was thirteen when the movie was shot and she is a revelation. She more than holds her own along side seasoned performers like Bridges and Damon. I noticed on my second viewing of the film, the way Mattie shows no grief over her father's death and instead just gets down to business, is admirable but somewhat disconcerting at the same time. But, as Roger Ebert said in his review she is \"the kind of person you'd want guarding your back.\"As usual, Roger Deakins, the brothers' regular director of photography, does an excellent job with the cinematography. There are numerous great shots throughout the film. And the sequence with Rooster carrying Mattie towards the end of the movie is stunningly beautiful (this scene nearly made my sister cry).From my familiarity with the John Wayne version, I was anticipating the \"fill your hands, you son of a bitch\" scene. When I saw it had arrived, through my excitement, I couldn't stop myself from quoting along with the movie. It's those type of moments that cinema is all about. After watching it with my dad this afternoon, I've now seen True Grit twice and yet, I still can't wait to see it again\u0085Check out my other reviews and whatnot at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",

            "content": "What would a normal 14 year old in the late 1800s do upon finding out her father was murdered by a scoundrel and a thief? Mattie Ross (played by Hailee Steinfeld) is no ordinary 14 year old. She takes the train into Fort Smith to deal with her father's body and stays back \u2013 determined to avenge his death. A poised and fearless young woman (having run out of money, she spends the night at the undertaker's with 4 dead bodies!) with rapier sharp wits, she manages to recoup some of the money owed her father. Mattie also finds out that US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) is her man for tracking the murderer Tom Cheney who has fled into the Indian Territory. One eyed, overweight, aging and permanently drunk and disheveled Cogburn is Mattie's choice, she tells him, because she has heard he has TRUE GRIT and never lets go of a fugitive. Rooster agrees to take on the mission for $100, and after trying to evade Mattie by sneaking out ahead of her, allows her to come along when she catches up with him. They are joined by Texas Ranger LeBoef (Matt Damon) who is also hunting Tom Cheney, for a senator's murder in Texas. The grit and patience of each of the three fellow travelers is severely tested along this journey into the wilderness and we see the men gaining a grudging respect for the young girl as she more than holds her own on the trail. The ending is more true to the book than it was in the 1969 version of the film. This Coen brothers' adaptation of the book by Charles Portis is a somber tale that lacks some of the humor and crackling interactions we saw between the leads in the 1969 film. But it also has much less of the coyness and sugar that came in ample measure in the older version. The role of Rooster Cogburn won John Wayne his only Oscar and a memorable role it was! In the 2010 adaptation Jeff Bridges is as good as he can get, which is pretty darn good, but somehow the telling falls just short of all time greatness.The show is stolen by Hailee Steinfeld \u2013 she has a poise and innocent charm coupled with a fierce determination, that makes her one of the more memorable characters in recent films. Matt Damn is more than adequate as a stiff necked Texas Ranger, who slowly goes from boorish to serious and dependable. Jeff Bridges is great as Rooster Cogburn, \"a one eyed fat drunk man who cannot shoot straight anymore\", because he does show true grit and more, a strong sense of justice and an innate nobleness. John Wayne's iconic persona was utilized fully in the 1969 film by Hathaway, and here the Coen brothers find a persona that matches the Duke's in stature. Bridges brings a loose limbed laziness to his Cogburn, and yet manages, even at his most whiskey soaked moments, to convey a sense of urgency and sharp wit that is required to make the character work.The film is wonderfully shot on location in Texas with sweeping vistas, bleak forests in fall and winter, and seemingly endless plains. The Coen Brothers go fully mainstream in this film, finally producing one that has the violence mostly reined in (well some guys do die and fingers are chopped off too), and none of the language or situations containing being anything less than family friendly. But what makes this a winner is the remarkable young woman on a quest to see a criminal brought to justice. No simpering miss, she stands tall among leading ladies, as a sharp witted and brave character, honorable and just with all the good qualities that we often find lacking in the world today.This one is a certified winner and not to be missed.",

Her speech and facial/mouth expressions were so contrived. I don't understand why anyone thinks she is a good actress, she did not make me like or empathize with her character at all. She alternately over/underacts her part, seemed cold and pretty much emotionless and was just plain annoying. The only time she showed any \"real\" emotion was over her horse. If it wasn't for the blood and gore, this movie reminded me of a kid's movie where there is an unrealistic kid heroine who is cocky and \"smarter\" than the adults. Matt Damon looked good and his acting was fine as always but his too-small part is not enough to save this movie. Unless you like being bored and annoyed to death by a 14 year old who acts 40, don't waste your time going to see this movie.",

It (1969 version) had an excellent story line, great music, great locations, great scenery, great acting and GREAT COLOR IMAGES, the characters had time to develop and the dialog was witty and entertaining.The 2010 version has a choppy story line, dull music, uninspiring locations, boring scenery and the dialog was disconnected, difficult, boring, and choppy,at best ! Kim Darby was super in her portrayal of the 1969 Mattie Ross.The 2010 Mattie Ross acted too much like a mature woman. The original movie had an upbeat ending. The 2010 version had a disturbing and definitely downbeat and sad ending. The 2010 version is also much shorter in running time. A lot of the background scenes from the 1969 version were not in the 2010 version. That hurt the film's continuity. I was just very, very disappointed after leaving the theater. What a hack job, sorry ,but it is the truth. Save your money and skip this movie.",

The cast just did not work well together and were simply reading their lines and had no feeling or expression in the presentation. The film went on and on and on and never did pick-up. Wow....I wish we could get back to the great westerns with awesome actors that can really give you a heart pounding performance and keep you entertained throughout the entire story. If you love a true western that really makes you believe & feel involved and interested in the story then I would highly suggest you skip this film, it is by far the worst western I and my husband have every seen!Our friends also saw this film and found it terrible!",

            "content": "By now, you've probably read of how the Coen Brothers' latest version of the Charles Portis novel, True Grit, greatly differentiates from the original version starring longtime cowboy, John Wayne. The Coens, again, as they had with Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, remain as faithful to the book as catholic sons to their mother. Not all, but most of the dialogue comes directly from Portis' pages. Some liberties are taken as far as the action, but the overall tone and story itself is fairly precise. In contrast to the technicolor version made by Hollywood director, Henry Hathaway, in 1969, the Coens bring darker colors to the story. This trip that 14-year old, Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), has chosen to embark on is no adventure. It is a manhunt in which men are slaughtered and life is a fragile, tradable thing. There is also humor in the film, however, as there is in the book. Mattie's highly developed vocabulary, as well as Rooster Cogburn's (Jeff Bridges) wickedly funny tongue, makes for amusing conversation amongst the main characters. Newcomer, Steinfeld, surprisingly holds her own in some of the funnier scenes with two of Hollywood's best: Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon.This film may not be a Coen Brothers original. And it may not be as dense as A Serious Man or Barton Fink, but it is still a finely crafted film of the highest caliber. After reading the novel several times, I could hardly imagine anyone else making this picture. It suits the Coens' sensibility to a tee. And although, in the end, John Wayne is still one of the greatest cowboys of all-time, Jeff Bridges' portrayal is much more multi-dimensional, bringing to light Cogburn's slovenly drinking habits, as well as many of his other imperfections.",

These modern writers can't see the forest for the trees.

            "content": "This 2010 remake of one of my favourite films ever was done with SO much respect for the original material, book and film. That the Coen brothers did this, was just beyond belief for me, they treated the material as Holy and they respected the story.Now I loved this Mattie Ross, Hailee Steinfeld nailed it on the head: And I'll even dare to say, I liked her in the part much more than the original, hair-cut-too-short-and-in-60's-fashion Kim Darby, who annoyed me. This new little girl Hailee, really WAS no bigger than a corn nubbin. Which makes the force of what she accomplishes in the film, much more believable as she is cowing much bigger and older businessmen and Texas Rangers and one Rooster Cogburn.Rooster Cogburn, in this film played by Jeff Bridges, is as much Rooster Cogburn as was John Wayne. Just as ornery and 3 times as stubborn, Bridges seems to have been born to play Cogburn just as much as The Duke, and as he did not copy Wayne's Cogburn, he made it his own, just makes the whole thing much more fresh.Now this version of the tale follows the Charles Portis novel much more closely than did the first filmed version, and I had heard that Author Portis wrote the book with Wayne in mind for Cogburn, but also Elvis in mind for LaBeauf, which The Colonel made not happen to all of our sorrows cos Glen Campbell never sold us his portrayal of a Texas Ranger... But in this treatment, Matt Damon does in fact pull it off, giving us authenticity in that part for the first time.Filmed in Texas, the locations look more like Arkansas than the Colorado location which was used originally. Even so, the look of each location very closely matches the locations from the original film.The journey taken to find Chaney is slightly different than the one John Wayne took... There are a few vignettes that are played out along the way, and it just adds a little bit more to what was there before.The entire scene where Cogburn confronts Lucky Ned while at the same time, Mattie is dealing with Tom Chaney is a perfect homage to the original film, and is great in itself - It is a very good climactic moment, filmed well and very strong- I was very happy with it.That this whole film plays out, while strains of the gospel hymn \"Leaning\" are playing, adds to the more spiritual aspect which was wholly removed from the 1969 version, and as I understand this was a big part of the book, it was good to see those spiritual aspects brought back in as they were a major part of the story of the book, taking those things out weakened the first film.So now, we have two trails to Tom Chaney's demise - One taken by John Wayne, Kim Darby and Glen Campbell, and this one taken by Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfield and Matt Damon. Both The Duke and Bridges show \"True Grit\" - I loved the first film, I love this one. I am SO not disappointed, I'm happy this homage was paid.",

Partially lensed in New Mexico and Texas. Continuity goof: When Maddie Ross shoots Tom Cheney the first time and she falls backwards into the water we can see her gun the entire time when she falls and then rights her self, she could not re-cock her gun without the camera seeing it, however when the camera cuts to her standing her gun is cocked and she then attempts to fire it. This is impossible due to the fact that her pistol is a Colt Model 1848 which is a single action pistol, meaning she would have to cock it after each shot.*Emotion- This film was quite enjoyably different than it's predecessor from 1969. It's an enjoyable film; if not for the extreme graphic violence scenes with hangings, trail accidents, crimes and many shootings. The fun dialog is of the historic period and the filming locations are epic. Many unusually shot scenes are memorable along with the beautiful locations. This film is supposedly closer to the book and takes the story far into the future ending in Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn's death and burial on her family cemetery.

In 2010, the more things change the more they stay the same as Jeff Bridges takes on the role of the drunkard U.S. marshal Rooster Cogburn as he tries to hunt a young girl's (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) father's killer (basically a cameo for Josh Brolin) with the help of often inept Texas Ranger Matt Damon. Also along for the ride is yet another villain in the form of Barry Pepper who serves as the production's ultimate antagonist (even though he is not seen or heard from until the film's latter stages). Henry Hathaway's original in 1969 was a pure Old West production which seemed more suited to 1939 than its release date. In the end, the original proved to be basically the end of the \"traditional\" western as film-makers like Sam Peckinpah and Clint Eastwood would take the genre to new, darker cinematic realms. The redux has an odd mix of Shakespearean-styled dialog, oddball situations galore (a man disguised as a bear riding a horse, need I say more), and oft-times head-scratching outcomes which seem like fireworks which fizzle rather than dazzle. With all this said, the Coens are still gifted filmmakers and Bridges is worth the price of admission on his own with his old character bumbling, stumbling, and somehow succeeding with good old common horse sense and a hard-nosed personality. Beautiful cinematography and the ability to capture mood and atmosphere are arguably the greatest assets and the final product's saving graces. 4 stars out of 5.",

It turns out to be a watchable enough movie, even if it lacks the heart and spirit that made other recent westerns (like APPALOOSA) so good. The dialogue zings along, the various scenes are well staged, the scenery is well shot and the characters are intriguing, but there's something missing at this film's heart. It's as if it wants to be as quirky as something like O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? but doesn't quite have the ambition to carry that quirkiness through.Hailee Steinfeld is the film's main strength, and works wonders as the young girl setting out to avenge her father's murder. Jeff Bridges should be barnstorming as the scene-stealing Rooster Cogburn, an irascible, one-eyed legend, but he never quite goes all the way and seems quite mundane in places. Similarly, Matt Damon's Texan ranger is added to the mix for some more comic relief, but he's never really all THAT funny.The action that transpires is greatly familiar from other westerns and the film as a whole lacks the distinctive mark that the Coen brothers typically add to their movies. Although I appreciated Mattie's quest for vengeance, I never felt that the other characters really did and the climax to that story, when it comes, is a letdown. Even the crucial elements of the western \u2013 namely horse chases, shoot-outs and showdowns \u2013 are never as exciting as they should be. That makes True Grit okay, but far from great.",

Whether you're a fan of some of their films is a matter of taste, it doesn't make the films any better than they really are, or more universally appealing. We get it: they love the wild wild west setting, the deep American south and its thick southern twang, and their element be this sort of directionless contemporary western spaghetti that prefers on-screen acting and cinematic aesthetics to any lesson of any depth or ultimate morality. 'True Grit', the next in line. A heavy focus on the acting: the young and VERY impressive 14yo female protagonist Steinfeld, the yet again anti-hero presence of a seasoned Jeff Bridges, and then the star power or impressionable grins of the Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and others... and you've got a cast that makes a movie by itself. And this is sort of what happens here. Story \"doen't\" matter, it'll have gun shots, a bit of blood and gore, it'll have horse riding, it'll have bits and pieces of simple intrigue and it'll be stuffed with the adequate tongue and dialog that certainly make up for about half the film's goal. Because, let's be honest, that's what's really important here, isn't it: reconstructing the old south's flavor, guns and villains, yeehaw. Doesn't matter how compelling the plot, story, concepts, how deep the dialog...it would always be more of the same - the same self-indulgent, ultra-specific, not universally appealing Coen produce. Is it boring ? Yeah, a little. Does it have action ? Well, yeah. Is it really good ? It would be so very complacent to answer 'yes' when it focuses on a few elements so hard, and leaves out all the rest (the more important 'rest', mind you).",

            "content": "I think no matter what, one is always going to compare this movie with the 1969 version. I love that version also, so i ant going to put one down in favour of the other, only to say that this retelling probably has been given the 21st century makeover, shedding itself of the sentimentality which was probably the original's only weakness (if it could be said the original had any!)The Coen brothers said they weren't remaking the John Wayne version, but rather going back to the source material of the original novel and this can certainly be felt in the use of language. The 1969 version toned down the grandiose language to allow the audience of the day to engage more accessibly with the characters, but the Coen Bros. celebrate the lavish quip lip of the original novel, in all its glory.The character of LaBoeuf played by Matt Damon, is also given a revitalising lift. In the 1969 version LaBoeuf really does come across as just a sideline character, but now Matt Damon gives LaBoeuf real personality and presence. His character maintains the same cock-headedness and massive ego, but Matt Damon injects a level of 'goofiness' that lends to a certain amount of vulnerability and third dimension to LaBoeuf's character. I got to say, Matt Damon has never been one of my favourite Hollywood actors, but if he continues to turn out performances like this, I may very well have to reevaluate my appreciation of him!No bad word can be said about the legendary Jeff Bridges and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. Bridges' really manages to encapsulate the grittiness of his character in a manner that seems both close and personal and Steinfeld is simply splendid as the young girl, Mattie Rose. I thought nothing could equal -if ever surpass- the scene in the 1969 version where Rose manages to barter with the trader over the selling of her mules, but seeing the exceptionally young Steinfeld keep a head of steel as she gets the trader in a tizzy, was simply mesmerising.The dynamic does change to some degree between the two main characters is this version as Rose is played by a much younger girl. In the original, the emphasis fell more squarely on a theme of polite society meeting rugged society; prudish Rose was capable of competing with the course Cogburn on a close to equal basis. In this version, though Rose still maintains a head of steel, her young age perhaps makes us perceive her with greater vulnerability and thus moves the relationship with Cogburn close to resembling a father/daughter one. I'm not sure which dynamic I preferred. They both have their strengths as a mode of expression to explore the overriding theme - I guess I'll put it down to the interpretations of the differing directors. The movie highlights the generational gap between Cougburn, who is like a dying generation of hard boiled cowboys and Rose, who is the embodiment of the new confident 'settled' generation. Somewhere, there is a space where both briefly meet...",

In almost every other respect, this is a movie that has been made thousands of times by good and bad directors with good, bad and occasionally wonderful casts.

            "content": "Our contemporary society, debased by greed and corruption, destruction and rape of the environment, and an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, longs for a reminder of the good old days in the West when men were men, ready at the drop of a hat to draw their guns and shoot each other in the middle of dusty streets. The only problem is that it wasn't true. According to writer Earl Hunsinger, \"The true story of the Old West is boring. Many western towns had strict gun ordinances, making it illegal to carry guns in town. People entering the town were required to surrender their firearms to the sheriff.\" Although there was some violence, it has been blown out of proportion and is much less than we see today. In the latest paean to the Old West mythology, The Coen Brothers have remade True Grit, the John Wayne vehicle from 1969 that earned him his only Oscar for Best Actor.Based on the novel by Charles Portis, True Grit is more even handed and adult than most Hollywood Westerns and there is not that much of a gap between the good guys and the bad, though apparently fourteen-year-old girls are larger than life. Narrated by the adult Mattie Ross who reflects on the time when she was fourteen, Mattie (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) is self-confident and mature beyond her years as she seeks revenge for the murder of her father at the hands of his employee Tom Chaney. Chaney has gone free to join a band of outlaws in Indian country and she intends to exact revenge. Mattie has come to the village to bury her father and to find a lawman to help her track down Chaney. She chooses the surly, drunken, one-eyed federal Marshall Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges.He is the one, with his past history of violence, that she thinks has \"true grit\" and pursues him until he agrees (for a price) to find and kill Chaney (Jeff Brolin) or capture him for a trial and public hanging. With God and Cogburn on her side (the song \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arm\" is played repeatedly during the film), Mattie is on a mission and will not stop until she can see Chaney brought to what passes for justice on the frontier. She must first prove how tough minded she is and does so in negotiation with a horse trader (Dakin Matthews). Of course, she comes out on top, managing to get what she wants after making a deal for her father's worthless ponies.Before she can convince Cogburn to take her job offer, however, she has to fend off a Texas Ranger named La Boeuf played by Matt Damon, who also wants a piece of Chaney's hide and has been tracking him to take him back to Texas where he is wanted for killing a State Senator. Though neither Rooster nor LaBoeuf want any interference with their pursuit, she follows them to Indian country, where there are no Indians to be seen since they most likely were run off their land by our God-given right to trample native populations (not discussed in the film). However, Cogburn and LaBoeuf stand amazed as she drives her horse across a river through sheer will power. The young girl soon gets an education that she doesn't want as they come across a dead man strung up on a tree and she witnesses Cogburn murder a man at close range after he chopped off a boy's fingers to prevent him from telling the marshal about Chaney's whereabouts.As the two zero in on the villain Chaney, they must confront Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and the struggle takes on an epic fight for survival. Though True Grit is filled with the usual violence (what would the story of the West be without it?), the relationship between Rooster and Mattie becomes one of tenderness and caring. Hailee Steinfeld, in her premier role, is simply wonderful as the steadfast, verbally acute teenager who knows how to stand up for herself in a world of men. Jeff Bridges also turns in a convincing performance, although we have to sacrifice understanding three quarters of what he has to say. Regardless of its auditory problems, True Grit is a strong and heartening film that is more straightforward and less quirky than most of the Coen Brothers' films, making us eagerly anticipate what they have up their sleeve next.",

This could truly be the reinvention of the western film genre.Mattie Ross is a 14 year old girl who is determined to seek revenge against Tom Chaney; the man who murdered her father. To capture the killer she hires the US Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who is best known for his drinking and reckless actions. After insisting that she travels with Cogburn to ensure her investment is undertaken correctly, she finds herself joining forces with the Texas Ranger Labeouf (Matt Damon) who has been hunting down Chaney for his own motives.Although this may appear to be the tale of a trio that together bring down a ruthless killer, it is nothing of the sort. The three struggle to work alongside each other and each one must figure out what their priorities in this journey are.The attention to detail in this film gives off a genuine western feel. Although the start of the film lacks action it captures the audience's attention with the wit and creativity of the script. The characters appear troubled and believable and are successfully introduced to combine their traits with there flaws. It must be acknowledged that the dialogue will put people off as at times it is difficult to follow what is being said but if anything this just adds to the western feel.Hailee Steinfeld who plays Mattie Ross gives off an incredible performance. This can be seen as her breakthrough movie that initiates her acting career. Her Co-worker Jeff Bridges also gives a convincing performance that brings justice to the real US marshals of the western times.It can be easily understood why true grit has got 10 nominations for Academy Awards including best picture and best performance by an actor in a leading role and supporting role.In many ways the Coen Brothers have made an even truer and realistic version of the original film and have brought justice to the tale.",

            "content": "Joel and Ethan Coen make a lavishly entertaining and endearing movie that not only glorifies the old westerns, but brings them to a new level of creativity. Based on the 1968 book by Charles Portis, this movie has the usual Coen Brothers quirkiness, but also possesses more warmth and heart than any of their other movies.Maddie Ross is a 14 year old girl who's father was recently murdered by a man named Cheney. While sorting out her father's estate, Maddie decides to hire US Marshal Reuben Cogburn\u2014a boozing, grizzled, disgusting old man\u2014to find Cheney and bring him to justice. Along with with a Texas Ranger who has forced himself into the group, Cogburn and the young Ms. Ross head into Indian territory to find the murderer.The book was made into a movie once before\u2014in 1969 with John Wayne starring as Cogburn. But this movie is more violent, more stylized, and digs much deeper into the souls of its characters, and into the time period as well. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal as the barely understandable Cogburn. The old man he portrays is all at once repulsive and impossible to hate, and Bridges commands the screen like few others can. There is never a moment in the film where you see an actor playing the US Marshall; Bridges simply is Cogburn. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin are both great, but it's Hailee Steinfeld as Maddie Ross who steals the show. Supplying the film with the touch of sentiment and story-book quality that makes it so good, Steinfeld is the centerpiece to this film.The Coen Brothers rarely ever disappoint, and this is one of their best films. Rather than making a gritty, depressing, hard boiled western, the directors have made a movie about love, friendship, and compassion. With beautifully stylized cinematography by Roger Deakins, the Coens immerse the audience in the old west. A world full of dust, grit, and danger, the late 1800's is a perfect setting for any Coen Brothers movie. With striking and surreal landscapes, this movie effortlessly captures the essence of the west.The Coen Brothers have succeeded in making one of the best westerns of all time. With superb acting and a wonderful score by Carter Burwell, this movie dives into a world that in itself seems like a ghost, long gone with the passing of time.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "They went and done it! Remade TRUE GRIT (1969). I can understand how John Wayne purists would blanch at any actor attempting his legendary dirt-talking', eye-patched, whiskey-guzzlin', six-shootin' role as Marshal Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. It's like remaking DIRTY HARRY without Clint Eastwood.But they went and done it anyways! And like one of those rare comets we feel privileged to witness as it blazes triumphantly across our skies, writers-directors The Coen Brothers have done the purists, the Duke, and the Western art form damn proud.Jeff Bridges is Rooster Cogburn. How dare The Dude - lovable though he is - try to pull off The Duke's iconic, Oscar-winning role? Well, this new TRUE GRIT, adhering more closely to the Charles Portis novel than the 1969 film, boasts every aspect better than the original! Them's fightin' words... Not taking anything away from the dambusting 1969 movie, the acting is better here, the production design oozes 1880's authenticity, the language feels Wild West weathered, the staging of every scene is more dramatic, the cinematography is eye-delight, the music (by Carter Burwell) evokes a Western pathos that Elmer Bernstein's faux-MAGNIFICENT SEVEN themes failed to evoke, and the hero scenes are amped up to meaty proportions.Jeff Bridges gargling car oil as Rooster was the final nail in the original's coffin. Disheveled, rambunctious, gruff and gritty, we can almost SMELL him in his grimy long johns when Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wakes him to set out on a manhunt for her father's murderer. At the perfect weathered age, fat but not gross, his eye-patch on the OTHER eye, constantly smoking, drinking and rambling, his violence sudden and decisive, Bridges makes the character his own, stepping \"vuhry\" lightly on Wayne's broad shoulders.Told through the eyes of educated, strong-willed, 14-year-old schoolgirl Mattie Ross, TRUE GRIT follows her and Rooster - the most ruthless marshal she could hire, a man with \"true grit\" - as they hunt down Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin in another of his small but effective roles).Matt Damon is the loquacious Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (pronounced \"La Beef\" for some esoteric comedic reason) who joins the hunt for Chaney, but for a much bigger Texas ransom. The constant squabbling between LaBeef and Rooster provides humor dredged from the most unlikely situations; at surprising moments, there is sudden levity, a lot of it to do with the delivery of the actors and the colorful (not expletive, but descriptive) language.Barry Pepper is almost unrecognizable as the sooty-faced Lucky Ned Pepper, his drooling mandibles twisted from a wound inflicted by Rooster years ago. Like all modern \"revisionist\" Westerns, Pepper is not intrinsically evil, and follows a code of conduct, even if that be merely honor among thieves; we feel these men were forced into their villainous roles by the vagaries of social disparity and politics.Even Rooster is no saint. Not only is he an incorrigible drunk, not only do stories circulate of his viciousness, we meet him on a court stand, testifying to a recent killing; he is painted almost as a sadist who uses unreasonable force on perps, with a history of supposedly impulsive shootings, ex-marriages, bank-robbing and riding with unsavory characters. He is one wrong kill away from being an outlaw himself.When Mattie first meets him, he tells her, \"Don't believe in fairy tales, sermons or stories about money.\" He's a cynic who just wants to collect the bounty on Chaney.He boasts to Mattie of a time he put his reins in his teeth on horseback and charged seven men with both guns blazing. It's much better foreshadowing than the original, so that when that rock god scene arrives, we feel that thrill up our leg like Chris Matthews on the night Obama got elected.When all the baddies have been smoked, there is an almost anti-climactic epilogue, when Mattie gets bitten by a snake and Rooster desperately rides with her to get to a doctor. Miles fly by. The horse dies. He shoots it unflinchingly against Mattie's weeping pleas, then carries Mattie, puffing and risking his own death to eventually come upon a cabin, where he stumbles to the ground, firing a single shot to alert the occupants within to come get them... And we wonder - what has TRUE GRIT got to do with this midnight ride across moonlit plains on a dying horse? And we realize: that is the true measure of this man's grit - not only can he gun down people brutally, he will ride down a horse and then enburden himself for the life of this little girl.As good as TRUE GRIT 2010 is, it lacks the sociological punch of the original, because in 2010 we are used to young women fending for themselves. And the bloodthirstiness of Mattie in single-mindedly wanting Tom Chaney dead at her hands is not as shocking as it was in 1969 when it wasn't \"proper\" for young women to behave that way.Not demeaning the Coens' efforts at all, but TRUE GRIT is a straightforward story about vigilante justice; what holds it back from being a \"great\" movie is that it lacks any kind of irony or self-reflection.Well, the only bit of irony I can find is that the word \"dude\" in the Old West meant a city slicker vacationing out west, a fake cowboy (hence the modern term \"dude ranch\" to denote a fancy-pants resort styled after a rugged Wild West homestead). So though Jeff Bridges somehow manages to mine nuances of that most beloved character of his and insert them seamlessly into his successive film roles (the drunkenness and scatterbrains go so well with Rooster), the fact he is so starkly authentic playing a rugged cowboy originally brought to life by THE American Cowboy means he is anything BUT - The Dude.",

            "content": "Mattie Ross, the main protagonist and driving force of the Coen Brothers latest release True Grit, is one of the more intriguing and noteworthy characters of cinema in recent years.I wouldn't call her precocious, as that suggests a certain youthful exuberance. She is well spoken, polite but extremely blunt and concise, where there is more than one option available Mattie selects the one most likely to get results, regardless of how extreme or difficult it might be \u2013 in negotiations this often involves suggesting that lawyers need to be contacted.Mattie is not exuberant and definitely doesn't rush to decisions. What she is though is headstrong and most definitely determined.We are not given any indication of \"this is just how Mattie is\" or if this determination and single mindedness is borne from necessity, but over the course of film once Mattie sets her mind to it she will do whatever it takes to get the job done.(But I don't get the impression that once a job is completed that she goes home to play with her dolls\u0085) When we first meet Mattie she is traveling to arrange for the transfer of her Father's corpse back home. Mattie knows exactly how, why and who was responsible for his untimely death, and cannot rationalise just why no action has been taken or indeed appears likely to be occur.Mattie hears from the horse's (Sheriff's) mouth that the law have no intention of pursuing Tom Chaney, the man responsible. So she swiftly makes a decision and sets to making it so.First Mattie performs some hard nosed negotiations with grown businessmen who quickly learn she is no dumb kid. The next step is to find a suitable man to hunt down Mr Chaney \u2013 who has fled to the badlands. In her research Mattie is told of three local bounty hunters who might take the job; the first is fair but not perhaps efficient, the second gets results but might not totally be the most ethical, and the third\u0085 I can't remember.Mattie opts for Box No. 2. Enter Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). Cogburn is in his 60s and is a straightshooting unsociable drunk known for shooting first and asking questions later. He too fails to take Mattie seriously and takes some convincing to even accept the job. Once he does though he is less than ecstatic that Mattie wants to ride along with him to \"protect her investment\", stating that his role is not to babysit a teenage girl whose only previous experience was camping trips with her late Father.However of course it was always destined that Mattie would accompany Rooster on his hunt. They are also joined by a younger man named Le Boeuf (pronounced Luh-Beef, perhaps to distance himself from one Shia?) a Texas Ranger who reminds both Mattie and Rooster of his credentials all too frequently, perhaps as a sign of insecurity and a need for acknowledgment.Along the arduous trek we are given indications that Mattie really is but a child \u2013 granted she is whip smart and mature beyond her years \u2013 but still a child when bullets fly or times get especially perilous.Rooster on the other hand has seen almost everything before. He knows there is no foolproof way of doing things and that even though Mattie has a plan that there is no guarantee that the chips will fall in their favour.In essence both Rooster and Mattie are extremely logical creatures, Mattie's logic is based upon facts and assumptions, while Rooster deals in more real world situations \u2013 where sometimes riding towards a group of armed men and acting like a lunatic is the best option.On the ride the three amigos bicker, argue and attempt to one up each other, Mattie wants it known that she is no different to the more experienced riders, and Le Boeuf and Rooster try to one up each other \u2013 leading to an amusing game of drunken skeet shooting with slices of thick bread.The film is quite straightforward, especially for a Coen Brothers creation, and as it is a western the intrepid hunters encounter various odd and/or nefarious characters along the way and eventually do come face to face with their prey\u0085 though the events and actions along the way don't really follow the old school bang-bang, clutch one's chest as you fall off the saloon balcony sort of thing.Jeff Bridges is gruff, ornery and mean as Rooster Cogburn, though at times he seems happy to have company and becomes chatty and even a little lighthearted, his blunt statements and frontier logic provide moments of unexpected levity. Le Boeuf is serious and well meaning, if perhaps a little unsure and insecure of his true capacity at times.But True Grit is Mattie Ross's story, she is steely eyed, eloquent and a force to be reckoned with. At a time when most Hollywood starlets in their early teens are working through their first stint in rehab or choosing what to wear to the Bieber concert Hailee Steinfeld is merely announcing herself Ellen Page-style as a future star, her performance as Mattie is poised and not distracting one bit, if anything she steals scenes from Matt Damon and plays a great straight foil to Bridges gruff drunken ramblings.Without Steinfeld this no doubt could have proved an equally efficient and entertaining movie, but having seen her performance it is hard to imaging anyone else in the role.Final Rating \u2013 8 / 10. Don't let the fact that it's a western prevent you from checking out True Grit.",

In the 1969 movie the story revolves around the Rooster Cogburn, in this movie the focus of the story is the 14 year old girl. In the 1969 movie Rooster Cognburn is a larger than life character; in this movie he is portrayed as having many flaws. In the 1969 movie much of the violence is played down, in this movie the violence is explicit. In the 1969 movie Mattie seems older than 14 years old, in this movie Mattie is barely an adolescent. The 1969 movie showcased John Wayne, this movie is more or less has an ensemble cast. The 1969 movie presents a straight forward plot, in this movie the story is more complex and reveals more about the culture in which the story is set. Instead of trying to recreate the John Wayne role, Jeff Bridges presents a different type of Rooster Cogburn. The Bridges' Cogburn is a broken down man, hardly an heroic type, yet still endearing. The character is drunk, violent, and a social outcast, yet still commands respect due to Bridges' skillful performance. A lesser actor would have made Rooster Cognurn seem a caricature or buffoon; under Mr. Bridges that pitfall is avoided. However, accolades are in order for Hailie Steinfeld who plays Mattie, the 14 year old girl. She succeeds in carrying this movie and is the star. Her performance is strong and appealing and provides an excellent role model for children. Although the movie includes a certain amount of graphic violence not suitable for young children, the movie sends a positive message to children regarding courage, virtue, responsibility and loyalty. The ending of the movie is especially effective. What a wonderful movie.",

            "content": "If you create a great remake of a great movie, but one that doesn't significantly differ from the original\u0085have you actually done anything at all? The Coen Brothers' version of True Grit is a wonderful film and probably one of their most conventionally entertaining productions. It just doesn't offer much of anything that would recommend it over the equally as wonderful original.Technically more a 2nd adaptation of the novel by Charles Porter than a remake of the 1969 classic, the only meaningful changes the Coen Brothers made to the story are to replace Glen Campbell with Matt Damon and to tack on an ending that may be truer to the book but I can't imagine too many folks would prefer it to the just and touching and less depressing finale of the first film. Otherwise, this True Grit reminds me of the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho. It may not be a shot-for-shot duplicate, but it hews so closely to the plot, characterizations and dialog from the first rendition that it's hard to think of any reason why this True Grit needed to be made. Yes, it has the Coen Brothers' unique sense of visual style and pacing. The first version, though, wasn't lacking at all in any areas of style or substance, so it's not as if it needed improvement. And the Coen Brothers stick very closely to the feel and language of the Old West setting of the story, perhaps more so than the original. The only compelling justification to remake a classic film is if the passage of time has left it feeling dated in some way, but I'm not sure that in 20 or 30 years the Coen Brothers' True Grit won't feel more dated than the first movie.The story of 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) seeking justice for the murder of her father by saddle tramp Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) remains largely unaltered. She hires the brutal and unkempt U.S. Marshal \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help her track Chaney down and they are joined by the preening Texas Ranger Leboeuf (Matt Damon), setting off into the Indian territories to find Chaney and the gang of Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) that he's fallen in with.The performances here are all marvelous but while more mannered, as you'd expect from a Coen Brothers' movie, I don't think they're any better or more relevant than the work of the 1969 cast. While funny and exciting, I don't think this True Grit is more exciting or funnier than the first adaptation. There are a few digressions where the Coen Brothers show off their own sense of style and humor but again, the original wasn't exactly lacking in either of those things.This is a very well made and quite entertaining film. However, aside for hardcore fans of the Coens, I can't think of any reason why anyone should watch or would prefer this True Grit to the first version. This is, by far, the best movie I've ever seen that I can't quite recommend. They are so much alike that the two adaptations of the story make one of them superfluous, and choosing between John Wayne and Jeff Bridges isn't a hard choice. Most people will quite enjoy watching this movie. Most of them would enjoy the original even more.",

            "content": "Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) is a 14-year-old girl whose father has been murdered. True Grit chronicles her search for the murderer as she is aided by a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) and a drunken bounty hunter (Jeff Bridges). There isn't much else to say really... that's not just the plot in a nutshell; that's the entire thing.To say that True Grit is simplistic is an understatement.It's been a while since I've seen a film with so much padding. For instance, Matt Damon's character leaves the party and rejoins it some three times. The first time it makes sense but after that it becomes simply repetitive. Characters and plot points also pop up for seemingly no reason (an encounter with a dead body and a medicine man which take up about 15 minutes or so together only give one useful piece of information that could have easily been delivered by some other means).The characters don't fair much better. I, for one, did not believe Mattie's character for one second. She's supposed to be 14 but she acts like she's 38. There is not a single child-like quality about her. More damning, however, is the sheer lack of emotion on the part of her actress; the only time she genuinely showed an emotion (beyond being annoyed, mind you) was when she witnessed the death of her horse (but she doesn't bat an eye when two people are killed in a brutal fashion just fifteen feet in front of her). Matt Damon's character is both devoid of memorable characteristics and completely useless until the last twenty minutes. Finally, while I understand that Jeff Bridges' character was a drunk, does that really mean that not a single line of dialog that he utters should be intelligible? The film is also confused as to what it's tone is supposed to have. This is a brutal movie with graphic murders and mature situations, but there is a constant stream of unfunny humor that is continually shoved on screen. The most glaring example of this comes near the end of the film where Mattie finds herself with the bandits who employ her father's murderer, and one of the outlaws is a short, fat man who only utters animal noises. I kid you not--the character does not speak one word, but instead bawks like a chicken and moos like a cow.All in all, True Grit is a very confused movie. It doesn't know what tone it is going for and it doesn't know how to tell it's simple story. The characters are a chore to watch, and I just didn't care whether or not they achieved their respective goals. I have not seen the original movie, nor have I read the book on which the films are based so I cannot say which version of this story is the best, but if this movie is any indication, I won't be watching/reading either or those other versions any time soon.EDIT: I have since seen the original film. The two films share similar problems, but the original is marginally better because Mattie doesn't seem to be a Terminator doing it's best Peggy Hill impression.",

It's nearer to the book itself, darker and possibly a better movie, but has the problem that everyone speaks out the sides of their mouth, which makes the dialogue difficult to follow at times. Marty played by Hailey Steilfield is as engaging and annoying by turns and no surprise when La Beauf (well played by Damon) spanks her. She is rescued by Rooster Cogburn, the part well taken by Jeff Bridges. The one thing he doesn't have is the sheer stature of John Wayne. But this is a pretty good effort. The baddies with Joss Breslin are all well up to character and the movie ends as the book does - unlike the Wayne film. Result? An honourable draw between the two versions.",

Although it's hard to beat John Wayne and the charm of the '69 version, I might like this rendition a little better, mainly because it's more gritty realistic. I suppose you could say it has more, well, grit. But they're both great or near-great films. Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as the educated and headstrong 14 year-old Mattie Ross. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Rooster Cogburn, the one-eyed, overweight, hard-drinkin' Marshal with true grit. The former hires the latter to apprehend the scumbag (Josh Brolin) who murdered her father. Teaming up with a young Texas ranger (Matt Damon) who's also tracking down the owlhoot, the three go into the wilderness of the Choctaw Nation of Eastern Oklahoma to apprehend him, where they're also forced to contend with the outlaws with whom he's riding. Barry Pepper plays the leader.It's interesting -- but fitting -- how Mattie's disposition remains intact as she grows older. You could say she's unlikable but Cogburn won her respect and you have to admire her life-long loyalty, especially since he's not the most savory individual.The locations are less spectacular than Wayne's version (which was shot in Colorado and California) but they're closer to the actual locations of the book and therefore more realistic. Besides, they're awesome in their own mundane way. The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in East-Central Texas (Granger & Blanco) and Buena Vista Ranch, New Mexico.GRADE: B+ or A-",

            "content": "I love the Coen brothers. There's no one like them in Hollywood. Maybe it's because they're so anti-Hollywood. And when they're on their A-game, there are few modern filmmakers that can compete with them.Thankfully, the Coens seem to have kicked back into the form of the late 90's. What I mean by that is they aren't putting out mediocre movies of the early 21st. The Coens came back in a big way in 2007 with No Country For Old Men, a modern classic that rightfully put many Oscar statues in the brothers' hands. Ever since, the Coen brothers have been back on track, coming out with a movie each of the last three years that have been critical successes.The last being 'True Grit.' Originally a novel by Charles Porter Jr., later a 1969 movie that won John Wayne his sole Oscar. The Coens have stated they have not seen the 1969 film version, and are adapting the movie faithful to the novel. It's hard to tell what the Coen brothers say is true or not, for they have been notoriously in recent cinema for stretching the truth. I have yet to see the original movie or read the novel, so how close this new film adaption is to the book and the resemblances and differences it has to the 1969 version, I couldn't answer.What I can tell you about this film is that it certainly brings out the nostalgia factor in me. The Western is a dying genre, as science fiction and visual effects have served as a replacement. It's a real shame, seeing as some of cinema's greatest moments have spurred from Westerns, such as Shane; The Searchers; High Noon; The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; and Unforgiven, to name a few.Now, finally, the film itself. Maddie Ross (well played by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) has just lost her father to the hands of Tom Chaney ( unrecognizable Josh Brolin.) She hires a mean-as-hell bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges, in one of his best roles.) Cogburn is played off as an aging drunk, a man who's wife has left him and seems to get no enjoyment out of life than that of the bottle. Cogburn and Ross ride out to track down Chaney (though Cogburn is heavily opposed to Ross traveling with.) On their travels, they encounter a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) hunting down Chaney for a different set of crimes. In order to achieve their goal, the characters must collaborate together (The Ranger knows Chaney's ways and Cogburn is familiar with the territory.) This is plays out in a nice dark humor twist as the three characters cannot stand each other.Steinfeld received one of the ten Oscar nominations for her role as Maddie Ross. What's ironic about her nomination is that she appears in nearly every scene, yet she is nominated in the supporting actress category (Much like how Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People was.) Not often in Westerns (I can't actually recall another circumstance actually) is the movie carried by a female catalyst. She's not played as a sex symbol or easily damaged. She comes across as pertaining just enough stubbornness and willpower to see her way through.Jeff Bridges pick up his second Best Actor nomination for his role (he won the prior year for Crazy Heart.) His dialect his mangled and incoherent to the point where he has a monologue in court I could barely decipher. I would of loved to know, or see, more into his back story, seeing as the film could of gone on a few minutes longer.Which brings me to my criticisms, which are very few and minor. First, and more glaring, is the ending. When I say end I don't mean climax, I mean the END, after the climax. It dragged on for too long and didn't seem needed. Maybe that's how the novel ended, in fact, I'm pretty sure of it. The other criticism is the lack of Barry Pepper's and Josh Brolin's character. You have nearly A-list actors, why not use them to their fullest potential? Overall, this film is very well made, will bring you back to the old days of Hollywood Westerns, and makes you care for the three main characters by the end. Check this out if you haven't.",

He is a drunkard, and not a very lovable drunkard. But he has what Mattie Ross wants, namely, true grit.Mattie knows what she wants and how to get it. She has a sharp tongue and insists on having her own way at all times. Not surprisingly, she ends up as an old maid. Men may admire her but romance is not in her future. LaBouef is a self-important Texas Ranger that Mattie verbally cuts to pieces at their first meeting. He squabbles in a childish manner with Mattie and Cogburn but redeems himself by saving both of them at the end of the movie.The theme of this film is not just retribution, it is redemption. Cogburn redeems himself through his courage and his loyalty to Mattie. Mattie's stubborn determination and bravery redeems her. Considering how pompous, silly, sodden, and stubborn the characters' behaviors are, this film is emotionally uplifting due to courage that the characters show in the end.The cinematography is beautiful. It is stark and cold as befits a story about revenge. The acting is solid all around with Mattie at the center of the action. I don't see how she can be considered a supporting actress by the Academy Awards. She is obviously playing the lead role.Although most liked this movie, some people were very disappointed. Many said it was boring or they didn't like the characters. Some went to the movie thinking there would be a lot more action. I thought the action scenes were great. Some even tried to make political criticisms which I find extremely inappropriate. Some criticisms were based on the preference for the original True Grit. I, recently saw the original. Although I liked it I think the new one has better acting and direction. The original is weak in cinematography and in the musical score.

TRUE GRIIT is a strong example of this. Despite reading the book and seeing the original film version the viewer will likely not be prepared for this version of the Charles Portis novel. Much of that is in the screenplay as written by Joel and Ethan Coen; the dialogue is definitely not contemporary but is as things might have been uttered during the timeframe of the piece. This adds considerable authenticity and rawness, AND humor to the story. Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld - the weak point in casting) is compelled to bring her father's murderer Tom Clancy (Josh Brolin) to justice. A girl of fixed purpose (and strange knowledge of Latin and law....) she hires US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an alcoholic reprobate of a old cuss who has the one attribute Mattie needs - true grit. The two set out on Clancy's trail, at times assisted by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon, who shines here), chasing Clancy and the gang led by Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, hardly recognizable), and after much killing and mangy incidents justice of sorts is served. The ending of the film gets a bit sappy but leaves the audience a chance to clear heads before the film credits begin. Aside from the terrific dialogue, other attributes of this version of the story include first class acting by all concerned including some exceptional cameos by Ed Corbin as the Bear Man, Domhnall Gleeson as the kid Moon, Jarlath Conroy as the Undertaker and Paul Rae as Emmett Quincy, extraordinary cinematography by Roger Deakins who manages to give the Coen Brothers some spectacular scenery and atmosphere - the Old West the way we've seldom seen it, and a musical score that relies heavily on old Baptist church songs. It works. If we only knew how these folk knew Latin and the intricacies of the law....Grady Harp",

'Fargo' was an astonishing piece of cinema that haunts me till today , while 'No Country Old Men' remains to be amongst the best films of the now-gone decade. 'Burn After Reading' gained a cult-following. 'True Grit' is surely a damn-good film, with a sterling & silver-lining performance by Jeff Bridges, but Coen's can do much more.Based on Charles Portis' classic American novel of the same name, 'True Grit' is a vendetta fare. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old girl, who inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, played by Jeff Bridges, to track down the man who killed her father.'True Grit' begins with a bang, and the legendary bro's leave their now-very famous stamp. However, the slow-pacing begins to bore at times. The first hour, though not \"bad, gives you the impression that this isn't catching up as expected. The second hour is dramatic and gripping, but it's the climax that leaves the strongest impression. The execution of the finale is simply awe-inspiring.Coen's can do better, I mean it. Sure, 'True Grit' is amongst their better films, and they direct each frame with absolute sincerity, but the impact, as well as the writing are not up to the mark. Roger Deakins Cinematography is striking. Editing offers well.Performance-Wise: Jeff Bridges has never been so good, and my summary has already covered that fact. He is effortless and most effective as Rooster Cogburn. His mesmerizing performances in 'The Last Picture Show, 'Starman', 'The Contender', 'Fearless' & 'Crazy Heart', sorta pale in comparison near to his work in here. Bridges has gone down as a Legend in Hollywood, and according to me, it's an under-statement. Hailee Steinfeld is very sincere and most lovable. Matt Damon doesn't get the desired scope, but does well nonetheless. Josh Brolin is superb in a brief role.On the whole, Coen's are more than this anyway good film.

            "content": "True Grit is the latest Coen Brothers movie, and while it is not groundbreaking, it is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of Charles' Portis novel, but it is more famously known as a remake of John Wayne's adaptation of True Grit. The Coens' film has a few nice touches of style, dialog, and well rounded characters. The movie follows Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a teenage girl, while she attempts to find Tom Chaney, the man who killed her father. She enlists the help of the elderly, one eyed drunk Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who has a reputation for possessing \"grit\" and killing all of his prisoners. Cogburn, against Ross's wishes, teams up with Texas Ranger LaBouef, played by the always reliable Matt Damon. Courage and commitment are the dominating themes of the film, and these three characters possess an abundance of these qualities, but Cogburn and LaBouef can't surpass Mattie Ross, which they both recognize in the end. The highlights of this movie are, without a doubt, the cast and the dialog. Steinfeld is a very gifted young actress who perfectly exudes a high level of intelligence and bravery, while still letting us see her vulnerabilities and flaws. The characters in this movie are unusually eloquent, but Steinfeld has no trouble with the dialog at all. Bridges will inevitably be compared to John Wayne, but he should not be, as he is trying to play the character from the book the film is based on. I have not seen the original movie or read the book, but Bridges gives his character humor and frailties. He is overweight, drinks heavily, and his lack of depth perception is a source of frustration, but there is still a definite sense of danger about him. Damon plays a cocky, sexist Ranger, but he has a strong sense of duty. Josh Brolin's role as Tom Chaney is too small for him to really make much of a mark on the film, but he's adequate as a foolish criminal.The script is intelligent and witty with its nineteenth century phraseology; it's the kind of script where you miss a few things on the first viewing, which only makes the second viewing better. I admire the Coens for imbuing their Western with a strong sense of authenticity. Their decision to use music from the time period is one example, but the viewer gets a real sense of the history of the nineteenth century in two scenes. At one point, Cogburn and LaBouef argue about their valor and honor by comparing the divisions they fought with during the Civil War. LaBouef alleges that Cogburn's commander, William Quantrill, a Confederate Guerilla leader, was only distinguished for killing women and children, whereas LaBouef fought in the Army of Northern Virginia, reflecting the romanticism of Robert E. Lee's army that persists to this day. In the very last scene, we get a sense that the \"Old West\" was officially over, and the frontier had closed ala Frederick Jackson Turner's famous thesis. The themes in these scenes are not a major part of the film by any extent, but they remind the viewer that the Wild West was a real place that was connected to the history of the rest of the country, rather than existing in a fantasy bubble world. If you come into this picture expecting a slam bang action picture, you will be a little disappointed. Action scenes are not the center piece of this film at all; however, the few action sequences are very suspenseful. The only criticism I have is that the pacing was a little off. There is a scene where they find a dead man hanging in the woods, and then they encounter a man wearing a bear skin hat, which in retrospect seem unnecessary. Fortunately I don't think this is a major detriment to the film because the characters are so enjoyable. This is definitely a more conventional effort by the Coen Bros., but it is one of the better pictures I have seen this year. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "I've never seen the original version of the film with John Wayne and Kim Darby, so I have no comparisons to make on that count. I have been busy watching a few of the Best Picture nominees though and would place this basically on par with The Social Network and 127 Hours in terms of enjoyability, although they're all very different kinds of movies. This is a wonderful story. It has everything you'd want in any typical western - good guys and bad guys, gunfights and horses. It has an interesting enough story revolving around Mattie - a young girl who sets out to track down her father's murderer and hires US marshal Rooster Cogburn to help her in the pursuit. It also has a fair number of laughs in it. It's a very funny movie in many ways right off the top when Mattie starts bargaining over her father's funeral costs and it just keeps going.The movie has a great cast, headed by Jeff Bridges as Cogburn (nominated for Best Actor) and 14 year old Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie (nominated for Best Supporting Actress.) While solid, I didn't think Bridges' performance was good enough for an Oscar. The nomination for Steinfeld baffles me. Not because she's not deserving - she put on an absolutely superb performance as Mattie. Considering her lack of experience, she went toe to toe with Bridges and a supporting cast consisting of folks such as Matt Damon and Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper and frankly - in my view - outdid them all. What I can't figure out about her nomination, though, is why it's for Best Supporting Actress. She's the only actress of substance in this movie, and she gets probably more screen time than Bridges does - so how does he warrant a \"Lead\" nomination and she only a \"Supporting\" nomination? That makes no sense to me. Some things only the Academy can explain.But that's a mystery that doesn't affect the quality of the movie. It's enjoyable from start to finish, largely due to the performances. One quibble I had (and it's just a matter of personal taste I guess) is that even though I understand that the story is about Mattie's quest for revenge against her father's killer, I do wish that this 14 year old girl hadn't pulled the trigger on him herself. That made me flinch a bit. I realize that in context it was understandable. Somehow, I wish that Mattie could have retained a little more innocence than that, though.",

            "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a fourteen year old girl, seeking justice for the murder of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin.) To help her, she enlists the help of grumpy old US Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and gets the more unwanted help of law enforcer LeBeouf (Matt Damon) and embarks on a dangerous and dark mission across the great American frontier.The western is very much a genre of a by gone era, that struggles to hold it's own much against a modern day audience, which couldn't be said when the original came out in the more innocent, simple days of 1969. Still, it spurts out the odd nail in the work, notably Tommy Lee Jones's 2005 directing/starring effort The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and the re-make of 3:10 to Yuma with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, and here the Coen Brothers have a shot at re-making the John Wayne classic.The Coens are known for adapting their unique style to whatever genre they take up next, and while we've seen how it works out with comedy (Burn After Reading) and dark thrillers (No Country for Old Men) with the western, they've thrown in the right ingredients, in terms of the lingering mood and atmosphere present in these type of films, but one that is so lost in this style it feels a bit alienating to a modern audience used to a more quick fire, fast paced type of style, and sadly the movie does bore in parts. It's sort of a product of the time it came out in, and would probably have been appreciated more in a gentler, more relaxed day and age.Wayne has remained an iconic figure in the world of cinema and popular culture years after his death and the height of his career, and his distinctive gruff, no nonsense delivery and presence gave each film he was in that unique mark. So any actor trying to step into his shoes and take on a role he once did would have their work cut out getting it in just the style he did, and luckily Bridges works hard (especially with the drawl!) and is convincing enough, while for such a young actress, Steinfeld is very commanding as the young girl. Hip new talent Brolin here has considerably limited screen time as the villain, but in the few scenes he has, leaves a lasting impression. Damon sort of feels unnecessary in his role, I speak as someone who never saw the original, but here he just felt like an over-bearing weight that shouldn't be there.The Coens are always unique and surprising with whatever project they choose next, and while they haven't delivered a classic here, they've delivered a very competent and slick effort that will sadly be lost to a younger audience. ***",

I was disappointed she didn't win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but believe her day will come.Her's was an amazing performance and she owned that character! I especially enjoyed her wit and quick tongue throughout. Entertaining dialog! All the actors were outstanding and Jeff Bridges' Rooster Cogburn BETTER than Wayne's. I know I'm stepping on Americana here, but that's how I feel. Wayne's iconic image overwhelms his acting ability in my opinion. Let's get with the new millennium people! Matt Damon and the bad guys, all great casting! The story holds your attention and is believable. A daughter seeking revenge for the murder of her father and the characters that make it all come together.I'm not a huge fan of Westerns but grew up watching many of them. This is by-far my favorite of the genre and certainly among my favorites of all-time behind the likes of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"The King's Speech\"",

I had to go permanently to the subtitles. I don't understand what people are crazy about this version. I tried not to compare it with the John Wayne classic in any scene. But the problem is that it never conquered, my attention was always going out of the film, somewhere else. No actor is outstanding here, there is no beautiful scenery, I terribly miss the touches of the magnificent Henry Hathaway, I couldn't find anyone -let's not say John Wayne who really deserved the Oscar- close or near to the fantastic roles as were played by Glen Campbell, Robert Duvall, Jeff Corey, Hank Worden (by the way, anyone could be better than that awful Kim Darby). Nevertheless, a lot of people has liked this version. I don't know why. I would recommend them to watch the John Wayne film and then let's talk about it again. As it is, I didn't like the Jeff Bridges version. I prefer him in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot or in Starman. And I prefer Matt Damon as Bourne by far.When John Wayne was doing classics like True Grit, he had a fantastic competition from his fellow classic legendary actors like Robert Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Charlton Heston, Tony Curtis, James Stewart. Now, all of them are gone.The competition for Jeff Bridges today would have to come from Steven Seagal, Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Gere, Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner who consistently are giving us the better movies of the day. I am sure that in 20 more years from now we will still be seeing again and again True Grit (1969), Under Siege, Rocky, Rambo, Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Indiana Jones (all of them), Braveheart (1995), Shall We Dance? (2004), The Bodyguard (1992), No Way Out (1987), Dragonfly (2002). I am certain that we will never see again this True Grit (2010).Mr. Bridges, I like you very much, almost as much as I like your father Lloyd, but you should do better that this.Respectfully yours always Duke.",

The Coen Brothers have fashioned another winner, from script to casting to direction to production design to score to camera-work, the whole nine yards. I always liked the John Wayne version, but I have to say that this version out-draws it.Jeff \"Starman\" Bridges is utterly convincing as Rooster Cogburn, Matt \"The Bourne Identity\" Damon is far superior to Glen Campbell, and I'm sorry, but newcomer Hailee Steinfeld has it all over Kim Darby, and not just because she's in the right age range. The rest of the ensemble is excellent as well, including Josh \"W.\" Brolin and Barry \"Saving Private Ryan\" Pepper as the main bad guys. This is no surprise; Coen Brothers films have rarely, if ever, been miscast.The brothers' screen adaptation is much better than the original (which really wasn't bad), since the times now permit (if not outright encourage) a less sentimental, as well as uncensored, take on the proceedings of the Charles Portis novel. The overall impression of being submersed in the period is much stronger, and this in part due to the language, which may seem flowery to modern audiences, but far more accurately reflects speech of the period (book) than the Wayne version. Roger Deakins' DP work is impeccable and as beautiful as ever.In a flour sack: if you like westerns, don't miss it. If you like Bridges, don't miss it. If you like the Coen Brothers, don't miss it. If you like quality film entertainment, don't miss it.Edit: I've purposefully avoided rehashing the plot because any film-goer worthy of the name should already know it.",

I confess that I am not a fan of western movies, I think it was an extremely mistreated genre in the past, but I decided to make an exception for this because of how much I heard very well about him as well as the actors involved. Of course, having the Cohen Brothers ensure the direction and writing of the script also piqued my curiosity. I already know enough of their work to know it's worth the risk. Only now, as I documented myself a bit to write this critique more clearly, did I realize that the film takes advantage of material from an older one, not quite a remake because the plot is greatly modified by the Cohen. I did not watch both films to prove it, but I give credit to everything I read because it agrees with what I know of the Cohen's creativity.The interpretation of the actors is excellent. I expected no less. Matt Damon made a restrained but credible appearance, but it was the perfect duo of Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld (the latter in their movie debut!) That dominated the movie and leveraged the action. They are really to be congratulated! I think Steinfeld's young age and inexperience caused some shame and prevented his nomination for awards as best actress, including by the conservative Hollywood Academy. I understand that, but it was really unfair because the young woman deserved the merit of this nomination, not the \"demotion\" to Supporting Actress.Technically, the movie is flawless. The Cohen Brothers, as detailed as ever, did not miss every detail. Light, shadow, cinematography are ideal, camera angles are impeccable, the soundtrack works perfectly well. Historical details, such as sets and costumes, deserve a particular draw for the positive. Pleasing to the eye and taste, they do not shock or steal our attention from the plot itself, but they do a great job in transporting the public to space and time, striving for historical rigor.This movie definitely helped change my conception of Western movies. I am sure that I will give more opportunities to films of this genre.",

The movie is beautifully shot and all the hallmarks of a Coen Brothers production the snappy and authentic dialogue is expertly suited to the period and the supporting cast are on par with Bridges performance including a superb turn from Matt Damon as Texas Ranger La Boeuf full of self importance. However the real coup here is the casting of Hailee Steinfeld as the 14 year old Mattie Ross who for me is the true representation of the title of this picture and it would be a crime if she is not at least nominated for an award. Her spirited performance is at the heart of this movie and she gives all the men in this picture a real run for their money putting every single man in her midst in their place with her highly intelligent thorny tongue. One scene in particular springs to mind where she sells back the horses her father buys from Colonel Stonehill only to buy back one of them at a reduced rate....poor Colonel Stonehill is bamboozled as are all the men who happen to run into this feisty 14 year old. The excellent casting and beautiful silent landscapes provide a backdrop to a fine adaptation of the original novel.

            "content": "First, I should note that I have never read Charles Portis's novel (although I might like to read it someday), nor have I seen the earlier movie version of \"True Grit\" (and have no plans to). That said, I really liked the Coen brothers' version of the movie.You probably know that the plot is that 14-year-old Mattie Ross hires hard-drinking US Marshal Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn to help her find the man who murdered her father, having heard that Cogburn has true grit. Joining them to search through Indian Territory is Texas ranger LaBoeuf. It's hard for the three to fully get along, but they all stick to their goal.The movie has to figure out how to strike a balance. Although Cogburn is treated as the main character, it seems as though more of the focus is on Mattie. Despite the tragedy that has befallen her family, this teenage girl is always self-assured, and very eloquent. In fact, there's only one scene in which the otherwise strong Mattie seems afraid.But even so, Cogburn remains probably the most important character. He cannot really be considered a \"good\" person, due to his lifestyle and less than 100% honesty. It is simply that Mattie has no other choice except to hire this somewhat disreputable individual to do what needs to get done. LaBoeuf is more of a side character, despite having his own reasons for wanting to find the killer. Still, he does eventually prove to have a purpose in the movie.All in all, this is not a masterpiece (certainly not the Coen brothers' best movie), but I still recommend it. Jeff Bridges almost chills your bones as the gruff Cogburn, staying focused on his business while maintaining a rather sordid lifestyle. Matt Damon didn't catch my attention as much, but a lot of praise should go to newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as the brave, young Mattie. There's nothing \"cute\" about this girl.So, while this might not be the best movie, I still encourage you to see it. Also starring Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper.",

Matt Damon and Haliee Steinfeld are an improvement on Glen Campbell and Kim Darby but Jeff Bridges, who I like, is in no way a John Wayne. Bridges wisely doesn't try to do anything like Wayne, it's a completely original performance and it's pretty good. However, you can't watch that character and that story and not think about John Wayne. I don't think the pacing or soundtrack is as good as the original. There was more comedy in the first version and also, surprisingly, I think the violence was better too. Also, the country and photography was better in the first.

The Coen brothers bring a muted version of their distinctive style to this version of Charles Portis' novel and the result is an excellent revisionist Western, with a classic anti-hero in Cogburn, who likes to 'pull a cork' and condones the occasional extrajudicial killing when it's called for. Bridges is great as the tough, often drunk 'one-eyed fat man' as is 14-year old Steinfeld as the tenacious (and sometimes vexatious) girl who is searching for 'frontier justice'. The cinematography is excellent and the film has an authentic feel for time and place although I found the dialogue at times to be a bit 'stagy' (especially Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) who sounded a bit like a character from HBO's 'Deadwood' (2004) without the imaginative profanity). All in all, an excellent version of a great Western story and a worthy successor the 1969 version, for which John Wayne finally won an Academy Award (and undeserving of its own Oscar snub (10 nominations, 0 wins)).",

            "content": "I have to disagree with Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald who downgraded 'True Grit' slightly because of what she terms \"the prevailing lack of Coen-ness in the movie.\" In fact, that's precisely why the movie worked a lot better than many of their previous offerings (usually involving trashing one of their prototypical straw man anti-heroes as well as reveling in their ubiquitous 'glass is half-empty' philosophy of life). The Coens have been quoted as saying that they approached the True Grit source material quite reverently, based on Charles Portis' 1968 novel, \"with its emphasis on adventure and quest.\" As usual the Coen cinematography and set design is excellent, creating a much better look to the old west, than the way it was depicted in the first True Grit vehicle, starring John Wayne. Except for the ending and a greater emphasis on Mattie Ross (focusing on the clever 14 year old, as the story's main protagonist), both versions pretty much followed the main plot points as found in the novel.I found this 'True Grit' to be mildly interesting but often slow-moving. It takes quite a while before 14 year old Mattie conscripts Rooster Cogburn, the 'meanest' US Marshall in the west, who will eventually track down Chaney, the man who killed her father. Joining them along the way is LaBouef, the Texas Ranger played by Matt Damon, who is also seeking Chaney for the killing of a Texas State Senator. When Mattie objects to LaBouef and Cogburn agreeing to bring Chaney back to Texas and not to her hometown to stand trial for the murder of her father, she receives a whipping from LeBouef. Cogburn intervenes, preventing LaBouef from inflicting additional punishment, and he then leaves.Although one of the strong suits of the film is the dialogue which features interesting local references, it's often hard to understand much of it, as Jeff Bridges has a tendency to mumble his words. The Coen brothers are determined to make this True Grit more 'grittier' and play up the violence. Cogburn is not politically correct when he gruffly tosses two Native Americans off a porch as he looks for an outlaw, Ned Pepper, and his gang, who are reportedly traveling with Chaney. When he finds two outlaws, Quincey and Moon, in an empty dugout, Quincey cuts off Moon's fingers and stabs him in the chest, to prevent him from talking, with Cogburn forced then to dispose of Quincey.Most of the rest of 'True Grit' is perfunctory. Ned shows up with his gang and Cogburn kills some of them with his shotgun, saving LeBouef in the process (who showed up earlier, right before the gang comes on the scene). Eventually, Mattie is kidnapped by Chaney, Cogburn kills most of Ned's gang, but is saved at the last moment by LaBouef, who shoots Ned, from a cliff, 400 yards away. Oh yes, Mattie eventually kills Chaney but falls into what looks like an abandoned mine, only to be saved by Cogburn after she's bitten by a rattlesnake.True Grit has its moments, but there are really few surprises overall, in this average tale of a teenager's desire for vengeance. Much of the conflict stems from the tension between the perspicacious Mattie and Cogburn, who is often befuddled by the tenacity of such a female. It works occasionally because it's nice to see such a macho character as Cogburn, get his comeuppance. But Cogburn is also such a one-note character, that the machinations between the two principals, begins to grow tiresome. As for the plot, it's basically a tale of the good guys dispatching the bad guys (with antagonists who aren't particularly interesting). The film might have worked a bit better if we arrived at the climax a bit sooner.The Coen Brothers did well in adding on the ending which is found in the novel but not in the 1968 film. We see Maddie (sans an arm due to the snake bite) now as a grown woman, looking for Cogburn, but tragically misses him by only three days (Cogburn, employed at a circus, dies right before Maddie can find him). After all the excitement, Maddie ironically turns out to be a spinster, in her adulthood (no CGI effects here folks; the Coens actually did a nationwide search and found a one-armed woman, who could play the part). Perhaps True Grit's main problem is that it's based on source material that has quite a bit of realistic dialogue but no real twists and turns in the plot. I liked Hailee Steinfeld as the new Maddie, as she provides a more 'serious' approach than the Kim Darby version in 1968. As for Jeff Bridges, some have said he's guilty of overacting; I leave further evaluations for the pundits, although again, I think he could have done better in annunciating his lines a bit better. Damon fails to bring anything distinctive to the thankless part of LaBouef.In the end, True Grit pretty much is an average western, featuring better than usual dialogue as well as a great deal of impressive cinematography. For once the Coen brothers decide not to stand above the fray and expect to be congratulated for shooting down one of their usual straw men. This time, they've done an honest job in attempting to adapt someone else's material. Not all of it works but one can say it's mighty nice to look at\u2014and that's no small feat.",

Audiences lapped it up because the traditional conservative figure descended into self-parody, and Wayne embraced every bit of the tough-loving, no-nonsense hardman of the west. Consider the final 'showdown' of the film, where Cogburn leans into his horse, pistol in one hand, rifle in the other (he holds the reins with his teeth), and charges at the four goons across the plain. No one but Wayne himself could ever sell the audaciousness of a four-on-one shootout posed like a medieval joust, and Bridges, who has been bumbling about for most of the remake, doesn't have the self-imposed gravitas and hardness to make it meaningful or dramatic. The original was a tale of two heads clashing - Cogburn, the stubborn old rooster, and Mattie Ross, the equally stubborn young hen, and how neither of them gave up any ground. It was only through the story and journey that they learnt to get along and even care for one another. But the power imbalance of this relationship in the remake means we don't get the same clashes. Bridges has no grit, taking a leaf out of his Lebowski instead of Wayne's numerous collections of weathered hardmen. His introduction is reminiscent of the stoner hero; squatting in the outhouse, grumbling about his 'business' being interrupted, playing off the straight-laced Ross. A similar scene is staged mostly for humour and the viewer's benefit - Bridges tossing up bread into the sky and being outdrawn by LaBoeuf, but not before spluttering and falling unceremoniously from his saddle. In these moments the character does nothing but service a joke, but because Bridges never goes beyond them, he doesn't earn his final redemption. Wayne's bravado of violence and self-importance was a facade that lent itself to each postured moment where he dominated the screen. Wayne didn't simply utter dialogue, he strutted and growled through his entire body and eyes, and until Ross we understand that nobody had ever challenged him on it. Bridges' version, on the other hand, mumbles through most of his lines, and shrinks rather than rising to the occasion. There is no narrative process where he is gradually humbled and stripped of his outward persona, and therefore no payoff. In LaBoeuf there is also an interesting transformation. Glen Campbell was a country singer first and actor second, and there is little comparison to Damon, but he plays his role well. The character is an archetype plucked straight from Texas, a sort of larger than life cowboy, a straight shooter for truth and justice. It's a bit role that requires a very specific type of character, one that is humourless and uptight, and Damon doesn't fit the mould. Watch how he has to strain and clench his jaw to keep within the character's parameters. In fact all of the original cast were tightly held by the same formal, literal prose from Charles Portis' novel - the kind of speech which forgoes contractions and gets straight to the point. The Coens, unsurprisingly, render this comedic and twist it into their traditionally deadpan deliveries. \"If you want to kiss him it will be all right,\" recites the undertaker to a grieving Ross in the beginning. Steinfeld is the only one who makes this dialogue work in a remake burdened by the Coens' familiar post-modern irony, subversion and outlandish signposting. Some obvious examples: the bear-head costume, how a hanged man's last words are cut off, the cackling midget of Pepper's gang. Most egregiously, in how the violence is stylised and then played for laughs - see how the camera casually pans down to the chopped-off digits after the dramatic shooting, and then is loudly interrupted by Bridges' \"GOD DANG IT\". Kim Darby was good in the original, with the impetuosity of a teacher's pet who always got her way and a motor mouth to back up her actions. She wielding the phrase 'Lawyer Daggett' like a magical spell and practically bullied older men into giving her what she wanted. Steinfeld is even better. She is younger, yet does not recall the brashness of Darby - she's not the teacher's pet but the teacher herself, shamelessly scolding adults and criminals like misbehaving schoolchildren that would dare deny her the justice she deserves. She nails my favourite part of the film where Ross squeezes between the two bounty hunters arguing, and reduces them to grumpy children wanting to hear a bedtime story: \"Would you two like to hear the story of the Midnight caller?\" Steinfeld pulls this off with a nervous smile about her, not only because of the simmering hostility in the air but also because she is opening up a bit of herself beyond that initial persona, and hinting at an underlying kindness and childishness that the west would see as a weakness and gobble up immediately. The Coens know this, so they cut straight to her tuckered up in blankets upon a horse, and expose her for the brave little girl she really is. They also bring back the original ending of the novel where an older Ross reminisces on how both men, much like the west, faded into obscurity and how she singularly held onto that time in her memory. I would love to presume that the Coens are using layers of history to meditate on the nature of legend, myth, storytelling - how the truth is usually funnier and harsher than the stories they form - but a glance seems to confirm that it is merely them not being able to resist their usual trademarks. But they have never really been able to hold back from this, except perhaps in No Country.",

            "content": "True Grit is based upon the novel of the same name by Charles Portis. Many who will go to see it will also recall that it was a film in 1969 which starred John Wayne and won him an Oscar for the same character that this time around, Jeff Bridges will most likely get an Academy Award nomination for playing. The film takes place in the late 1800's to early 1900's and is about a determined and fiery young woman named Mattie Ross, who goes into town to settle her late father's affairs. She vows to get even with the man who shot her father dead and decides to look for a marshal to bring him down. Mattie comes across the cantankerous and moody Rooster Cogburn and decides that he is the right man for the job. After some persuasion, Rooster agrees and the two of them are off on a manhunt to bring back the killer of her father, whether dead, or alive. I would like to start off by saying that I have never seen the popular 1969 film version of True Grit and I have also never read the novel on which both films were based. As any fan of films can tell you, John Wayne was and still after his death is one of the most popular movie stars of all time. People loved the westerns that he starred in and he had a lot of loyal fans. To some of those fans remaking, or doing a new version on one of his films, let alone the film that won him his Oscar should not be touched and I could see where some of those fans may not even want to see this new version. As, I said, having never seen the original version, I can not truthfully make any comparisons between the two. However, I did find myself immensely enjoying this new version. Westerns are not normally my favourite genre because I find that they can get pretty formulaic and clich\u00e9d, but I felt this version of True Grit did everything right. It gives us a very entertaining story that is not only filled with a lot of entertainment, good character study, humour and some well played out action scenes, but it also is done with a lot of craft and care and the film comes off looking like a beauty. The story itself, I think is further enhanced by the great characters and how well and developed they are. The relationship between the crotchety Rooster and the determined and spitfire Mattie, is actually a joy to watch because their screen relationship is so good between one another because of their great conversations and even when they are saying nothing at all the performances by Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld are perfect. They will definitely both be up for acting Oscars for this film and both are well deserved nominations. The rest of the cast is all very good here as well, including even the minor characters. The mood of the film was at times atmospheric with beautiful cinematography and art and set decoration and at other times it is grim, at others full of action and there is even some true laugh out loud moments in the film. The editing and direction are tight and well on display here and it is put together perfectly. This is definitely a film where the entire cast and crew gives there all and the result is fantastic. I loved True Grit for the great screen chemistry between Bridges and Steinfeld, their relationship as well as the words they exchange with one another and the fact that they really do care for one another. The story itself is intriguing and we want to keep watching as a viewer to see what will happen and at times it is really exciting. The action scenes are well shot and played fairly low key, so nothing is over the top, or ridiculous looking. As well as the great performances and look and feel of the film, this is the type of film that critics will love and the average moviegoer will love as well. True Grit did everything right and turned out, so much better than I thought it would be, to the point where I would call it one of the best films of 2010 and worthy of any and all Oscar nominations it is up for.",

            "content": "True Grit crackles and pops across the sweeping vistas of the Wild West, a time where the frontier actually existed, where young girls could pursue their father's killer in the name of revenge, and a time where a U.S. Marshall could be judge, jury, and executioner without any real appeal. The Coen Brothers have crafted a Western adventure that is everything a great Western should be, and something that many Westerns have lacked. They take us back to a simpler time, where men roamed the wilderness, where it was either good or bad, scoundrel or coward, and it is this simplicity that makes True Grit the superb cinematic achievement that it is.Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross's father was murdered by the coward Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) recruits U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to hunt Chaney down and bring him to justice, but here's the catch, Mattie must accompany Cogburn across the wilderness to exact her revenge upon Chaney. Along the way there are electrifying gunfights, beautiful landscapes, and a self-promoting Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who often teams up with Mattie and Rooster. The hunt is on.Writer/directors Joel and Ethan Coen make a sentimental film to a time long lost, without feeling at all sentimental, but being a work in memory of the time. Throughout the entire film, the Coens keep it pure and simple, and simplicity is the thing that makes this movie excel. There are no complex narrative structures or crazy frills and whistles, the movie does not innovate in these areas, but just does so well with what already exists. The cinematography from Roger Deakins is simply marvelous. Never is there an unnecessary camera movement or hand-held camera work to add some grit, but rather the cinematography is always precise and captures the essence of simplicity. Helping aid the simplicity, the score from Carter Burwell, adapted from four old 1800s hymns, is never obtrusive, always played purely, effectively, and reminiscent of what an 1800s church service might have felt like with just a couple twenty people and an organ to sing to.The Coen Brothers' script sizzles with their trademark comedic flare, and it is through the humor that comes simply from the characters being themselves that creates a camaraderie between Mattie, Cogburn, and LaBeouf. Everyone is not as they seem in this movie. Mattie, contrary to her appearance, is a tough girl who will trek the wilderness to hunt down a killer, but she is also a compassionate person who sees things in others that no one else sees. Mattie sees beyond Cogburn's gruff exterior, and becomes his spunky sidekick, knowing that he is a man of heart who will carry her across the plains to save her life. Not only that, Mattie comes to believe in LaBeouf more than he does in himself, that he is a greater Ranger than both he and Cogburn give him credit for. But what makes their camaraderie work are the performances of the actors. Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon deliver as one would expect, but the scene stealer is always thirteen-year-old Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie. Steinfeld is a firecracker whose emotions are pure, innocent, and straight-to-the-point. Nothing in her performance ever seems over-thought, but just natural, and the tears of her seeing a horse put down or her fear when she falls into a pit of rattlesnakes, is true to human nature.Never have I been more enthralled by a Wild West adventure than I was by the Coens' True Grit. Their simplistic view of a simpler time takes one back as a viewer to those times of their simplistic childhood, where we idolized heroes, and despised the villains. We were Mattie, and for a few hours, the Coens allow us to remember what it was like to be her.I give True Grit a 10 out of 10!",

            "content": "Having seen, and loved, the original 1969 version of this story starring John Wayne I was intrigued to see the Coen Brothers' take on it. As is usually the case with these things, it didn't show at my local cinema and so I waited patiently for it to appear on TV. As you can probably guess, it put in an appearance this week and I'm very pleased to report its well worth a look. I will tell you why after this brief summary.Fourteen year old Mattie Ross has been sent to claim the body of her dead father, shot by a man employed by him called Tom Chaney. Now Chaney had run for the 'Indian Territory' after the event which makes him the responsibility of the U.S. Marshall's service. To this end, Mattie engages U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn to bring Chaney to justice. A Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf, is also interested in finding Chaney as he had shot a Senator while down there. Cogburn and LaBoeuf plan to find Chaney on their own and bring him to justice in Texas, but they hadn't bargained for the tenacity of the young Mattie Ross. We follow them into the 'Indian Territory' in their pursuit of the fugitive who they believe to be running with one Lucky Ned Pepper. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police (Western's Division) will be sending Cogburn after me (again).Nicely shot, but with a much 'starker' feel to it than the original; it also lacks the majesty of the surroundings that the original had. Having said that, this doesn't detract too much from the story which is very well written and performed. And on that subject, we have to give praise to Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn who, despite a rather mumbled performance, does really well! Also worthy of note were both Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross and Matt Damon as LaBoeuf who both put in great performances also. Honourable mentions must also go to Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned Pepper.Much has been made of the dialogue and how it more closely matches the original novel. Well, yes it does, but then again the 1969 version wasn't a million miles away from it either. There are, however, some interesting, and welcome, additions and alterations to the narrative that weren't included in the original. I really liked these and they gave the film a little extra that I wasn't expecting. Now I have to talk about the performance of Hailee Steinfeld; while quite different to Kim Darby's 1969 performance, I found the character grew on me as it went on. I believe Kim Darby was quite a bit older when she made the film and I think is shows in her slightly more polished performance. That's not to take anything away from Hailee Steinfeld, she's a fine actress and I hope this performance brings her much success in the future. Over all, I like both films but the Coen's version slightly has the edge (at the moment). Worth a watch\u0085 Hell yes!... Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 106,408 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 96/100 (based on 248 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 86/100 (based on 108,965 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).",

            "content": "When I hear of a remake of a film wherein I was fond of the original, I am not usually eager to see it. But after watching this film last night (industry screener copy), I wish the Coen Brothers would remake a few more films. Their version of True Grit is an engrossing masterpiece. The main adjective that describes the viewing experience is...immersive. I have rarely felt so incredibly immersed in a world and a subject matter. Every detail of every performance is simultaneously both quotidian and extraordinary. Every detail of the world depicted on film makes me feel like I'm there.And the script -- the dialogue is colorful yet plain speaking, mundane yet deep. If I keep describing the film in contradictions, I guess it's because it's rare that a film can give us a glimpse of the contradiction that is life. There are odd bursts of humor -- the kind that happens in real life. Perhaps because the sudden violence that is depicted seems so real, the humor is all the more appreciated. By the characters themselves as well as the viewing audience. The direction is brilliant -- the Coen Brothers at their best. And the cast is uniformly brilliant, even the smallest bit player. Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin, Matt Damon -- all a joy to watch. But the young actress Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie is perhaps the most notable simply because it's her first movie, her first starring role. What a debut! She has an intensity that leaps off the screen effortlessly and makes us care about her plight from the first second we see her.Forgive the hagiographic nature of this review -- but this movie is just that good. The most satisfying movie-going experience in years. In an age with a relentless onslaught of those horrid comic book superhero movies and bland romantic comedies alleviated only by the pretentious dreary indies and headache-inducing 3d pap thrown in the mix, it's a relief to see a movie so well crafted as this. It pulls you in from the beginning and doesn't let go till the credits roll. Thanks Coen Brothers, for writing this and directing it and picking such a great cast and crew. Thanks for reminding me why the movies were invented.",

To do this, she enlists the help of Deputy Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges).Cogburn is a barely functioning alcoholic, but still mighty good with a gun. He accepts her offer of $100 to hunt down the man who killed her father. He is joined by a Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon). Mattie accompanies them on their hunt, because she doesn't trust either of them.The rest of the story is the group's exploits in attempting to find the man who killed Mattie's father. That is just about it. There isn't a twist, there isn't a lot on the film's mind, and it's just a well-told adventure story in a western setting. Since this is a Coen brothers film, that also means that the adventure will be compelling and the characters will be interesting. The movie will also be of high quality, this we can almost be sure of before even viewing it.\"True Grit\" is adapted from the 1968 novel of the same name. The novel had already been made into a film one year later in 1969. That film starred John Wayne, and won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. The Coen brothers have stated that they wanted their film to be more faithful to the novel than the 1969 film, and that they were not just reimagining that film.Whether or not their claim is true or not is something that is hard to discern. The story doesn't really have much to alter about it, and the genre is already set in stone. In fact, this is really the first time that the Coen brothers have stuck to their genre so rigorously. They adhere to most of the standards of the Western genre, not pushing any boundaries or taking any risks.There are only two things that actually make \"True Grit\" stand out from the other quality movies that are out nowadays, or the great Westerns that were made years past. The first way is differentiates itself is in the humor that it contains. The way that the Coen brothers have written their adaptation makes it humorous, while keeping a fairly dark tone. There are many funny situations and moments in dialogue, breaking up the dark moments with ones of humor.The second way that it is different is the fact that it is a Western. There haven't been many of those lately, so having one come out automatically makes \"True Grit\" stand out. The last big Western film to come out was 2007's 3:10 to Yuma, itself a critical success. Having a lack of competition will certainly help \"True Grit\" at the box office.Also helping it out is the fact that it features great acting performances. Despite the big names included in the cast like Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, the lead of the film is actually 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld. The story is told from her point of view, and she does a good job of carrying it. Selected from more than 15 000 auditions, Steinfeld won the role. This must have been created some anxiety from the filmmakers, as she hadn't starred in any large-scale production before. Nonetheless, the risk paid off, and she delivers an impressive performance. Her character is far more mature than many you would expect, being able to negotiate with several businessmen and get her way.Also great are the performances by Bridges and Damon. While they don't get as much attention as Steinfeld, they are perfect for their roles. Bridges job as an alcoholic, half-functioning U.S. Marshal is always entertaining, and Damon always seems like he's having fun, no matter what is happening in the story at the time.The story mixes a mystery with adventure, finding a good balance between the two. Characters have to look for clues regarding Chaney's whereabouts. They ride horses everywhere, and engage in shootouts. Characters travel great distances across the Wild West. There is a good sense of adventure that is given, and there is enough action to keep the audience's attention.The characters all have depth and they develop throughout \"True Grit\". We are given reason to care about Mattie right away, as her character is one to be empathized with. Her father's murder gives her motivation. We also end up caring about the other characters, especially that of Cogburn. We want to see him overcome all of his issues by the end of the film. We have that hope throughout, and it helps keep our attention during the slower moments.\"True Grit\" is a good film that will get attention mostly because it is a new Western film, something that there have been few of as of late. It has an interesting story, great acting and the Coen brothers' unique style of humor. It's genuinely funny, and stays entertaining throughout. \"True Grit\" is a well-made film that may inspire similar films to be made in the near future. It's a great Western film, something we haven't had much of lately, and that will allow it to be a success. It's definitely worth a watch, so give it one.",

            "content": "So sayeth John Wayne at the end of the original \"True Grit\" back in 1969. Bridges character is portrayed no less gritty than Wayne's Cogburn, and is in fact given a nice sheen with his mean as a opossum in a cellar attitude. Bridges pulls no punches with his interpretation of Cogburn, and is not straddled by a larger than life reputation that accompanied Wayne with nearly all of his roles.So it is that we get to see not Wayne, not Bridges, but Cogburn himself in perhaps a purer form as intended by the author. There's a lot to praise in this film. First off, it's not an action piece. It's a good old fashioned Western with six shooters, horses, bandits, vendettas, rattlers, and everything that goes with it. There're ancient forces at work here; predator and prey, law and order, right and wrong. This stuff courses through this film.There aren't a lot of quick witted zingers, but there's good portioned humor scattered throughout, usually in the form of a wry observation, or other commentary that's peculiar prima facia, but otherwise a kind of truism worthy only of a US Marshal or Texas Ranger.It's a film that's respectably shot, decently acted, though there are no deep moments of tears, anger or other emotions. This is the old west. People have feelings, but they're secondary to survival in a world where those who've gone astray can pack a rifle or six-shooter, and spread their misery. They need to be dealt with, and it falls to the tin-star to bring them in.Look, I'll be honest here, I liked this film. But, compared to the high-glossed super-sexed action tripe that people seem to love so much today, I simply don't know if people are ready for this kind of film. One that goes back to basics; bear your pain (suck-it-up) and forge onward to see that right is done in the face of wrong. It will not look pretty at first, but the beauty is in seeing that justice, the law, has addressed the evil in men's hearts. I'm not sure the younger audience will except non-sexy film making.The shots are basic. They are functional. Again, this is old fashioned film making. This is not quick cut MTV shaky cam BS mixed in with a hyper bass track that makes your heart skip a beat. Nor is the content in the film white washed nor over played in terms of the times the characters inhabited. We have people dressed in the attire of the time, and living, thinking and speaking the way people did then. My grand parents and their grand parents and so forth. To live here, you must have true grit.I think of my own horse and firearm days, and no, they weren't anything like this, but I did camp out under the stars, fire different types of pistols and rifles, rode horses, hiked up in the coldest of the Rocky Mountains and trudged across deserts, and I could certainly get a sense for the characters and their surroundings.My final note is on the cast; superb. Bridges does an excellent job, as I mentioned before, as do all the rest who surround him. There isn't a single miscast here, and everyone does their job with great authority and execution.If movies weren't so expensive, I'd go see it again. In the meantime, give it a chance.",

I had seen the original with John Wayne so i knew the story however I'm wondering it is me or westerns in general that i have a problem with my favourite being Tombstone. I have tried to sit through a handful of westerns but only a couple i actually really liked. After witnessing her father get killed 14 year old farm girl Mattie Ross go on a nationwide hunt for her father's cold blooded killer and here's the man to get the job done is us Marshall Rooster Cogburn who she ends up finding out is a washed up old drunk who only accepts her job cause he starts taking a shine to her and doesn't seem to want harm to come her way. Also along for the ride is Texas Ranger Labeouf ( Matt Damon) who seems to have a lot of issues taking orders from a 14 year old child as he puts it. Like i said i was kinda feeling meh in this one but still watched from start to finish another one i think you should save your hard earned money from and wait for the rental.",

            "content": "A slow wild west story, it starts off as a narration by the protagonist, who recounts her experience while she was a 14 year old girl. Her father was murdered by one of his employees, Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin). She finds out that the law is moving slowly in delivering justice, and takes it on her own hand to hire an experienced tracker to hunt him down and bring him to justice.She hires Rooster Coogan (Jeff Bridges), a one eyed drunkard sheriff who was reputed to kill more than arrest. They are also joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who is also chasing Tom Cheney for crimes in Texas, for which a substantial reward is still pending.The movie is gripping, and the performances were very powerful. However, for some reason, I thought the 1969 John Wayne version had a better story - the story is slightly different towards the end. But I don't remember that all too well, so maybe I'm wrong.In any case, it's a pretty good movie to watch, if you're into the realistic, gritty, slow westerns, like 'Unforgiven'...

They'll say it's a travesty to remake John Wayne's Oscar winning movie..blah, blah, blah. but don't believe them. That's bias and sour grapes talking.This new effort is so obviously superior to the original that I am shocked to admit it. I watched the original a week before seeing the new version and must admit that although it was pleasant enough, the original has not aged as well as many other classic westerns. I believe the reason for this is Henry Hathaway's uneven direction, Elmer Bernstein's uncharacteristically weak musical score and Glen Campbell's horrible casting as La Boeuf. I enjoyed John Wayne, Kim Darby and Robert Duvall in the original but Wayne and Darby never really made an obvious emotional connection in the original. (In fact John Wayne commented on his low opinion of Kim Darby's acting skills after the movie was released.) By comparison Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfield hit it off in this new effort in a way I'm convinced John Wayne would have admired greatly. I personally place much of the blame for this with Hathaway not the actors. Despite John Wayne's criticism of Kim Darby I don't think they were out acted as much as Hathaway out-directed by the Coen's. This takes nothing away from the actors in the new version. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld were absolutely fantastic, with Hailee Stanfield edging out the fantastic performance by Jeff Bridges. The overall direction, pacing, art direction, cinematography, music and casting all come together in away they simply did not in the original. It really is an amazing tribute to the Coen's collaborative genius. One thing I particularly appreciate that I'm sure many more conventional movie goers will not like is the ending, but then I hate syrupy happy ending in movies like this. (It's sooo Hollywood.) This is a darker movie with a more realistic feel to it, so the remake appropriately has a darker, more believable ending. Is it really hard to imagine that a woman as forthright and independent as Mattie Ross, minus her left arm, wouldn't be married? Is it hard to imagine that after being bitten by a rattlesnake and a days ride from help that she might lose her arm. Wake up people, Rooster Cogburn didn't ride her up to Johns Hopkins.If you like fairy tale westerns, with unrealistic happy endings, stick with the1969 version. If you like something a bit more realistic and poignant, go for the remake. The movie's named \"True Grit\" afterall.",

            "content": "First off, I never saw the older version with John Wayne, so please don't expect me to comment about that at all. As far as this version with Jeff Bridges in the role that Wayne originally played, I thought it was pretty much half-baked.The plot is a very straightforward revenge-Western, with the twist being that it's a young girl who wants to \"get this killin' done\" to borrow a phrase from Dylan. It's reasonably hard-boiled and dry, with a couple good action scenes. There were two big problems that I had with the movie. First of all, I want to smack Joel and Ethan Coen and tell them that it's OK to use contractions. If the entire \"style\" of the piece hangs up such a thread, then it's probably not a very worthwhile style. Basically, if you have not yet seen this movie and you are reading my comments despite the spoiler warning, expect that every character in this movie talks like Commander Data on Star Trek. No matter what part of the country they come from or how drunk they are, they will not say won't. And I thought it was a bit.... gosh I hardly dare to use the word on the IMDb but maybe.... pretentious? The other thing was the whole ending, which I guess is where the generalized spoiler warning comes into effect. I thought as soon as Hailee shot Chaney and he turned into a CGI and she suddenly hurtled backwards down a mineshaft, all of a sudden it was a Roadrunner/Willie Coyote film and it was just utterly horrible, the entire rest of the film. Actually we can rewind... even the whole climactic showdown with Bridges against Barry Pepper (whose character's named, oddly enough, is Ned Pepper) and his gang was pretty underwhelming, with Bridges not really summoning anything special and with poor Pepper, one of our best working character actors, without enough screen time in the film to establish a memorable villain, it's kind of an anticlimax. And then with Josh Brolin popping up like a monster in a horror movie, and the rattlesnakes, I mean it's just too much for me.The acting is uniformly excellent. Matt Damon is coming along excellently as a star and managed to hold the screen with Bridges. Bridges himself is the star of the show and he knows it, but a generous and spontaneous performer here as always. Brolin didn't manage to do anything memorable except another enactment of his malignant buffoon routine, but he's good at that. Barry Pepper, again despite very limited time, was as impressive as always at conveying a character more complex than the scenario surrounding him. His performance seemed right out of a Boetticher film, quite a bit like Richard Boone in \"The Tall T\"... he's a leader of bad men who's just intelligent and wise enough to know how much of a better man (or in this case, girl) his enemies are than his \"friends.\" I like the movie but I didn't find it compelling and I thought the conclusion was corny. I don't know if they were trying to stay true to the book, but it didn't work for me at all.",

            "content": "It is my opinion that many of the people who go to see the Coen Brothers' re-imagination of True Grit will have little to no knowledge of the original version from 1969 starring John Wayne. Indeed, both follow the Charles Portis novel well while the Coens follow the plot more truly, sticking to much of the dialogue as well as certain story lines left out of the Wayne film.Regardless, this is a film that stands on its own, primarily because of the very strong acting. Jeff Bridges, always associated with his character from the Coens' 1998 classic The Big Lebowski, really gets under the skin of Rooster Cogburn, a curmudgeon of a federal marshal who is hired by the strong-willed and determined 14 year-old daughter of a recently murdered man to avenge his murder. The young girl, Mattie Ross, is played by newcomer Hallie Steinfeld, who is without a doubt a revelation of an actress, one so young yet so intelligently fierce in her performance, she stands nose-to-nose with every other actor in the film, who are needless to say great in their own right.Aside from the marvelous and immensely watchable Steinfeld, the Coens have put together an incredible cast, boasted by Bridges' method performance along with Matt Damon as the pompous Texas Ranger La Beouf, Josh Brolin as the vile and cutthroat Tom Chaney, and Barry Pepper as the infamous Lucky Ned Pepper. As with nearly all Coen films, the supporting cast is perfect, every single small role and extra filled just right to accentuate the main cast.This is much more of a straight up genre picture than the Coens have ever done, particularly in the Western form. That being the case, True Grit is not the instant masterpiece No Country for Old Men was, but it still has the immaculate quality of film making expected by the Coens every time out. Roger Deakins' photography is breathtakingly beautiful and sublime, Carter Burwell's score is minimalisticly aesthetic and the Coens write, direct and edit so perfectly, you forget to look for flaws or missteps and simply fall into this rather charming story of the relationship between a young girl and older man who somehow meet in the middle, rekindling the very thing that brought them together initially: a father-daughter relationship.This is perhaps the \"nicest\" Coen Brothers film ever, although given their past dark material that isn't saying much. It follows along smoothly, never stopping to include certain passages or characters unnecessary to the real story. Some may feel unmoved by it, but I find it hard to believe many people will leave feeling any remorse or empathy for Mattie Ross. She is a wonderful character, and Steinfeld's performance only enhances the beauty and majesty of this film. The true grit belongs to her and we admire how much she has as well as how she attains it.",

Jeff Bridges is simply five stars in his role as Rooster Coqburn the old US Marshall.

A 14 year old girl (Hailee Steinfeld) is strongly determined against all odds to pursue and catch the man who killed her father and ran away to join a bandit gang in the Indian Territory, with the purpose of killing him or bringing him to justice. After hard bargaining she managed to hire an old US Marshall for that purpose and makes him with great obstinacy of hers, to accept her company and help to perform that just task. Later a Texas Ranger joins them since he is also chasing the same man for the murder of a senator. Despite the fact of dealing with those characters and despite her indomitable will and determination the young girl reveals herself to be very well-bred always calling the marshall as Marshall and the Ranger as Mr. LaBoeuf and behaving nicely most of the time. The story develops itself in several intensely dramatic moments since the chase is not peaceful at all and passes through several violent scenes riveting the viewer's attention till the very end.

            "content": "An amazing movie by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen and no one's surprised as they make their way to the nominations for the Academy this time as well. Although I personally didn't like No country for old men and I was a bit reluctant to go for another one of their flick but I was really taken by surprise when I actually found the movie quite interesting and brilliant. No country for old men had left me with a sour taste (yeah I am talking about the ending) although the movie was quite brilliant as I recall it now but True grit has certainly something more of a true grit in it.What really worked apart from the obvious brilliant direction was Mattie Ross's (Hailee Steinfeld) boldness and Rooster Cogburn's (Jeff Bridges) true grit. Matt Damon did his part as LaBoeuf the Texas Ranger who follows them on their hunt completing the trio hunting down Tom Chaney(Josh Brolin) who has murdered Mattie's father and absconded. Mattie is looking for revenge and hires Rooster Cogburn to hunt down Tom Chaney and punish him for his deed. Albeit LaBoeuf is already on the hunt for Tom Chaney and wants him hanged in his own town and there is a bit of a contradiction of opinions between the three of them. The drama is well portrayed as everyone wants a piece of Tom Chaney and LaBoeuf and Rooster are busy proving who's the best in getting a Bulls eye. Rooster is after a guy named Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and is in for the kill for his reasons.The flick is a marvellous depiction of the life of Mattie who is looking for vengeance, who is just 14 years old and still can do a lot about getting her job done because of her bravery, presence of mind and skills.It is a worth watch and I'd rate the movie 8.5 on 10 and recommend everyone to go for it.",

But the end result, with Jeff Bridges, no stranger to westerns he (RANCHO DELUXE; BAD COMPANY; WILD BILL), in the role that the Duke cemented forever in people's minds, is no slouch of a film either.Once again, a teenager named Mattie Ross (here played by Hailee Steinfield, in the role Kim Darby had) hires the crusty, whiskey-drinking Cogburn (Bridges) to hunt down Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin, taking over for Jeff Corey), the man who killed her father, as well as Brolin's gang, headed up by \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, in the role Robert Duvall parlayed in '69). Matt Damon, meanwhile, tags along as LaBeouf, the greenhorn Texas Ranger (played by Glen Campbell) who proves he, like the feisty Mattie, shows some \"true grit\" of his own to stand up to Bridges' hard-charging marshal. The film, though somewhat longer than an audience weaned on headache-inducing 3D and MTV-inspired montage editing might like, moves at a fairly fast pace, thanks to Bridges' salty performance as Cogburn, and the Coen Brothers' eye for period dialog, set design, and music (provided by the Coens' regular composer Carter Burwell). And Steinfield gives a great and marvelously unruffled performance as Mattie--a role that probably ought to earn her at least an Oscar nomination.It's never easy for Hollywood to do remakes of anything, especially not Westerns, particularly those where John Wayne was involved; but the Coens' effort at reworking TRUE GRIT doesn't disappoint. If Bridges' performance as Rooster Cogburn doesn't necessarily outshine the Duke's, it is not out of lack of trying; he just gives a different, but equally valid, portrayal. Many of the original film's most famous lines are repeated almost verbatim (including the always-memorable \"Fill your hand, you son-of-a-b**ch!\"). In the end, it may very well get people to ask why Hollywood went stone-cold on the Western, even after it proved its worth in recent times with films like UNFORGIVEN, TOMBSTONE, and OPEN RANGE. When made with the kind of care and authenticity shown here, along with solid performances from all concerned, the Western can still show the kind of \"true grit\" that the Coens' film, like the Henry Hathaway/John Wayne epic before it, showed.",

Through the whole movie, I couldn't understand half of what Jeff Bridges was saying!. And the sound was so LOUD! it was almost painful, before you got adjusted to it. I mean , I love Jeff, he is one of my all time favorite actors, but he clearly was still a little stuck in his last roll a bit (Crazy Heart) except here, you can't understand him. (by the way, Crazy heart was.... OK)As always, the filming of movies today...it's so amazing. They can make crap smell good, because they have such great equipment and technology. That, and the fact that they also produce such garbage at the same time, they make what movies that DO come out fairly well, to appear far better than they really are. The color, the music, the sound, the graphics, can be very good, but what they miss a lot is, there are other elements you need... to make a \"Great Movie\".John Wayne (aka Rooster Cogburn) had a way about him that made you love him. In this version, Rooster is a bum, someone I wouldn't want buried next to me, for sure! I wouldn't even want to know the guy. Josh Brolin was a JOKE!. He looked foolish trying to copy the dialogue from the original that I don't even want to talk about it, it's so bad. Hailee Steinfeld was...OK, Barry Pepper sounded amazingly like Robert Duval and played his part VERY well. Matt Damon also did very well, but then again, he had Glen Campbell's old part, and well, doesn't take much to do better than Glen Campbell.I'm not suggesting they should make remakes exactly word for word what the original was, but the rule generally is, if you aren't going to make it better (or at least just as good), then please, PLEASE... don't make it at all.The end was a major league disappointment and that made the movie a disappointment even more so. If you are a fan of the Original, Don't buy this movie, borrow it if you must see it.By the way....

This is the very first time in their history of filmmaking, that the Coen brothers have ever done a western film. The story of True Grit follows Mattie Ross seeking revenge on Tom Chaney, the man who killed her father, with the help of Rooster Cogburn and Labeouf, Texas Ranger. First of all, I know this film does not relate to traditional Coen films. The type of movies from the Coens are dark comedies, well-written dramas, and sometimes bloody. But \"True Grit\" is the first Coen film that only had little of that, and does not fit traditionally. But I still enjoyed the movie, and the cast is incredible. Jeff Bridges helped recreate John Wayne's Oscar-winning performance of a drunk U.S. Marshal who never shut up. There's also Matt Damon as a Texas ranger, Josh Brolin as a coward, and even 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld, who portrayed an awesome performance in this movie, where she spent her whole life and soul to find the man guilty of killing her father. And her Best Supporting Actress nomination is so deserving. But she was placed in the supporting category, when having more scenes than anyone else in the whole movie. This film had its moments of great writing and talented casting, but \"True Grit\" handles less Coen brothers tradition, but most scenes are completely epic, and the ending follows revenge, punishment, and retribution. \"True Grit\", in my review, \"An epic adventure, but not the same piece of material\".",

            "content": "The book and the 1969 original set very high standards for this Coen Brothers' Western drama, but as high as the standards were set, the Coen Brothers managed achieve the goals or better yet exceeded them. True Grit is about a drunken US Marshal and a cocky Texas Ranger helping a stubborn 14 year-old finding her father's murderer. Rooster (Jeff Bridges) was offered $50 to find the murderer for Mattie, played by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Le Boeuf (Matt Damon) was offered a reward to find the same guy who also killed a Senator. Conflicting each other on the journey and finally catching the bad guy Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the three each developed their character skillfully. Jeff Bridges playing last year Crazy Heart's Bad Blake only with a gun and an eyepatch. Matt Damon used his own personal style to play this cocky but humorous Texas Ranger. Hailee Steinfeld played a stubborn 14 year-old who's determined to find Tom Chaney and bring him to hang. Though expected performances from both Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, newcomer Hailee Stenfeld was as good as her castmates. The one thing I kept in mind while going in this film was that Bridges and Damon are going to give applausable performances and Hailee Steinfeld was getting nominated for some major awards. But when I was finished, I didn't see what all the buzz was about. Sure, Steinfield was good, but compared to Bridges and Damon, she sure didn't have much. I have to say though, beating thousands of other girls for this role is impressive, but I'm sure other Hollywood stars had to do that as well. Even though I find her not as great as I hoped, she still delivered well. The directors are the two and only Coen Brothers. With ten Oscar nominations and four wins for each Joel and Ethan Coen, they are Hollywood's most wanted in directing dark Western dramas. Well known for their latest work \"A Serious Man\" and \"No Country For Old Men', True Grit is another fine addition to their long and impressive resume. Directed with true grit and impressive performances, True Grit outsmarts the original and simply entertaining. OscarBuzz: Best Picture (good chance), Best Director (good chance), Best Actor (Jeff Bridges, better chance), Best Supporting Actor (Matt Damon, a chance at a nod), Best Supporting Actress (Hailee Steinfeld, a chance at a nod), Best Adapted Screenplay (Coen Brothers, better chance)",

I'm an old (63)Texan who's watched a lot (dozens and dozens)of Westerns set in Texas, set in Arizona, set in Mexico, New Mexico, you name it- and they all, oddly, looked exactly like they were set in southern California. This movie was filmed in the Texas Hill Country, and the scenery is perfectly in accord with much of south eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas. There are scenes in scrub timber and on rocky hillsides that are perfectly beautiful and quite fresh to the Great American Western.I am astonished by the number of reviewers who rate this movie as inferior to the film starring John Wayne. You know, there's a reason nobody ever tapped Wayne for an Old Vic revival of King Lear. In any film Wayne ever made, the script, the story, the other actors were all there in secondary importance to the great Wayne, and no one watching the film ever was allowed to forget it - the movie belonged to John Wayne. He played the same character over and over and over again, he played him at age 30 and age 65, in all kinds of settings, but he was the same guy. Wayne was hugely popular and is still, but he was never much of an actor. He was a movie star. The film he made of True Grit was a John Wayne movie.In contrast, the Coen Brothers movie was cast with accomplished, versatile actors playing realistic characters from a brief but distinct period of American history, respectfully and skillfully adapted from a marvelously original novel. The only reason I didn't give it ten stars is that I believe the highest rating should be reserved for relatively few films.",

            "content": "TRUE GRITThe Coen Brothers decided to be \"west\" \"ern\" \"boys\" and rounded up a western in their redux of the John Wayne starring classic \"True Grit\". When I first heard that the Coens were going to tackle this gritty tale of a western young teen Mattie Ross who hires a vociferous & alcoholic U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn to extinguish the outlaw who killed her father, I thought that it was a risky move because it's not within their quirky recipe of movie-making. But I was wrong, because Joel and Ethan Coen did an admirable job in incorporating a straight-arrow narrative approach to their \"True Grit\" that differed in style from their past films; not that there is anything wrong with their past films, these brothers from the same mother definitely know how to saddle up a good movie. John Wayne played Cogburn in the 1969 original, which is resurrected in a sound but overrated performance in the Coens' version by Jeff Bridges. Before you gun me down for criticizing the thespian master Bridges, let me just hit on some bullet points why Jeff's starring performance as Rooster Cogburn was not as good as many think it is. \u0095 It did have a certain amount of authentic enigma on the pathos of the Rooster character on what led him to run whiskeys dry every day, but I think his drinking ways left with him with a speech impediment because half the time Bridges' Rooster sounded like Karl Childers of \"Sling Blade\". MMM! HMM! \u0095 I am not trying to state this like an acting standoff between The Duke vs. The Dude, but I think the Duke played Cogburn with more of a respectful tone to the character than The Dude. \u0095 Hey, I am one of Jeff Bridges' biggest fans, but I think he was a bit too one-dimensional in his Rooster show here. \u0095 My last bullet states \"what do I know?\" Why? Because Bridges will most probably be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for his performance in \"True Grit\". Now, I do give my full support to the impressive supporting performances of \"True Grit\". Matt Damon proves yet again that he has acting depth with his charismatic performance as LaBouef (pronounced La Beef), the Texas Ranger who is also in a quest to capture the outlaw Tom Chaney. I have no beef with Damon's work here which ranged from comedic to heroic in authentic fashion. But the grittiest performance of \"True Grit\" comes in the form of newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. She stood her ground acting opposite the likes of Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. This Seinfeld, I mean Steinfeld, is not about nothing! She will blow you away with her screen presence and the vivid dynamics she brought to the Mattie character within her determination, brilliance, and focus. Forget campaigning her for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, try Best Actress! She is in every darn scene of the movie, Hello!!! I will give Brolin some credit for his showy performance as the ruthless Chaney, but I fall preference to the other outlaw in \"True Grit\", that would be the Lucky Ned Pepper played with sure magnetism by who else but Barry Pepper. Ned is a Pepper, Barry is a Pepper, wouldn't you like to act like a Pepper too! Barry Pepper has been one of the most underrated actors for years, and hopefully his luck will change and be more recognized for his consistent acting efforts. We are talking about a Coen movie, so with it there is always stunning cinematography in the hands of the camera maestro Roger Deakins. And here is no different, did you Roger that? The Duke of Deakins shines again with his scenic cinematography to another Coens' pic. The Coens screenplay contribution to \"True Grit\" was a treat, even though I could not hear half of the words that Bridges' Rooster was rambling about. I preferred how the Cones directed this \"True Grit\" tale by paying homage to the original novel and on how it perpetuated its tribute to the western genre. \"True Grit\" gets my true recommendation, and I am sure I will enjoy it more in its second viewing; Hopefully, this time with subtitles so I can fully understand those Rooster verbal calls. **** Good",

This film relies heavily on a pronounced dichotomy between fast-paced banter and typical \"Hollywood\" resolutions; there seems to be a nice story build-up to a place of despair, in which they realize the trail has gone cold and the spectator can feel the emptiness in any further pursuits. After this the movie spirals into a formulaic approach to story-telling; there seems to be a time constraint in which they need to crank out the remaining details listed in the script. The bad guy is miraculously found, the little girl avenges her father after being saved at the last second (more than once) by the deus ex machina of screenwriters (blatantly spitting in the face of real life, which has no such piety.. human life is ballast at most, but essentially useless)... I find it hard to believe that anyone who has some degree of familiarity with cinema still finds relief in having the hero come through virtually unscathed (her losing her arm doesn't change the direction of this diatribe). It's sad... I had high hopes for the performance of Jeff Bridges, but he wasn't able to provide enough contrast to the role to be convincing. We'll see what the directors come up with next, but this one did not deliver.",

            "content": "The first movie of 2011 I decided to see was True Grit, Joel and Ethan Coen's take on the novel by Charles Portis.Set in the 1800's, the film centers on headstrong 14 year old Mattie Ross (Played terrifically by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld), a girl who seeks the help of a ruthless, alcoholic, and old-fashioned U.S. Marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Played by Jeff Bridges), so that she may find, and bring to justice Tom Chaney, a man who shot, and killed her father in cold blood. Joining their group is a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Played by Matt Damon), who also wants to see Chaney hanged for a previous murder, rather than Mattie's father's.To be honest, the film feels less like a film by the Coens than most of their other movies, but a decision like that is for the better, as the film channels the classic westerns of Hollywood, ranging from the spaghetti westerns of Leone, to the other great western of the Coens, No Country for Old Men. But the film is not entirely without their personal stamp. As you'd expect, it's neatly structured, evenly paced, thoughtfully worded, and also so funny. For instance, Tom Chaney is built up to be such a rough and evil man, but upon his introduction, he comes off as somewhat comical.The cast is also impressive, specifically that of Steinfeld, who gives a natural performance balanced out by her sharp wit, and emotional timing. Pardon the clich\u00e9, but a star is born. Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon are also fun to watch in their respective roles of Cogburn and LaBoeuf, while Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper make great use of their relatively small roles.The film is also beautiful, sporting an involving sound mix, impressive production and costume design by Jess Gonchor and Mary Zophres, and especially great cinematography by the man, the legend, Roger Deakins.***1/2 out of ****",

Bridges had to be equally questioned to take on the role that is already considered a pinnacle of a legend, John Wayne. All mentioned, somehow, some way, pull it off.Everything from the pitch perfect casting, to the cinematography and score, the Cohen's \"True Grit\" is a worthy member of the Western genre family.Bridges take on the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn shows no signs of mimicking John Wayne's portrait of the character. Rather, Bridges puts his own spin on the character and like Wayne, delivers a wonderful performance. Matt Damon's LeBeouf, is fun to watch. Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld gives a wonderful screen debut, which no doubt will earn her several awards nods.The story is simple; young girl hires a down and out marshal to help her exact revenge upon the man who killed her father. Those unfamiliar with the original should enjoy this solely on its own merit. Those that are familiar with and love the original, your memories will not be trampled upon. This is merely another telling, one that doesn't try at any moment to wink at the audience of the first, rather, tries to present the book, which it is based on, the best way it can.There really isn't much more detail that I can provide that others haven't already provided.

The good guys are really good, the bad guys are really bad, the plot proceeds in a brisk, linear progression towards a climax and denouement that leave no ambiguities and no untied strings. Problems are solved through heavy-handed applications of well-practiced, righteous violence, and no one questions that. Unlike in several recent high-profile films, no one is imagining anything, and nothing that happens is the result of a hallucination induced by schizophrenia or the secret program of totalitarian powers. There is no irony.Hailee Steinfeld is excellent as 14-year-old Mattie Ross, an intelligent and well-brought-up girl determined to avenge her father's death. I'd like to see her as Antigone. Steinfeld's performance has gotten a lot of buzz, and the buzz is earned. You just say a little prayer that she never descends to the Lindsay Lohan circle of teen-girl-star hell. It's a breath of fresh air to see a mainstream American film treat a teenage girl with respect.Matt Damon is very good as a Texas Ranger, funny, kinky, and heroic. I have to admit that Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn did not sweep me off my feet. He's good, but not as impressive as Damon and Steinfeld. Barry Pepper is excellent in a very small role as Lucky Ned Pepper, an outlaw. The movie really, really should have made more use of him.The script is highly literate. Characters speak in carefully-wrought, full sentences, using excellent vocabulary and expressing complex ideas. I loved this feature of the film. I was on the edge of my seat, not wanting to miss a word. It was very refreshing to listen to a script that doesn't cater to the stupidest and laziest mind in the theater, and that doesn't much care if those minds can't keep up.\"True Grit\" isn't in the first rank of classic Westerns. It isn't \"The Searchers.\" It lacks the depth of that film. But while it's on screen, it's a heck of a good time.Coen Brothers' hardcore fans will no doubt conclude that their boys are getting soft and selling out. Coen Brothers' fans love to read deeply into every choice the brothers make, and see irony around every hairstyle, every kiss. \"True Grit\" isn't that kind of movie. It's not an empty mind puzzle; it's not a niche movie; it's made to please crowds. In that, it is one of the most daring movies the Coen Brothers have made.

            "content": "Full disclosure: I have neither watched the original film starring John Wayne nor read the Charles Portis novel on which it is based. Still, the Coen Bros. adaptation is a strong film in its own right and is filled with their trademark humor, has an outstanding score and soundtrack, and of course as excellent performances across the board. TRUE GRIT tells the story of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), whose father is gunned down by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). In order to catch Chaney and bring him to justice, she enlists the aid of US Marshal Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who possesses \"true grit.\" There is also a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) who tags along with them and serves as competition for the reward money. One thing I expect when I watch a Coen Bros. film is a story in which people start out with good intentions, but through error or misfortune see their plans undone. With TRUE GRIT, they seem to have dialed back the noir a little bit and gone with a more straightforward story, albeit with some meandering. If there's one element aside from the performances that really stands out, it's how well written the characters and dialogue are. So even though the plot does stall a little bit at times, I never really minded because the characters were so interesting. It also helped that the film is quite funny, with Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld some often hilarious barbs at each others' expense. As far as performance goes, Jeff Bridges does a good job as usual as the cantankerous Rooster Cogburn, but to be honest he could have played this role in his sleep. The real standout of the cast is Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, who imbues her character with just the right amount of spunk and vulnerability. She also knows her way around the legal system, which comes to her advantage a lot. Also worthy of mention is the score/soundtrack. Generally speaking, all of the scores and soundtracks for Coen Bros. films are excellent, and TRUE GRIT is no exception. One recurring bit that I liked was a piano version of the gospel song, \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.\" Lastly, Roger Deakins' cinematography was beautiful and did a wonderful job of showcasing the Western landscape in which the film takes place. My only gripe is that once the film arrives to the third act, it prolongs it a little more than I would have liked. There is also an epilogue which didn't necessarily have to be there, although it did make some sense to have a look at Mattie grown up since she narrates at the beginning. Overall, TRUE GRIT is an excellent film that lives up to what the Coen Bros. have done before. It's not quite their best ever, but its definitely the best thing they've done in the past decade.",

That can only be a good thing, allowing a wider audience to experience their gift for storytelling.The brothers here remake or re-imagine the classic western \"True Grit\", made famous by the iconic presence of John Wayne.Each movie must be judged on it's merits so lets leave 1969 in the past.1880, the father of fourteen year old Mattie Ross (Steinfield) is callously killed by \"no good\" Tom Chaney (Coen regular Josh Brolin). Mattie hires local reprobate Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), to hunt down Chaney to avenge her father. Shot down or hung, it makes little difference to the no nonsense Mattie.Steinfield is a revelation as Mattie, tough speaking \"with no varnish on her words\", her deconstruction of a local trader during their negotiations is a joy to watch. Sensitive, vulnerable and yet tough as old boots, the film simply would not work without her.The cantankerous Cogburn, along with his beloved whisky, reluctantly takes Mattie on the trail, where she proves her worth. The pair joining forces with Texas ranger La Beouf (Damon), in the hunt for the missing fugitive.This is a down and dirty western, attempting to portray the way of life in a more honest way. It's rough, messy and life is cheap. No one helps anyone if there's no money in it. The one exception to realism is a prevalence of \"Hollywood teeth\", which does juxtapose with the realistic array of \"tombstone teeth\", the splendid character \"Lucky Ned\" (Barry Pepper) possesses.Characters speak slowly and in a roundabout poetic fashion, an approximation of a time when everything took, just that bit longer. Justice was enforced sporadically and generally to settle petty personal scores rather than founded on any legal direction, despite the presence of courtroom scenes.Bridges gets to act drunk in his underwear again, following his Oscar winning turn in \"Crazy Heart\", it will be good to have him back sober next time. Again, whilst very effective, he does appear as a larger than life version of the Jeff Bridges we know and may not bring him another award this Oscar season.The normally ultra urbane Damon, despite initial misgivings, looks and acts the part helped by his character being effectively a fish out of water, far from his usual Texas hunting ground.\"We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County\", as Mattie points out upon their first meeting. The subsequent screen chemistry between the three is enjoyable to watch.Rooster, emotionally thawing visibly throughout the film, also get some good lines which are delivered to perfection.\"Ground's too hard. Them men wanted a decent burial, they should have got themselves killed in summer. \" The film is simple enough tale, good bad and the grey that exists between the two. Everyone struggles and people die violently, with little ceremony, as was the case at the time. There is little mysticism or being at one with nature, just a desire to survive in inhospitable surroundings. Mostly doing right by others if you can, but if inconvenient, well what's a man to do.This is not a showy film, there is no mysticism or characters being at one with their surroundings, see \"Dances with Wolves\". However, the film is directed with an assured hand and most importantly does not take itself too seriously, a liberal sprinkling of humour keeps the linear story moving along and picks up pace nicely towards the end.It is good to see the brothers have not completely left the slightly surreal, we have a character dressed head to foot as a bear, buying a dead body, \"for two dental mirrors and a bottle of expectorant\", pure Coen.Summary Not as iconic as \"Unforgiven\" by which all such films need to be judged but well acted and displaying enough humour to pull the story through.Recommended for all western fans and a solid slice of entertainment for those new to the genre, this is a great place to start.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The entire cast from Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld to Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper is amazing. However, the most outstanding ones are Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld.-------- Directing is, as it usually is in The Coen Brothers movies, great! But what's even better is cinematography. Cinematography is simply brilliant and an Oscar for it would not come as a surprise. Neither would it be surprising for Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, The Coens and even Matt Damon and possibly, but not likely, Barry Pepper. He is excellent but his screen time is very limited for an Oscar nom. However, Jeff and Hailee, both deserve a statue. They were just brilliant! He was brilliant as this tough, old, sickened by life Marshall an she was great as this mature young girl highly dedicated in avenging her father. The two of them really did an amazing job!-------- What i thought was a big mistake is the music. It's great but highly overused. There should have been less of it. Certain scenes were just not meant to have a musical background and they did. I was also very disappointed that they didn't use Johnny Cash's God's Gonna Cut You Down as they did in the trailer. I thought it was great for the movie! -------- As for the movie it self, it's highly entertaining and way better than the original. Speaking of the original, The Dude is way better than The Duke was. The only thing that the 2010 True Grit lacks is the same thing that the 1969 True Grit lacked, speactacularity - so to say.-------- And one more thing to mention, i was very surprised it wasn't rated R. I liked the fact that it had some blood and violence in it, but i really don't know how the R rating missed it. It's not very violent but enough to get an R on American standards.-------- All in all, it's very entertaining and definitely one of the best movies of 2010. I wasn't completely blown away but i was well satisfied to say at least!!!",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers return with True Grit, their 4th consecutive film (starting from No Country from Old Men in 2007). Shot only earlier this year, the film contemplates the Southern plains following a feisty heroine Mattie along with the unscrupulous Rooster Cogburn and sidekick LaBoeuf. Along for the ride is vicious Ned Pepper and the dull Tom Chaney.As the Coen brothers stated numerous times, True Grit is meant to be a more earnest adaptation of the source novel by Charles Portis. This is clearly presented in the film with its sometimes unintelligible dialogue and classic tropes. Unlike their darker No Country for Old Men, the film takes on a more unsophisticated tone. Mattie is clearly the hero and Chaney and Ned clearly the antagonists. Rooster's drunken stupor leads to comic effect, as does his verbal sparring with the self-righteous LaBoeuf.What helps the Coens realize this goal so well is the support they garner by their more than capable cast. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld are completely embrace their parts. And in this process of complete immersion in language and mannerisms, they all turn in remarkable performances. Bridges and Steinfeld are likely to receive Oscar nominations (the latter, unfortunately, in Supporting Actress) but the cast on the whole roundly performs. Damon in particular continues to show off impressive ability after his likewise humorous turn in The Informant!.From a behind-the-scenes perspective, the Coen Bros. also rely on their trusty team. Roger Deakins proved his ability to master the Western landscape with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and here proves once again his fateful eye. The compositions all feel completely appropriate. Sometimes Deakins channels the starry nights of The Night of the Hunter (also referenced through the older Mattie's narration in beginning and end) and like that earlier work, the film is visually entrancing. Carter Burwell also provides a solid score, frequently using \"Leaning on Jesus\" (also a nod to Night of the Hunter). And the Coen Bros., using their alias, masterly cut the work together so that it builds along nicely. Violence often erupts in True Grit with the filmmakers preferring to use the point-of-view of the characters rather than cutting to the potential victims.If one can knock True Grit for anything, it's that the film sometimes feels longer than it needs to be. The epilogue, in particular, feels less necessary than it does tacky. But the Coens faithfulness to the source novel may have been a part of this, as well as their desire to tell a complete story. Along with a PG-13 rating, this is probably the most market friendly Coen Bros. film in quite a while but it still works due to their unquestionable talent.To summarize, True Grit is a satisfying Western. It does not aim to subvert the genre like No Country for Old Men, but rather to please. And thanks to its solid performances and technical craft, True Grit succeeds.",

            "content": "Wholesome family entertainment from the Coen brothers; I never thought I'd see the day. And yet the minds that brought you Fargo and The Big Lebowski have taken it upon themselves to remake the much-loved family western. And they've done a hell of a job, making it grittier while still being true to the original. It's not much like their previous offerings, except, as others have noted, in quality.The story is still the same as before, with a bit of minor tweaking. Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) hires US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to track down Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father. Together with a boastful Texas Ranger, they set off into the Indian country in pursuit.The few changes made to the script are well thought out, serving to tighten up the establishing scenes and increase the tension at the end. This version is also grittier, both in its visual style and with the handling of violence. It's still a family though. There's no language or sexual content, and the violence shouldn't be too much for anyone in middle school or higher. I also approve of the Biblical overtones. There is much quoting of scripture, and the most heard song on the soundtrack is 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arm.'The cast has done excellent work here. Steinfeld is incredibly spunky, strong willed, and precocious. She can argue points of law and negotiate deals like a pro, but she's still a child deep down, as her optimism and skill a pouting can attest. And when she tries to involve the two lawmen in a round of spooky campfire stories, it's simply hilarious. I expect her to get an Oscars nodBridges is also brilliant as Cogburn. It's hard to draw a comparison between him and John Wayne, but he embodies the drunken, worn out aspects of the character in a way that Wayne never did. He's also quite funny. When drunk he's the spitting image of The Dude. But he's no buffoon. When sober, he can shoot. And he is absolutely pitiless to his enemies. On second thought, maybe he is better for the role than Wayne was.The Coens have really done a bang up job here. They've brought back the classic western, and in the process shown a whole new side of themselves. Their version of True Grit is wildly entertaining and perfect for filmgoers of all ages. I would have no difficulty calling this the best western of the last decade.",

            "content": "How do you remake a classic, very iconic later day John Wayne film. If you are the Coen brothers you don't remake a film, but start with the Charles Portis novel from whence it was all begot. This is the key and with the Coen brother's remarkable talents they have succeeded. The Coen brother's \"True Grit\" stands both alone and as an even truer adaption of the novel. So, even though the original 1969 movie will forever be the John Wayne True Grit, this movie stands as a great adaptation of what a writer penned.There is a synergism at work here and it is simply in the richness of detail which is quite amazing. Westerns are like hen's teeth as far as big-budget movies go. If there is one made that will stand the test of time it had better get most of the ingredients right or risk being an embarrassment. The movie here does get, practically, everything right by starting with the book and staying absolutely true to the period. As expected with any of the Coen brothers films there is great attention to dialog. Immense care is exhibited by both the writers and the actors to bring a rich period perfect dialog. It makes one pay attention as it envelopes the viewer into a time past. The sets, as well as outdoor vistas, are amazing in both detailed accuracy and visual presentation. This further surrounds and plunges one into a period with little similarity to the world we now live in. What hasn't changed is humanity, and bringing that all important part to the story is the amazing performances of Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld who is unperturbed in her mission to bring her father's murderer to justice. Steinfeld is up against one of, if not the finest, performance of Jeff Bridge's selectively illustrious career; she is simply a scene stealer over and over, yet in all of her other-worldly inspired acting she never manages to eclipse the master Bridges. This is my highest compliment to both. The nuance displayed by Bridges in bringing the facets of Cogburn to life resonate against the bold brassiness of vision so effectively portrayed by Steinfeld. Such richness by the juxtaposition of old and young has never appeared in celluloid with more urgency. Throw in an utterly fantastic turn by Matt Damon in his portrayal of Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (aptly pronounced as LaBeef for the film) and you get a tour de force of three principals bringing an admittedly great western novel to life in which it doesn't pale in comparison to the author's work.So, if you are a fan of westerns see this movie. Do not make the mistake of any comparison with the first filmed version, but take it on its own. If you do chances are you will be highly entertained with the sum total of amazing attention to detail and vision in bringing the Portis novel to life. A very solid 8 is in no way pandering because this rare western deserves your attention.",

John Wayne may have been The Duke, but Jeff Bridges was The Dude, and the latter helped define a generation of slacker tourists swept along by the inexplicable happenings of everyday life. Go figure that the Coens, never content to settle into a niche of predictability, follow up \"No Country for Old Men\" (itself a subversive, postmodern take on Western genre mythos and archetypes) and \"Burn After Reading\" (a subversive bit of political-thriller tomfoolery) with a faithful literary adaptation that pits elegant, picturesque settings against raw and shocking violence (the film pushes the boundaries of its PG-13 rating); moments of grace and earnest emotion against sometimes gut-busting humor; and a sense of redemption and maturity against a world where many grown men are still playing a game of \"cowboys and Indians,\" albeit with greater consequences. The Coens have long since proved themselves as two of our finest, most reliable filmmakers, and \"True Grit\" serves as both an all-encompassing collection of their idiosyncrasies and a story told using the greatest extent of cinematic language (the lush imagery, the grizzled characters, the somber score, the down-to-earth humor) to pull the viewer into a world at least a century removed from where we sit today. The performances are uniformly fantastic (with Hailee Steinfeld gamely straddling the line between potentially precocious brat and mature, intelligent girl). The direction is confident without being pretentious. And the story ebbs and flows with all the consistency of great literature. It may be a redundant sentiment at this point, but \"True Grit\" could be the Coens' masterpiece (though I feel they're not through with us by a long shot).",

            "review_title": "The Coens deliver a terrific western that's surprisingly traditional",
            "content": "The Coen Brothers continue to impress and deliver another film that highlights their versatility as filmmakers. They've made thrillers, comedies, gangster pictures, musicals, dramas, and now a western. There's been a number of interesting westerns over the past 20 years, but they're all typically revisionist westerns, where the genre has been subverted (i.e. \"The Revenant\" \"The Proposition\" \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" \"Bond Tomohawk\" \"Django Unchained\" \"The Hateful Eight\" etc.) and have not embraced the more durable tropes and archetypes of the genre. \"Appaloosa\" and \"Open Range\" are the only westerns of the last 20 years I can recall that were of the classic mold and were any quality (all western fans should go out and watch these films immediately if you haven't). The original \"True Grit\" is a classic in the sense that it was a popular film with a memorable performance by John Wayne as the colorful one-eyed lawman Rooster Cogburn, but it's a far cry from being a masterpiece along the lines of the best westerns by Ford, Hawks, or Peckinpah. This was smart on the part of the Coens to take a well known story and character and put their own spin on it. It's harder to remake a masterpiece than it is to remake something mediocre (i.e. remaking \"The Fly\" versus remaking \"Poltergeist\"). As quirky of filmmakers as the Coens are, they have crafted a surprisingly straightforward western, though filled with rich characterizations and a balance of elegance and grittiness. In this retelling Jeff Bridges takes on the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn and Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross, a young girl who enlists the help of the gruff marshall to find her father's murderer. The Coens are often credited with their visual panache, but they don't get enough respect for their writing. Take this exchange early in the film when Maddie is looking for a marshall to help bring in the man who killer her father:MATTIE: Who's the best marshal?SHERIFF: Hmm, I'd have to think on that. Bill Waters is the best tracker. He's part Comanche; it is a pure joy to watch him cut for sign. The meanest is Rooster Cogburn; a pitiless man, double tough. Fear don't enter into his thinking. I'd have to say the fairest is L.T. Quinn; he always brings in his prisoners alive. Now, he might let one slip by evrey now and then, but...MATTIE Ross: Where would I find this Rooster?That exchange perfectly sets up up both Maddie's intentions of what she wants the end result of her manhunt to be and it also informs the audience about the character of Cogburn, even before the audience has met him. As with the original film, the story is mainly a character piece focused on the dynamic between the determined and quite proper Maddie and the gruff jaded Cogburn. Bridges chews the scenery as Cogburn in a way that he hasn't in a film for years. And in the Coen's introduction of the character, Bridges makes the most of their dialogue in a courtroom scene where he describes his bringing a group criminals to justice under cross examination:\nCOGBURN: I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy, Aaron Wharton, down there on the creek bank with some hogs. They'd killed a shoat and was butchering it. They'd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water.MR. BARLOW: What did you do?COGBURN: Crept down. I announced that we was U.S. marshals and hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys. He picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.MR. BARLOW: What did you do then?COGBURN: Backed away trying to talk some sense into him. But C.C. edges over by the wash pot behind that steam and picks up a shotgun. Potter seen him but it was too late. C.C. Wharton pulled down on Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me with the other. I shot him and when the old man swung the axe I shot him. Odus lit out and I shot him. Aaron Wharton and C.C. Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but Odus was just winged.The Coen's tapped into folksy dialogue in a number of films, but in \"True Grit,\" wether this is authentic language or not, this old west dialogue sounds great and is some of the best I've heard since \"Will Penny\" or Peckinpah. This dialogue also tells us that Cogburn may be a fat old man, but he's also a force to be reckoned with who's quick to violence. Maddie and Cogburn make quite an odd couple on the trail and are also joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, pronounced Le Beef, played to the hilt by by an erudite Matt Damon, who is a perfect foil to the gruff Cogburn. LaBoeuf's know-it-all attitude is also hilariously challenged by the self confident young Maddie. Cogburn's take on the trio is:COGBURN: \"I'm a foolish old man who's been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpie in trousers and a nincompoop.\"The Coen's follow the original film's story for the most part, but they bring a richness to the characters and a gritty elegance to their representation of the old west that was missing from the Wayne version. In a time when the traditional western story has become pass\u00e9, the Coens have managed to make it relevant and accessible again for modern audiences.",

            "review_title": "Adventure In The Old West.",
            "content": "The novel is a whiz-bang action comedy and sometimes is funny as hell. Matty Ross, the book's fourteen-year-old narrator, is a pinch-penny, opinionated, preachy instigator who doesn't suffer fools gladly -- or at all, if they can be avoided. What gives the novel its comic flavor is that, like Voltaire's Candide, she is a naive observer. She's a tough little horse trader but she proposes to Rooster Cogburn, the Marshall she's hired to capture her father's murderer, that they hit the killer on the head with sticks and capture him. This is the Wild West we're talking about -- 1873 in Arkansas and Oklahoma.The first adaptation was released in 1969. It was relatively faithful to the novel and starred John Wayne in one of his two best roles, the other being Captain Brittles in \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon.\" It was a sunny movie, shot amid the glorious gold and bright yellow of Colorado's aspens in the Fall. The musical score was heroic, chipper, and programmatic. If Wayne became drunk, so did the music.Wayne won an Oscar for his performance. These awards don't mean much but he deserved critical praise for genuinely getting into his decrepit and debauched character. He never did it again, reverting instead to his Mainstream John Wayneness, maybe in search of lost totemic adulation.Too bad for this later version that Wayne was so good in the first and that the mood was so up beat. The Coen brothers are among the most original writers and directors working today, but this film can't help being compared to the headlong and happy-go-lucky original directed by the thoroughly unimaginative Henry Hathaway.Here, the atmosphere is dampened. It begins with the score. Instead of the tuneful and triumphant theme of the original -- melodic enough to be warbled by co-star Glen Campbell -- we have variations on an earnest and somber religious hymn. That's true to Matty's character but the point of the story is to allow us to see dastardly and hilarious goings on through her eyes while perceiving what she doesn't, not to adopt her temper literally. The atmosphere isn't helped by all the night shooting or the stark and colorless landscape.Wayne's earlier exuberance works against Jeff Bridge's interpretation of Rooster Cogburn too. Wayne didn't bother to adopt a regional accent. He didn't have to. His aging croak told us all we needed to know. Bridges, on the other hand, uses this mangled hillbilly drawl that's so thick it's hard to understand what he's saying. And he's so slow and and solemn that it's hard to tell when he's drunk and when he's sober. With Wayne, there was little room for doubt. Hailie Steinfeld as Mattie is adequate and Matt Damon as their Texas Ranger sidekick has little to do.The original story has been tampered with quite a bit. That's not necessarily bad. The novel wasn't a charter document like the Koran or the United States Constitution. And, in fact, the additional dialog follows Charles Portis's style rather closely. Yet, the way the narrative has been rearranged, something is lost. It's the sense of community in the novel and in the 1969 film. Everybody knows everybody else in the earlier stories, or at least knows OF everybody else. The visit to McCallister's store in the Indian Territory, carries with it the affection of old friends meeting and kidding around. The Coen's movie is about three friendless strangers wandering through an inhospitable wilderness. On the other hand, maybe that's what the Coens were aiming for. If so, they got it.It's not a bad movie but it's different from both the novel and the 1969 version. And it's darker and a little less fun. Cogburn's life history emerges in fragments. It's hilarious but you can't tell from the off-hand way it's mumbled by Bridges. It would have been nice if someone had laughed or even smiled, but hardly anyone does. The Coen brothers have done some splendid commercial work before, as well as some truly challenging stuff. They've produced a couple of clunkers too. This comes somewhere in between the clunkers and the fireworks.",

Westerns usually don't get my drift, and they usually use repetitive actions to win me over. True Grit was especially this, but more. P.S: I did not see the original, so don't expect comparisons...The acting was extraordinary. Jeff Bridges did a wonderful job with his drunken character, and he carried the film. Matt Damon did a wonderful job as well, but his character was absent half the film so I wouldn't say so much. But the real thing was Hailee Steinfield, the young actress in the film. What saddens me is that she wasn't even marketed as one of the main characters, but she carried the film as with and alongside Jeff Bridges. She isn't even on the main cover of the film, or even advertised as the main actress. I know, Hollywood would love some money, but taking her out is pretty selfish. You see her on screen the entire time, and she did a wonderful job...The main thing that surprised me was the dialogue. To better define it, True Grit is like a western directed by Quentin Tarantino. It's full of wit and charm, and this is the film's strong point in my opinion. Seriously, Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfield's dialogue exchanges alone are worth the admission, and your never going to get tired of it...Now I've only seen two films by the Cohen Brothers (this and No Country for Old Men) and they are extraordinary movie-makers. Surprisingly, they are different in their owns ways as well. No Country for Old Men is a cat and mouse game full of suspense and grittiness. True Grit is a witty adventure full of dialogue-driven action. I recommend the film thousands of times, and I'm surprised of how much I enjoyed it. Although I'm not a fan of westerns, and most of time not even enjoying them, the Cohen brothers made a near cinematic masterpiece. If you enjoy westerns, this might as well be thousands times better than I liked it.9/10.",

            "review_title": "True Grit: Recreating a \"Duke\" classic is sometimes hard to do.",
            "content": "True GritDirected and adapted for the screen by Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men, Fargo) \"True Grit\" serves as a good attempt at a somewhat dead genre (i.e. westerns). Starring Jeff Bridges (Tron, The Big Lebowski) as the alcoholic U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn, Matt Damon (Hereafter, The Departed) as a narcissistic Texas Ranger LaBoeuf and, in one of the best leading lady performances of the year, newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross (who in this reviewer's opinion, steals the show). The characters of \"True Grit\" and its story are under the label of iconic, so for the Coen brothers to attempt to recreate this film without upsetting its cult fan base is nothing short of \"ballsy\". In the end, this Coen version is not better than the original which earned John \"The Duke\" Wayne an academy award, but it is still a very well made western on its own.In this retelling, the audience once again follows the young and very sharp-witted 14 year old Mattie Ross, as she searches for a \"lawman\" for hire to avenge her father's murder. If you don't know the story already: Mattie Ross finds her \"lawman\" in a lush yet lively U.S. Marshall named Rooster Cogburn and a big headed, know-it-all Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf. As the three track the whereabouts of her father's killer, their total polar opposite personalities clash creating Coen-esque comedy (definition: dark and violent laughs). The one glaring difference between this version and the 1969 version is that this version uses Mattie Ross as the main narrator/character rather than Rooster. To the disappointment of many fans this doesn't work as well as it could have.As with a lot of movies this month, \"True Grit\" is filled with good performances (and one great performance from Steinfeld). It is a wonder why this film did not receive a single Golden Globe nomination. In true Coen brothers fashion, this movie takes a realistic look at a time period (post civil war in this case) and uses a simplistic storyline to make the audience focus not on the storyline but the characters; all while using their own bit of dark humor to move to story along. Even though this version was not better than the original, I would say this: If this where a true story, one could say that the Coen version was more historically accurate than the original. That is to say, this version is more in line with the Charles Portis novel (and that may be its downfall, for it plays out particularly slowly like a novel).But enough with the story, let's talk about this young actress Hailee Steinfeld, who by now everyone has or should have heard about. One would think that with a cast filled with such heavy hitters (Damon, Bridges) any newcomer would be glossed over by audiences. I mean, Bridges take on Rooster is inspired and Damon is a huge step up from Glen Campbell's portrayal of LaBoeuf, but Steinfeld out acts every other actor on screen. Did you hear me? EVERY ACTOR ON THE SCREEN! With the witty, linguistic command of an actress three times her age, Stienfeld will blow audiences (many who came to see Bridges and Damon) away with her performance of Mattie Ross. Her performance is simply hypnotizing. And even though much of her witty lines are due to the great screenplay by the Coen brothers, she certainly lets her acting prowess be known to every audience member in the theater. In short: Get this girl an award and do it quick! Final Thought: For some this version will not be as \"cool\" as the trailers depict it to be and the ending may be to low key for many who though this was going to be a bloody shoot em' up western (its not), but when the Academy Awards come around, mark my word, \"True Grit\" will not be snubbed as they were with the Golden Globes (That doesn't mean it will win much of anything, but it will be nominated). \"True Grit\" is a film worth seeing, but with reservations (the anticlimactic ending is what I am talking about). Clearly not the best Coen brothers work, but still worth checking out if you are a fan of the western genre or what to see what all of that Hailee Steinfeld hype was about.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Their movies have always, always been about showing the invisible, on film, with a keen moral sensibility.What they've done with _True Grit_ is wed this ongoing pursuit of refining that particular artistry with the crafting of a western. And the snake bites its tail: In the final analysis, their \"postmodern\" chops enable them to produce a pitch-perfect period western.The norm for modern \"remakes\" is that producers no doubt feel that they can't lose on a remake if only for the fact that they'll draw in the curious and nostalgic. Here, the Coens transcend this safe dodge. _True Grit_ shows that updated aesthetic sensibilities can be brought to bear to tell a classic tale with more warmth, intelligence, skill, artistry and feeling than the original.This is not to imply that the 1969 original is outdated, or even flawed. It's just that the time was ripe to tell it again, better. And the Coens & Co. were the ones to do it.I cried at the penultimate sequence, and flushed with warmth at the ending.

Reluctantly the one-eyed lawman takes Mattie in tow and heads into Indian Territory(later to become Oklahoma)in search of Chaney. Along the way they are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf(Matt Damon), who is also in search of the ruthless gunman on other charges. Cogburn will be allowed to prove his highly touted abilities as well show his self fortitude and \"true grit\". Bridges is outstanding, but Ms. Steinfeld is the show stealer.

            "review_title": "Not quite a masterpiece, but the Coens are on fine form here",
            "content": "Normally you expect a remake to be of something a bit more notable, so this is an odd choice, but the Coen Brothers are odd, so it should not be that big a surprise. Mattie Ross wants the hired hand, Tom Chaney, who killed her father, caught and hanged for the crime. She hunts down US Marshall Rooster Codburn who, under much duress, agrees to the job, aiming to bring the man in dead or alive. In the first act of the film a sheriff joins him, as he is on the hunt for the band of men Chaney has fallen in with. Mattie ambushes them, and the rest of the film charts the chase.I am a Coen fan, I understood Hailee Steinfield's performance was fantastic, and I am a huge Jeff Bridges fan, so safe to say I was excited about this film for various reasons; I was looking forward to the guys getting back with \"The Dude\" and recreating the Western. The Coens have not referred to the 1969 movie, but rather to the original text for inspiration, to the extent that those working on the film who had not seen the rather \"gung-ho\" original were not allowed to. The result is a film that is not so much a remake, but a reworking of the book as they see it. This version feels more literary than the original probably ever did, in that you sense the book's weight, its use of metaphor really put on the screen directly. The enjoyment of this film is derived very much from the characters' exchanges, their relationship with one another, how they view each other, and how that shifts; the story itself ends up taking a back seat to the characters' dialogue and how they are actually relating to each other. \"True Grit\" is a performance piece, and so it is fair to say it relies very much on the actors.There was always going to be comparison between Bridges and Wayne, and I think it is a silly comparison; John Wayne was not a good actor, but despite that, you have two actors from different eras of cinema, Wayne doing what he always did, and Bridges giving the real, studied performance. Which Rooster one prefers is ultimately a matter of taste, but as to which is the better performance? There is no contest; Bridges plays Rooster as far away from Wayne as he can, to the extent of wearing the patch on his other eye. There has been some talk of Bridges being, at times, pretty incomprehensible, and it is an interesting point. We expect any actor, stage or screen, to deliver lines clearly, and there is no doubt that Bridges is superb; I believe the Coens wanted him to play Rooster as this disgruntled, miserable bastard, and for you to really have to listen to catch what he's saying. There is a lot of heavy, fast dialogue to this story, so you are expected to be paying attention anyway. I can sincerely say I had no issue with understanding anything Bridges was saying, and I really enjoyed the performance which, much like Fenster in \"The Usual Suspects\", is far more about the character than the words anyway.Josh Brolin plays Chaney, and does so with real conviction, defying our expectation of the character, which is built well through the first half of the film. Steinfield gives an outstanding performance, delivering lines and having exchanges with other actors on a level of heavyweights, and managing it perfectly. Despite not winning at the Oscars this year, I do not doubt we will see more of this girl.\"True Grit\" looks amazing, and I am surprised it did not win the cinematography award at the Oscars. The film at times looks like a David Lean one; the sense of place is captured in a strangely gorgeous way, with a real earthy tone and a landscape that really drives home how this is trying to put the atmosphere of the book on the screen.A criticism of the movie has been that it fizzles out rather than going out with a bang, and I would suggest this also is a literary reason. If you are into the Coens' work you are likely to be okay with it. I can understand people not being happy with the ending, but I took from it what I think you are supposed to. I do think \"True Grit\" is a story with the point of misjudgement, and how we can follow the wrong paths for the wrong reasons; if you're with the Coens' vision all the way, you will see this is stated nicely in the final act of the film, and be happy with the final scenes.There was just one scene that I think was supposed to be offbeat funny, and it unfortunately just didn't sit with the rest of the movie for me; it is a scene I would have personally cut. Beyond that I must say I felt strange in the cinema, as though I was in on some joke that only a few people got, because almost every scene had something going on that made me giggle. Do not get me wrong, \"True Grit\" is not a comedy, and when it does serious it does it well, but these guys have a way of working their strange brand of humour into a film without ruining it, and if you are on the same wavelength as them, as has always been the case with their work, you tend to find a lot of things amusing.This film looks great, the performances are terrific, and it is a solid story. Though I am hard pushed to say it is a masterpiece, I recommend it very much to Coen and Western fans alike, and if you're a film fanatic, there is a lot you will take away from it.",

It was the RELATIONSHIPS and CONNECTION between the characters that made the original \"True Grit\" a good film.All of this is lost in the remake. Jeff Bridges mumbles and grunts his lines so that you really cannot understand most of what he is saying. Matt Damon gives an exceptionally wooden performance. And Hallie whats-her-name, gives a very unbelievable performance... she speaks so fast that it's unnatural to see a young women speak that way, and she has very little expression in her performance. Contrast this with Kim Darby's performance in the original film... Darby gives a natural, believable, and emotionally real performance in the original film. No comparison !! The remake also loses it's wonderful musical score, and great theme song, sung by Glenn Campbell.I felt that original film was superior in every way to this hack job by the Coen Brothers.

He earlier disappeared too suddenly from the story after being shown saving Matty from death by snakebite(poorly done...pythons were used, not real rattlesnakes). He deserved a better farewell, as in the original. Thus the ending was no better than weak, and far inferior to the original.Those who saw the original will find the story mostly comparable but still somewhat lacking in details, and will also compare the performances as I did. I found that some roles suffered in this remake. Jeff Bridges as Rooster was fine in his Bad Blake impersonation(or maybe an old Dude?), as was the new Matty Ross, but the only real improvement was Matt Damon replacing the very amateurish Glen Campbell in the original as the Texas Ranger. In the original, Strother Martin was very superior as the horse trader, and Barry Pepper was fine in this version but was outshined by the great Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper in the 1969 original. Others were mostly comparable or interchangeable, including a bland Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney, the killer of Matty's father and the purpose of the manhunt at the core of the story.Beautiful mountain scenery/photography again, but it was inferior to the original filmed in Technicolor, as digital cannot yet match that labor-intensive and very expensive film perfection. All in all a creditable remake, but the original did not need remaking, even by the Coens, as John Wayne was at his career best(yes, he played himself again, but this role enhanced him), as did wonderfully talented Kim Darby as world-class spunky Matty Ross. Good original stories must be in short supply in Hollywood these days, but the real reason for all these remakes of classics is to mine gold a second time, hopefully. Most also fail in quality, but this one did not fail. It was just not quite as good. Why not try to remake The Wizard of Oz, Casablanca or Citizen Kane next? Similar or much worse shortcomings would be the case in any remakes of these classics also.",

The original wasn't bad - I rated it 7/10 - but it was a typical John Wayne movie - good action, but one-dimensional characters and plot.The Coen brothers don't do one-dimensional characters or plot. From the opening scene you already know this is going to be better than the original. Characters have depth, cinematography is lush and beautiful and there is a great \"feel\" - a humanity, emotion and sensitivity - that is a Coen Brothers trademark. In addition there is some very sharp humour - mostly wordplay, but some physical - which makes the 2010 True Grit even more entertaining.The performances are outstanding. Jeff Bridges plays his trademark role - the down-and-out, disheveled has-been - and does it extremely well. He deserved his Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart, and here he outshines even that performance. Will be interesting to see if he gets the Best Actor Oscar.Matt Damon is good in his role. Here is a bit out of his element, as he is usually the lead actor, and plays the hero. Here he is a hero, of sorts, but he is also the butt of many jokes, especially through wordplay battles. Josh Brolin has very little screen time, but is solid as the lead villain.The standout performance, however, must go to Hailee Steinfeld, as Mattie Ross. At only 13 she displays maturity beyond her years, delivering her lines with the timing and naturalness of a veteran. She probably has the most lines in the movie, and has the most difficult lines - most of the wordplay jokes are hers, and her haggling scenes are worth the price of admission alone. Kim Darby played Mattie Ross in the original True Grit, and was 22 at the time. She ended up having a long (though not very illustrious - True Grit was probably the pinnacle) career. Based on True Grit, Hailee Steinfeld is destined for greatness.",

That said because this film received so much critical acclaim I have just watched it on BBC 2 . My opinion ? Let's just say instincts don't tell lies .It is a well made film helped greatly by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins in charge of the photography . It also follows the structure of the original screenplay very closely which won't alienate those who enjoyed seeing the 1969 version on its numerous showings on afternoons round about Christmas time . Indeed Barry Pepper seems to be channeling Robert Duvall to a tee . That said there's not a lot here that will appeal to an audience that have no interest in the Western genre . The pace is rather slow and the Coens seem interested in showing the diversity of the American landscape a little bit too much and the 19th American idiom seems slightly over done .

Josh Brolin plays 'Tom Chaney, the murderer that they have been tasked to pursue. As the story unfolds Mattie Ross slowly wins the respect of the two men she has employed for her cause and comes face to face with her fathers killer.Watch out for the 'Grizzly Bear' character as he crosses paths with Mattie and J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn early on in their journey, a character played with the typical quirkiness of the 'Cohen' brothers.This film reminds me of the earlier 'Cohen Brother' film 'Fargo' and is equally able to entertain and delight the audience.

            "content": "It makes perfect sense for the Coen brothers to direct a period western. They've danced around one for years, with modernist takes on the genre like \"Fargo\" and \"No Country for Old Men,\" while tirelessly exploring the early side of the twentieth century elsewhere in their work. \"True Grit,\" however, is their first giant leap into the past. In fact, outside of a vignette that opens their 2009 film \"A Serious Man,\" the winter of 1878, where \"True Grit\" begins, is a frontier for both the characters and the filmmakers.I'm of the mind that the Coens, who have now impressively released four films in four consecutive years, benefit from occasionally stepping outside their comfort zone. \"True Grit\" is a fascinating experiment in that regard, though in adapting Charles Portis' 1968 novel for the screen (and mindful I'm sure of the John Wayne adaptation to which their film would inevitably be compared), Joel and Ethan Coen contribute less of themselves than might be expected. Granted, the dark humor and caustic irony that run throughout are distinctly Coen brothers additions, but perhaps more so than any of their other films, their latest is a mostly opaque effort.Still, the pair have some interesting notes on the genre, and perhaps what's most remarkable about \"True Grit\" is its characters. Westerns are typically full of cookie-cutter cowboys and predictable protagonists, but the Coens go almost out of their way to avert any and all clich\u00e9. From the brilliant performance of newcomer Hallee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, a fiercely intelligent 14-year old, to Jeff Bridges' stiff, guttural take on Wayne's Oscar-winning role, it's clear the importance the brothers place on character, and the care they take in realizing them.Probably the most immediately recognizable 'Coen-esque' personage is Matt Damon as a flamboyant Texas Ranger too big for his britches. The duo love ironic dichotomy, and from the misguided entitlement Damon provokes as the ludicrously named \"La Boeuf,\" to his silly cowboy getups, ceaseless boasting, and general ineptitude, Damon rounds out a classic Coen archetype.When you strip away the characters, what remains of \"True Grit\" is a fundamental but effective western revenge tale. If the film at all disappoints, it is because the Coens' stories are usually multi-faceted affairs with layer upon layer of nuance. Their most famous works are so busy that the utter simplicity of \"True Grit\" comes as something of a surprise. Taken on its own, however, the film more than holds its own among the many other revivalist westerns released over the past few years.And come to think of it, a tale loaded with heavy themes like vengeance, redemption, and justice doesn't need to be artificially inflated with subplots to support them. In fact, one of the reasons the western genre provides such viscerally satisfying experiences is precisely because it tends to wear its motifs on its sleeve. Part of our fascination with that era too comes from the simplicity it entails.But beyond the mechanisms of its success, the most important triumph of \"True Grit\" is that it delivers on its promise of six-gun badassery with a heart. Jeff Bridges is awesome as a decrepit Rooster Cogburn, and the begrudging respect he develops for Ross gives the gunfights weight. The last fifteen minutes of the film are beautiful and unforgettable.\"True Grit,\" It doesn't rock the boat as much as \"A Serious Man\" or offer the same fascinating level of character complexity as \"Fargo,\" but it is nevertheless an important landmark in the Coen brothers' career. They've conquered yet another frontier, and it's as exciting as ever to imagine which they'll turn to next.",

Opening scene , Mattie Ross the young 14 year old daughter is seeking justice for her murdered father . Her first confrontation is with a man she feels owes her $300 . That was perhaps the her best scene throughout the movie . Unfortunately, that's when I detected something was terribly wrong with this film . The little girl played by Hailee Steinfeld , delivered her lines as unemotional as Mr Spock would have during an old episode of Star Trek . Enter Jeff Bridges in the courtroom scene . Looks like things will pick up from here on . But unfortunately they don't . The dialog is just plain awful . I closed my eyes for a moment . I imagined I had wandered into a Charles Dickens 19th century English classic rather than an American western . Because of this cheesy dialog, the actors appear to be very uncomfortable whenever it's time to deliver their lines . There are no academy award performances in this so-so of a movie . After a half hour into this film, I started wondering who wrote and directed this mess ? I have never listened to such boring dialog or seen such wooden acting in a western before . The characters appear to be somewhat one dimensional at best . Hailee Steinfeld is either a robot or comes from the planet Vulcan, completely without feelings or emotions . She used the \" I am going to get my lawyer after you \" reference on four separate occasions . I never felt any true sense of peril for our heroes . The bad guys don't seem all that frightening, or maybe I just became numb by that time ? If it were up to me I would have used more contemporary dialog of today rather than that that old stodgy Quaker nonsense . Jeff Bridges as always is a pleasure to watch on the big screen , unfortunately even with both six guns blazing, he couldn't save this mediocre flick . I say wait for the DVD and rent it for a dollar . It's Not Hot , but lukewarm at best",

            "content": "The Coen brothers have created something unassuming yet quite beautiful in \"True Grit,\" a second cinematic version of the novel that was first adapted famously in 1969 and brought John Wayne his Best Actor Academy Award.The film plays out like a standard western, complete with good cowboys and bad, little ladies in peril, shootouts and even a visit by an Indian or two. It feels conventional (though I don't mean that in a bad way) for a Coen brothers movie, and doesn't have that off-kilter quality so prominent in their best work. And if the film had ended 15 minutes sooner I might have gone on my way with a contented shrug. But in that last 15 minutes, the Coens manage to pack in a beautiful and sweet denouement without any of the sugary sentiment any number of other directors would have brought to the same material, and I found the end result to be both haunting and life affirming.Jeff Bridges plays a fat drunk for the second year in a row, but gives a much more impressive performance than he did in his Oscar-winning role in last year's \"Crazy Heart.\" Hailee Steinfeld, as the rather odd young girl who serves as the story's narrator and chief catalyst, is remarkable and ably carries the film on her little shoulders.Grade: A",

            "content": "Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross's father has been shot in cold blood by the coward Tom Chaney, and she is determined to bring him to justice. Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal, Rooster Cogburn, she sets out with him -- over his objections -- to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man. (Paramount Pictures)Let me say right off the bat that I was disappointed with TRUE GRIT. This is the Coen brothers we're talking about, the guys who made FARGO and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. In comparison, TRUE GRIT doesn't hold a candle to those two films. That isn't to say that it's a bad film. It's a perfectly good one, made with apparent care and hard work. The cinematography and score by Carter Burwell are utterly fantastic. It's also filled with many genuinely funny scenes. The performance by Hailee Steinfeld is terrific in almost every way. Ah, I just love her in this film! Matt Damon, one of my favorite actors, is also great in here, sporting a realistic country accent. While not as good as the other two, Jeff Bridges is as good as always. Unfortunately, Josh Brolin is underused to say the very least.This brings a nice segueway to the huge problem of the film: TRUE GRIT is not your usual revenge flick and saying that is a mix of good and bad. The film moves in a leisurely pace filled with many bloated and unnecessary scenes that don't seem to have anything to do with the revenge story at all. Still, we get to see the characters bonding with each other which is nice. As the film slowly builds up to the climax all of us have been waiting for, it's not that exciting and is over in what seems like seconds. It's truly anti-climatic, yet I like how the Coens went above our expectations with an unconventional climax. Still, that's mostly a bad thing.I never liked Westerns, and TRUE GRIT didn't convince me to go and rent some immediately. However, it's a well made film with terrific performances and some great scenes. Still, problems like the slow pacing and the third act keeps it from becoming a great one.",

Firstly with No Country for Old Men, and now this wonderful piece of cinema. True Grit is in itself a very simple story, however the superb direction provided by the Coen brothers allows it to exceed all expectations. The dialogue is perhaps the biggest success of the film, and is some of the finest screen writing you'll see all year. The verbal interactions between the three main characters are both sensitive to the time period as well as being delightfully witty; the banter between Damon and Bridges is pure entertainment. The brothers also succeed in the development of the film's central character Mattie Ross. At no time is she painted as being unnecessarily annoying, but rather her bullish naivety provide for certain key elements of the film. Mattie is ultimately viewed as girl out for vengeance, plain and simple, but the Coen brothers go to every nuance to ensure she is both developed as an overly determined young girl, but still a young, very inexperienced girl nonetheless.I cannot say enough for the performance of Jeff Bridges in this film. His grizzly, brazen interpretation of a classic John Wayne role quite simply outdoes the original, and with every slurred sentence he utters I find myself applauding him more and more. Newcomer Steinfeld also offers a very promising debut, and Damon seems to enjoy himself endlessly in the role of LaBouef.True Grit is pure filmmaking at its finest. It provides everything we go to the cinema for; laughs, drama, action and the like. Simply put, True Grit is cinema-storytelling done exceptionally well.",

            "content": "America's taste for the amplified morality of movie westerns has withered. We no longer respect those age-old admonitions that served as prescriptions for survival; survival of our spirits and our hides. We are now immune to consequences, we are all legally divorced from responsibility. We may still imagine for ourselves a fierce ethic, but our faith in natural law has been displaced, lost. Life no longer slaps us down when we get too full of ourselves. In fact, Life is no longer paying us any mind. So, if Life has \"unfriended\" us on this synthetic social network we call American culture, then why should we care about Life, and, even less, the strange forces that support and guide it. These same forces, these same mysteries, these same \"laws\" are the very ones to which western movies had always paid homage. So it's very much an ironic, almost sarcastic attitude that is required to even contemplate making a western for today's corrupted, distracted, indifferent audience.And who is more ironic or sarcastic than the Coen brothers? They have consistently been this country's most diligent excavators of once vibrant American values, but always with a snide grin on their face. They have just about cornered the market on exploiting our need to be reminded again and again of just how high minded and hopeful we once were, even if all along we never fully believed our own bulls@#$. So many of their films have served as very time specific worm holes back to a moment when that particular defining quality we call \"American\" was being sorely tested, or more accurately, auditioned. They deconstructed our gangster era myth of noble war lords living out the American dream to the fullest in their early classic \"Millers Crossing.\" In that one the Don was reduced to a pudgy weirdo who used \"ethics\" mostly as a ploy to con himself. It's very clever and very, very funny. But on their latest morality tale, the brothers have dialed down the outrageous metaphysical shenanigans, and really tweaked up their signature fastidious devotion to characters being ethically assaulted. There's a minimum of outright irony on display, but it does lurk behind every frame.In \"True Grit\" the Coens have ventured further back historically than in any other of their tales. It's post civil war Indian Territory that beckons the boys this time as they faithfully interpret the 1968 novel of the same name. The 1969 John Wayne version, that won him his only Oscar, was filmed largely in the Rockies, but this new one is shot mostly in Texas in settings that more accurately mirror those in the novel. The vistas and panoramas are sumptuous, with a fine winter's patina over much of the landscape. What is so striking is how harshly filthy most of the characters are, how thoroughly tattooed the men are with layers of crud. They are not just of this land but basted in, infused with, composed of it. I started to see the muck and grime as a visual metaphor, an emblem of the intimacy these people had with natural law. Sure, it's a convention of westerns to have men, and occasionally women, beating puffs of trail dust off their well worn duds as they amble into the saloon. But here the dirt feels so deeply permanent, insistently bound to their core. That's how literal the Coen's have made this Grit. For this effect alone, the film's a cinematic achievement, but there are many other worthwhile qualities to be found here as well.Hailee Steinfeld as the young Mattie is remarkable, confidently mastering the curious language that roams somewhere between Huck Finn and Hamlet. Her expression of steely eyed determination, tinted with shades of wide eyed wonder, is a constant delight. Matt Damon's Texas Ranger LaBoeuf projects so much smug pride in his Texas homeland I kept flashing on a smirking, sneering George W. Bush bopping around his Lone Star spread. I know this is a highly personal interpretation, but LaBoeuf's childish boasting and naive arrogance really echoes the overblown, absurd persona our former leader fashioned for himself. Well, that's Texas. Jeff Bridges has done a fascinating thing by taking on his character of Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn as though it were a heavy, burdensome cloak, or even more accurately, a dense, woolly bear skin. His movements and speech are all hampered and softened by this put-on hindrance. This Rooster is not just hobbled with drink, but slowed and dulled by voluminous memories. These countless memories compressed within Cogburn bubble and gurgle forth in a fractured flow of anecdotes, tales and recollections. It's something of a welcome thing, too, 'cause there's little else out there on the trail to to keep themselves entertained. LaBoeuf takes a stab now and then at a spoken remembrance, but all he is capable of are trite secular homilies and tedious personal facts. He's wonderfully ridiculous.Finally, the cinematography is spectacular, with royally picturesque tableaux scrupulously vivid, sumptuous rich tones and exquisite textures throughout. The sound is wonderfully precise yet oddly hushed, as though reaching our ears only after having traveled the 150 years through time. It's a very subtle effect but I kept noting how often distant action would be played as pantomime, till suddenly punctuated with brittle gun shots. A neat trick. Come to think about it, the whole movie's a neat trick. It made me completely forget why we all don't like westerns anymore, and why I will never live a Life as noble - as natural - as anyone in this nasty, messy, fine film; the most subtle, lyrical version of that famous Coen irony.",

Even Mattie, for all her youth, steel and resolve, does not make a clear choice between justice and vengeance.Bridges goes for grunge in his portrayal of Cogburn, garbling his lines throughout.

Much of it has to do with the effective writing talent of the Coen brothers whose films are a cross word puzzle of delight from The Big Lebowski to No Country for Old Men. They are master storytellers and here they embark upon their first western. The film stars Hailee Steinfeld as fourteen year old Mattie Ross out to avenge her father's death at the hands of Tom Chaney. She enlists the help of Marshall Reuben Cogburn and are accompanied by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf. The trio ride into the old west and brave the winter and the opposition. Jeff Bridges embodies the role of Cogburn with an amusing Southern drawl. When first seen he is on trial where it is learned that his taste for alcohol are a setback. He knows his skill well but will ultimately learn to care. Steinfeld brings brave determination to Ross who struggles to maintain the conflict of two personalities while ultimately suffering severe fatalities for her stern quest. Matt Damon as LaBoeuf knows Chaney but is also clumsy and conceals a lack of confidence. Josh Brolin as Chaney is introduced through Ross's verbal description but is seen much later as part of Ned Pepper's gang. He is and isn't what he seems but he is destine to face consequences through Ross. Barry Pepper must have been perfect to play villain Ned Pepper thanks to his last name. The message is still sustained in its fatalities of revenge and its lifelong hold even when we're past the driven hand of justice. Score: 10 / 10",

            "content": "It's rare for a re-make of an American classic like True Grit to mirror the impact of the original movie based on the novel by Charles Portis. In fact, I'm surprised more is not made about the Portis novel as the basis for the two movies, because I enjoyed reading it when it was a best seller many years ago.Since the 2010 remake, I've become a groupie of the True Grit themes of redemption and the brutality of justice.As a truly American story, its special features are acted in the crudeness of the characters and the harshness of the old Arkansas County criminal justice systems which, no doubt, were closer to fact than fiction in the movie, during 1880 when the story took place.Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) is a County Marshal, but a man in need of redemption. He knows it, but doesn't know what to do about it. Cogburn's redemptive moment shows up in a person he least expects to extend him hope, when he meets 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Stienfeld). She is looking for the meanest person she can hire to help find her father's killer, a criminal named Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin).Complicating Mattie's plan to find her Daddy's killer is the character LeBoeuf (Matt Damon). LeBoeuf shows up as a needing-to-be-redeemed Texas Ranger, who is out to get the same man Haddie is looking for, but for the purpose of claiming a considerable amount of bounty money.LeBoeuf and Cogburn decide to rudely pass on Mattie's intentions for justice. Rather, they join forces to split the bounty. They don't count on Mattie's stubborn determination to find her Daddy's killer. She bargains for a horse and goes off after Cogburn and LeBoeuf.Haddie is the innocent surrounded by men who lack any sense of justice. They kill because they can. A ringleader of the murderous gang that Cogburn, LeBoeuf and Haddie pursue is Lucky Red Pepper (played by Barry Pepper), whose luck eventually runs out in a brutal scene when he enters into an intense dual with Cogburn.On the redemptive side, Cogburn quickly sees something in Haddie that he cannot ignore in himself - a driving need to find justice. Soon, the story is not about the handsome bounty on the killer Cheney's head but, instead, it's to help Haddie fulfill her mission.True Grit is an American story with some stereotypical characters we can expect to find riding through a 1950s Wild West movie. Yet, with Haddie as the central anchor, it tells a timeless story about justice prevailing over evil challenges encountered along the way.Bridges is entertaining and believable as the wasted Cogburn. But, the surprise performance, for me, was Matt Damon's portrayal of LeBoeuf. This role was originally played with no pizazz whatsoever by singer Glenn Campbell in the original movie with Oscar winner John Wayne as Cogburn. I appreciated the sensitivity Damon brought to the role, the sense of uncertainty he showed when trying to outsmart and out shoot the drunken Cogburn brings a hint of humanity to both of the heartless men.I give True Grit an 8 rating because it is well directed and acted. Perhaps it would have been a higher rated movie if we could have understood more about how Hattie became such a hard driving stubborn young lady. One scene I found totally unbelievable was when she drove her horse Blackie through the river to catch Cogburn and LeBoeuf but she wound up dry in spite of the drenching ride. Otherwise, the background scenes of the Arkansas prairie, especially depicting the lonely terrain, was a realistic setting for the story. Bleak surroundings seemed to drive some men looney, like the characters Bear Man and one of Lucky Pepper's sidekicks.I'm now a True Grit groupie. Loved the book, which I will now re-read, enjoyed John Wayne as the originator of the Cogburn role and now Bridges for bringing the story back to life. Right or wrong, True Grit is a story about morality, of American justice done the old fashioned way, and redemption. A classic.",

What made the earlier version of True Grit such a great film was the adherence to the novel's storyline.Though John Wayne was miscast as Cogburn, IMO, and Bridges was a much better Cogburn, the way the Cohen version went off the rails was straying from the path laid out by the novel. Having Rooster and Mattie traveling through the Nations without LeBoef , along with removing much of the novel's excellent dialog was, I think, a mistake.I saw mention of an imagined \"return to the source material\" in a trivia entry for this 2010 version. This is laughable. The Hall Wallis \"True Grit\" hewed much closer to the novel, especially in the dialog, which is lifted verbatim from the novel in most scenes. The dialog in this latest outing is pitiful in some scenes and quite annoying to a reader of the novel in those scenes.Jeff Bridges was great as Rooster Cogburn, and just about anyone would be better as LeBoef than Glen Campbell was in the first making of the story in 1969, but nobody in the industry today could replace Strother Martin as Col. Stonehill in the original. His exchanges with Mattie, taken nearly verbatim from the novel's dialog, are inimitable.Barry Pepper was very good in the role of Lucky Ned Pepper, though Robert Duvall was also very good in the original. Overall, the casting is fine, it's just the meddling with the novel's story that hampers this version for me.The Cohens made up for such meddling by including the scene in which Rooster kicks two boys off the porch at McCallisters for tormenting a mule. That was left out of the 1969 version. It establishes another facet of the Rooster Cogburn character that Bridges had been better at showing than John Wayne was.Still, the film doesn't miss the novel's greatness by much, and it gains a lot of credibility over the Hal Wallis version with its depiction of Fort Smith and the accurate period costuming and armory detail. Weapons were more correct for the period and the final gunfight scene was pretty much exactly as the novel told of it.. So was the courtroom scene.IMO, 8 stars is an accurate rating for this fine film. The flaws I noted aren't really minor flaws and many reviewers will not see them as flaws at all. Still, the novel was the best novel published in the 1960s, in my view, and it is readable yet, describing the post-bellum years and pointing out the difference in public perception of that war's aftermath today as compared to 1968.In 1968, outright hatred for the Confederacy and for Southerners in general was not so nearly universal as it is today. The disapproval shown by LeBoef for the Missouri guerillas, with whom Cogburn had ridden, was shared with Union veterans by some Confederate veterans, so that exchange between the two men was believable.Another glaring mistake in the Cohen version is the year of birth on Cogburn's tombstone: 1825. That would have made him 36 years old at the outbreak of the war, when the novel had Cogburn describing himself and his fellow Guerillas, saying, \"We was kids, and all we had was horses and pistols\".Also, the Border war was already in full swing when the wider war broke out. That was part of the backstory in the novel, ignored by both versions of the film.I admire both versions of True Grit and I own both on DVD. Enjoy the film. Thanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "There is this strange insistence on the part of the Coens that this is not a remake of the '69 Duke film. HAW. This is SO much a remake of that movie it ain't funny. While it's not as slavish to it's source material as the '98 Psycho re-hash, it's right up there. I hadn't watched the Wayne vehicle in some years, and I could tell right away. Don't try so hard Coens. Nothing wrong w/ remaking True Grit-it's a good film.Others have already expressed what works so well here-I just wanna say I agree. Jeff Bridges is terrific as Cogburn-by NO means is he 'better' that the Duke-he's essentially channelling Mitchum from 'El Dorado' by way of Wallace Beery as far's I'm concerned. And it works, rather well. You root for the man and buy into his toughness out on the trail after the baddies.Loved Mattie here. Like watching a young Jody Foster at work. Self-assured, believable, steady, a little adult. You hope she has a great future ahead of her. I enjoyed her performance.Good turns by Barry Pepper, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin too. Solid action, great scenery and cinematography.I think as an overall film, it's better than the '69 Oscar winner, as two of the key roles here-Damon and Mattie> Campbell and Darby. No one is going to replace the Duke, and Bridges of all people, being part of Hollywood royalty, knows this better than anyone. He made the role his own and therefore the film is that much better for it.***1/2 of *****. Yes go see it. Wayne wouldn't mind.",

            "content": "'True Grit (2010)' is told with the Coens' signature dancing dialogue, realist yet distinctly cinematic style and slightly absurdist slant, all of which culminate in a very unique yet decidedly well-worn spin on an old tale in (what's arguably) an unfortunately dying genre. It's a feature that adheres just as strongly to the tropes of that genre as it does to the tropes of its head filmmakers' now iconic portfolios. While its perhaps more meditative than some and it certainly isn't an action film by any stretch of the imagination (regardless of its body-count), there's often a sense that the story has been imbued with a slower pace than necessary simply to include long sequences of deliberately cumbersome but unintentionally repetitive back-and-forth banter and odd, almost dream-like asides that serve to paint this version of the old-west as one of strange folk struggling to earn their keep anyway they can, an admirable attempt to introduce some extra - and, actually, unneeded - personality that often falls flat thanks to the fact that the rest of the piece isn't anywhere near as weird - or as slow - as these moments. Still, there's a decent sense of a dusty, rustic style and a no-nonsense tone, both of which combine with the scenery (and screenplay) chewing performances to make for an enjoyable experience. 8/10",

I saw determination in the girl's character but no emotion. THAT didn't come through at all. Neither did Rooster's character and his many obvious character flaws, they were acted but not lived nor were there any solid glimpses into the reasons for his less than admirable traits. The 'bad guys' were props, the only character that emoted at all was the Texas Ranger and his character wasn't all that interesting. In the land of westerns, he was kind of wimp.",

            "content": "I saw this at the cinema last night (Saturday 26th February 2011), hoping to enjoy this film. I haven't seen the original starring John Wayne in the Jeff Bridges role, but must say that I absolutely LOVED this film.I saw this film, as it stars newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, who was BAFTA nominated for best actress and has (at least) received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress (the results of the Oscars are unknown as of when I'm writing this). Hailee produced an outstanding performance as 14-year-old Mattie Ross, who is out to avenge her father's death at the hands of a drifter named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She persuades an alcoholic marshal named Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to join her in tracking down Chaney and they are also joined by a Texas Ranger by the name of La Boeuf (Matt Damon).This film is a new version of the 1969 film, based on the 1968 novel of the same name, by Charles Portis.The writing and directing credits come from the Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan, although this is the first of their films they've done, I am sure that they have reached new fantastic heights with this film. I also wish to congratulate Roger Deakins on his cinematography; Carter Burwell on his score and Jess Gonchor for the great production design, plus all the other people I haven't listed.Jeff Bridges was wonderful as Cogburn, producing a funny performance and also I hope he wins an Oscar. Matt Damon was great (as he normally is), albeit he looks slightly unrecognizable with that huge moustache! Particular praise, though, goes to Hailee Steinfeld. She produced such an amazing performance for a newcomer aged 14 (who may well win an Oscar), but even if she doesn't win, I'm sure she will feel honoured enough to have a nomination, I know that I feel proud for her. When I meet my hopeful dream of becoming a filmmaker, I'll definitely have a role ready and waiting for her (If you're reading this Hailee, I mean it!). I felt sorry for her not to win the best actress award at the BAFTAs (which here in the UK is the equivalent to the Oscars), but my theory was that she didn't win it, maybe because she is young. In a couple of year's time, she should certainly have a BAFTA statuette at home (or two)! I was originally surprised that she was placed in best SUPPORTING actress for the Oscars, but I heard somebody say on an UK programme called Film 2011 that she may have been placed there, as she will have a better chance of winning it, I now feel that this may be true, so GOOD LUCK HAILEE!!!The action was very good. I was hooked throughout and there were plenty of suspenseful moments and also some funny parts, especially the 'best shot' competition between Cogburn and La Boeuf! I highly recommend this film to anyone and hopefully I'll be able to get the Blu-ray for my birthday (August 12th)!Overall, I give this film 10/10, as it was an outstanding film, containing great performances from veterans and newcomers alike, particularly the new great star Hailee Steinfeld, who will be a regular for me, when I am a filmmaker!",

When I saw the trailer with Jeff Bridges wearing a eye patch wielding guns I knew I had to see this movie. What is shocking though is how Hailee Steinfeld steals the spotlight as Mattie Ross, the girl seeking vengeance. Although Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn stood out as well. I didn't find the dialogue all that amazingly entertaining but it's still well written. I didn't see the original so I can't compare the two films but this movie stands out pretty darn good on it's own. Matt Damon played his role well, basically the way the character is intended to be with his proud and yet somewhat metro personality. The journey for these 3 characters all the way to the end was actually quite enjoyable. It sort of feels like your with the group as they are on a manhunt. Not as great as I thought it would be but it's a western that is most definitely worth seeing.7.8/10",

I've been looking forward to see how Jeff Bridges portrays Rooster Cogburn in this remake. After watching his performance, I have to admit that I was very impressed. True Grit is an amazing movie and one of the best I have seen in years.The Coen Brothers adaption has their trademark style to it. There are ten times as many goofy and quirky characters in this movie that in Napolean Dynamite. All of the characters are very intriguing and entertaining. The acting was great and I also appreciated the dialogue too.Bridges did an amazing job of portraying the crusty old Ranger. Damon was also great and I hardly recognized him in his role. I loved the banter between the two lawmen throughout the movie. There are some great quotes in this movie and I was surprised at how much humor there was for such a serious plot. Hailee Steinfeld plays the young girl who hires Cogburn to track down her father's murderer and bring him to justice. She personified \"true grit\" more than any other character. She was the main reason I liked this version so much more than the original.The only two minor hangups I had with this movie was the encounter with the \"bear dentist\" who spoke like he was tripping on LSD and the abrupt ending. Aside from that, I was mesmerized during every scene and have not seen such an entertaining movie in a long time.This is one of the few movies I have seen where I didn't find myself criticizing the movie for hard to believe effects or story line. It is very graphic and has a very realistic feel to it. I give True Grit 9.0 well deserved stars.",

Usually, I count myself as one which is why I was reluctant to see this film. Today, however, curiosity got the best of me and I'm glad I changed my mind. Don't get me wrong, I still prefer the 1969 version, but the makers of this film didn't dishonor it. It says volumes for Jeff Bridges talents that he can take a role made famous by John Wayne and give it a new original twist, making it uniquely his own! There have been critics that said that Wayne got his True Grit Oscar for the cumulative body of his work. They said that as Rooster Cogburn, he really gave a hammy, \"over the top\" performance that normally wouldn't have gotten an Oscar. Bridges makes Rooster more complex and darker. There are scenes in this film where you can practically smell him from your seat. I loved the scene where he was trying to shoot that cornbread he tossed in the air. The screenwriters stayed faithful to Charles Portis's novel and its cute dialogue and I salute them for that. To me, the one improvement over the original is newcomer Haille Steinfeld. She is amazing as the young heroine Mattie Ross. Critics are lauding Bridges for his portrayal but lets not forget this incredible young newcomer. She is skies above Kim Darby's portrayal. When it came down to it, Darby was in many ways just bratty and annoying. Steinfeld makes her courageous and strong as well. I also wanted to salute Matt Damon for taking on Glenn Campbell's old role. For you trivia lovers, they originally wanted Elvis to do it but he wanted too much money. SPOILER ALERT the only beef I have with this film is the rather downbeat ending when we see a middle aged Mattie visiting Rooster's grave. I prefer the original where Wayne jumped over the fence at the end. It was more upbeat.",

Having never seen the older film (gasp), I'm not in a position to say which is better, nor which is more faithful to the book both are based on, having never read it, but what I do know is that the newer film is fantastic.Spot-on performances from all involved, superb dialogue, beautiful cinematography and a straight forward storyline made for the most enjoyable film I have seen in some time.Most people are probably aware of the premise of True Grit, but to summarise: 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) hires US Marshall 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help her track down and bring to justice her father's killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). That's it. No twists, no turns, just a good old-fashioned romp across classic cowboy country.Also featuring are Matt Damon as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf and Barry Pepper as 'Lucky' Ned Pepper, who's gang of outlaws Chaney is tagging along with.Perfect casting throughout, I cannot fault any of the performances. Special mention has to go to Steinfeld though. I've read that she was picked from 15,000 applicants and I'm glad the casting team found her amongst all those hopefuls. She is exceptional as the headstrong Mattie. Steinfeld's up for the Best Supporting Actress gong at the Oscars which I'm sure she'll go home with. In my opinion she wouldn't be out of place in the Leading Actress nominations as she is by far the more central character in this picture. Sadly, as you can see her name is barely visible on the movie poster, but this is quite acceptable given the calibre of her co-stars - I'm sure she'll have top billing in the near future. True Grit will be Steinfeld's 'Leon' - the 1994 movie which catapulted a 13 year old Natalie Portman to superstardom.Bridges is deservedly up for Best Actor for his superb portrayal of tramp-cum-hero Cogburn, though I think Colin Firth already has that one sewn up.I'm sure True Grit will pick up a bunch of the other awards it's nominated for. I'd be very surprised if Roger Deakins and Mary Zophres don't win in their respective categories of Cinematography and Costume Design - the movie is visually stunning. Do not wait for the DVD or Blu-Ray - I urge you to go and see this on the big screen.A straightforward plot in a movie is becoming a rarity these days (I'm still trying to work out what happened in 'Inception'...) so the good old fashioned storytelling in True Grit was nice and refreshing. As said previously, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years. The only (very minor) complaint I have is that the pacing could have been a little better (slightly slow to get going and too quick to end) but that really didn't affect my enjoyment.",

Well, except for Matt Damon's bushy mustache which looks like it juts a few inches above his face and looks perilously like falling off at any time. Anyway, what sets this movie apart from other Westerns is the fast talking verbal jousting that gives the first half of the movie a comedic shade. All the while, this talking does imbue our protagonists with personality which is deftly channeled into the shooting and gun-slinging of the second half making for nail-biting and suspenseful action sequences where our characters are put to their test.In many regards, this is a perfect film (perfect pace, perfect acting and so on). The Coen brothers have created some amazing films (Fargo, Big Lebowski) and some mediocre ones (Ladykillers, Burn after Reading) but this movie will go down as great movie. \"True Grit\" embraces the grittiness of the modern westerns (corpses, blood splatters and bullet impacts) but unlike other westerns eschews the silent morally-grounded superman cowboy for a garrulous Marshall who is fat, drunk and not averse to lying, stealing and killing but who shows true grit and courage, not as virtue but as a delicate construct of the relationship that the characters build.",

Matt Damon does a good LaBoeuf, again different in the same way Bridges is, the supporting cast is great as well, Josh Brolin, Dakin Matthews are good but again we have a good actor in Barry Pepper playing Ned Pepper, not as good as Robert Duvall but not far off.They try to stick closer to the story in this, LaBoeuf does not die, but Rooster does, not in a scene though, an older Mattie Ross looking for him 25 years later, finds out he died 3 days earlier, that was a bit of a let down, it would have made a better film if she had met him just before he passed away, if that had been the end I would have scored it the same as the original, but that is realism for you, it always gets in the way.

Despite not being a typical, quirky film, the Coen Brothers made one of the best recent western films.This remake of the 1969 version is about a strong-willed girl, Maddie who hires a U.S Marshal to find the man, Tom Chaney who killed her father. She, the Marshal, and a Texas Ranger all set out to find the man and possibly another gang he has become infatuated with.The acting is a very strong point of the film. Jeff Bridges and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld were very impressive. I was even more impressed on how Hailee held her own against a very talented cast.Overall, this is one of the best western films ever made. When I first saw this film, I had trouble understanding the garbled accent of Jeff Bridges, but since then I had come to appreciate it.

Matt Damon and Bridges both also bring extremely impressive performances, but that's to be expected from two seasoned veterans.The plot was extremely satisfying, the only reason I didn't give this movie a full rating is that I felt the ending falls a bit flat. It's not surprising, and some may even say the ending was brilliant, but I expected a little more of a resolve. Not a terrible ending in any sense, just wasn't what I was expecting.I loved this movie and not only would I watch it again, but I would also actively seek it out and push others to see.",

I gave it a 9.Everything about this film was just incredible. The cinematography, music, the dialog was simply brilliant and frequently hilarious. The direction and editing were wonderful.Jeff Bridges should be get an Academy award for his portrayal of a one eyed, grumpy, drunken Marshall who aids a spunky (to say the least!) 14 year old girl track down the killer of her father. He puts his signature mark on this character - gruff, hard, killer with a heart of gold - and very funny. At times he reminded me of W.C. fields with his growling one liners. Some of this unfortunately was missed in the theater as we were laughing so hard at times we drowned out some of his lines. I look forward to hearing him again on DVD where I can relish his delivery once again.This is a movie about revenge, justice, trust and eventually - relationships.But it is not the story so much as the way it is told that makes this brilliant. It is drama, action, comedy all rolled up in one serving.Hallie Steinfeld was a joy to watch, and is definitely someone to watch for as I am sure she will become a famous actress. In many scenes, she carries the movie. Her performance is one to see - words cannot describe it.Josh Brolin is also great - but he doesn't get enough screen time to shine.The only thing that prevents me in giving this a 10 is Matt Damon, who - in my humble opinion - was miscast and seemed out of place with the veteran actors and talented newcomers.His performance was 'okay' - and the film itself is so wonderful that I still highly recommend it - even to those who are not fans of the Western genre. This is great story telling at its best.I plan on seeing it again... that in itself, says a lot.",

Definitely have used another theme from their favorite \"West\" with wild figures of American creativity. They chose their favorite actors (Brolin, Bridges, Damon) but all this did not work properly. The Coen brothers choose western again, after the award-winning No country for old men. This time they do a remake of Henry Hathaway's movie, starring John Wayne (who won an Oscar for this role), put his place Jeff Bridges, filming with surrealism and cynicism the characters of the Wild West and with their special sarcastic humor, create a pure western, with too slowly rhythm, minimum but brute violence, and sporadic... shooting. The beautiful photography, the interpretation of the little Hailee Steinfeld which impresses the audience, the good, although one-dimensional interpretations of all the actors and attentive, without exaggeration direction, unfortunately is not enough to save the new creation of Coen from the boring effect. Pity, because the names in directing and the cast prepares us for something much more interesting than a boring movie, where the journey to revenge and atonement is without 'true grit' and mostly without any originality.",

            "content": "I grew up watching John Wayne movies. The man is movie icon. His body of work is legendary. Since Hollywood is seriously lacking in creativity these days it came as no surprise to finally see a remake of one of \"The Duke's\" films. I must admit that when I first heard that someone was remaking True Grit, I was appalled! And his only Oscar winnings performance to boot!? Blasphemy! Those arrogant Cohen Brothers! Who do they think they are? During the next few months the idea really started to sink in. I began to really consider the audacity of the dynamic brotherly directing duo and I became a believer. I considered the Brothers own legendary body of work. Eight Academy Awards between them, including two for Best Picture (Fargo, No Country For Old Men) and various other accolades. They even inspired me to read the book! After a bloody inner battle I realized that if anyone could pull this adaption of the Charles Portis classic and meet the Duke standard, they could.Now for the actual review.....True Grit is a story about a young girl named Maddie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father is unjustly murdered by one of his employees, a simple minded criminal by the name of Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Maddie sets out to the town her father was killed to settle his business affairs, to send his body home for funeral, and to see that Chaney is brought to justice. After discovering that justice will not be sift as she sees fit, Maddie hires U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to hunt Chaney down. As they prepare for the hunt, they encounter an arrogant Texas Ranger by name of Lebeouf (Matt Damon) who is also on the scout for Chaney under a different name for the murder of a Texas senator. Together the three go after Chaney, who is now banded with Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and his gang of miscreants.First and foremost the casting was brilliant. I was convinced that no one could play Rooster Cogburn like the Duke did, not even Jeff Bridges. And I was right. However, this isn't the Rooster Cogburn of John Wayne lore. This Rooster is a much dirtier and dingier portrayal. There is no doubt about the man's courage and toughness, but there is some question about his character. Is he a good man? Or is he bad? By the end of the movie, Bridges has played the character so well that there will no be doubts to what the answer is. Matt Damon as LeBoeuf is monumentally better than Glen \"The Rhinestone Cowboy\" Campbell. He captured the arrogance and later the humility of LeBeouf very well. And newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is the most impressive by nailing the sassy and confrontational Maddie Ross. Made even more impressive by the fact that she has very little acting experience and easily garners the most screen time. Finally, the Cohen Brothers are masters at both writing original screen plays and adapted screen plays. While True Grit won't win an Oscar for Best Movie, it is deserving of multiple nominations and will more than likely be treated duly, although the Golden Globes managed to thumb its nose at the movie in most categories.",

While the word vengeance is cited throughout the movie it is not truly vengeance that drives Mattie to leave civilisation and travel into the wilderness in search of her father's murderer, but to make sure that justice has been done.Death and justice are two themes that a common throughout the movie. Near the start Mattie watches a hanging where three men are being punished for their misdeeds. The first is in tears and uses his last words to warn the crowd against following in his footsteps. He got drunk and murdered a man in a fit of rage. The second man was after vengeance and killed an innocent person, but is justified in his own eyes. The third is an Amerindian, and is denied a voice (it is interesting to see the portrayal of the natives in this movie. Blacks are treated as servants, while the Amerindians are treated as being less than rodents).Mattie is a very intelligent and determined individual who makes sure she gets her own way. This is seen as she negotiates with the man whom her father bought livestock from as she seeks to wind up her father's business in this town at the edge of civilisation.It is clear from the start that the town in which Mattie arrives is at the edge of civilisation as it is at the end of the railway line, and beyond this town is only wilderness, a place where outlaws run to escape the consequences of their actions.While the movie is about justice, and the rule of law, where Mattie travels the law exists only in theory. In practice only the strong survive and justice is sought at the barrel of a gun. She learns this quickly when she confronts her father's murderer and attempts to arrest him only to have him laugh at her. In the end, the only justice that is found, is justice at the barrel of a gun.",

            "content": "When the Coen brothers first announced this remake of the classic 1969 western, I thought it was a poor idea. Remake an Academy Award-winning endeavor from the Duke himself? Good luck, right?! But then, a funny thing happened--it turned into a serious passion project for the Coens, also shepherded along by such names as Steven Spielberg & Roger Deakins. When all was said and done, it turned into perhaps my favorite western film of all-time.For a basic plot summary, \"True Grit\" tells the story of young Maddie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), who hires Deputy Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to avenge the death of her father at the hands of the coward Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Along the way, with the help of Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), Maddie and Rooster track Chaney via the notorious Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) gang.What elevates this movie from the original is the closer following of the source material: Charles Portis' novel. The Coens portray a much darker, grittier time and circumstances--probably much more accurate to the period than the original's 60s bravado. Whereas that version was all about the Duke, this one focuses on the rightful charge: the young, plucky Ross.\"True Grit\" also does all the \"little things\" (which so often end up as so much more) perfectly. The acting is flawless, the direction is solid, the visuals are often jaw-dropping, and even the music adds series emotional depth to the entire production. Every scene is riveting, and will have you on the edge of your seat. Even the comedic and light-hearted moments do their job and add some needed levity.Thus, I consider 2010's \"True Grit\" to probably be the all-around greatest western I've ever seen. There isn't a single scene that is a letdown, and all the other filmmaking factors converged to produce a masterpiece. Whenever I hear of a seemingly \"bad idea remake\", I always use \"True Grit\" as an example of how re-working a classic film can produce a better result if enough care is taken with the material and each storytelling component.",

She's wise and tough beyond her years, & simply won't accept the way the town of Fort Smith, Arkansas has allowed Josh to get away scott-free\u0085\u0085 Hailee toughly bargains with horse-trader Colonel Stonehill (DAKIN MATTHEWS) to get enough money to personally hire an old eye-patched marshal named Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (JEFF BRIDGES) to find Josh so she can kill him\u0085 He's uneager to get involved, but needs the money\u2014 mainly to build-up his supply of WHISKEY, which seems to be his main interest in life\u0085\u0085 A Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (MATT DAMON) comes to town, also wanting to catch Josh because he's wanted for killing a State Senator back home.

Will Hailee have her wish of being able to KILL him for what he's done to her family?... Will \"Lucky Ned\" REMAIN lucky, or will \"true grit\" by his pursuers rule the day?... Will Hailee escape the perils she HERSELF faces (from wild animals & others)?... What will \"postscripts\" show happen to various of the main characters after the \"basic\" CHASE ends?...\u0085 I found this film to be a real PLEASURE: Jeff & Hailee were EXCEPTIONAL in their lead roles, & Matt (in a somewhat \"quieter\" role) also does a fine job (as do Josh & Barry in much smaller roles). The \"stilted\" type dialogue actually \"WORKED\", giving a real \"mood\" and humor to the \"Old West\" proceedings\u0085\u0085 Thus, for the finely-crafted enjoyment it brings, I'm rating this film at 9.0 out of 10 stars\u0085 Go SEE the \"Rooster\" crow at daylite (or even nitetime)!",

The first film with John Wayne was a mediocre average western only saved by the presence of a 14 year old girl chasing and hunting the killer of her father. The Coen brothers performed a miracle and give this film a strength and power it did not have in 1969. After spaghetti westerns now is the time of kaddish westerns.They more or less try to be a lot more effective as for the feelings and emotions of the audience. They use the girl at her maximum in all situations. The story though is simplistic but it provides us with some beautiful pictures and landscapes and it increases the dramatic tension a lot.But that does not make a great film and not even a beautiful film, except the touristic discovery of the Santa Fe region and its wilderness. The ending is different and it adds some posthumous depth to the story but fundamentally we are very far away and even more than far away from the tension of Sergio Leones' and Ennio Morricones' films.Yet it is pleasant and I must say the hanging scene is a lot more impressive in this version probably due to the nice sound track that makes the breaking of the vertebrae a lot more audible.

LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) is a U.S. Marshall in pursuit of Tom Chaney for various previous crimes and wants in on their pursuit but falls short on his ability to please and differences in approach. Rest is how they fix their differences and accomplish their mission.A lot rides on making Mattie's character likable and Hailee Steinfeld does an excellent job by showing the stubbornness and innocence associated with her age and maturity to deal with the veteran gunslingers. Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin and Matt Damon are accomplished and talented actors and there should not have been any doubt about their output. It is gritty than stylish, realistic than audience pleasing (except for the climax). Screenplay and character development are textbook and well executed.

            "content": "First of all allow me to clarify, I am not going to draw comparisons to that of the original John Wayne film because the Coen Brothers version should be seen as another adaption of the novel, rather than a remake. And before you metaphorically ask yourself whether i have seen the or read the novel the answer is no. The following review of True Grit is judged on face value...Now that the air is clear let me start by saying True Grit follows in classic Coen Brothers fashion, it is a little different to most Hollywood westerns. Quite refreshingly, the film seen through the eyes of 14 year old girl Mattie Ross. Which reminds me, do not go into the movie expecting a saloon door swinging, face off dueling, shoot em' up. At least 30 minutes passes until the first bullet is fired BUT in saying that there is good balance of grounded and believable action thrills (they call it TRUE Grit for a reason) and character exploration. Yes, there is even crisp moments of humor too, just like that ^.The acting is superb from Jeff Bridges who is made for the role of the aged and rugged US Marshall Rooster Cogburn, although his raspy voice is sometimes hard to understand initially (don't you hate that). Matt Damon is pitch perfect and Josh Brolin is also very good, despite only featuring for around 20 minutes. But the real gem is Hailee Steinfeld who delivers a confident coming of age performance, in order for the film to work she needed to nail it and not only did she do that... she brought a nail gun to the table, deconstructed the table and then built it again. It was exactly what she needed to do with the character of Mattie. Of course the cinematography is both technically sound and brilliantly captured by Roger Deakins, one of the best in the business. The score swings seamlessly between thrilling orchestra and delicate piano and the overall feel/ production design and costume is spot on.But did True Grit stick the landing? For me it didn't entirely have me gasping in ore by the credits like I so badly wanted it to. I wanted to walk out saying 'god that was awesome' but instead I said 'that was enjoyably solid'. I can't quite put my finer on it... It could be because it has a level of predictability (surprisingly for the Coen Brothers), it could be because you are denied of some back story and closure to a certain extent, it could be because the start and ending seemed a little 'tacked on' and didn't quite tie together cohesively. I could tell the audience felt this way too because at the start of the credits there was a wave of silence that lasted for some time. (Note, these are all small things that don't butcher the film at all)Never the less, I definitely did not regret seeing it by any stretch. The Coen Brothers prove once again why they are the best director duo in the world and True Grit proves to be a very solid, refreshing western that balances a smart script and realistic thrills nicely. Go and see it, make up your own mind.",

The narrative was almost making me sleep because the progression is very slow and most of it is just the characters travelling. There is some action featured but I've seen far better in majority of films. There were also some random bits. One including a guy jumping out of the trees, swinging his arms like a chicken and making silly noises which put my friend and I in hysterics! Then again, the Coen brothers seemed to develop a ridiculous narrative in 'Burn After Reading' which also had random parts. Therefore, it seems to be their auteur style.I couldn't understand the conversations because Jeff Bridges just grumbled throughout. He needed subtitles cos I can understand R2-D2 better than this character! The exception of this film was Hailee Steinfeld who spoke very clearly and represented a very powerful and independent character for just a 14 year old girl. Yet her name isn't prominent in the advertising which I find wrong. I must admit the settings were very good as well.Although I haven't seen the original or read the book, I wouldn't recommend this. This is Simply because I feel you wouldn't be missing much. It didn't really teach anything and I found it hard to empathise with the characters. However, in a way, I'm glad I watched it because now I know for myself what it's like and I had good fun talking about it with my friends.",

This movie is more in line with Unforgiven for exampleTo summarize this is a vengeance movie - girl wants to track down and kill the man that murdered her father and hires the help of alcoholic, loose cannon, bad-ass and bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn to do the job Cogburn is played by Bridges, and it is without doubt the best Jeff Bridges performance I have ever seen. All cast members are incredible here, I hadn't seen Hailee Steinfeld before but she is unreal in this as Mattie. If only all 14 year old's were this cool! As with other Coen movies the focus is on characters and accents, and the unusual way that the cast speak provides many opportunities for comical moments - witness Mattie's negotiations for a stolen horse, four ponies and a saddle. Lot's of laugh out loud spots in the theatre I was in. I especially liked Matt Damon's deliveries and the dude wearing the grizzly bear. There are countless good bits and memorable one liners here *spoiler* A very creative movie, I really liked the surreal backdrops and star-fields at the end of the movie when Bridges has the girl on horse back and is carrying her The sound, as usual, is absolutely amazing. No bells and whistles, just solid sound recording and design. Loudness and range are used to really good effect with everything accept gunshots occupying a modest volume level. So the first gunshot is through the roof and really produces a physical reaction! Brilliant and economical use of surround as usual. Very sparse use of music, and all kinds of unusual sounds thrown in. Will watch again just to hear it My only regret about this film is that it wasn't longer, and at nearly two hours it seemed to go by incredibly quickly. Top marksAgain, action junkies go elsewhere",

It's everything we've ever wanted from a good, solid western and then some. From the very first minute we're drawn into this world of the good old Hollywood Wild West, although in this case the typical Wild West has a touch of realism in the form of a rather dark atmosphere. There are no real heroes and all the victories are Pyrrhic at best, which fits the Coen brothers' modus operandi rather perfectly.The film's real strength, though, are its characters. Each of the three main characters is well-developed and believable, although they all recycle some old clich\u00e9s into a new format. Damon's LaBoeuf is a dandy, but still well-meaning and competent. Steinfeld's Matti Ross is a precocious little miss I'm in charge, but she has a spine of steel and more determination than any of the other character. And finally there's Bridges' Rooster Cogburn, who's absolutely the best character in the whole film. He's both sympathetic and repulsive. He's terrifying and pathetic. He's a quandrum of opposites and he's absolutely unpredictable. One of Bridges' best performances by far.Add in some rather sweet side characters and a suitable old western storyline and you have a movie that manages to keep you invested from start to finish. There are no empty moments or wasted conversations. Everything feels premeditated. Pretty much the only reason that keeps this film back from being more than just great is the fact that it doesn't really invent anything new or allow us new viewpoints into the genre. It's just an extremely good western, which is more than fine in my books, but some may find it a bit lacking in that regard. Plus the ending is the kind where you either love it or you hate it, which is neither a plus or a minus.",

The Bad - It is particularly boring at times when the two main characters are conversing whilst slowly moving along their journey. The cinematography is nothing to admire. But worst of all is the film's antagonists, if you can call them that. They don't serve their purpose as our heroes' main rivals, the only purpose they serve is being a device that brings our heroes together. We here about them throughout the entire film, the terrible crimes and killings committed. Boy-oh-boy these people sound menacing, I feel scared for our dear heroes as they creep ever so closer to finding these treacherous scoundrels, but I bet it's gonna result in a mind blowing conclus...wa...what...they're dead? That's it? We see them for less than 10 mins and they're all dead? That sucks. They were kinda pointless huh. And it wasn't even a satisfying death for the antagonist, I never hated him, I had no reason to, I had barely seen him. No stunning fight we were teased about happening for the last hour and a half. Just the few bullets shot and hey presto the bad guys are dead. This film also falls more under the romance genre whilst not really having any romance in it. The relationship between the main characters isn't that convincing, I never became truly invested in their friendship, they were usually quite disjointed, so I never felt sad at the end. Lastly the plot is quite bland and boring, yes this is a remake that was based off a book, but still on its own the plot just doesn't stand out. So I hear ya, why am I giving it a 6 when I've done nothing but talk shit about it, let me tell ya.The Good - The acting is pretty much masterclass. Everyone acting just nails it. An Oscar or two should have been won by these actors/actresses. Also the costumes and makeup are spot on, it all looked quite convincing. The music is good, but not amazing. And lastly the action is quite cool. But as far as anything good goes, that's about it.All in all, average film that could have been something more if it wasn't for a lacklustre plot with just as bad antagonists. I advise you do watch it if you haven't seen it, but don't expect much.",

But after the third time the experience runs so dry it becomes a flick that starts empty handed and ends nowhere.True Grit isn't a western. It is set in the era. But the characters, the environment and the plot are far from the actual life in that era. To a degree where the movie is stunning in the first place and keeps getting worse with every time you watch it again.That starts with the plain and simply intimidation of Mattie getting reimbursed with ridiculous claims and the vendor is giving in and in to a point where the audience cracks up laughing for it is so plain unbelievable. With all due respect, but the Coens start it with a basic perception that treats a 14 year old orphan with the same respect a current jury in NYC would do. In a time where many people just got enslaved, raped, worked to death and murdered without anyone ever caring.This idea then goes on for about 2 hours. The regular bad-ass loner, the goofy sidekick, the gotta-care-for-kid. End of story. Again it is not a bad movie, on the contrary, but even for Coen-standards the story and the characters are so overdrawn, the movie sadly only ends up as solid, nothing more, nothing less. Mediocre in every regard.While the Coen brothers have a well deserved reputation to come up with remarkable movies this one lacks out on exceeding in any regard. Just another movie out there.",

            "content": "True Grit refers to the trait of toughness of character. True grit seemingly referring to raw rough Rooster more subtly and might actually refer to the toughness of the no-nonsense, no-fear 14 year old girl bent on seeking her revenge. Unfortunately that's about it for the character's layers; they are one dimensional containing this \"true grit\" and because they are so simple we are less drawn in and can't truly engage with them beyond the superficial level of getting the bad guy. It is amusing to watch this 14 year old girl negotiate and wisely confront and manipulate these much older, wild western men.It is supposed to be a humorous western. But it wasn't a really funny movie nor was it a great western adventure. Whatever it's supposed to be, this combo did not make it anything memorable. It could have been Gritty and raw but the humor took us away from that or it could have been very funny but the seriousness of it being a western and not a comedy took us away from the comedy. The dialogue was a little interesting and intellectual stimulating but the verbose, almost Shakespearean Rooster mumble, in his true grit fashion, made it exhausting to follow. The typical Coen Brother realistic?, gloomy, uncertain ending is getting more typical than the Hollywood endings, is therefore no longer surprising especially in a coen brothers flick and despite being a little different or quirky these endings do not save the movie.The individual scenes The Coen's make are quirky and unique and expertly executed. They are masters at creating intense suspense and sudden action such as the famous scene of Rooster riding with two guns for a showdown with the bad guys. The cinematography is also marvelously shot with scenes that contain such life and vibrancy or are completely devoid of that and rather have a moody barrenness, that we can become so absorbed by this other \"character\" which is the background. The individual scenes of Coen's are as always excellent but taken as a whole there seems to be a lack in story almost like something is missing or something random/gratuitously quirky goes on for too long.",

After the success of their dark, humorless drama No Country for Old Men, the Coens have returned to the scene of dark epics to test their directing skills yet again, this time adding some of that Coen humor to the mix as well.But thinking of this movie as a remake of the first film is road to disappointment, so don't. The Coen brothers drew their creativity from Charles Portis's 1968 novel, gave a few nods John Wayne's way, and then made the movie entirely their own. The result is a wonderful experience of all the authentic period settings, speech, accents, clothing, hair, and oh, those teeth.I won't give away any details, but the acting in this movie was absolutely superb! Jeff Bridges made no attempt to imitate or replace John Wayne as the rough, gruff, and vulgar Rooster Cogburn and in the end created an incredibly convincing character. A pleasant surprise, nearly all of the actors and actresses in the film put out some of their best performances to date, even if only with small roles, including Matt Damon as the inept Texas Ranger, Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned Pepper, and Josh Brolin as the hopeless coward Tom Chaney. On top of it all, Hailee Steinfeld made a fantastic Mattie Ross, playing the naively headstrong girl that avenges her father's death by pursuing his murderer with U.S. Marshall Cogburn.The Coens' True Grit is a impressive visit to the classic Old West that neither diminishes nor tries to compete with the 1969 film.

Hailee Steinfeld's Mathilda has to show toughness to Bridges' Rooster Cogburn who doesn't want her coming along. By the end though he has to concede she was more than able to meet any challenge. She faces down a terrifying Tom Chaney (Brolin), seeking him out in spite of his ruthlessness toward her father. She is cool when Rooster and uptight Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Damon) squabble over leadership in the hunt for Chaney. She holds the screen and conveys toughness well. Hailee Steinfeld will be a star if she wants to be. Set in 1877, Mathilda wants to avenge the death of her father. She rejects all attempts to ignore her on account of her age. We first see her toughness when she is trying to prevent a lawyer from ripping her off for a horse. She has a hard time convincing Cogburn to lead the manhunt for her Dad's killer. He evades her, dismisses her, and tries to send her home, but she won't have it. She won't back down from the evil killer - played with manic ferocity by Josh Brolin. She isn't deterred by the violence she sees in pursuit of her Dad's killer. Viewed from 2013, her toughness seems extraordinary but I think she survived in the environment in which she was born, just as people do today. Her courage in directly confronting her father's killer when he spots her at the river was for me the most electrifying part of the movie.There are moments of random oddness such as an encounter with a doctor cloaked in a bear fur which reminded me of the random encounter in Fargo when Frances McDormand's cop was contacted out of the blue by an old classmate. Jeff Bridges is crusty, foul-tempered, drunk, and rough around the edges. When he sees Matilda's determination to bring Chaney back to Texas for trial, he finally agrees to help her. I thought Bridges was fantastic. Barry Pepper shown himself an actor to watch, as he continues to choose unconventional characters and roles that run against type. Josh Brolin is also fantastic as Chaney and Matt Damon continues to choose roles more based on their quality rather than his ego. The film is gorgeously shot - lots of washed out color which gives the film the look of an old western. The Coen Brothers show themselves to be such iconoclasts in the variety of films that they direct. The only common denominator seems to be a willingness to look unflinchingly at human nature and show it warts and all. Their curiosity seems to know no bounds. They rarely strike sour notes. \"The Ladykillers\" and \"A Reasonable Man\" might not have been the most electrifying, but even they were were worth checking out.Their knowledge of styles and conventions, which they then put their own touch on is what makes them so interesting. This take on a classic western, overlaid with the lead of such a strong young woman and some fantastic performances, only continues to do that.",

The 1969 version seemed simply designed to showcase Wayne yet again, and the acting of the other cast members was quite wooden and hollow. John Wayne was simply John Wayne. What more needs to be said? And while some would argue it was irrelevant to the story, shooting scenes that are supposed to be occurring in Arkansas/Oklahoma in the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains was a bit....much.While this may be complete heresy to say, I think Jeff Bridges made a better Rooster Cogburn than John Wayne.I recommend readers see the 2010 True Grit.

Make it a bit more 'gritty' (if you'll pardon the pun) by having the girl lose her arm and become a strange old spinster.They slightly mix up the \"One-eyed Fat Man\" line, but it works.Kudos to the supporting cast, the set direction, etc. Everything in this movie seems to work well. I think it was just the ending that dragged on a bit and maybe wasn't necessary. (Was there a snake-bite in the Wayne version?)",

            "review_title": "Highly entertaining, wonderfully acted and excellently written, but somehow not satisfying enough to be classic",
            "content": "The western has been a genre in dire need of a comeback as of late. The Coen brothers have always had some love for the setting (No Country for Old Men notably), so if anyone is to be up for the challenge of bringing it back, it would be them. What was unexpected was for them to tread into remake territory, bringing the John Wayne classic back, a film I admittedly have not seen. Viewed as its own beast, True Grit 2010 is a highly entertaining, very well written and very well acted western tale, but didn't fully satisfy my hunger for some good old fashioned retribution.The film is about young Mattie Ross hunting Tom Chaney, the killer of her father, with the aid of notorious US Marshal Rooster Cogburn and occasional aid of Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who has been chasing Chaney for some time. Mattie is not satisfied simply letting the two men take care of it and insists to accompany them herself. The three reluctant allies make their way through Indian territory to face Chaney and the gang he has shacked himself up with.The Coen touch is clearly felt in the side-characters encountered, notably a bear-skin wearing doctor of questionable honesty. These moments give it almost a noirish feel at times, but truth be told this is as close to a straight genre film as the Coens have ever made. Western through and through, True Grit does little to mess with the formula and tone, unlike perhaps more daring films like The Proposition.Even through it is a genre film, its a damn well made one. The setting feels like a long-lost memory at this point for most audiences, and is represented beautifully. The dialogue rarely if ever feels modernized, but strays from unintelligible archaic babble. Even more importantly, the film can be downright brutal. The old west was, I imagine, a violent place compared to modern society, and the film does not shy away from the blood, racism and cruelty. Those who can't take animals getting hurt should be wary of the film's climax, and those who squeam at the sight of blood should bring a shoulder to bury their eyes into.The best part of the film is indeed the characters and the performances behind them. The weight of the movie falls on the shoulders of young Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, who stands with Chloe Moretz as one of the great emerging young actresses of the year. She shows maturity well beyond her years and pulls off some incredibly impressive dialogue believably, especially notable in the first twenty minutes (the bartering scenes are almost the highlight).Those worried Jeff Bridges wouldn't be able to pull it off can put their worries to rest, as while Steinfeld is the emotional center, Bridges carries the movie as the entertainment. His performance is highly believable, yet this is Mattie's story and not Cogburns. As such, he's an incredibly funny and occasionally cunning major character. Matt Damon pulls off the arrogant asshole LaBoeuf as well as the necessary changes his character undergoes. Josh Brolin gives a perhaps confusingly meekish portrayal of Chaney, but it just makes his character that much more interesting. Barry Pepper makes the most of his small role as the gang leader.The problem with the characters is that nothing really seems to happen. Mattie is already hard as rock when we meet her, rather than having to build up due to necessity. Rooster only begins to change his stripes at the very end, and does so very quickly. LaBoeuf emerges as almost the most interesting character to watch change, but is relegated to the sideline. Perhaps I'm expecting too much of an old story, but I also felt unsatisfied by the ending, with everything working out a bit too neatly aside from one tripup.True Grit is not the best film of the year, as many thought it may well be. It is a very well made and entertaining western sure to please fans of the genre and not make its detractors as bleary-eyed as they might expect, but its ending prevents it from reaching classic status. Hopefully its success ushers in a new wave of westerns, for the cinema scene surely needs them.",

            "content": "The film True Grit is about a witty young woman named Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) and her search for her father's killer. Her father has been killed by a man named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) who has fled into Indian Territory. After consulting with the town sheriff, Mattie hires Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) a Deputy U.S. Marshal to help her hunt down Tom Chaney and to bring him back to be tried for her father's death. Mattie chooses Rooster because she believes he has \"true grit\". LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) a Texas Ranger is also searching for Mr. Chaney. He teams up with Mattie and Rooster in hopes of finally catching Tom Chaney. The theme of this film is about a girl hell bent on finding Tom Chaney. She believes in justice and will not except that her father's murderer will not pay the price. She picks Rooster even though he is a drunk who can barely role his own cigarettes. Mr. Cogburn, Mattie and LeBoeuf set out on this journey as three people who barely can get along. Cogburn continuously makes jabs at LeBoeuf and at times mocks the Texas Rangers. Mattie uses her wits and sharp tongue to belittle the grown men to the point of being switched by LeBeof. Over time they develop a sense of mutual respect for each other. Mattie pulls her weight, LeBoeuf saves Cogburn with a long shot from his rifle and Cogburn saves Mattie from the snake bite. In the end they get what they set out for, Mr. Chaney is dead. The long chase is over. The Coen brothers did an excellent job directing, writing and editing this film. The flow of events kept the viewer intrigued. The film never became boring. The scenes in the film pass from one to the next fluidly. The camera angles, objective and subjective points of view made the viewer feel as if they were participating in the chase. One scene in the film that the Coen brothers did an outstanding job using subjective and objective point of view is near the end of the film. LeBoeuf and Mattie have just knocked out Chaney and are on top of the cliff side looking down into the bottom field. Cogburn is seen at one end and Ned and gang at the other. The objective point of view allows the viewer to take in the landscape and realize what is about to happen. After jawing back and forth Cogburn demands that the four men fill their hands with lead. This is where the excitement begins. The camera switches from objective to subjective several times. A wide objective view shows the Cogburn racing towards the four men all on horseback. Then the camera switches to subjective and puts you in the saddle of the horse. You can see Ned's men being shot from Coburn's point of view. The sounds and camera angles make you feel as if you are in the fight. After the dust settles Cogburn is trapped under his horse. Ned's three men have been killed. Ned rides up to Cogburn and draws down on him with his gun. Cogburn is a dead man. At this instant, the view goes back to the subjective point of LeBoeuf looking down his rifle barrel. A shot rings out and Ned is seen falling from his horse. I truly enjoyed watching this film. I liked the narration done by Elizabeth Marvel who also plays Mattie's character as an adult. The film was suspenseful all the way through. It kept me intrigued and cheering for Mattie, Cogburn and LeBoeuf.",

            "content": "True Grit seemed to be a very straight forward Western to me. There are bad guys, good guys, and a precocious young woman. The plot was pretty straight forward. It was the characters, the acting, and the dialog that was great. I am a big Jeff Bridges fan, and he was as good as ever as Rooster Cogburn, the irascible, one-eyed, hard-drinking, Federal Marshal, with the pretty good heart buried down deep. I thought Hailee Steinfeld played Mattie well. She was earnest with the single-minded goal of revenging her father's death. Matt Damon's role of LaBoef, the Texas Ranger, was fairly understated. Not over the top; just nice.Regarding the dialog, before reading anything about this film, I described it as Shakespearean with a Western flavor. I guess other people see it the same way. I often complain to my wife that the dialog on many current television dramas is not realistic. The dialog in these legal and cop shows is often very fast paced, full of big words, perfectly composed and delivered. I tell my wife that people do not speak like that in real life. Well, I don't know that the dialog in True Grit is any more realistic, but I loved it. The dialog between Mattie and the owner of the town stable over business matters is one heck of a rapid-fire, back and forth battle of the mouths. Just what I don't like normally, but I got a kick out of it here. The dialog in other parts of the movie is even more poetic and beautiful.My final thought concerns Mattie. I was fearful that this lovely nubile young woman might suffer at the hands of these crusty lonely men out in the middle of nowhere. Nothing of the sort occurred, nor was it really even suggested. Kudos to the Coen's for not going there. By the way, Mattie seems to be a great assertive role model for young women.",

            "review_title": "Neither the true hit nor the true s*it - a boring western with some great acting",
            "content": "I am a huge fan of Western movies and also of Matt Damon's acting and that was why I was really looking forward to this movie. I haven't seen the original with John Wayne but I have seen other movies starring him and know about his strong presence and particular acting even though I largely prefer the Italian Westerns and their actors and think that John Wayne is somehow overrated. After many positive reviews and an entering at the list of the top movies of all times on this site, my expectations were quite high for the new version of True Grit and then crashed dramatically down. I won't say that it is a bad movie but I would honestly say that it is a rather boring that is saved by the great actors, the magnificent landscapes and the movie score. True Grit is neither a True Hit nor the True S*it.The movie is a rather slow paced character study where the actors do a very well job, especially the young and talented Hailee Steinfeld as stubborn young girl Mattie Ross that wants to chase the killer of her father with the help of the often drunk, used and pitiless but rather smart Rooster Cogburn played by the very convincing Jeff Bridges. Matt Damon plays a young, modern and somewhat emotive Texas Ranger but is less convincing as usually. On the other hand, I didn't see any sadness, fear or despair in the role of Mattie Ross, a young girl in a stranger town that has lost her father recently; her only emotion was her stubborn sense of vengeance. Rooster Cogburn did a slightly better job and shows his two sides as a prudent tutor and nostalgic storyteller but also as an alcoholic with a quite grey life. But even though Rooster saves Mattie in the end, I miss somewhat a closer contact between them, a developing relationship between them and I would have liked to see a more intense final ending between those two characters. I was also surprised to see that the development of the character was abruptly broken when Rooster got suddenly heavily drunk out of the blue after so many sacrifices during the chase and I thought that inappropriate. The role of Matt Damon seemed strange to me, sometimes he acted like an arrogant and pitiless ranger and later as an almost warm-hearted friend. Some people may call this a developing and profound characterization but I rather saw the whole thing as an unconvincing lack of continuity. Every time I thought that there would be an interesting and tension filled relationship between the characters for example when the Texas Ranger left the group to chase the bad boys on his own and enter in conflict with the other two main characters, nothing really happened or evolved. But what really left me disappointed were the roles of the evil guys. They had nothing menacing, nothing bad and nothing outstanding apart of the embarrassing and unnecessary bad buy that was imitating animal noises to cut off the little rest of atmosphere and tension in the movie.And with this allusion comes my next important point. The whole story was rather boring and tensionless while the main idea could have been interesting. Something like a convincing final duel or intense chase between the good and the bad was missing. A part of a few shooting scenes, there was a lack of action in the movie as it tried to touch a rather emotional, nostalgic and finally dramatically and philosophical style. That could have been another interesting approach, but the movie even failed from that point of view. The nostalgic speeches of Rooster about his wife, his career and his demons are completely random and not very touching, the thoughts of the young girl are quite linear and predictable while Matt Damon showed two different attitudes in a rather disturbing than convincing manner.Many good ideas that could have given something special to the movie have been left out in my opinion. If the bad boys and their three hunters were marching through a territory of the Indians, I would have liked to see a cause of conflict between them. But the good and bad guys were just randomly galloping through rather beautiful landscapes. But the whole chasing story is somehow based on a few unbelievable coincidences. The fact that the girl meets the murderer of her father was predictable and the way how she met him was quite unoriginal for example. I also thought that the killer had nothing menacing at all. He was afraid of the young girl and almost begging and crying face to face with the leader of the gang (who were those guys anyway?) but should have been a cold hearted and legendary murderer across several states? These lacks of logic and some boring points throughout the whole movie could not have been hidden only by a few sympathetic word plays or jokes throughout the whole flick.When there is a random story with many coincidences and less convincing characters, even the greatest actors, the best movie score and the most beautiful landscapes can't quite help to completely save this movie. I would have preferred a more original or even unique story and not a remake of a rather average western. I think that the talent of the actors was wasted in this unoriginal movie. Only those actors save this movie from being an absolute faceless average Western like \"Appaloosa\" or worse. That's why I don't really understand the whole hype about this movie. I would only recommend this flick to collectors that would absolutely see any film with Matt Damon or Jeff Bridges and those who adored the original flick. But sadly, the great times of the brilliant westerns have gone a long time ago. With this kind of movie they won't come back either even if I would hope so.",

Who would ever have thought! He certainly didn't look his age. But these remarks are quite petty.

(Full disclosure: it has been at least thirty years since I have seen the 1969 film, but I recall liking it a great deal) Matt Damon and the supporting cast were fine. But Hailee Steinfeld stole the show. She, and the role she played, were utterly outstanding. Kudos.A note about the much-commented on use of language. It was all quite formal, and it really set the atmosphere of the film, establishing that this was a different time than our own. Of course no one really knows how people spoke back then, but I suspect that a lot of people did speak more formally in those days, at least educated people. But I suspect that many others did not, whether from lack of education or temperament.Anyway, this is a fine film, even with a few plot holes, and I recommend it.",

This time they succeeded, where in 2004 their attempt to remake \"The ladykillers\" (1955, Alexander Macjendrick) failed miserably.This time no \"neo film noir\" from the Coen brothers, but a Western. A courageous choice, because the Western was seen as a genre at the brink of extinction at that time.The film is about the hunt on a contract killer (Tom Chaney played by Josh Brolin). This hunt is undertaken by Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), a 14 years old girl whose father has been killed by Clancey, and marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). The marshall is pragmatic even leaning towards opportunistic. The girl is pertinacious of the \"an eye for en eye\" kind of type. Their interaction is the driving force behind the movie. At the end of the movie they are both damaged (although in different ways) but have come closer to each other.The film has an undercurrent derived from the Old Testament. It is no accident that is starts with a quotation from \"Proverbs\" (28:1) \"A wicked flee even though there is no one to pursue him\". This quote definitely relates to Chaney. The film does not quote the sequel \"A righteous man feels as safe as a lion\" which would be a pretty accurate description of Mattie.From the John Ford Westerns we know the beautiful landscapes of Monument valley. \"True grit\", which was shot in New Mexico and Texas, has many beautiful landscapes too. Highest praise deserves cinematographer Roger Deakins however for a scene in which Mattie has been bitten by a snake and Rooster Cogburn tries to reach medical help in time. The heat of the moment, the sweat on the skin of the horse and the starlit skye all add up to a few magical minutes of film.",

They are totally 1970s in their contrived formula for the most depressing thing they can think of, which is exactly what the self smug, self righteous geek in the caf\u00e9 always concocts.But here, they finally get in touch with the times, in the remake of the Western drama-adventure in which a very young girl enlists a rogue lawman and a handsome Texas Ranger to help her find her father's killer.The original TRUE GRIT stood out in its era, not so much because it was great, but because it was about the only film of the era which was true to the alleged \"reality\" the directors preached. Most Westerns of the era were one dimensional caricatures. In fact, they were so goofy that the John Wayne westerns came across as the most realistic in terms of characters.And the Coens manage to finally come up with an action film based more on a realistic look than one based on \"contrived hate and depression\" that only raving lunatics could enjoy.Here, they stay very close to the original. They give it just a touch of their own individual treatment, without going overboard, and that works. This is not a \"groan\" invoking movie.It is very watchable.The key is the one eyed fat man, of course. And Bridges, I dare say, is a bit better than the duke in this role. He is hilarious and credible at the same time. In fact, he'll probably remind you of someone you know personally.The other characters are good, too. The ranger is an improvement.However, the young girl sounds more like someone reading lines. She looks like she was cast for her looks, making you wonder if they were looking for a model instead of an actress.The direction of the lines is good, as we get a realistic stress of words that makes us feel these were eighteenth century Americans.However, the girl runs through her lines faster than a person could possibly think of the words. Hence, she really just seems to be reading memorized lines.But overall, it is a decent movie. My score of 6 is above average. I gave the original a 7. I am a harsh grader. For me, 5 means average. I give it a 6, because it was watchable and pretty well done, but I certainly don't feel any inclination to ever re-watch it.If you like this, you should like the original, and if you like the original, you should like this.

Although slightly different in style (this movie utilized a more authentic cowboy language and a more direct, flattering and less intense storyline) but the mechanism of the flow of plot was truly an award-winning effort.Also contributing to the movie's unforgettable moments was a strong cast, particularly Hailee, whom I thought was placed in a wrong Oscar category as she seemed like a main actress, having more time appearance than her 'main actor counterparts'. She reminded me of the strong-willed, hard-headed Trixie (Deadwood) without the constant swearing.The Coen brothers did made some bad movies, but TRUE GRIT was a masterpiece in rejuvenating the classic cowboy behaviour and it was truly an enjoyable experience. It is not a heavy movie to watch, but the issue of 'grit' faced by each of the 3 companions throughout the movie is something we all can relate to in real life.",

They lose their way and make some real stinkers ( Robert De Niro being the obvious example). Jeff Bridges is the complete opposite. The older he gets the better his performances are and despite his age he tends to star in more Oscar nominated film that most. He is superb as Rooster Cogburn , the US Marshall who is out to kill the man that murdered the father of Mattie Ross , played by Hailee Steinfeld and what a mature acting display we see from her. This is directed by The Coen brothers who are on a roll at the moment with films i really have enjoyed , which is a surprise as I'm not keen on a lot of their earlier work. All in all , True Grit is an entertaining film that is really hard to dislike and although nominated for best picture at this years academy Awards , its unlikely to win but i do hope Hailee Steinfeld wins an Oscar for best supporting actress because i think she deserves it .",

Jeff Bridges does a fine job creating a real human being, not just a caricature, which would have been a lot easier. Matt Damon is very good playing his exact opposite, a very understated character.To me, however, the most striking thing was some of the cinematography, which was really very beautiful. To me, it really went a long ways toward creating the atmosphere of the later part of the movie.What I liked least was a lot of the dialog. Yes, people wrote in that very stilted style then, even those with little education. But to hear dialogue like that I find strange. And, frankly, many of the actors seem uncomfortable delivering it. At times the language becomes much more natural, as when Matty and Clancy are arguing in the river, and you notice how much more natural the delivery becomes. In a sense, it is like actors, even perfectly good actors, trying Shakespeare for the first time: they don't know yet how to make the very different language sound like the everyday language of the characters.As a result, and as when you have actors trying Shakespeare for the first time, a fair amount of the dialogue gets lost.Still, I enjoyed this movie and was never bored for a moment.

            "content": "The Coen brothers have always existed as somewhat of an anomaly. After two trailers and more than a dozen of their other films, I thought I knew what to expect. I did not. Granted, I came into the film fresh off of the high from No Country for Old Men, assuming a more serious form of Western with snippets of humor thrown in here and there to break up the tension from the stunning visuals. In regards to True Grit, I have not read the book, or seen the original film (quite intentionally, and contrary to burning desires), but I believe Joel Coen when he said of Portis's novel, \"the book is just an oddity. It's a very odd book.\" And coming from a Coen, that statement, in itself, is quite odd.But astute. The intelligent, well-spoken Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) takes it upon herself to exact revenge upon her father's bumbling killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), eventually enlisting the help of a drunken, cantankerous marshal, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), and, by sheer coincidence, a longwinded and highfalutin Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). The film is not only at times an honest and non-prescriptive look at the nature of violence, morality, and law, but also one hell of a laugh riot and bloodbath.To be honest, I should have expected the sheer volume of humor from a Coen film, but with the sparseness of it in No Country for Old Men, I wasn't expecting hilarity that beckoned back to the constant laughs of a film like O Brother, Where Art Thou. And the Coens give the audience permission to laugh quite early, deflating the seriousness of a few men's final words at a hanging, shortly followed by funeral parlor humor. In fact, rarely is there a scene that doesn't offer some sort of laugh, no doubt in part (a big part) to Jeff Bridges' drunken, cantankerous, no-nonsense marshal and, on frequent occasion, his banter with the self-aggrandizement of the prideful LaBoeuf.The Coen's have been making great films for a long time, but this one seems right up there with No Country and Fargo. It combines incredible wit with grave seriousness, and all without being didactic. Around midway through, Rooster is quite drunk and listening to a conversation LaBeouf seems to be having with himself about the nature of morality and law. He speaks of the distinction between malum in se (wrong in itself) and malum prohibitum (wrong by due to law). For the casual viewer, a scene like this might display value for its humor, since Rooster consistently spouts drunken vitriol at the tongue-flapping defensiveness of LaBoeuf, who slurs ridiculously because he nearly bit his tongue off in a scuffle moments prior, but the philosophy could titillate the serious viewer as well. There's something for everyone in this film, and that seems to be what the Coens have begun to master nearing their 30th year of filmmaking.One could ruminate upon the distinction between the instinctual hunting of a man from Rooster, or the calculated rule-following tendencies of a man like LaBoeuf. Near the end of the film, Josh Brolin arrives to surprise the hell out of the audience, along with Barry Pepper, by playing their criminals either sympathetic, in Chaney's case, or as caring in spite of their lawbreaking, in Ned Pepper's case. It becomes clear that the characters seem trapped by the roles they must fulfill: bad guy, good guy, vengeful child, perhaps because that is the law of the plot, a law that cannot be broken. Unlike many of the films released this year, the Coen's True Grit begs for a second viewing just to appreciate the nuances in character and theme, in spite of the entertaining distractions.The only possible issues that I can even see people having with the film are its music and the ending. The music is oddly religious through a collection of stylized church hymns but, in spite of a quote from Proverbs at the beginning of the film (\"the wicked flee when none pursueth\"), religion seems largely nonexistent from the film. Perhaps that's the point, and the letter of the law versus the spirit of the law is an underlying point, but it seems more incidental than intentional and, overall, distracting. The ending, as well, seems unnecessary. By the end of the film, Hailee Steinfeld has proved herself as Mattie Ross, and her adult actress far from fills her shoes in the limited screen time she has. It serves to show only that she's endured irreversible consequences from her adventure and that she's always appreciated what Rooster did for her. I could tell that from the ending of the story proper, without the needless addition of a coda.But these are trifling concerns, and didn't in the least sour my viewing of the film. The Coens' True Grit is a wonder, and I hate that I have to wait to see it again. So often, a Coen film is such a visceral experience, and True Grit didn't disappoint. I want to go back to that world, feel the dust in the air, hear the bones crunch, and smell the alcohol on Rooster's breath.",

            "content": "True Grit is the new film from the Coen Brothers, not a remake of the 1969 classic starring John Wayne as \"Rooster\" Cogburn, but a new adaptation of the Charles Portis novel. A new Coen film is always of interest, but does their version of True Grit cut the mustard?The film follows 14-year old Mattie Ross (an impressive feature film debut from Hailee Steinfield), who sets out to avenge the death of her father at the hands of hired man Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She enlists the help of the aging and mostly drunken Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a US Marshall who has, as she sees it, 'true grit.' Accompanying them is Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who is also in search of Chaney. True Grit is not really a surprising film for the Coens to have made. After all, they have done straight thrillers before, most recently with No Country For Old Men, and most of their films are in fact period films set in the past. However, whilst No Country For Old Men managed to be an intensely affective thriller, its real achievement was its outlook on life, which lent the film a depth and a resonance that was there if you wanted to see it, and gone if you just wanted thrills. The main problem with True Grit is that it has very little depth and no resonance. Excitement it does have, with plenty of nasty characters and several bloody shoot-outs. It is full of good performances that give real dramatic weight to the outlandish characters. The central relationship between Mattie and Cogburn is well handled, as is Damon's secondary role. The Western landscapes are fantastically well shot and the period is skilfully imbued with a sense of eerie danger and reckless cruelty. However, as a whole, the film doesn't hold together. Many scenes feel like comical interludes from other films and many more serious sequences are handled as if they have much more import than they really do. The writer-directors approach these scenes as if they are key to the film as a whole, but it always remains unclear exactly how. In the end, the film feels completely lackadaisical, almost as if the Coens made it up as they went along and only permitted one draft.The characterisation of Tom Chaney is one of the film's more obvious problems and is an indicator of what is wrong with the whole film. Absent for most of the film, his entrance is long anticipated but ultimately rather forced. He is neither the chief villain in the film nor is he a concrete character. He appears neither evil and pitiable, a non-character who is presented in an unfocused and poorly judged light. The lasting impression is that he, like the film, doesn't make any sense. True Grit goes for dark and, for the most part, achieves it. But the typical Coen humour seems forced, clich\u00e9d and not very funny. Many of the scenes set a palpably sinister and brooding tone, but nothing is ever made of it. It feels like the Coens did a lot of research to get a powerful level of authenticity into the film but then, when the time came to write the script, opted to prioritise making good use of the research than writing a coherent story. To a big fan of the Coen's, this film was something of a disappointment. Perhaps the problem lay in the tackling of a time that they knew little about, or maybe it is evidence that Hollywood just can't figure out exactly how to make a proper old-fashioned Western anymore. As good as the trio of lead characters are, True Grit feels like a film that was considered much too highly by the talented but momentarily lost duo. A step down from A Serious Man, maybe the film would have been better if they had taken a little more time in pre-production. For more reviews for latest releases, check out filmwhinge at blogger.",

Haley Steinfeld is a revelation in this movie. I think it was Nicole Kidman who once said that children don't act they do as they are told (when it comes to acting) and to an extent I agree with that statement but have to take an exception with this film (as with the career of Dakota Fanning thus far) some children are just born gifted and the gift of acting is very apparent in Steinfeld who essays the role of a child who has become a product of her environment and is now hell-bent on avenging the death of her father with the help of a hired bounty hunter played by Jeff Bridges in fine form.

The character development is also very strongly done for the three main cast. And that also adds up to the comedic situation when they happen. The acting overall for me is indeed a good one. Jeff Bridges doesn't lose his crazy antics from his days at The Big Lebowski. Matt Damon acted out the Texas Ranger character a little bit flat here. Hailee Steinfeld did very well in living out her character in opposite of senior actors. Josh Brolin and Domnhall Gleeson adds up nicely even with their small roles.",

I'll leave the jury out on Glenn Campbells acting capabilities. In the original the character of Rooster Cogburn was more rounded, he had sense of humour and friends, a Chinese man and a cat. I personally have not got much time for re-makes, all of the ones I have seen have invariably fallen short of the original, and this film is no exception.",

Unfortunately, I do not think it is a great western, or a film in general. First of all it lacks the philosophical depth of questions posed, like pre-destiny, the physical and moral nature of the Universe or randomness - that lie underneath Coens' other, more notable efforts. True Grit seems to exist only because the Coens felt like making a western, there is nothing more to it, it is what u see and hear and nothing more. The story is not profound or complex, it's basically a chase after a killer. The girl acts well but her character is too smart, too tough to feel real. There is a lot of talking in the movie, mostly hard to understand, but it is neither deep nor interesting enough. I read opinions that this is such a \"realistic\" western, but it comes short also in this respect. The scene when the guys argue who is a better shot and they shoot to pieces objects in the air is very unrealistic, taken from some lousy westerns. I read from several sources that in fact the colts and other revolver guns used in the Wild West were very unreliable, imprecise and they jammed often. It was not easy even to shoot a man from 20 feet afar, never mind shoot a little bottle flying in the air. I think in this respect and several others True Grit is not in the same league as Unforgiven by Clint Eastwood. I do not understand why the Coens decided to re-make True Grit exactly, as the original did not seem to have a very interesting script in the first place. And the political correctness regarding animal cruelty does not allow for any horse to be shot during the several shootout scenes when it would make perfect sense to aim for the horse rather than the rider.",

            "content": "Last night I watched the 1969 movie version of this book and then just had to read it again. Much like seeing the east side of the Cascades as you drive west towards Seattle, there are scenes in the movie that simply take the air out of your lungs (it was filmed in Colorado). It made me homesick for the mountains of Washington, the playground of hiking, climbing, and mountain biking I left behind four years ago when I moved to Spain. After watching the film for only the second time (I saw it the first time when I was 11 at a drive-in) I stayed up until 4 am reading the book from a PDF I found on the web.The book is narrated in the no-nonsense, straightforward fashion you would expect from a good journalist, as Portis was before he gave it up to write fiction full-time. He has a great ear for dialogue and he obviously researched the speech of the era as there are many phrases and words that are now out of use or just impossible to invent. Folks just plain spoke different back then, something Portis was keen on having us hear. Take this little exchange:\"I don't believe you have fifty dollars, baby sister, but if you are hungry I will give you supper and we will talk it over and make medicine. How does that suit you?I said it suited me right down to the ground. I just don't think you could make up a line like \"right down to the ground.\" That Portis was a newspaper reporter shows in his attention to details like this small one (but all details, big and small, are important, of course). I suppose that I take more notice to Portis' ventures in language because I am up to my own eyebrows learning Spanish and I subconsciously am translating everything I hear and read into castellano, as it is called here, mostly. And evidently Portis was a bigger fan of the Duke than I because he wrote the character of Rooster Cogburn with him in mind. The author also had a fair ear for humor of which the novel and both movies abound.I found myself one pretty spring day in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in need of a road stake and I robbed one of them little high-interest banks there. Thought I was doing a good service. You can't rob a thief, can you? I never robbed no citizens. I never taken a man's watch.\"\"It is all stealing,\" said I.\"That was the position they taken in New Mexico,\" At least both sets of film makers have enough wisdom to recognize the wisdom in the book.The original movie certainly isn't perfect, not by a long shot. But any criticism of it would be like criticizing the way people talked back in the 1880's. Films are different today, mostly better in my opinion. There are some problems in the 1969 version with some of the side characters and bad acting. The musical score is sometimes bombastic and annoying. The first five minutes which recount the murder of Mattie's father are tiresome and have been wisely excluded in the Coen brothers' remake. More than anything the 1969 movie is absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. The old movie has a better and more satisfying ending than the new one which follows the book more closely. The old movie is pure Hollywood, not always a pejorative, especially in this case.\"You're too old and too fat to be jumping horses.\"\"Well come and see a fat old man sometime.\"",

Now as a fan of the Cohen's earlier work but not so much of their recent output I approached this film with caution and I was right to, its not that it's a bad film it's just that it isn't that good either. It looks fine and is acted well but the pacing is all wrong, you never really get to spend any significant time with the characters so you never develop a relationship with them which leaves you ultimately feeling empty and cold. It is also hard at times to understand what anyone is saying in their southern drawl which also doesn't help. Add to that the bizarre quirks like the weird tourette's guy and the bear man and the ending that just comes abruptly from nowhere and it's a strange watch.

Both Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld are truly incomparable and their performances will raise the bar on your idea of what's possible on film. The original True Grit suffered from several flaws nowhere to be seen here. Is that a measure of our collective maturity? I suspect it is though that's not to deprive the Coen brothers of their just due, which is considerable. I have no idea how they found the perfect Mattie though I understand they went through thousands of auditions. Still it would have taken enormous personal luck, the kind only good karma can supply, to have found someone as dead on as Ms Steinfeld.My biggest complaints are that Josh Brolin's role was far too small and I found Matt Damon's performance somewhat out of place though I imagine both were directly out of the novel. Even with a good movie in a 2-hour film I'll check my watch at least once to see how much longer it has to go. This time I checked once out of fear it would all end too soon.",

Others say don't compare the two films, but to me that's seems impossible. They're so much alike (right down to the same lyrics in some scenes), that trying to separate them would seem to me to be an exercise in futility. The acting is first rate (Seinfeld is amazing and in my opinion carries the film even more so than Kim Darby does her version), but the story is almost boring and proceeds at a much slower pace. It does have it's funny moments (as does the earlier version), and as with all movies made now (as opposed to 35 years ago), virtually everything from the art direction to the costumes, to the violence, is much more life like. But much is missing from this movie that in my opinion adds much to the story. I won't spoil it for anyone by adding specifics, but I'm pretty sure that many would agree. I waited until this was available on video so I could watch it in my own mini theater, and I'm glad that I did. If I had spent $7-$10 to see it, I'd be REALLY bummed.",

            "content": "As a rule I don't put any faith in remakes, ever. Especially if I didn't care for the original. 'True Grit' is now one huge exception.Joel and Ethan Coen are two of my favourite writer/directors of all time with their unique blend of intelligent storytelling and surreal comedy, so you might think that I am biased in what I say but I put off watching this film for some time because it just wasn't important to me. Plus, I never go into a film with who made it in mind.What I gathered was that the Coen brothers would have taken a more sensible and conventional approach to this remake of a John Wayne Classic and I was right. There is none of that trademark surreality associated with the Coens.But I didn't go far enough in my assumption by guessing that this was in fact an updated adaptation of Charles Portis' classic novel rather than a remake of an old western movie. What we have here is one of the finest westerns I've ever seen... in my opinion! Young actress Hailee Steinfeld provides possibly the finest child performance I've ever seen (or will at least admit) as she portrays the 14 year old Mattie Ross, a girl looking intelligently and methodically to bring her father's murderer to justice; the outlaw Tom Chaney.To do this, she seeks to enlist the services of grizzled old drunk US Marshall Rueben 'Rooster' Cogburn over the confident, strict and matter-of-factly Texas Ranger LaBoeuf. But when Cogburn and LaBoeuf join to collect another withstanding bounty on Chaney's head, ordered by the Texas court, Ross refuses to see Chaney hang in Texas and stubbornly sides with the two lawmen to see that she will avenge her father's death.The trio quickly become conflicted with one another, which puts them in more danger than they expected! 'True Grit' reeks of authenticity, almost as if the John Wayne classic never even existed but then saying that, Jeff Bridges' handling of the iconic role might not have been so well appreciated but then that would have to be one tough audience as Bridges displays some of his finest ever acting. You may laugh and you may cringe but you may almost smell the whiskey on his breath and the sweat beneath his arms.Joel and Ethan are superb directors, though, and if you've seen the majority of their films, you'll feel something of a family atmosphere if you don't see their appreciation for their cast so clearly.Jeff Bridges and Josh Brolin are familiar with the directors, thanks to their iconic roles in 'The Big Lebowski' and 'No Country For Old Men.' Matt Damon belongs to a fraternity of popular actors who have been able to express their character skills more freely with a Coen film than with your average feature (George Clooney and Brad Pitt).Damon's performance isn't extreme but it's a nice contrast to his previous and more recent works and it's a joy to see him acting more methodically, as does everybody in this film, notably also Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper. I'm not a fan of Period Drama but this is as close as I get.'True Grit' isn't an action western but it has plenty to keep you preoccupied, it's a full-on story that deals with the issues of how hard people have to be to get by but it doesn't preach it to you. It also somehow captures the feel of old 50's/60's westerns yet doesn't alienate people who have little interest for them.I give 'True Grit' a 9 out of 10 and all because it does what it says on the tin. It defines itself!",

Texas Ranger LaBoef (Damon) joins them.We are told this version of True Grit is based more upon the book. I didn't see much difference between this and the John Wayne version. They are basically the same. However, there were a few directorial changes (additions, omissions) I saw, but I did notice something kind of out-of-place: the lines given to Hailee Steinfeld as she recited them sounded more like she was reading poetry or that a writer from the Deadwood TV show came in and gave her that cadence to spew out. It was annoying in Deadwood and it was doubly annoying here. Is that what they meant by this version being more in tune with the book? At times she wasn't the only one to spew that cadence as Matt Damon as LaBoef had a couple shots at it too. Did author Portis write those words in such a way, they would sound like a poetry reading, or some kind Shakespearian Iambic Pentameter verses in the book? If so, I can well understand and like better the John Wayne version which was more conversational and real.The other thing not noticeable unless you know it, and I do, from reading about the John Wayne version and that is that Kim Darby who played Mattie Ross was 21-yrs old when we were all told the character was 14-yrs old. In this version, Hailee Steinfeld probably was 14-yrs old. No biggie, but the cadence given her most of the time had her acting like she was 40. Yes, I cannot get over that out-of-place cadence. Sorry. To be honest I didn't see much difference between the Rooster character in both John Wayne and Jeff Bridges. They were the same. To be honest again, Bridges portrayal made us think of John Wayne a lot during the movie. That shouldn't have happened. Maybe it is the way the character was in general and I felt Bridges was channeling Wayne. However, his performance was still excellent and worthy of an Oscar nomination and I am again being honest. One of the things about western movies is that, most times, you see a lot of wonderful scenery. Here, they showed some, but could have and should have shown us more. They forgot that the scenery is also a part of the story. Bummer. The other thing I noticed was that there was no memorable music. Another bummer. But, over all, this was still very good. Had there not been a John Wayne version, we probably would not have noticed any difference. Well, except for those annoying cadences that is. But, you see all the trouble a remake does regarding comparisons etc. If the Wayne version was good enough, why bother with a remake especially since the remake was basically the same except for some minor differences. But, for my money, the John Wayne version was totally good enough and I am being honest again. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No f-bombs; one GDI was heard",

            "content": "The Coen brothers can always be counted on for some interesting cinema and \"True Grit\" is no exception. Here they revisit the 1969 film that won 'The Duke' his sole Oscar. It isn't a straight remake, though, since they stick closer to the novel by Charles Portis.The story follows teen-aged Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) as she seeks to recruit a man with 'true grit' in order to bring her father's murderer to justice. She eventually finds the man she's looking for in U.S. Marshal 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). He teams up with a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) who's tracking the same man but neither are thrilled when Ross insists on accompanying them.The aforementioned cast members all do a fine job, especially Steinfeld & Bridges. Josh Brolin plays the villain, Tom Chaney, but it's a role with little substance. Barry Pepper plays the leader of the outlaw band, 'Lucky' Ned Pepper, and at times it seemed to me like he was channelling Robert Duvall, who originally played the role.As far as I'm concerned, the film's biggest drawback is the script, particularly the dialogue. It's all very formal, with the effect that some of the performances seem artificial. People have suggested various reasons for this but I could have done without this eccentricity on the part of the Coens. Apart from that, the script is pretty good, though the plot's close enough to the 1969 adaptation that I have to wonder why the Coens even bothered.As for the visuals, they are stellar, as you might expect from a Coen brothers movie. Roger Deakins' cinematography is exquisite and the direction is well-handled (jointly) by the brothers. Musically, Carter Burwell's score is pleasing though not as striking as his scores for \"Fargo\" or \"Miller's Crossing\".Ultimately, \"True Grit\" is worth watching but you could end up being irritated by the dialogue like I was. Also, if you've seen the original you may find that you've already been there, done that for the most part. Overall, not a bad movie but overrated, at least for the moment.",

The acting is good, as are the sets and costuming. The editing too is quite smooth and effective. However the Coen brothers show their urban roots in their inability to shoot the countryside effectively. The Wild West in their hands is a rather tame and enclosed place.Whilst Jeff Bridges is usually an excellent actor, he mumbles his words so much in this film that understanding more than one word out of two is difficult. Hailee Simpson puts in a good, though not brilliant, performance. The standout however is Matt Damon, who shows a remarkable talent for reflective acting. Whilst the Coens use all the technical innovations that the Wayne film didn't have they are unable to replicate the power of the earlier film, which lay in an American optimism that has now collapsed. The most powerful element of this film is the language which replicates the richness and power of the Bible (which was the only common reading of the time).

            "content": "There is no arguing that the western genre has been into a household genre in Hollywood, rostering many, many classics from the days of John Wayne as a classic western hero, to the days of Clint Eastwood in the Dollars trilogy, to the modern day of spaghetti westerns. With Joel and Ethan Coen, the genre-busting geniuses behind some of the best modern day classics, working behind the camera; this remake of the 1969 classic demonstrates a mixed bag of the charismatic style of the Coen Brothers' filmmaking and amazing storytelling brought by incredibly talented writers. This 1880s-set film stations Hailee Steinfeld in the role of 14-year old farm girl Mattie Ross who travels to an old town in New Mexico in search of someone to assist her in search of a vicious outlaw Tom Chaney (played by Josh Brolin), the man responsible of the murder of her father. She reluctantly hires Rooster Cogburn (played by Jeff Bridges), a roughneck U.S Marshal to aid her on her journey. Along the duo comes ruthless Texas Ranger Labeouf (played by Matt Damon) who's also intent on hunting down Tom Chaney, but for his own personal reasons. These three sprawl across the west and encounter some unexpected and dangerous surprises during their chase for Chaney and his goons.The Coen Brothers bless this film with pure maturity and captivating style, and the screenplay takes credit for this. The powerful appeal of the film begins with the solid visuals of the old west, and with Santa Fe desert serving as the backdrop of the old western town; the result is an authentic, moody representation of the old west. Then we are introduced to the main character Mattie Ross who is energized by an astonishingly riveting performance Hailee Steinfeld. She is very mature on her role and her performance and stunning dialogue shines quite powerfully for a girl who was only 13 at the time of filming. It is no surprise that this young teen was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, despite having the most screen time than her main co-star Jeff Bridges who is also very charismatic in his role as the ruthless gun-totting Marshal who was last played the legendary John Wayne in the 1969 original. Matt Damon performs well as the Texas Ranger Labeouf, only its too bad he doesn't quite get all the screen time he deserves. Now the storytelling is what comes as the film's top appeal. The plot progresses at a near flawless pace and builds up to its nail-biting climax. The plot is written so elegantly that no single moment throughout the film ever feels wasted. Plenty of violent gunfights and intense stand offs that pay solid homages to old classic spaghetti westerns, but don't go in expecting a straight forward gunslinging actioner. There are tons of moments rested for plot development. These scenes however, are made up of strong, colorful 19th century dialogue that is written brilliantly.True Grit is an incredible work of art by the Coen Brothers, and easily one of the best films they have brought to the silver screen. This movie is a brilliant successor to the western genre. With the outstanding performances by its stellar cast, stunning writing, and captivating visuals, True Grit is a film worth your time.",

Then, more or less by chance, I got around to reading the book ('68, C. Portis) a few weeks ago and I just about loved it - though at times I found Mattie to be a little much. The other night it was finally time to see 'El Duderino' have his go at Rooster Cogburn...And I had a hard time deciding whether to have fun with him (Bridges as Cogburn) or to be truly intimidated by him (at times he reminded me of in Karl 'Sling blade'), but I suppose that fine line can be expected when one goes on a 'coon hunt' with this unlikely trio. The book is as much exciting and rough as it is witty and endearing, too, but the problem with TG2010 is that I didn't really fall for any of the characters, to wit, the actors. They all do a fine job, but that's about it, mostly (Barry Pepper was my favorite). The same goes for the story and how the Coens approached it. There are plenty of pretty shots, the settings are great, but for the greater part I missed some true Coen magic. The horseback ride (Cogburn riding with Mattie) for instance, d\u00edd have some of that, even though it was clearly done with that obvious blue screen. Another problem was the overly sentimental soundtrack which, combined with some rather misplaced dramatic choices (the trio never split up in the book, nor did Mattie and La'Beef' shake hands, or did Cogburn start telling stories until they were waiting to ambush the Pepper gang). On the other hand, the violence and the dialogues were more true to the book than the '69 version was...So, there's a lot to be weighed here, but that is usually not a good sign. I enjoyed it, all in all, and I'm sure I'll give it another go sometime, but for now a big 6 out of 10 seems adequate. -edit- I just saw it a second time, and my review needs no changes - a decent western, but a little on the sentimental side at times.

            "content": "The latest \"True Grit\" is a worthy film, possibly even a great one. But it's time for a closer assessment of this film as well as the larger matter of movie remakes, which are popular with producers primarily because of a \"guaranteed\" box office draw. In taking on the remake of \"True Grit\" the Coen Brothers might be expected to adhere, albeit it with creative flare, to the original story. A radical make- over would seem especially ill-suited to this film for a number of reasons. Perhaps above all, the original's Dukish screen icon and \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" co-star, Glen Campbell, are sufficiently ensconced in public memory to make a barely recognizable \"True Grit\" seem disrespectful if not offensive. Doing a remake of \"True Grit\" that is more a display of originality than a sincere adaptation would strike critics and public alike as intellectually and artistically dishonest.At the same time, if the goal was faithful adherence to the original, there are far safer bets than the Coen Brothers. The history of these filmmakers includes the off-beat black comedy \"Fargo\" and, more recently, \"That Is No Country for Old Men,\" a film closer to the existential, thought-provoking cinema of Ingmar Bergman than to conventional Hollywood entertainment. Moreover, the original \"True Grit\" had certain elements that by today's standards might be considered sentimental, formulaic, or Disney-esque--i.e. \"dated,\" out-of-step with a new millennium along with its impatient and jaded consumers in a post-modern, digitalized mediascape. Just wait, I told myself, until the Coens bring \"True Grit\" into the hip-hop age. Among today's directors the Coen Brothers, moreover, have established the expectation of making films that are \"off-beat,\" unconventional, utterly unique. As a result, I was prepared for a wholesale remodeling, a barely recognizable approximation, of the original movie, which attained semi-classic stature primarily because it was Duke's last hurrah.By now it should be apparent to avid, inclusive screen-goers that John Wayne is the most outsized, bigger-than-life screen persona in the history of cinema, so comfortable in his own skin that he makes us uncomfortable in ours. To suggest Wayne's mythic proportions the Coen Brothers film Jeff Bridges' in drunken moves verging on overacting while employing their cameras to make Bridges' Rooster Cogburn almost as outrageous as his legendary predecessor but at the same time more believable, down-to-earth, and humorous (reminiscent at times of Shakespeare's Falstaff).The signature of a genuine auteur, as Andre Bazin and his followers argued, is not a film director who has complete control of his project along with the liberties of expressing himself as he chooses. Alfred Hitchock was their hero because he left his personal stamp on each of his films in spite of the commercial, profit-making priority expected of him in each instance. There's a trademark tone, a consistency, a thematic purpose, or worldview, that \"gives away\" a Hitchcock film even to the viewer unfamiliar with the director going in.And here's where the COEN BROTHERS have excelled. Rather than play a bold new hand, they've stayed within the rules and, in spite of long odds, achieved a cinematic triumph that is consonant with the themes of their quirkier, less formulaic films. In the beginning of this new version, the voice- over declaims that as mortal beings we are all beholden to our past actions, each of which will have consequences from which we can't hide. In the end there is no freedom from offenses against society, nature or God; there is no escape because we are all accountable beings: mortality in itself is at once beautiful, unforgiving and deadly. Despite our wishes to the contrary, as Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff reminds us at the end of \"That Is No Country,\" there is no ultimate justice, no \"deus ex machine\" that will, at a climactic moment in our lives, rescue us from the final encounter against which as mortals we may choose to wear blinders and cower in fear; or exit courageously, singing in our chains and raging against the dying of the light.In the original \"True Grit,\" spectators had, prior to attending the film or shortly afterward, knowledge that the film was elegy as much as saga. Wayne's mythic character would not spare him from the cancer he was already fighting. It was in fact our knowledge of that \"human flaw\" that made the title \"True Grit\" stand not simply for the \"exceptional\" man but the \"universal\" one. Much as we hate to admit it, all of us in search of a dramatic rescue or, seeking escapist entertainment in movies, must confront the fact of our mortal existence. Better it be with eyes open and a healthy appreciation of life's bounties than the whimper of a cowardly lion. For some, there may be the consolations offered by religion, but neither the original story nor the Coen brothers' movie goes there. The church, to the extent that it is even visible in a Coen Brothers' movie, is presented as ineffectual, deluded and hypocritical. In its place of salvation lying outside the camera lens is an unflinching representation of the only life that the camera along with human consciousness can know. If it's not enough, it's more than most filmmakers have been able to offer. The Coen Brothers reveal what will be required of each of us at the conclusion of life's journey: the truest grit of all.",

In the first, Kim Darby was much too girlish and appealing to play the rigid, flinty Mattie Ross, and John Wayne was much too John Wayne for me to think of anyone but John Wayne while watching him pretend to be Rooster Cogburn. .This one has been lauded for it's beautiful photography. What beautiful photography was that? The exteriors looked bleached out, and I never really got a feel for where we were in any of it, including the interiors, which for reasons I can't put my finger on right now, looked like they had never been occupied by man nor beast..(And who the hell hanged that stranger forty feet in the air? A rope salesman? \"Climb up and cut him down,\" says Rooster. Why? Why not just untie the rope at the bottom and let gravity take care of the rest, since it had to be just looped over the limb in order to get the guy up there in the first place.)People were people back then, and had emotions, just as we do now. But I can't think of a single line in this film that was delivered along with a convincing portrayal of emotion. I've got a hunch that nobody who hasn't read the book or seen the first movie would have a clue as to what Mattie's dealings with the horse trader were about. All lines bunched together, spoken too fast, and delivered as if by rote. No time at all for the characters to react to what the other character was saying.Charles Portis used no contractions in the book. That was okay, (if not a bit too cute) since he wrote it first person from Mattie's point of view and I could buy while reading it that perhaps the stiff-necked Mattie disapproved of contractions.

            "content": "I finally had a chance to see this. Although it was an improvement on the cornball version with John Wayne, there's a lot of things that simply miss the mark. For one, I understood about half of what Rooster was saying. I know he's supposed to be a grizzled old guy, but being old doesn't make you speak like you have a mouth full of food. Secondly, since when would a 'federal marshall' be allowed to be like that. Just because it was the 1800's doesn't mean there weren't standards. I found the whole character of Maddy just too unbelievable. She's a farm girl living in a rural area - 14 years old - and yet knows the law better than most lawyers. What guy in his right mind, running a business, would be afraid of a 14 year old kid coming into his place and telling him he must deal with regards to the horses. That was just nonsense. Next, the guy hanging from the tree. What was the point of that? There seems to be no point at all. Then the Indian takes the body. Why? Since when did Indians consider a dead body something of value? In fact he sold it to another guy.. why would that guy want a body as well? I will give the movie credit for some historical accuracy when it comes to the weapons and how they were used. The old John Wayne version was totally historically not accurate. No one in the wild west ever dressed like John Wayne did or wore their pistol slung low in a holster like those old time cowboys movies portray. That is pure Hollywood. I liked this movie for what it was but I can't see how it was nominated for so many awards.",

            "content": "Back in early 2010, when the trailers and ads for \"True Grit\" were being released, I started developing mixed feelings as to what we could expect. On one hand, I was very interested, for even though \"True Grit\" had been put on-screen once before, and quite successfully, it was a story worth retelling. Because new approaches could be taken, new moods could be attempted, new styles could be applied. The 1969 version of \"True Grit\" is a minor classic in its own right, but it's not an impeccable masterpiece like \"Vertigo\" or \"Casablanca\" where a remake would only leave you spreading your hands wondering: why did they even bother? So I had some high hopes. The black cloud I saw, however, was spinning over the head of the movie's much-hyped young star, Hailee Steinfeld, playing a precocious teenager who recruits a one-eyed marshal to track down her father's murderer in the old west. I was not about to judge her from clips in trailers, but Steinfeld struck me as out of place and bewildered, not familiar with the camera enough to pull the job off well.Ten months later, the movie left me disappointed. But not for the reason I feared. By contrast, I was kicking myself for my predictions before, as Steinfeld's performance was not only good, it was exceptional, and one of the few watchable elements in this pretentiously longwinded western. \"True Grit\" was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, two admittedly talented directors from Minnesota, who have become loved and drooled over by just about every movie-lover except me. For me, \"True Grit\" contains just about everything I've liked and disliked about their previous endeavors. What I liked: strong craftsmanship and endless ambition. What I disliked: bloated pacing, inanely longwinded and talky dialogue, and dead air as filler between scenes.Hence why I have seldom liked their movies. To deny that these two men have instincts with staging their camera would be foolish, but I've repeatedly questioned those who have written them off as profound commentators of American mythology and morals. The Coen brothers do not just tell stories, they attempt to bury subtext and symbolic commentary into their narrative. In the case of \"True Grit,\" violence in the old west and how, beginning with the dime novels, you might say, most Americans got it all wrong. That it was not a glorious, fun-filled time. This is a movie filled with unpredictable characters, anti-heroes, and villains who are more stupid and half-drunk than diabolical. That's certainly a good ambition. But by the end of it all, I never felt any big resonance about what the movie had been saying, and, frankly, that Clint Eastwood had handled the same subject matter so much better in, ironically, another western called \"Unforgiven.\" \"True Grit\" is not as haunting as it would like to be.The reason? It all goes to the screenplay. The talky, ostentatious, and dulled-out screenplay. As with previous Coen brothers movies, the script for \"True Grit\" is utterly in love with the sound of its voice. Dialogue stretches on and on for unendurable lengths of time, wearing out all attempted profundity or attempted humor, and leaving me wondering just what was all the fuss and commotion about. Take, for example, the courtroom scene where Jeff Bridges, as the one-eyed marshal, defends his decision to shoot two people dead during an arrest. The scene is played partially for laughs and partially to hint that bad times are ahead. But the pacing has feet of clay, it staggers slowly: in other words, it feels like a real courtroom event. The actor playing the defense lawyer, overacting as though in a kabuki theater, poses longwinded questions and Jeff Bridges mumbles back in a tone so low you can hardly understand him.And that's the overall tone of the movie. What the characters talk about is not so interesting that it deserves so much attention. Chats around campfires, and there are so many of them, maintain that drag-and-dribble motif. Crucial moments whisk by without registering an appropriate impact, and unimportant stuff, such as the longwinded dialogue in the courtroom or that insanely bad and unfunny scene with a 'doctor' wearing a bear coat, takes its time in leaving the screen. And the dialogue, quite frankly, is a near self-parody. Since when would an uneducated, dumb-punk cowboy say something as articulate as \"I must think over my position and how I may improve it.\" Or, would a smart little twerp of a girl trapped in the wilderness really say to her rescuer: \"Oh, Mr. La Beouf, how did you happen to come by here?\"Usually, the Coen brothers can boast about good acting in their films. Not this time around. Steinfeld is very good. The other exception is the underrated Barry Pepper, playing the leader of an outlaw gang. As for the rest of the cast: Josh Brolin gives an uncharacteristically dull performance, playing the punk-cowboy as though he had autism, and making him seem like a self-parody as opposed to a dangerously drunken idiot. Matt Damon, also normally a reliable actor, is completely lost and misguided in this type of film. He lacks the physique and completely lacks the charisma. He's not interesting in the role of a Texas Ranger. But worst\u2014and most shocking of all\u2014is the awful performance by Jeff Bridges. Bridges, who is a wonderful actor and did an outstanding job playing Wild Bill Hickock in 1995, resorts here to mumbling behind a stone-faced expression with no concentration. It does not come across as an unpredictable man who could snap at any second, it comes across as Jeff Bridges hamming his way through a movie. The only thing consistent about his role is the way he reminds us how much better John Wayne played the same part in 1969. Yes, John Wayne was just playing John Wayne, but that was a performance in and of itself. And it was interesting. This was not.",

            "content": "After an outlaw murders her father, a feisty 14-year-old farm girl hires a boozy trigger-happy bounty hunter to help track him down. Together with a Texas Ranger, the unlikely trio must venture into hostile territory to dispense some old fashioned Wild West justice.John Wayne famously played Rooster Cogburn to earn his only acting Oscar in 1969 alongside Glen Campbell, Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper. Bridges's portrayal of the US Marshall is more one of a husky and haggard old man than Wayne's simple drunk, but it's a character which suits the world built by the Coen brothers' script. I hardly think Wayne's Cogburn would've made it far in this less stylised environment without the no nonsense approach of Bridges' grouchy straight-talking one-eyed lawman.Hailee Steinfeld (herself only 13 at the time of filming) won the role from a pool of 15,000 auditions and ultimately changed the character of Mattie from a damsel in need of protection to a capable gunslinger you'd rather have on your side in a fight. She's often smarter than many of the adversaries, a point that's proven in one of the first scenes where she barters with a horse trader using his own logic against him to get a refund.Meanwhile, as the crude, cold-hearted and cowardly murderer Chaney, Josh Brolin plays a man who would just as easily shoot his 14-year-old pursuer as he would the tried and tested Cogburn. The scenes in which he appears are as unnerving as they are eye-drawingly unmissable since you're waiting for him to make his dastardly move.The film isn't what you'd describe as a traditional Coen Brothers film - there's nothing eccentric or quirky about it - but therein lies its appeal, since it allowed the cinematic siblings to go all out on the artistic side of filmmaking. Nominated for ten Oscars (including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress, Adapted Screenplay and Cinematography), it undeservedly came away with nothing at all, but when you consider that Inception stole the technical gongs while The King's Speech cleaned up the big prizes that year you realise it was up against some stiff competition.The film drags a little once they find Chaney and there are a few scenes towards the end which might've been better left on the cutting room floor, but it soon pays off in the final 20 minutes so you never feel like your time is wasted. Considering it's a remake (or a 'new adaptation' of the Charles Portis novel), it's one of the Coen brothers' stand out offerings - much better than their atrocious attempt at The Ladykillers! - and truly worthy of its 95% Rotten Tomatoes rating.Best Quote: \"The ground's too hard. If they wanted a decent funeral, they should have got themselves killed in summer.\"",

            "content": "This is an update of a great Western film I remember from my youth which originally starred John Wayne. When a man is killed by one of his hired hands, it's his 14 year old daughter Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is the only one that seems to passionately need vengeance and justice. She hires a mercenary bounty hunter called Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) who is meaner than mean and portrays what she calls 'True Grit'. He begrudgingly joins her (sort of) to track down the killer, a Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), and they are accompanied by a Texas Ranger called LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) as they traverse the wilderness in hunt of their man.Directed by the Coen brothers, this updated version of the film is a great, and more authentic to the source material novel by Charles Portis than the original version way. It feels more authentic to its time in many ways, not just from the wardrobe and scenery, but just in the general dirtiness felt and the hopelessness experienced throughout. Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in this - her portrayal is as gritty as they bounty hunter she's looking to enlist. It's her character Mattie that drives this film, whereas the original was all about John Wayne's Cognurn character. Speak of which, another notable mention has to go to Bridges, he really reinvents the Cogburn character, somehow making him meaner yet more caring, while not detracting from John Wayne's portrayal at all. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin are that good in this film that there are times that I forgot they were the actors behind the facial hair and dirt - and that has to be a compliment to an actor. While there are a lot of positives in the film I also had a few moments of negativity; there were times the pacing could have been better, there were a few minor plot holes, and some of the dialogue wasn't necessary - but all in all the positives did out weight the negatives, and they didn't subtract massive, so I still enjoyed the filmI was absolutely surprised with this update brought by the Coen brothers and I am delighted to see a good old fashioned western movie brought to us in times were superheroes rule the silver screen. I really enjoyed this and recommend it. I'm not normally a fan of remakes or westerns but this was great, a good old fashioned western with a simple story to tell - 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "True Grit is the most sincere film I've seen all year. It features one of the most well written scripts, an close-knit cast each worthy of critical acclaim for their respective roles, and a score that could bring you to tears without even seeing anything on screen. Written and directed by the Coen Brothers (Fargo, No Country for Old Men) True Grit was expected to be great. To me, it's a departure from their usual. We still have extremely interesting characters, quirky situations and scenarios, but more than anything, the film has a lot of heart, something I think Coen brother films in the past have lacked. You won't find a sweeter film all year. That's not to say the film's not rough around the edges, it is. But True Grit could make even the burliest, broad shouldered, John Wayne worshiping men shed a tear.True Grit opens with a voice-over from Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) retelling the story of how her father died just a few days ago at the hand of the coward Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She's a stubborn young girl, and she's traveled from across the land to capture her father's killer and take him back to her homeland where she'll get retribution and see to it that he's hanged. Just a few days 14, she knows she can't capture a killer on her own, so she seeks to hire the toughest U.S. Marshall in town, a man with true grit, a man by the name of Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a man who's killed more men than he could care to count. Along for the ride is a man by the name of LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), a hunter, tracker, and Texas Ranger who's been on Chaney's tail since he murdered a senator in Texas a few months back. Together, they will find the killer, and see to it that he's hanged.True Grit isn't an action film on any level. Most of what transpires on screen involves the relationship between Mattie, Cogburn, and LaBoeuf. While each of the characters begin their journey in pursuit to capture a killer, what each of them find while out alone in the country is much different. Mattie discovers her maturity, her courage, and her heart. Cogburn discovers a relationship, a sense of trust, and a reason for doing what he does. LeBoeuf ends up finding himself, something a true Texas Ranger isn't typically open to exploring.I've never bee a huge fan of Westerns. In fact, I could probably count on my one hand the number of Western's I've actually seen over the years. I feel like the Coen's really captured the essence of your typical country Western affair, yet they've modernized it to appeal to a 21st century audience. The dialogue is dead on, the sets are vast and expansive, and the score is reminiscent of protestant hymns of the not so distant past. The film hits on a number of religious notes, but knowing your proverbs isn't a prerequisite.All in all, there's not much to criticize when it comes to True Grit. It could've used a bit more action and I wouldn't have minded seeing a few more guns go off, but I think it's the lack of disturbing violence that actually set this film apart from the number of violent films we've seen in the past. This simplicity and sincerity in the way the film was shot makes True Grit one of the most honest and successful films I've seen all year.True Grit is a film I fully recommend and by far one of the year's best. Whether your're looking to compare it to the original or enjoy a completely new experience, I don't think there's any way you could walk out of the theater unimpressed with what you've seen on screen.

            "content": "I saw this film on the second day of general release. Turner Classic Movies had shown the original the night prior so I decided to see the new version and compare. First off it's important to note that this should not be called a remake. Other users on this site have mentioned that is isn't as good as the original because it has many of the same scenes and dialogue. Of course it does it used the same novel as its source material. It is not uncommon for a noteworthy novel or play to be filmed more than once. Look at the number of versions of \"Hamlet\" or Sherlock Holmes films out there. This new \"True Grit\" must be judged on it's own. And on that basis it succeeds brilliantly. And yes it it better than the previous version which let's face it was really not a very good film. The production values were amateurish and the acting with the exception of Kim Darby was hammy. Those who call it a classic are allowing their admiration of John Wayne to cloud their judgement. Wayne made better movies and gave better performances in a number of films. \"Red River\" and \"Stagecoach\" come to mind. The Coens version succeeds because it has much better acting and production values and more importantly it follows it's source much more closely and places the emphasis where it belongs on Mattie. The titular grit doesn't refer to Rooster but rather Mattie. And despite Jeff Bridges top billing the real star of this show is Hattie Steinfeld who makes a spectacular debut. Jeff Bridges however does do an excellent job and if his performance seems less memorable than Wayne it's precisely because of the understated manner in which he plays it. Wayne was hammy and mannered, Bridges is all gravelly menace perfectly conveys Roosters boozy weathered demeanor. This is the best western since Unforgiven and one the best films of the year. Especially noteworthy is the cinematography of Roger Deakins and the score by Carter Burwell. Note: I am in the minority when it comes to the Coens, I don't find them to be the most brilliant filmmakers out there the only film of theirs I have liked outright was the hysterical \"Raising Arizona\". IMHO they are hit and miss filmmakers but with \"True Grit\" they have a hit on their hands.",

The movie was decent, but it did not compare to other Wayne movies like: The Searchers (his best western), The Horse Soldier, The Shootist, Sands of Iwo Jima and The Quiet Man.I was surprised that True Grit (rather than The Searchers) was remade.I was hesitant to see this film since it starred Jeff Bridges. Bridges is one of the long list of \"bomb\" makers in Hollywood. After the horrible Tron: Legacy, the pitiful Crazy Heart and the uninspired The Men That Stare At Goats it looked as if Bridges would finally be put out to pasture. Unless you are a fan of the Big Lebowski (UGH) Bridges has not been in a good leading role since Starman in 84 and a really great role since Thunderbolt and Lightfoot in 74. His resume would not impress anyone at any other type of profession.Surprisingly I enjoyed True Grit. While the Coens are advertising that it isn't a remake and that they interpreted the story their own way, it is a remake. Just about every single scene is straight from the Wayne movie, just with different dialog.What about Bridges? He is serviceable as Rooster Cogburn. It brings the same type of performance that John Wayne does, but his Cogburn will not garnish an Oscar.Matt Damon does a much better job in the role of La Boeuf. Damon is much better than Glen Campell was in the original.Josh Brolin is forgettable as Tom Chaney, but then again would you remember Jeff Corey's performance in the original.Barry Pepper is good as Ned Pepper, he is just as menacing and despicable as Robert DuVall was in the original film. Almost the exact same lines also.What separates this film from the original is Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. Steinfeld is 100 times better than Kim Darby was in 1969. Steinfeld raises this movie above what it would have been with the rest of the surrounding cast. She steals every scene and she is excellent in this movie.Because of Steinfeld a 7/10 movie moves up to a 9/10.",

But I find it jarring when a film with very little merit gets so much critical acclaim, even more so when it's a particularly weak creation by two of my favorite directors in the world.The Coens prefer not to call True Grit a remake, but an alternative adaptation of the novel - I even read somewhere that they claim to have never seen the John Wayne film before making their version - I call shenanigans on that. Having never read the novel, I can't tell for sure. But whether or not it was their intention doesn't really matter - as it is, True Grit is one of the most direct remakes ever made, at times almost a shot-for-shot retelling of the same film, and it offers too little to actually make itself relevant in any way.Though there's nothing inherently wrong with that, there's nothing about True Grit that has the Coen feel to it. It does have witty dialog - always a Coen trademark - but the odd thing is, the best pieces of dialog, like the bargaining scene near the beginning, appear exactly as they did in the 1969 version, and they aren't as fresh and sharp as they were back then; in fact, it sounds surprisingly monotonous, which is once again very jarring considering the Coens' usually free-flowing dialog.So what's good about it? Well, the Coens are still professionals, and very talented filmmakers at that. The cinematography and music, in particular, are terrific - much better than the John Wayne version, which is a shame, because it means neither version will ever been the perfect one. Haylee Steinfeld is terrific, the only one of the leads who really nailed her part. Jeff Bridges is as adept as ever in creating a character and sinking into it, but his version of Rooster zigzags between an impression of John Wayne and an impression of Billy Bob Thornton, with some Dude thrown in for good measure (whether or not the Coens did, Bridges definitely saw the 1969 version). Matt Damon is wooden and devoid of any emotion. Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin both deliver, but they're not quite enough.I don't mind the fact that the Coens wanted to make a simple, entertaining western, a homage to the classics of the genre, and not a 'Coen twist' on a western - but if so, they could have picked a novel that wasn't made into a film before. Maybe then it wouldn't feel so ridiculously redundant.",

Every problem can be solved with a gun or rifle. And when shot, one can (1) die quickly, (2)die slowly and provide idle chatter or (3) take a bullet in the most vital spot but survive. It just depends on what the director wants.Hint from the real world: Guns Kill!! Sad.",

It brings a breath of fresh air to the wild West, reviving the gunslinging genre in which we recently haven't seen many films.Starring Hailee Steinfeld, Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon. Steinfeld, a girl of only 14 years old, holds her own with her co-stars. She really shows that she has a lot of talent and I'm sure we'll see a lot more of her to come in future.The cinematography in this film is beautiful, with shots reminiscent of Once Upon a Time in the West obviously paying homage to the great Western films. The story is superbly written, as you would expect from the Coen brothers and likewise the directing is superb. The one criticism is there were a couple of continuity errors, but these probably wouldn't have been picked up by normal movie-goersThis is a fantastic film, but not for everyone. A bit slow in pace, the guy I saw it with got bored of it and fell asleep in one part. But this would be because he prefers more fast paced, up beat films.All in all True Grit is a superb film, once again showing that Joel & Ethan Coen are the best in the business.Find the full review and many more at:http://ingloriousfiction.tumblr.com",

            "content": "I have not seen the original True Grit, but I do know that it is a western genre film starring John Wayne. This creation by the Coen brothers appears to be a parody of that film, judging by a number of factors, above all, the language used by some of the characters (especially those played by Hailee Steinfeld and Matt Damon). Obviously, people living in out in the dusty West, with no access to books, do not talk as though they spend their idle time reading Shakespeare and studying law books. So I am guessing that this is supposed to be not a remake but a parody and that the Coen brothers are once again playing a trick on the audience. It\u00b4s not quite obvious enough to fool everyone, as can be seen by the abundant reviews lamenting this \u00a8remake\u00a8 and lauding the superiority of the original version. But I am fairly sure that the directors are getting a good laugh out of these reactions anyway.",

Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfield) joins with Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and Texas Ranger LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) to bring down Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) the man who killed Mattie's father. It has all the signs of a classic western and includes some trademark Coen dark laughs. The acting from Bridges is great as always and it's fun watching him play a fat drunk cop. Damon is also great (if not unrecognizable) as the uptight LeBoeuf. And Steinfield is great as well as Mattie. As for Pepper as, well Pepper, it's kind of a mixed opinion. It's a western outlaw so, he's not an evil genius, he's not a mastermind, he's not even all that smart at all. He's really just a stupid drunk. And the reason why so many killings happened in the old west happened were because there were a lot of idiot drunks, with firearms. But other than that we really don't see much of him. Chaney is really the man villain so he's the one with the most depth but he doesn't really get a whole lot of screen time either. But to be fair these are really small problems with this film. Because overall it's just fantastic. Bridges gives an excellent performance as always so go check it out.",

Two movies in my top 5 favorite movie of all time. Simply, too much of boring and for most of the time dragged out dialog. It felt like movie had intermissions. It lacked the constant mysterious and realistic suspense like in Fargo and No Country for Old Men. This movie lacked chemistry between characters. For example; between Rooster and Mattie. Also, it had some very unrealistic reactions. For example; Mattie sees her dead father in coffin and she has no expressions on her face; sadness, madness or anything. But, she is so furious to get the killer??? Give me a break.This movie is so typically Hollywood, average, commercial. It relied on those annoying unrealistic garbage coincidences to make movie \"interestingly twist-full\". For example; when Chaney is about to cut Mattie's throat out of nowhere in very last 0.01 seconds LaBoeuf hits him in the head. Grrrrrr! This movie for most of the part is indirect macho rubbish of 3 people; Rooster, Mattie and LaBoeuf; lacking the chemistry. They tried to make it look and feel as it was made in the 60's. I really was hoping to see a new fresh take on westerns as you would expect from Coens.The movie has couple of excellent suspenseful shooting scenes. The very last one and the one where LaBoeuf was shot. What saves this movie is great acting of Jeff, Damon, Hailee and Josh. I haven't read the book. Maybe the book ins't good and Coens should not have picked it. Still, I gave it a 7 because it is a good movie. It is just I expected more from those 2 great directors. :-)",

It does not give a romantic impression of the Wild West with a heightened contrast and eerie whistling score. Instead, we follow a trio of characters as they journey through plains and mountains in the winter months, searching for an outlaw.This is my second (or maybe third) time watching this movie, and it's as slow as I remembered it being. While I tend not to mind slower movies, I have to say I thought this one dragged a bit. Whether this is because of some lack of exciting plot developments, or because of the sleepy performance of Jeff Bridges, I cannot say.I should clarify, Jeff Bridges does not give a bad performance. On the contrary, it's pretty great. He creates a character that is entirely distinct from John Wayne's original, which walks the line between real and fantastical in my opinion. But that doesn't change the fact that listening to Bridge's speak, makes me want to fall asleep.",

True Grit is a thrilling, funny, and blazingly well acted rare great western. I only love two westerns(make that three now): 3:!0 to Yuma(Christian Bale version) and Unforgiven. True Grit is excellent.Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie, a teenage girl who's father has just been killed. So, she asks bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn(Jeff Bridges) to track the killer, Cheney(Josh Brolin) down. Rooster is a major drunk, and there are times when you can't hear a thing he says. They also meet La Beouf(Matt Damon) who wants to catch to catch Cheney too.True Grit is thrilling, and at times, funny. The scene stealer here is Steinfeld, who I think truly deserved the Oscar. The moments with her are the ones to cherish, and lets not forget the great Jeff Bridges. Bridges, if Firth wasn't nominated, would've deserved the Oscar here too. Its even better than his Oscar winning performance in Crazy heart.The film is action packed and at times delightful. You should see it for many reasons, but the performances are the main reason to tune into it. This is one of the Cohen's best, and one of the best films of last year.A",

It's that creative expression in cinema and indeed television is subject to heavy scrutiny, from agencies looking to exploit opportunities to create capital from some controversy. An example of such would be the contrived controversy over the character Simple Jack in Tropic Thunder. The result is a kind of mealy mouthing within scripts to placate numerous sensibilities.This is what I feel must've occurred with the 2010 version of True Grit, all the toothsome material from the book has been omitted, it's in effect, a bowdlerised adaptation. Worse though, is the pointless deviation from the source material which completely guts one scene in particular and seems motiveless.After watching it, my overwhelming feeling was, why bother, why did they actually spend the time an money making this flic? The original version stands up much better as a piece of cinema and interpretation of the novel and has become a something of a classic, albeit a misunderstood one.",

It takes too long to get the show on the road and the beguiling feistiness of Haillee Steinfeld as Mattie is offset by the very UNbeguiling curmudgeonliness of Jeff Bridges as Rooster. Many of his lines (and those of other characters) are lost in mumbling and face-pulling. I never 'got' the appeal of John Wayne - the same in every role, klutzy and clumsy - but at least he was articulate. (Who can forget his Centurion at Jesus's Crucifixion: 'Truly this was the Son of Gahhhd'!) Bridges here reminded me of Robert Duvall in LONESOME DOVE, but his tetchiness is not amusing and appealing in the way Duvall's was. And Matt Damon is wasted in an under-written supporting role.The mumbling spoilt it for me (odd, because Heath Ledger's mumble didn't spoil BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN). Once the chase gets underway, the movie gains momentum, but the performance holding it together is Steinfeld's. One to look out for: a very talented girl.The last 20 minutes have some of the best cinematography ever seen in a western and the ending - and the postscript - have an elegiac quality. For my money, THE WILD BUNCH and DANCES WITH WOLVES remain the best of the 'New Realism' Westerns. This TRUE GRIT is reminiscent of both THE UNFORGIVEN (over-rated) and HEAVEN'S GATE (under-rated). It's visually haunting, well-plotted but Jeff Bridges's turn as Scrooge is tiresome.",

I am NOT writing this review with Westernisms.The Coen brothers consistently produce some of the most entertaining and provocative films in Hollywood. With the exception of The Hudsucker Proxy, which I just could not watch, I've enjoyed every one of their films. The trailer probably was one of the most entertaining and well- cut I've seen in ages, but that means little. This, coupled with the Tron: Legacy trailer made all the Jeff Bridges fans go Whoa Whoa! some time around Christmas '10.In brief, the movie covers a young girl hiring a rogue gunslinger to help her gun down her father's killer. She's obstinate; so is he, and they eventually have mutual respect for each other. Also some ranger tries to horn in on the action and ends up being pretty useful. I can't really tell you much more because that's just about it.So what did we get? Great, strong characters \u2013 CHECK! A modern western \u2013 CHECK. A strong plot \u2013 ehhh\u0085. this is where the movie probably gives some viewers fits. Due to the strong performances all around, I sort of gave this movie a free pass. Jeff Bridges showed his gruff, tough-guy range with a truly\u0085 gritty character *puts on sunglasses*. Hailee Steinfeld was wonderful and I hope to see much more of her \u2013 she reminds me a lot of Jennifer Lawrence. Really beyond the character development, there wasn't much in the story category. There isn't a very clear time or distance scale for the duration and you kind of wonder where they're going for most of the film. What should have been the climax of the film was perplexing. I chalk that up to the Coens being a bit anti- climatic in a lot of their movies, but after all the violence and\u0085 grit\u0085 the big moment we were waiting for didn't really play out in any exciting way. Westerns are supposed to have the shoot out and big finish, not a \"huh\u0085oh.. well\u0085 I... \" sort of finish.True Grit may not have been a Fargo, but it really did entertain. Call me a hypocrite for calling out Horrible Bosses for lacking a plot, but at least this movie had some depth and probably more humor than that so- called comedy. It may not be everybody's cup o' joe, but it's a nice violent spectacle. Oh, and best eye-patch wearing hero since Snake Plissken.",

The writing for this movie is pretty great. For the most part it's original and interesting, and the story flows in a way that one wouldn't at all expect it to. It sets it apart from other westerns, which can be a hard thing to do, especially in this day and age. The acting is pretty great from just about everyone. Jeff Bridges shines in particular, but Hailee Steinfeld, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin are good in their roles too. I was surprised to find that Steinfeld was 13 when she played her character, a 14 year old girl, and she did a great job as this character. The characters themselves are pretty likable as well. They manage to maintain a level of realism and still be fun to listen to and watch interact with each other. Every now and then there's a piece of dialogue that gets thrown in there for comedic effect, but the movie isn't so over-saturated by these lines that it gets annoying, but there's enough of them to keep it fun and add an extra layer to the characters. Plus, they're actually funny, so there's that too.The action scenes are actually pretty great. I have found that the movies I see where guns are used in action scenes can often lack in their ability to interest and engage the audience, but this movie pulls it off pretty well. Most of the time it's due to the camera-work and angles that make it just that much more immersive, interesting, and original. I have but one major issue with this movie, and that is the last 5 or so minutes. It's a forced \"where are they now\" segment that just feels out of place and kind of dumb.I struggled to find a better way to end the movie, but regardless it kind of sucked, and I know it could have ended better Overall True Grit is pretty great, save for the ending. The writing, acting, and action scenes are great, all topped off with some fun and interesting characters. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie.",

The journey the 14 year old girl and her marshal take through the landscapes of the dry forests where each one learns about the other and share a good deal of memories is enjoyable though some may say irrelevant to plot.Cinematography is marvelous expectedly and so is the background, there are no flaws technically nor aesthetically and the non complex, straight forward characters makes this movie one of the most accessible Coen Brothers movie till date.Hailee Steinfeld performance as Mattie Ross stood out.Watch if for Coen Brothers view of the story that includes dark humour in many places and for Hailee's top notch performance.

I've seen both adaptations (remember, both versions are based on the book) and, personally, I think the newer one is better.I know that John Wayne was revered, but it's time for us to be honest with ourselves: John Wayne wasn't a very good actor. Yeah, I said it. He could only play one character (himself) and it was only suitable for two roles: cowboy and soldier.Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is an amazing actor. Look at the plethora of roles he's played. In \"The Big Lebowski\" he was an aging California stoner, in \"Crazy Heart\" he was a country music singer/songwriter (based loosely on legendary, yet not so well-known, real-life icons), in \"The Lookout\" he was a disabled former meth cook on assisted living, in \"True Grit\" he was an old-fashioned, hard-living lawman.So, as much as everyone loves John Wayne, it's time to admit that Jeff Bridges is simply a better actor and his portrayal of Rooster was far grittier (sorry for the wordplay) than John Wayne's portrayal.",

I don't think I've been as bored as I was last night when I wasted 11 hard-earned dollars on seeing this crap.For the record, I was a huge fan of No Country For Old Men. I loved the story, the cinematography, the characters. It was a great movie.True Grit has none of that. Aside from the performance of Jeff Bridges, this movie completely lacked anything that could possibly hold my attention. For me, by far the most aggravating part of the movie was the awful dialogue.I could barely stop myself from laughing throughout the first 30 minutes of the movie--apparently people in the old west never use contractions. The movie is filled with so many awkward \"I do not\"'s and \"I am\"'s and \"There is\"'s that it became an teeth-gnashing distraction. This isn't--oh, I am sorry; this is not--how real people talk, now or (especially) back then, when most people could barely read (yet you'll find they have a much larger vocabulary than the average modern American in True Grit). The script just feels ameteurish at times, and the dialogue is bad enough to create a number of awkward moments all by itself.Finally, I can't believe all the praise Steinfeld is getting for her role. Hers was perhaps the most annoying performance I've ever seen in cinema--from the monotonous, amateurish delivery of her lines to her often strange facial expressions, I don't see how anyone who grew up on planet Earth--and actually paid attention to the movie--can possibly suggest she's worthy of an Oscar. Steinfeld's not even the best actor in the movie. If anything, she's the worst. But hey, she's a kid, right? Let's give her an Oscar just for trying, even though the local high school drama troupe could probably find half a dozen girls with ten times the talent Steinfeld has (and they'll never be recognized for anything).In summary, if you enjoy typical, formulaic Hollywood movies with cookie-cutter scripting and acting, this movie is right up your alley. I guess the reviews prove it; the peons have already started buying the \"Movie of the Year\" hype being pumped out of Hollywood, and it's only January 10th.",

I would think its a excellent film of actions and determination and would recommended it to all who enjoy action, funny or great stories.

The direction of the camera and the scenic landscapes all add depth to the film, accompanied by Carter Burwell's piano-driven score. The story is about a 14 year old girl named Mattie who wants to avenge her father's death but not without the help of a Marshal. She chooses Mr. One-Eye-Patched Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges, who manages to be convincing enough. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also play as supporting (enemies) characters. Ethan and Joel Coen have directed something of a miracle, normally (especially noticeable within this year, thats right...I'm looking at you Single White Female rip-off) remakes are a bad hand which is why it's a miracle because the grand cast works well and their chemistry is warm as a bottle of whiskey. 7.8 It could've been more exciting but so far its a couple of steps above your normal cowboy movie.

            "content": "OVERALL: 7.8 / 10 Plot/Screenplay (minor spoilers): 7/10 Just like the original John Wayne True Grit, the story lineated by encounters; and, just like the old True Grit, they are often uneventful and indistinct. Nevertheless, when action does take place, like the negotiations and gunfights, it does become very exciting; however, many scenes are totally impertinent and don't contribute whatsoever to the story (i.e. weirdo bear pelt wearing \"dentist\", the high hanging man scene, grandma sleeping scenes). Given the brevity of the film, a mere 110 minutes, it seems such a waste to kill the run time with introductions of arbitrary elements for subplot development which unfortunately don't progress at all all.Script: 3/5 The dialogue sounds totally unnatural for the most part; I attribute this mostly to little Mattie Ross' profoundly eloquent mode of speech, which at some points it sounds more like a Shakespearean actor's dialogue than that of a believable 14 year old girl raised in the archaic educational system of the 19th century American West. Other instances of haughty speech are farted out but it plagues only a few characters; nevertheless, it is a great pity that the Cohen brothers spent more time looking in the thesaurus than the original novel when it came to writing some of the dialogue.Acting: 4/5 Next to cinematography, I think the acting, not character development, is most impressive; particularly, Jeff Bridges, Barry Pepper, and Josh Brolin. Their eyeless, toothless, and muffled accents of the rustic American west tough guy personalities will be sure to please any viewer. Everyone else falls more or less into the neutral range. I don't care what anyone says about Mattie Ross being a phenomenal actress and worthy of BAFTA and Oscar nominations; it's the dialogue that drives her character! I dare make such an analogy and compare her, and her ponytailed hair, to the ponytailed teenager Judy Garland in the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Garland possessed such an astounding acting quality that she could to bring an audience to tears by the mention of a phrase while Ross provokes no such reaction and only incites our flattery with a verbal conundrum and pokerfaced countenances. As for character development, I honestly think the horse Blackie developed more than any of the characters, all the way to its death.Score/Soundtrack: 4/5 Beautiful as I've been accustomed to is Carter Burwell's work. True Grit's score reminds me much of the swelling melodies, and majestic orchestral flow of Miller's Crossing (1990) and Fargo (1996) with a pinch of the Wild West. The Iris Dement closing track was lovely and brought well suited closure.)Cinematography: 4/5 Some absolutely lovely shots decorate this film whether you find the wander into a court house or free reining the forest countryside. You can't beat the work of Roger Deakins as he is without question one of the best cinematographers in contemporary Hollywood. Sound & Editing: 5/5 There's very little to complain about when watching a Cohen Bro's movies in terms of editing. These fellows know the ropes and ranks of making a well segued film. The fade to blacks get a little trite but overall it's nothing to complain aboutScenery & Costumes: 4/5 (There's little dissatisfaction these days when it comes to costumes and scenery in a big budget film. I especially enjoyed seeing the 19th century town, courthouse, and home interiors. Nothing extremely impressive though.)31/40 P.S. How many people think the MPAA has some serious common sense issues?",

While I think the actors all did their jobs properly, per the script and director, the whole cast came off like residents of an assisted living facility. Not mentally impaired enough to be institutionalized, but not mentally proficient enough to live and work independently. The young Mattie was the exception, and quite a scene stealer (though do note everyone else came off retarded so that wasn't hard.) To compare, the Fargo cast was a little simple, a little odd, but you knew there was appropriate intelligence behind humorous exterior. Here you don't feel that. My sister actually turned to ask why they were talking like idiots, and I had no answer. Rooster was hard-drinking and tough, and sometimes came off as clever and knowledgeable about his chosen profession, but sometimes was just too weird. Matt Damon actually came off like a certain comedian's (unfavorable) impression of him. As a talkative Texas Ranger, proud and a little out of his depth, he could have been presented more intelligently. The murderer Tom Chaney was most appropriately stupid, and a little crazy, but amongst the cast didn't stand out as such because everyone was so strange. The enjoyment comes from this oddness, because the story is very basic, probably straight from the original film and novel (neither of which I had access to before watching this version.) I would recommend those interested rent the movie, which is what I would do if I could turn back time. Those put off by the Coen Brothers normally, but perhaps attracted by the positive reviews or talented cast, avoid this altogether.",

Bout the only thing I can work out that has their signature in this.

            "content": "Back in the day, most households only had the TV, and you watched everything as a family. My Mother was a big John Wayne fan. So, whenever there was a John Wayne movie on, I was forced to watch it. Well, not forced, but I knew there would be nothing else on the family set. From the time I was a little child, I remember watching The Duke, and realizing I was watching something special. Of course, like any true Duke fan, my favorite John Wayne flick is THE QUIET MAN. I have had meaningful, deep, conversations about this movie with friends over beers in what passes for an Irish pub on the Westside of town. But that is a subject for another day. I want to talk about the ultimate John Wayne Western: True Grit.True Grit features The Scene. The scene that makes John Wayne The Duke! We all know the scene. It's the scene towards the end of the movie, when he meets Lucky Ned Pepper in the open field and tells him he is either going to arrest him, or kill him. Ned politely declines to be taken in, and insults Marshall Cogburn. And Rooster yells, \"Fill your hand you son of a bitch!!\" and the big climatic gun battle ensues. It's just not the line, which is probably the best line in any western, but also the way the Duke delivers it. The look on his face after being insulted by Ned,and the determination on his face during the charge. It is truly an inspirational moment.So, naturally, when I first read online that they were remaking (okay, retelling) True Grit, I had many, many reservations. And when I heard that Jeff Bridges would be playing Rooster Cogburn, and Matt Damon as LaBoeuf, I was worried. Jeff Bridges? Starman? The guy from Tron? As Rooster Cogburn? Blasphemy! And MATT DAMON? That guy in all the Kevin Smith movies? Double Blashphemy!! Well, of course, he would be an improvement over Glen Campbell. Who wouldn't be? And just who the hell is Hailee Steinfeld? Kim Darby was never a favorite, and this role did nothing to change that impression, but I had no idea who this Hailee Steinfeld was. It was the Duke that made the original a great flick. And of course, the story was fantastic. And they kept saying this wasn't a remake, but a retelling of the book. Sure. To say I was under impressed with the new cast would be an understatement. I was not looking forward to this at all. The last time I was so not looking forward to a movie was The Lovely Bones, and that proved I was right to be concerned. And besides, most remakes, well, suck. There just is no other way to describe them. So it goes. Then, I saw the trailer. My curiosity was peaked. It actually looked good. Could they actually remake a classic like True Grit worth watching? Then I saw the trailer again. Wait, was this actually going to be a good movie? With Matt Damon? Would miracles never cease? I was actually looking forward to see this thing. Well, I did see it. Like I said, I wasn't expecting much, but maybe I should have been. This actually turned out to be a pretty great movie. Yeah, great. Jeff Bridges is a worthy successor to the Duke, at least as far as ROOSTER COGBURN goes. He will never replace the Duke, nor do I think he wants to. He wants to play Rooster the way he wants to play Rooster. And he does play Rooster well. Matt Damon, just by appearing on the screen, takes command of the LeBoeuff role. And Hailee Steinfeld played Mattie great. The three of them had great on screen chemistry.There were one or two scenes that were not in the Original version, but for the most part, it was a remake, not a retelling. The \"new scenes\" could have been left off, and not effected the storyline at all. I will have to get a copy of the novel to see how those scenes fit into the story, as it looks like they might have a little more to do with the plot than what is revealed in the movie version. That is often the case. You watch a movie version of your favorite book, and you see nothing wrong with it, but someone who has never the read the book will look at a certain scene and say it didn't belong in movie. There are several cases of this in The Lovely Bones, and I am curious to see if this is the case with True Grit. Then there is The Scene. Like I said earlier, The Duke aced it. Jeff Bridges just misses that mark. A great scene, and great acting, but the facial expressions just fail to make the same impression. The impact just is not there. So it goes.The ending to this remake is just flat. It was like the producers looked up at the Camera and noticed they were running out of film and decided they had to wind this thing up pretty quick before the spool ran out.They just left some very important plot items just hanging, and tried to explain it away with a voice-over in the final scene. It just didn't work. It was a let down, a disappointment in what turned out to be a pretty good flick. Other than that, my personal opinion is that the Duke would be pleased with the remake. Again, I make it a point to call it a remake and not a retelling, as both movies are very similar on a lot of points. There are differences, just not enough to call it a re-telling. Check it out on the big screen.",

Normally, I am wary of remakes, but with the Coen brothers and Spielberg behind it ,the omens were good. The former are excellent at dialogue and storytelling, the latter expert in production.The plot is simple, a mouthy fourteen year old girl sets out to avenge her father's death by bringing his killer to justice with the help of a drunken, gnarled Marshall, and succeeds. The success of the film depends upon the interplay between Mattie and Rooster. Hailee Steinfield and Jeff Bridges deliver in spades.Steinfield's portrayal of Mattie is far more satisfying than Darby's was in the original. Darby was boyish to a fault, Steinfield is feminine, brattish, but smart. Bridge's Cogburn is closer to John Wayne's, but his amorality and ruthlessness are cranked up. Matt Damon is satisfying as rival Marshall Lebeouf, Matt Damon animalistic as quarry Tom Chaney. Both parts feel a little underwritten as Cogburn and Mattie steal the screen time which at 110 minutes could probably have been ten minutes longer, the original was almost twenty minutes longer.But the story is told with pace, the landscape cinematography is lush, the townscapes authentic. The dialogue is as sharp and witty as you would expect from the Coen brothers, my only gripe being Bridge's diction which sometimes rendered his lines incomprehensible. When violence erupts it is bloody and graphic lifting the classification to a 15 from the original's U, but it is never gratuitous, and serves as a dramatic counterpoint between the verbal duelling of Mattie and Cogburn.A good story, well told.",

Apart from some directing staples and their standard editing, story is rather disappointingly straight forward and I may say even unrealistic and boring. I was not able to connect with the plot or feel the revenge motive at all. In that sense film is even kind of artificial if you want. Going further on contrary of common opinion I do not believe that 14 years old girl in the 19th century Wild West, would be capable to act so mature and even if she did I do not believe that it will finished for her like shown in movie (the top invention is when she discuss legal issues with crocked merchant - most of the kids of that age will start to cry or show some emotional response but not in this case, she is just going on with legal arguments towards her aim - impressive but unrealistic) . In my opinion the daughter character is one of least realistic that I have seen in serious movies recently and looks more like up to date exercise of what are children today than how it looks like back than.The point is that I did not feel any emotions from the screen while watching the movie, I could not connect either with story or the characters so I do not see anything particularly good about this movie. Here I would take out cinematography and era reconstruction but this is not what can make plot or movie more interesting.To me it seems that now Coen Brothers are getting recognition they have well deserved for their early classics like incredible Fargo or Big Lebovski not to go further. Anyhow if you prefer Wild West realism try with Deadwood which is far better, or with Unforgiven if you want to see catharsis and real juicy movie, if you want to watch average western directed by Coens which will probably win some Oscars, go for this one.Finally as a big Coens Brothers fan I'm even a bit disappointed with True Grit and hoping that next time they will go back to their own screenplay and make some more provocative movie as they did so many times.

I'm talking after watching ''No Country for Old Men'' from Coen brothers too. What a surprise back then! Of course I started to love Josh Brolin there too, Javier Barden a genius!! But.. going straight to the point... thanks Coen guys I'm starting to give Westerns a chance. I knew about this movie and couldn't wait to watch it! Of course it has nothing to do the fact that is starring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin... I'm kidding, they're gorgeous! Jeff Bridges has beaten then all... if there is a Leading actor award, you've got it right here! What a acting, mixing that comedy-drama role, who in the Holy Mother of God can do that as good as him... or at least who can do it? Thanks Jeff for a great movie... then you have Matt Damon, in the 2nd line, you know, hard to say what I'm really thinking... but, well.. after all is Matt D. (what would u expect?)... he was too funny really really funny too, great job there. I was really expecting to see more about Josh Brolin, but, well, he had not such a big part in the movie I guess, but he was perfect too. The girl, a really tough one, you don't wanna mess with her... that's all I'm allowed to say if I don't want to give u a spoiler... my last will... WATCH IT and GET IMPRESSED!",

I must admit, there was more hype than delivery. Don't get me wrong here, I still enjoyed it. I loved the accents. Style was awesome. But yet I felt there was something missing. It's true, expectations were high, but they weren't sky-high. I guess all the Coen Brothers movies have been that good and I just didn't find it up to that level. My call however.The cast is okay. Jeff Bridges is a great actor with a nice smokey voice. He is doing a fine job here. Unfortunately, Matt Damon is not for westerns. At least, I found it out to be a little mismatch. But on the other hand, Hailee Steinfeld was powerful. So pretty and so confy. Very likable and stole the show for me.I don't know, maybe die-hard Coen Brothers' fans find it extremely good. Well, I'm not one of them, so I rate it average with a little plus.",

The cashier struck up a conversation with me and it led to me telling him I was about to head out and see True Grit. He said something to the effect of recent remakes always being inferior counterparts to the originals. I was kind of puzzled by this. I was under the impression that most people watching this movie were watching it because it was the next Coen Bros movie. I have been shocked to find out that this is a widespread sentiment. I'm not sure if these people are not very familiar with the Coen Bros, or if there are way more John Wayne fans than I expected.Nevertheless, this is a great Coen Bros Movie. It has great writing. That is probably 90% of the reason to see this movie. Coen Bros have had top notch clever writing in most of their movies. This certainly is not an exception. The acting is also top notch. Jeff Bridges greatly redeems himself from his Tron Legacy performance. He is fun to watch and great to see acting. I usually don't go for the smart ass kid character in these kind of films, but Hailee Steinfeld really pulls it off well in this movie. There are just so many great lines in this.If you are a Coen Bros fan, make sure to see it. If you are a John Wayne fan, maybe you can give some honor to the chicken-hawk's memory by fighting in Afghanistan in his place.",

            "content": "Sometimes great film makers burst on to the scene spectacularly and sometimes they work their way up from small beginnings gaining more credibility and funding with every project. But there is always the risk that at some point they will believe themselves so capable of creating credible fiction and fantasy that the belief will overcome rational judgement. You have to wonder if some films will ever be remakeable but even if they are. it'll be a lot longer than a mere 41 years. The Ladykillers, The Italian Job, Alfie, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, True Grit, God help us when they decide it's time for a new audience to experience the joy of Casablanca and It's a wonderful life in colour or the magnificence that CGI could add to Gone With The Wind or Mary Poppins I heard a quote from Bridges saying he felt that there was no reason to remake a great film but he'd never heard anyone say that True Grit was a great film. I have considerable respect for Bridges as an actor and would be disappointed if this quote were true, for it shows for all his skill, a lack of heart, a misunderstanding of what makes a film iconic and unique to the point of being unremakeable (at least until every person who saw the original is dead) The Italian Job is one of my favourite action comedies because it never fails to cheer me up, because both Coward and Caine bring qualities to their characters almost indistinguishable from their own characters. So Bridges is a better actor than The Duke but from the accent to the swaggering to the true grit, you are always aware that Bridges is acting in order to bring the character out. Like Olivier as Archie Rice, brilliant actor but you know it's not really him. With Wayne you felt he just happened to have been cast in a part that happened to be him! Like Michael Caine was Charlie Croker surely? and Jimmy Stewart was George Bailey and Tom Hanks( bless him ) was Woody.If there'd never been a 1669 version then this would be a fine film like Unforgiven; IS a fine film like Unforgiven. But there is; and that version will, for a good while yet be \" the real \" True Grit. I Like most of the Cohen brothers films and This is far from poor, but with this I wonder if they've hit what I call the \"Lynch\" point when artistic Genius' start to believe they're as good as the sycophants are telling them they are. Maybe the smoke and mirrors will still carry along the Hollywood image brigade but may no longer fool the public into thinking this is anything other than a less lovable copy of a much loved film, an attempt to hitch their names onto a great title. OK then when's The Magnificent Seven coming out ( please don't tell me it's already a remake )",

            "content": "The sum of my life's experience, which I will not describe today, has conferred upon me a mistrust of all forms of expertise and authority, and indeed a reluctance to take the word of any person regarding any matter at all. For this reason as much as any other I was skeptical when the makers of the film Tombstone explained the elaborate attire worn by the actors in their employ. Those film-makers referred their audience to photographs taken in the era in question, in which most of the subjects captured were indeed clothed in layers of redundant formality. I wondered, though, if their attire was not more a result of what they considered to be a formal occasion--a gathering before a trained photographer for the purpose of an artful portrait--than the result of their habitual dress.Similarly, while marveling at the film True Grit I wondered at the elaborate speech employed by the characters, most especially Miss Ross (Miss Steinfeld). Did the novelist, or the directors, draw their conclusions regarding the words and phrases which the persons in the story would most authentically have chosen, from letters written in the period? If so, it occurs to me that letter-writers of that time might have been exceedingly careful in their language, and might have, like those who posed for photographs, considered something we today consider commonplace, to be a situation calling for a touch of formality. However, I believe you will so enjoy the poetic verbiage in True Grit, and the display of both extensive vocabulary and impressive knowledge, and rather hope that reality has indeed provided them, if only for the briefest of moments, in the distant past.Why you should see it You will be pleased with your decision to do so, I give you my solemn word.Why you shouldn't see it You have wasted your youth going about in low company and now find yourself unable to enjoy, or even discern, finer pleasures such as those the Brothers Coen have given us here, in the form of True Grit.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",

No, i didn't like it. I didn't *dislike* it either since there is nothing really to dislike, but nothing in the film stands out as memorable. The main fault lies in the interaction between the two main characters, and the story - as the story is laid bare before you immediately (fierce girl is getting her revenge ZOMG, old drunkard is no drunk at all, bad guy will fall) , the girl and the old man have their work cut out for them - and nothing unexpected happens. A moment of brief tension is when the *other* ranger seems to challenge them, and i thought \"wow, maybe it will be a triangle, with girl, bad guy and ranger, that's nice\" but no. Sorry but True Grit just hasn't got enough juice for me. When the writing process is so evident to the audience that we can see the next scene happening before it does, something's amiss. Audacity, i would say. Final Vote 7/10, UNLESS you are a western- fan, then make it 6/10.",

The Coen's have a real feel for the settings in which their stories play out and they succeed again here, bringing to life the frontier jeopardies that must have been a daily challenge for the early settlers in the American wild west. Jeff Bridges is billed as the lead star - he does well in his role but it is Hailee's film from start to finish.

I usually love their work, when it is original. I hate remakes. I can't hardly think of any good remakes that are better than the original. I mean there are a few, but very seldom. Some movies should never be remade. True Grit is one of them. The original True Grit with John Wayne, is one of the best westerns ever made in my opinion. It had a great cast, great acting, great music, and a great story. It's almost a perfect movie. But this new one? Good grief, it's almost like a word for word remake. I love Jeff Bridges! But he is not the Duke. Bridges mumbles is speech throughout this train wreck, acting too hard, to distinguish himself as a different portrayal of John Wayne and it just didn't work for me. I hate Matt Damon, both as a person and as an actor. So you already know what I think of his performance. This film receiving 10 Oscar nominations, should let you know just how awful the movie industry has become. I think modern day Oscars are complete political, virtue signaling, arbitrary non-sense but I will say that the original True Grit (1969) won one. And One winner versus 10 almost winners should be all the evidence you need. Do yourself a favor, skip this film and just enjoy the Original1969 film. I don't consider this a Coen Brothers Film. Some of you may like it and that's alright. I suppose I am bias, being such a fan of the original. But I gave an honest review.",

            "content": "It cannot be denied that this film is a western. This includes the Old West setting, gun fights, horse riding, unique trading, and polite humor, but this film does not feel like the old time westerns you might be used to. It is modern, fast-paced, and very entertaining! The most impressive aspect of this film was how modern the film felt. The increased technology and high quality of the film help make this film feel different from the first scene. It is the fast pace of the plot and dialogue help make this storyline feel more relatable to our culture of constant motion and multitasking. Taking all of the usual western elements and transforming them into a film that is relatable to today's audiences is no easy feat, but it was achieved in this film.The casting for this film is phenomenal. Jeff Bridges proves himself as an acting heavy hitter yet again. He transforms himself into this role and makes every word of dialogue, gesture, and movement believable. I was skeptical of Matt Damon in his role as a half-witty, yet cocky, Texas Ranger, but he also appears to have morphed himself in to this character to make it fully believable. His performance/character is also very humorous. He is very clearly the less intellectual of the main characters, but he is immensely lovable. Josh Brolin comes in later in the film to accomplish a great performance as the Old West's \"villain\", but this is highly overshadowed by the excellent performances of the main characters. None of these compare to the performance of Hailee Steinfeld as the hard-headed, witty young Mattie Ross. She appears to be fairly new to acting focused mostly in film shorts and television movies. She perfectly portrays this young girl who will not back down to anyone she encounters.Overall, this film was excellent. It takes the classic story of a western, keeps some of the age-old elements, but adds some modern twists to make it relatable and enjoyable to today's audiences. While it does contain clear evidence of the Coen brothers' brutality and wit at times, I think this film can be enjoyed by everyone (even those who have not enjoyed previous Coen films).SEE IT!!!

That, along with several absolutely unnecessary and pointless scenes, contributed to creating an impression that the writers didn't really know what to do with certain parts of the movie.The pace is quite slow during the whole movie, until the very end where everything is suddenly excessively accelerated, only to be stretched again with another unnecessary scene, without making a point.All in all, this movie is an amusing adventure and should be watched, but not for comparison with the original True Grit.",

It's like stepping into a time machine and truly seeing what post-war, colonial America was like. It is very easy to feel sympathy for all characters in the film, even the bad ones but especially the lead characters.The reason I gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars is because I think this film truly sets a standard and precedence for all other top notch film makers out there. Super-heroes aren't the only new breeding ground for regurgitated creativity anymore. Westerns are in!

            "content": "Now I'm not one for cowboy films or the Spaghetti Western despite my father roping me in to watching repeated screenings from multiple editions of classics like The Magnificent Seven (1960) and The Big Country (1958). However, the Coen Brothers re-make of True Grit (with good ole Spielberg overseeing the project as producer) is timeless in its execution of both its cast and set.The film opens with an establishing shot, first used in 30's cinema, of the tumbleweed, down trodden, good-for-nothing patriarchal cowboy town. One recalls not so much John Wayne, choking at the dustbowl on horseback, but the menacing Clint Eastwood shooting down one deputy after another in Pale Rider (1985). The establishing shots in True Grit (2010) are reminiscent of the ES's we see in Charlie Walters musical re-make of the Grant, Hepburn and Stewart trio in The Philadelphia Story (1940) called High Society (1956) starring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly respectively. However, the scenic views aren't so beautiful yet mesmerising. This is also not so dissimilar from Baz Luhrmann's experimentation with the establishing shot in his recent production of Australia (2008) starring both Kidman and Jackman. There are beautiful panned ES's and WS's of the endless Australian outback.Hailee Steinfeld more than earned her award for best young performer and her nomination as best supporting actress (in the Broadcast Film Critics Association) for her portrayal of the feisty outspoken 14 year old girl who spins us rhetoric far beyond her years. She confronts her male supervisors with articulation and dexterity. They are flabbergasted even angered by her sharp wit and tongue to boot. Even Mr. La Boeuf, proud Texas sheriff (played marvellously by our almost unrecognisable Bourne hero Matt Damon) utters at one point that he doesn't know whether to kiss Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) or give her a good smacking for speaking out of turn. To which Ross retorts, with a perfectly serious and stern look, \"neither would be pleasant.\" Although I am not ofay with the 1969 original True Grit, Steinfeld's character manages to cleverly manipulate both La Boeuf (Damon) and Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) through challenging their egotistical and proud nature; although both males seem to disagree on what is deemed to be right and wrong. The 'trial and tribulations of the famous trio' plot line is a familiar narrative device also featured in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) as well as briefly emerges in the killer couples hit and feminist favourite Thelma and Louise; with the smooth and sexual introduction of Brad Pitt and his 6-pack! Although this platonic bond between our three favourites, in True Gritt, is not without its problems. The camaraderie between La Boeuf and Cogburn is restored when Cogburn saves La Boeuf's life. This reminds me of the climactic scene where the prodigal son (played by Aidan Quinn) saves his father (Anthony Hopkins) in Legends of the Fall (1994).The emerging success of True Grit not only paves the way for the future film career of Hailee Steinfeld, as something tells me she's not going to repeat the Macaulay Culkin disaster, but that the Spaghetti Western genre is becoming ever more prominent and popular among audiences of today. 3:10 to Yuma (re-make of the 1957 classic; produced in 2007) directed by James Mangold and starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, as well as Brokeback Mountain (2005) also starring Damon are both prime examples of this. The latter obviously is more contemporary in its portrayal of the traditional Western genre but its originality was both commended and rewarded for this.For me, the Coen Brothers 2010 production of True Grit would have received 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the peculiar appearance of Ross as an adult woman in 40's/50's. It destroys our vision of Ross as a child character. Coupled with the reported death of Rooster Cogburn, the narrative then appears to lack substance. If this is the Coen brothers attempt at moving the fictitious tale into a legend, it is a poor strategy that should not be repeated.Despite this, and certainly last but not least, Jeff Bridges (nominated as best actor by several ceremonies with some yet to come including the Academy Awards) portrayed as the cantankerous drunkard yet hero-of-the-day is flawless. Casting, setting, characterisation and re-invention of this re-make is purely sublime! You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat from the opening scene! THIS FILM MOST DECIDEDLY HAS \"TRUE GRIT!\"",

Jeff Bridges is a formidable actor but, curiously, he is no star, which great actors seldom are. Great stars Always play themselves and their roles are just different sides of that self (Clint Eastwood is Always Clint Eastwood and whenever he attempted to act the results were catastrophic).Furthermore there might be added that the Music in this film is far better than that in the original and with the end in mind that was, IMO, reason enough to do this remake.",

Even though i am not a large fan of Matt Damon he performed his role very well and played what is quite a simple character in a way that he seemed far more complex. Finally for Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, he played the perfect hard ass, grouchy drunken old man he had to play, i cant compare to John Wayne because as i said previously i had not seen the original. the story is very well executed and told and the one real action sequence in the film in which Rooster faces off against 4 criminals in the finale is a very well done scene which doesn't go too over the top with the action but still entertains. plus its great use of dark humour every now and then because lets face it, dark humour is awesome.overall a very good film, highly recommend it over Black Swan, Social Network (which was okay and is still worth a watch) and the King's Speech.",

            "content": "John Wayne may have been Rooster Cogburn first, but he is by far outdone by the phenomenal Jeff Bridges in the Coen Brothers remake of the 1969 film. The aforementioned directing duo breathe new life into the classic Western tale of a teenage girl who hires a disgruntled former Marshal to find the man who murdered her father.As Mattie Ross, newcomer (at the time) Hailee Steinfeld brings gumption and raw talent as the feisty teenager. Steinfeld shows a guarded vulnerability alongside her veteran co-stars, but she is not second-fiddle by any means. She holds her own by commanding each scene she is in and steals the show from fellow actors Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon. As Texas Ranger LeBeouf is a barely recognizable Matt Damon, providing his brand of cynicism to the mix. Damon is no stranger to being in a Western (having starred in the less memorable \"All the Pretty Horses\"), but this role allows him to shine at the right times. The dialogue between Damon and Bridges is biting as each man tries to outdo the barb of the other, challenging the other's ability to be top dog,; both injecting humor. Equally crisp are the exchanges between Damon and Hailee Steinfeld as Steinfeld's stubborn Mattie refuses to let LeBeouf treat her like a helpless child; drawing much of LeBeouf's ire and providing him with a controlled foil in comparison to the more outlandish Rooster Cogburn.And rounding out the trio of heroes is a well cast Jeff Bridges as the iconic Rooster Cogburn. Bridges brings the \"true grit\" of the title in his vastly different portrayal of the grizzled gunman. He plays Cogburn as a man initially unconcerned with anything other than his next drink, but when Mattie Ross enters his life he does everything to dissuade the teenager from being involved. When she refuses and they spend so much time together on their journey to find her father's killer, Bridges brings out a reluctant fatherly affection in Cogburn as evident when he helps save Mattie near the film's close.The film is expertly shot by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins. He utilizes the barren surroundings of the American Southwest in making isolation so prominent. Being surrounded by mainly desert or wooded forest pits the main trio against the elements other than dangerous criminals. The scenery is exquisite as Deakins highlights the landscapes with a keen eye that the setting becomes its own character.Give this Western a hit and you will love it...or just like it.",

Jeff Bridges is OK as Rooster Cogburn but he doesn't come close to the John Wayne performance. Matt Damon is pretty to look at but Glen Campbell did it better. Josh Brolin as Ned Pepper was good but he was absolutely copying the Robert Duvall performance. I submit this film to the cut out rack of the local Walmart. Sorry Cohens but you got this wrong.

            "content": "So it turns out they do make 'em like they used to! More than that, they make them better. I recall seeing Jeff Bridges interviewed by Jonathan Ross around a year before True Grit was due out, and what stuck in my mind was just how apprehensive Ross was about a film he cherished so dearly being remade. It's an uncertainty i understand wholeheartedly, and Hollywood has bad previous when it comes to remaking much loved classics. It's pleasing to say then that the Coen brothers' update is a unmitigated success on all levels. This is a film that firmly intends to stand on it's own two feet without any fear of being overshadowed by what went before and it does so with assurance and conviction. From the first few frames it's clear that the period detail and production values have been painstakingly researched and attended to. The Coen brothers have never been conventional film makers and it's refreshing to see them coupling modern film making techniques with the pacing and feel of an old fashioned studio western. It's almost as if the Coen's are saying, remember all those naff cowboy films from the 40\u2032s, 50\u2032s and 60\u2032s? \u2013 well this is how they'd look if the same directors made then now. Filmed between New Mexico and Texas, it's a grand looking film with strong biblical undertones that lend satisfying heft amid the themes of redemption and Godlessness. Performance-wise, words can't do it justice. The trio of turns from Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld are all fascinating and multi-layered. Bridges is truly gritty as he grunts and growls his way through the majority of the film and although it's not always possible to make out exactly what he's saying all of the time, it's getting the general gist that really counts. Eye patch aside, it's a million miles from the John Wayne performance and all the better for it. It'd be all to easy to just make a list of comparisons when discussing a remake such as this, but that really wouldn't be doing sufficient justice to what is a confidently made western that recalls a bygone era while having the smarts to operate on it's own terms.",

But in True Grit, the Coens decide to play it straight, much of the aspects that made the Coens popular are not present here. The Coens chose to glorify the material over the form. True Grit is simple, undemanding and pleasurable.Josh Brolin is despicable as Tomo Chaney,the man who killed Mattie Ross's father. Hailee Stanfield was absolutely amazing as the headstrong girl who will stop at nothing to bring Chaney to justice. Jeff Bridges as the unkempt Rooster Cogburn is a different Cogburn from John Wayne's interpretation, but has the same level to screen presence. The minor parts played by the other cast are perfect complements to this keeper.",

I swore after \"A Serious Man\" that I would not let the Coen brothers reputation make me mindlessly go see another of their movies without first doing more research. Darn, I did it again. I am still in the thrall of \"Fargo\" and \"The Big Lebowski.\" There is nothing in this remake that I would consider significantly different or better than the original: cast, script, locations, cinematography, etc. I love Jeff Bridges but his mumbling, drab interpretation of Rooster Cogburn is two-dimensional compared to Wayne's. And to the people that scream \"Stop The Comparisons!\" I say if you don't want to be compared don't do a remake that practically mirrors the original. The locations and cinematography were as much more colorful than the original as was Wayne's performance over Bridges'. In the horse trading scene I felt like Strother Martin was getting his pocket picked. All the hype that preceded the release of this film lead me to believe that the Coen brothers had done something completely different with True Grit. Unfortunately that is not the case.

There, now that I got that off my chest,this was a pretty good movie.So the story is about a teenage girl whose father was murdered. Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is taking care of her fathers arrangements and hires Federal Marshall, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to track down her father's murderer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) but as part of the deal she has to accompany him. To add to this Texas Ranger Leboeuf (Matt Damon) is on Chaney's tail as well to collect a bounty on him.I really liked this movie. It is pretty dialogue heavy for a western, but it was well crafted and shot. Jeff Bridges, is a standout as the grizzled old Marshall Cogburn, and gives a grade A performance. Hailee Stanfeld was also excellent in this one and showed a lot of poise for a young actress with a part with such stylized language and as word heavy as this one. I think everyone was well directed and gave great performances, with the exception of Matt Damon. I don't think Matt Damon gave a bad performance, I just think he wasn't the right actor to play Leboeuf. It could just be his character, the writers, or the director, but Matt Damon felt real out of place in this movie and his character came out much more as a caricature instead. That being said it was still a great movie, especially if you like to see new versions of the old west.As I said, I did really like this movie and will watch it again.

It was like watching Jeff Bridges Crazyheart character and throwing him on a horse with a pistol. By all means not a half bad idea. But when you throw in a stereotypical whiz kid and a cocky brash Texas Ranger and never bother to try any REAL character development it's just far too simple and unoriginal, especially when considering it's basically a character driven movie. Then you throw in the Brolin's character (the bad guy), and that character is even less complex than imaginable. He's a guy that killed the girls dad and another man, and we never dive into his character much or rarely see him. And it's not like his character is shrouded in mystery, his presence frankly is hardly ever felt.

Being a Coen Brothers film, I am quite familiar with a number of the films which often feature enjoyably bizarre, but not particularly likable, heroes and heroines and villains and so on and so forth. But this inspired re-tooling of the John Wayne classic is not just a superior movie but also a very relatable one. I could imagine being the characters, and that's unusual for Joel and Ethan who went to my college and appeared to have a love for Flannery O'Connor (according to one guy). Hailee Steinfeld who now is a big name and has moved on to more conventional roles is great as the tomboy Mattie Ross who is hellbent on killing Tom Chainey (the very rugged and ugly-sexy Josh Brolin). Jeff Bridges steals the show as Rooster Cogburn, he gives the character a more sinister edge than the original. While the humors all there, there's a darkness and a world-weariness to Rooster that wasn't as present in the original, where Wayne was a more flamboyant and in-your-face presence. Matt Damon makes a great and very cocky LaBeouf who sobers up to Mattie Ross as he is continuously made a fool of. On a technical level the film is great as well, with gorgeous cinematography reminiscent of the Coen's No Country and a riveting soundtrack by Carter Burwell. The film is a fun, slightly creepy, and involving western drama. I hate westerns as a general rule because typically they're a bit cheesy, but this one really pulled you in. I highly recommend this, Lonesome Dove, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly as the few well-made western films out there.",

The simplistic story has enough to keep our interest. The PG-13 rating is almost R for violence.Attention to detail and authenticity has become a Coen pictures trademark. However, as Shakespeare used language only the learned (aristocracy) could understand, so the Coens write for the screen. Not that the dialogue is beyond most people's cognitive skills, but it very often requires more attention than normal to be understood. This can be a problem for some. Yet for others, the sublime eloquence that only a Harvard English professor could lay bare can be very enjoyable.If this is to be taken as a flaw in film making, it can be argued that it contradicts authenticity because it contradicts reality. Most folk just don't talk that way; never have and never will. But the Coens, no doubt, have a creative need to demonstrate their clever use of language. And clever it is. Very.",

            "content": "I must confess I am not a big fan of the Coen Brothers films. Mostly they have done dark comedies like The Big Lebowski, Burn After Reading and Barton Fink (which wasn't too bad). The thing is their style is not something I really liked. I appreciated it and it was refreshingly different but I just couldn't adapt myself to it. But that's my problem and even though I didn't like those films mentioned, they had a intriguing style, which made me understand why they are such avidly acclaimed film-makers. When it came to True Grit. I wanted to see it (having seen the original a couple of months ago) and give the Coen's a chance with a more serious film. They have done that of course before with No Country for Old Men, which I haven't seen.Basically the true story is the same as the original with a young fourteen year old girl Maddie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father is murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Broline). She wants revenge and justice for her father so hires deputy sheriff Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help catch him. They are joined by a Texas sheriff LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants Chaney as he murdered a state senate in Texas. Together they travel after Chaney to apprehend him.The one thing I would say I didn't like about this is the film didn't really have any heart or emotion really not like the original. But it is beautifully shot and edited with truly wondrous scenery thanks to gorgeous cinematography by Roger Deakins, the script is surprisingly witty and sharp with some great laughs. The Coen Brothers have captured the essence of the Western period perfectly. The acting as well, Jeff Bridges impressed me with a good performance but he just wasn't as convincing or believable as John Wayne. Matt Damon is less impressive I'm afraid and it's easy to see why he hasn't been the focus by critics. He gives a reasonable performance and his competent enough, but he looks out of place (like Christian Bale as Dickie in The Fighter) and comes across as rather a bland character. But the best person in this is the young actress Hailee Steinfeld as Maddie. She has been nominated for best supporting actress and she fully deserves it. She gives an excellent performance and radiates a real maturity on the screen and perfectly portrays Maddie with strength and confidence. She is the one with \"true grit\" both character (Maddie being strong willed to ask for help and go with them to avenge her father despite many dangers and never giving up) and actress (filling the big shoes of a major role). She gives one of the best performances of a child/teenager actress and I will look out for her in future roles which deserve to be bigger (as she has done other things). True Grit isn't on par with 127 Hours, The King's Speech and Black Swan but it's certainly one of the better movies of this year and ably directed and it deserves high praise. The 8.1 rating on here is well justified. This version is just as good and in some ways better than the original. Highly enjoyable.",

However within the first 10 minutes, the spectacular backdrops and excellent direction (as always) from the Coen's had me hooked from start to finish. True I found myself at times comparing the two films, but found that while doing this, both attempts at the story had there strong points and weaker points.Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn always had tough task ahead of him, trying to re-deliver the character that John Wayne almost definitely made his own. He does this by playing the role even darker than Wayne did, but still producing comedy moments like Wayne did with the sheer intelligence and sharpness of the script. I felt that the big catchphrases from the original should have been left out, as Bridges was never going to take these from Wayne and make them his own. This almost cheapened the role a tiny bit for me.Matt Damon as LaBoeuf was very enjoyable. The Coen's obviously didn't want to change his characters persona much from the original and to be fair, the role suited him to a tee, and he played the role extremely well. I feel that this was his best film for a while.I enjoyed the acting of Brolin, however the role in the Coen Brothers Re-make had been significantly shortened and we did not see him nearly enough. I also enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld playing Maddie Ross, this is the one role that I preferred the later adaptation.I feel that this is another great Coen brothers film. Even a sceptic like myself was put at ease by the script, direction and ultimately the sheer beauty of the production. None of the acting disappoints and a few excel (mostly Bridges and Steinfeld).If you've never seen the original then enjoy. If you loved the original free your mind and enjoy. If you hated the original, chances are you'll still love the Coen brothers effort!",

Hailee Steinfeld does a brilliant portrayal of the main character, Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old girl who is determined to punish Tom Chaney, the man responsible for killing her father. Jeff Bridges (Iron Man) delivers a great performance as Rooster Cogburn, a tough, whiskey-drinking U.S. Marshall. Matt Damon (Saving Private Ryan) provides a decent portrayal of LaBoeuf, a Texas ranger who is also in pursuit of Tom Chaney, but for different reasons.The story is very well written. It is largely character-driven, as much of the plot deals with the relationship between the three main characters. There are a number of conflicts that develop between the main cast, particularly between Rooster Cogburn and LaBoeuf. There are also plenty of action scenes that take place throughout the film.Overall, True Grit is a very well-done film and I'd definitely recommend seeing it",

This movie could have been extremely boring but it's not it keeps you constantly engaged with its engaging dialogue and very good central conflict. The great thing about the central plot and conflict is how realistic it is as it constantly focuses on the main characters instead of the antagonists making you feels the same satisfaction and desperation as Mattie Ross does when they meet. This movie looks stunning the cinematography is beautiful and very well lit. The girl who plays Mattie Ross, Hailee Steinfeld blew me away in this movie she should have won the Oscar for this movie. But Jeff Bridges is her equal it's just such an engaging and intriguing performance that's makes you feel sympathy for his character and also gives and Oscar worthy performance here it's a shame he hasn't had more Coen brothers collaborations with Bridges but they definitely bring out the best in each other. Matt Damon is very overlooked here because I think he gives one of his best performances here because he's so held back in True Grit and has fantastic chemistry with Bridges and Steinfeld and should have at least received a nomination for his efforts. While this is a dialogue driven movie it's still a western with action and they are very well handled and give the movie a bigger entertainment factor. This is an amazing movie and one of my best Coen brothers western and one that I'm watching right now as I write this review. 100%-A+",

Even super lawyer J Noble Daggett doesn't appear in TGII. Cogburn's Indian cook/servant General Lee is awol (too politically incorrect); yet some nasty treatment to all the Indians in the film. I'm glad the Coen's have tipped a cowboy hat to the Duke & Darby but it seems Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney has been reduced to a near cameo. The role is beneath him.

            "content": "The 2010 remake of \"True Grit\" stars Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, the character made popular in the original version by John Wayne. Rooster Cogburn is a U.S. Marshall, who has a rough and tough personality and a reputation as a formidable opponent to outlaws. He is hired by young Mattie Ross, played by Hailee Steinfeld, to find the man who killed her father and bring him to justice. Displaying all the aspects of a good western such as resonating gun fights, authentic costumes, and rugged landscapes, the use of modern technology takes you back in time to another era.The theme of this movie focuses on the relationship that develops between Mattie and Rooster Cogburn. At first, he dismisses Mattie's attempts to hire him, believing her to be a simple minded young girl who couldn't possibly understand outlaws and revenge. But as their relationship deepens, he begins to see that she is as strong and determined as he is. She is unwilling to let anything stand between her and justice for her father's murder. It is in this determination that Rooster discovers that he and Mattie have a lot in common and a strong bond of trust, friendship, and mutual respect develops between them.As Rooster Cogburn and Mattie set out in the wilderness to track her father's killer, they are met with many obstacles which only stand to strengthen their bond and Mattie's resolve. Similar to the quirky relationship found in the movie \"Harold and Maude\" (Higgins, C., Ashby, H., 1971), the age difference between the two characters would seem to present an unlikely relationship. But Rooster and Mattie form a lasting friendship, albeit without the romantic interludes. They learn things from each other and are equally surprised at how much they care about what happens to the other. The final scenes of the movie show Rooster making a desperate attempt to get Mattie medical help after a poisonous snake bite. The emotion that is displayed in these ending scenes is heart wrenching. The camera angles, lighting, and lack of dialog add to the urgency Rooster feels to get Mattie the help she so desperately needs. It is the style of movie making that allow the viewer to feel like they are peeking through a window to another time and place, while peeking into the hearts and minds of its' characters.",

I thought the scenery was weak. The ending felt like a sequence of \"we have to do something to quickly finish this\". There was some good acting, but the characters were not believable.

I was reminded of Jack Webb's \"Dragnet\" when all the actors were supposedly instructed to act as though they were reading their lines. In \"True Grit\" it sounds as though the actors are not only reading from an 1880's dime novel but living it. Buffalo Bill Cody would have loved it! The cast is very, very good. There is nary a misstep by any actor and, as everyone has said, the young star is frankly amazing and well deserved her accolades. All in all a superb motion picture with a certain Coen quirkiness.

A real highlight was Jess Bridges's voice, which was a wonderful creation and a character all in itself, as unique and illustrative as Brando's in The Godfather. Another thing the movie had going for it was the dialogue with its quaint, rather formal sound created mostly by everyone avoiding contractions (I'm, You're, Didn't) and using the full forms (I am, You are, Did not). And the dialogue sometimes had delightful phrasing. But I don't think I'd go much farther than that for the movie. The plot was simple and straightforward, too much so to hold my attention, and where it took a turn, as when the girl suddenly found Chaney, it was predictable. Gosh, it looks like the end of the hunt, both men are deserting her, everyone is heading home, all her time and effort and money are down the drain, o woe! But wait, hey, there's Chaney after all, just a few yards away. Gasp! Who'd have guessed? Well, actually, I guessed, and I never even saw the original True Grit.Did Jess Bridges deserve an Oscar nomination? What he did with his voice was terrific, no doubt, but as for the rest we hardly ever saw his face. He was always at a distance or in the shadows or hiding behind his beard. There wasn't that much acting he had to do, once he came up with The Voice. If there were an Oscar for most original voice, he'd definitely deserve that.So what about the nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for Hailee Steinfeld? The rationale for that nomination completely escapes me. In fact, I was not impressed with the performance at all. She often rattled through her speeches in a monotone that not only sounded flat and dull but it was often hard to make out what she was saying. Bad Shakespearean actors often do that when they spout the words without nuance, without expression, without knowing what the words mean. The other actors had similar speeches, often slightly florid in expression, and they filled them with expressiveness, and they were easy to understand. I suspect her support came from sentimentality around the idea of a young girl playing such a key role in a major film.",

They have cojones. But if I jump off the sycophantic bandwagon for a moment, I can truthfully say that they have made more films I have disliked (or at least considered ordinary) than ones I have been in raptures over. This remake is faithful to the original but has the Coens' inimitable wit.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) seeks to avenge her father's death by the outlaw Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). To help her, with breathtaking casuistry, she persuades Marshal Rueben 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who has killed 23 men and loves to 'pop a cork', and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) to accompany her.As I do not rate John Wayne, whichever way Bridges played Cogburn was going to be better. Like all his funny characters, he is sinfully funny and isn't, contrary to general opinion, over-the-top. He acts drunk only in scenes where he is drunk, and his wisecracks always come at the right time. But in conclusion, it's a burlesque of his Oscar-winning turn in 'Crazy Heart'.Teenager Hailee Steinfeld has been lauded \u2013 rightly \u2013 for her grown-up performance. But I'm not sure that it stands up as one of the all-time great juvenile performances \u2013 not when compared with Jodie Foster in 'Taxi Driver', or Linda Blair in 'The Exorcist'. Steinfeld speaks her complex dialogue too quickly, and wears a constant detached expression. She makes the Wild West seem like a giant Jungle Jim. (Harsh maybe, but there is stiff competition for these rare roles, and kids are often more dedicated than adults).I was impressed that so many people laughed at everything Cogburn said. Ask them what he was saying and they wouldn't be able to say. His argot is so foreign that I doubt even he knows what he's saying. Paradoxically, that's part of his appeal: you have to listen carefully to make out his witticisms, and when you do catch a good one, you laugh all the more heartily.Matt Damon does nothing interesting. His character dies in the book \u2013 one bit the Coens should have stuck to. Why is he so prolific an actor? Who likes him that much? Josh Brolin also contributes very little here. It's a shame no one is making a case for Barry Pepper, who plays the main villain. This character-actor is much more than 'Jackson', the ace sniper from 'Saving Private Ryan'.Brit cinematographer Roger Deakins gives the film the look and feel of 'Unforgiven' (it looks beautiful). Not a bad thing, but the Coens are supposed to be luminaries, not looters. But perhaps I'm being pernickety. They may have revived the western.www.scottishreview.net",

As many reviewers have mentioned, the Coen Brothers have not quite lost their touch with accents, and the Southern drawl and Old Western speak fit in perfectly. But what is really worth watching is Hollywood's latest child star, Hailee Steinfeld establish her credentials in the acting world, especially when she is playing a character of such resilience and determination as Mattie. And what makes her character stand out is that it is quite easy to see a similar scenario happening in real life - we are all familiar with Jeff Bridges (Rooster Cogburn) and Matt Damon (Texas Ranger LaBoeuf) in the acting world, but it is the new and relatively unknown Steinfeld who really deserves the screen time she gets. The only part I did not like was the ending, which I found a little too abrupt and rather unappealing. But other than that, well worth the money.",

I hardly remembered any of the story, going into the movie. I went to see it because I'll see anything the Coens do.The script was excellent. There was a quick, dry, subtle humor to much of the dialogue. Hailee Steinfeld really impressed me, right from the start. She nails her character immediately, when she's talking with the funeral director, articulately and shrewdly calculating, and when he offers that she may kiss her dead father, she dismisses the idea dispassionately, as though her mind is occupied with other things, saying quickly, \"the Spirit has left\". She balances that lack of sentimentality with a zeal for righteous justice for her father; well done. Great to see a kid actor that's not awful.Damon is good here. Ever since \"...Mr. Ripley\", I've been able to appreciate him as more than a pretty boy actor. In all honesty though, of the three actors that get the most screen time, he's the one that's most average.Jeff Bridges is great. That rambling wreck of a body, booze-soaked, dusty, and sun-cracked. If Oscars were handed out to body parts, that one good eye would run away with it, this year. I mean it - it seems like, in some scenes, his eye gets its own lines.Brolin does a good job as a simple, weak, violent low-life.Pepper, as brief as his appearance was, was very good. Cogburn and Pepper's familiarity with and seeming professional respect for one another was nicely done.The whuppin' that LeBoeuf puts on Mattie was probably the most uncomfortable moment in the movie, as she's really a grown girl, but still a kid. It gets to Cogburn too.Go see it. Some won't like that the end is a little staggered and slightly predictable, but it's the Coens, working within someone else's story, and they do it well. It's not \"A Serious Man\", it's a different kind of film, for a much wider audience, and it's very good. 'Specially the dialogue.",

            "content": "I am happy to say that I was finally persuaded to watch this movie by all the good reviews posted here. I was not disappointed. Among many other things, I found the use of language and the featured thespians\u02bb mastery of the acting arts more than sufficient to justify the high score I have awarded it here. So fascinating was this work that I conducted my own investigation to determine the various principles or \"rules\" that lent such a peculiar yet distinctive air to it. It did not take me long to discover these principles for I have a talent in this direction in the way some people have for summing and spelling. But I do not boast of my own gifts in this direction, for movie analysis is not everything.In the first place, the language used was not one to take kindly to the use of contraction. Nary a single apostrophe was used in place of a letter throughout the entire epic regardless of the speaker\u02bbs station or virtue. We do not have to assume that this drama\u02bbs makers believe that people of the era and location did not use contractions in their every day speech. Instead the actress Hailee Steinfeld gives the secret away in her own capable portrayal of the 14-year-old Mattie Ross. Not only have 14-year-olds always used contractions in their speech, they have also always had a tendency to move about when speaking, or when engaged in any activity during their waking hours. But Steinfeld\u02bbs Mattie Ross calmly remains still as a middle aged spinster when delivering her demands and pronouncements.And that is it exactly. The novel True Grit was expertly written by Charles Portis in the first person from Mattie Ross\u02bbs point of view. Not the 14-year-old Mattie Ross, but the middle aged Mattie Ross; the very proper, very strong, Mattie Ross, survivor and possessor of true grit. And in fact, every one in this memoir speaks out of Mattie\u02bbs mouth. So we have a tale populated by characters speaking and acting in varying degrees like middle aged Mattie Ross\u02bbs and that stunt may as well have been invented by the Coen brothers such is their gift for strange stunts. Anyway, that is the secret to the style of the movie, and revealing it is my contribution here. I did not think it necessary to present a synopsis of the story since it is available in various degrees of accuracy and skill in the other reviews here.",

            "content": "I was disappointed with True Grit, mainly because so many critics had given it such great reviews. I usually like Westerns so I was hoping for something I would enjoy but I felt let down. The film looked authentic and Roger Deakins' cinematography was beautiful, but I didn't find the story particularly interesting and the ending was anti-climatic. Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old farm girl hires a tough, old U.S. marshal, Rooster Cogburn (Bridges) to track down her father's killer. Matt Damon plays a Texas Ranger who joins the chase. The first problem was the accents. Bridges and Damon adopt 19th century sounding regional accents. I struggled to understand what Bridges was saying most of the time. Damon's verbose and mumbling Texas Ranger was equally hard to comprehend and his outmoded speech patterns were irritating. Strangely, Ross, although supposedly from Arkansas, sounded like a modern American teenager. It was a rather incongruous combination. It would have been better without the accents. Cogburn is an unbelievable character and almost a cartoon. He's tough and fearless but with a heart of gold. He acts as Mattie's protector and apart from his drinking and penchant for shooting criminals he's almost too good to be true. Mattie Ross seemed too precocious and outspoken for a 14 year old. Damon's character is almost a cipher, someone who talks funny and dresses stylishly but you never work out who he is. I didn't really connect with the characters or care what happened to them.Although nominally an action film, there were only two real action scenes in the movie, neither of which was particularly memorable. Ross and her posse chase the bad guys, find them relatively easily, and the evildoers are punished. The Coen Brothers talked about the comedy in the movie, but I missed most of it. There wasn't much tension either and it was all very predictable. I felt that 3:10 To Yuma and Unforgiven had more interesting story lines. Overall, True Grit was OK, but I really expected more given the hype. I have been disappointed by Coen films in the past so I probably don't get their humor. In my view their films are usually not as good as you would hope.",

            "content": "After getting a bad snubbing at this year's Golden Globes, True Grit returned with a hammer to grab as many as 10 academy award nominations. Questions about its worthiness are better set aside because, though no one really gives True Grit a chance at the ceremony, all of these nominations we think are well deserved.Essentially, True grit is a movie about a daughter's pursuit to nab her father's murderer played by Josh Brolin. 14 year old Mattie Ross(Hailee Steinfeld) finds assistance in US Marshall Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) and it will require a display of true grit by no less than all three to get them through the task.Coens to their credit make True Grit in the way of the Traditional Western. It gives us the historical feel that we expect from the genre. We believe True Grit has done as much to revive the genre as has James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma, another good western in recent years. It is something that a movie like No Country for Old Men cannot do. Thus Coens' decision to remake True Grit is an important one, their approach is even more. True Grit takes a different course than a usual Coen movie, yet for its technical remarkability it has \"Coens Bros.\" written on it in bold font. It gives it an edge over the original 1969 adaptation of Charles Portis' novel. It is not without the dark humor they are known for and they also give us the typical Coen childlike adults in Rooster and Laboeuf.For comparison the Dude(Bridges) as Cogbern matches up to Duke(John Wayne) well and beyond. The performances of the lead actors push it even far.True Grit gets our thumbs up for adapting a classic western tale and doing nothing wrong with it, putting in all the brilliant things Coens know so well. This is the very best they have to offer. Heres a salute to the Great Western.REVIEW ORIGINALLY POSTED ON cueforchange.blogspot.com",

            "content": "The Coens must be considered True masters of contemporary American cinema. They have again crafted a well told story in a style that is simultaneously majestic and real. True Grit stands out for it's characters, cinematography, acting and sound design, but what exceeds all other aspects of this film is the dialogue. Credit must be given the actors and director for the execution of the script, however the rhythms, textures and painterly means of creating characters with their words is truly exceptional. We hear the landscape in this film, the silence, the rasp, the distance from humanity. It is a stark world, but the dialogue sings itself into the rhythms of nature when appropriate, and emulates the ugly, primal moaning of mankind at other times. The meter is absolutely joyous to listen to, and miraculously fits this gruff environment. And it is funny- I found myself laughing numerous times at not only the characters intent, but the wordsmithing of the Cohen brothers. Damon may come off as the most over-matched with the dialogue, but as the film progresses, he reconciles his choices well with his character and never pushes too hard. Bridges can do this role falling off a log; the gruff, drunk, self-possessed, but we absolutely buy his perspective of the world- he is shaped by it's wilds, and is the vehicle through which we understand the landscape. But the real prize is Hailee Steinfeld- wonderfully confident absent the attitude we so often see with the younger actors. She handles the dialogue with great ease and utilizes it surgically in the film, making us want to root for her, despite the awful intentions she has. The mission really becomes subjugated to our interest in the characters and the environment, and although this departs from our \"traditional Hollywood\" conventions, it is refreshing, accurate and reflects how we look at our own history. A brilliant script and execution again, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the DVD.",

When she finally meets Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) the local Marshall, with drink problems, promising him $ 50 in return of help her find and capture Tom Cheney. On their journey, joined them both the clumsy but competent Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). Together they embark on a journey through the vast and dangerous West looking for Chaney, that will bring them many dangers later. The story seems a typical adventure-Western story, the Coens managed to make it magnificent with its elements.When I say that the brothers were able to bring \"everything\" with them was exactly to do with the elements of their films. While they are loyal to the old classic, also were super faithful to Charles Porti's novel and managed to bring and join their elements: humor, simple and intriguing dialogs and brutal but sometimes fun violence (not like Tarantino though). But even being a Western, it also managed to be an adventure with drama (with some emotional times).But without any problem the brothers were also loyal to Western style giving a lot of epic moments: shootout sequences; a badass shooter; Indians, an outlaw gang and moments with the landscape of the West around reminding us how beautiful it is.And like any Coens movie, the cast is outstanding: Hailee Steinfeld is superb in every detail; Matt Damon as always fitting into any kind of movie without problem; Josh Brolin (despite having a small appearance) has a fantastic performance, but who shines again is Jeff Bridges, simply perfect!Another Coen's masterpiece, fantastic direction and writing; intriguing dialogs; hilarious and smart humor; exciting and epic moments on Western style, the Coens once again didn't disappoint at all.",

            "content": "First off, I must say I loved the book and the 1969 film. Those who say this version is a \"more faithful adaptation\" of the Charles Portis novel probably haven't read it. With the exception of the epilogue, the 1969 film follows the novel more closely and contains more character development. In the first film we spend more time with Rooster, Mattie, and LeBoeuf in the beginning and learn a bit more about them. LeBoeuf never leaves the expedition in the book or the first film as he does twice in the 2010 film. The dugout scene is more faithful to the book in the first film as well as certain sequences of events. I read that Jeff Bridges moved the eye patch to his right eye because it was more comfortable. If that's the case, he should have shot left-handed. Any hunter will find a flaw in this. Nitpicking, yes, but that's what we do sometimes when we're comparing things. I loved the Coen Brothers adaptation, but most of the reviews here are pretty over-the-top regarding a pretty good film, but not a 10 out of 10. Jeff Bridges was good, Hailee Steinfeld was brilliant and closer in age to the book's Mattie. Matt Damon was wonderful, but his time on-screen was cut too short by the directors. So, see this film, but read the book and watch the 1969 version. In my opinion, John Wayne deserved the Oscar, and Glen Campbell's acting wasn't as bad as some have written.",

Bridges is a shadow of John Wayne, and Brolin et al are no match for James Caan and Dennis Hopper's gang.

            "content": "The Coen brothers and the Western genre: at the latest since their Oscar winner No Country For Old Men, we know that this combination fits. In True Grit they take a completely different, almost conventional path. Based on Charles Portis novel of the same name, which spawned the 1969 film classic starring John Wayne, young Mattie Ross sets out to find her father's killer. She is assisted by a marshal who seems to be long past his prime.The story focuses on three protagonists. On the one hand, there is the young Mattie Ross, embodied by the then 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld. Considering that this was Steinfeld's debut in a leading role, she appears almost too experienced and is on an absolute par with her more experienced colleagues. By too experienced it means that one hardly notices her young age. Yes, in those days one probably had to take on more responsibility earlier and shed the infantile behaviour prematurely. The latter is most noticeable when Ross makes her cheeky and disrespectful announcements without regard for the possible consequences. Of course, she is na\u00efve at times, but this is less due to the writing of the character than to Steinfeld's authentic acting. She is particularly fun in combination with her companions Reuben Cogburn and LaBeouf. The former is in none other than Jeff Bridges, who once again delivers a veritable firework of cool. Bridges makes almost every role he plays look easy, even if it's one that's really tailor-made for him. As Cogburn, he is filthy and frustrated on the surface, but doesn't want to let it show in his appearance. When signs appear that he has long since ceased to be what he once was as a marshal, he immediately plunges into stubborn confrontations. He usually leads these against LeBeouf, played by Matt Damon. It often seems that this character was cast just for these arguments, which hurts Damon's presence somewhat. One hardly buys the role of the sovereign and almost ruthless cowboy because he only fits into this kind of role to a limited extent. Much more adequate is the villain part of Josh Brolin, who does exactly his job in very little screentime.True Grit is on the one hand a typical Coen film. Bloody brutality when you least expect it, beautiful images from the wild Western, captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins and peppered with clever and eloquent dialogue. On the other hand, the film is very different from their usual style of making. And this is precisely where the problem lies. The abstruseness of Fargo and No Country For Old Men is missing here. The approach seems almost generic and in its plot the film leans too much on the old version. As a result, it's nothing you haven't seen before multiple times. Still, the Coens put their stamp on the film again, especially with the stellar cast, and make True Grit a very atmospheric film experience. Nice homage to the Wild Western, even if that's about it.",

It sucks you in and does not let you go.Within 10 minutes I knew I'd be I writing a review on IMDb when I got home, which is something I rarely do despite seeing 100s of movies every year. But this one deserves it, demands it. It would be an injustice if I didn't help spread the word - people must be told: this is one of the best movies you'll ever see.Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and especially Hailee Steinfeld all deserve Oscars and any other awards we can give them - they \"nailed\" their roles. Perfect acting. Perfect writing. Perfect direction. The film had me literally on the edge of my seat, several times gasping and uncontrollably speaking out loud \"wow, this is good\". Make sure you see this - it is shockingly good.",

Not only that but it's seriously racist towards the north American Indians (As far as I know if they were going to hang the Indian then at least let them finish the speech because that's what they did) The story is pretty generic for a western, it doesn't reinvent the genre like I have heard it does.The acting for most is campy if not bland, the soundtrack just sounds uninspired and the direction is connect the dots type and not to impressively edited.Bridges and Damon gave really embarrassing performances that seemed to cheesy for the screen.But now it kinda boils down to this (I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but this is my opinion).Mattie Ross's portrayal by Hailee Steinfeld is being praised as godlike, impressive and tour-De-force like, well if you all want to hear my voice on this get ready, I might spoil down so you have been warned.I'd replace Mattie Ross's name with Mary Sue. Her performance is hideous, irritating, over hyped and beyond overrated. She just doesn't make the movie like everyone says she does.Seriously, everyone should quit ''jacking off'' over her performance because she deserves a middle finger and here's why. She showed no emotion when her father was killed, her voice sounded so silly, stereotypical and cringe-worthy in all the moments that where meant to be serious, demanded to much of Rooster Cogburn, had a very retarded and dumb look on her face throughout the entire picture like if she had smelled rotten eggs and worked with a stink look on the face (you guys honestly call this good acting), acted to much of a brat that wants to get everything done their own way and the way she acted maturely seemed really off as in ''I'm above all you guys and I treat all of you the way I want but I have to show a really fake mature side that seems to be the same as my spoiled side'' and contradicts what she said early in the film about her father having justice and won't necessarily kill Chaney butt kills the guy for revenge anyway.If there is a redeeming quality of this film it's the scenery although the movie in itself is very generic and boring.",

The players soon head out of town, across wide expanses of open grasslands with mountains in the distance - scenery typical in some parts of the great basin, but not at all like the woodlands that covered most of Arkansas at the time. The main characters come across a \"mountain man\", complete with a bear hide with a mounted head with intact eyes, teeth, and tongue in an open mouth - the type of display one would find on a bear rug hung in a mountain lodge. Later on, they come across a \"silver mine\" with rails, but no trace of any material in the form of a dump outside the adit - a quickly-assembled prop with no thought to reality. Cogburn discards pocket whiskey bottles across the countryside during their little adventure - bottles without labels - as if the makers sold their whiskey that way. Everything about this movie cries out as one more example of lazy movie makers ignoring important historical details just because they are too lazy or ignorant to do it right.

I have never seen the original but judging the ratings it's got, this may be one of the few remakes that is actually better than the original. This movie is a pretty graphic movie despite it's PG-13 rating, but I was surprised to find the movie hilarious at times. Most of the hilarity comes from Jeff Bridges's character and he definitely deserves an Oscar for this. His character is a drunk and dry humored aging marshal. I'm sure his accent will be mimicked to death, just like Borat, Austin Powers and Forrest Gump's. Matt Damon plays a cocky Texas ranger and Josh Brolin plays the outlaw that killed the girl's father. All of the acting is good. Other than Bridges's performance, I really enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld who plays the girl. I see a bright future in acting ahead of her. Also I must mention Barry Pepper, barely recognizable under the make up is fantastic the short time he is on screen. I would definitely recommend this to any Coen Brothers fan and anybody looking for a good adventure movie. Even if western movies aren't your cup of tea, you will still enjoy this.",

It was more faithful to the novel itself and it hardly ever change the film point of view. The film is about a 14 year old girl named Mattie Ross who hires an alcoholic U.S. Marshal named Rooster Cogburn to go after Tom Chaney who killed her father and is hiding in Indian territory. Not knowing the land well, Cogburn also hired a Texas Ranger named Laboeuf (pronounce as La-Beef) to help him with the land (he departs a few times in the film). Meanwhile, Mr. Cogburn is also after a man named \"Lucky\" Ned Peppers who is with Tom Chaney. The film (some of you will find it a little slow) is well made which is worthy for Oscar nominations (lets hope it doesn't snub it like the Golden Globes or there will be pain) so see it.

So I decided to hold a little film festival and screen both versions back-to- back, beginning with the original. It was a lot of fun to realize that the John Wayne film stuck so closely with the novel. A kid could have faked a book report by watching it. Since it had been 40 years since I had seen it, I had forgotten how green Glen Campbell was as an actor, but I had to remember how hot he was at the time - career wise - with his music and everything, so I can imagine this was quite a plum for him. Think: Elvis in Jailhouse Rock. I didn't like Kim Darby much at the time but she too in retrospect was excellent as were all the supporting characters including Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin and John Fielder - outstanding. Which brings me to the remake. I've read it on these boards before and I must agree: Bridges is no Duke and had I not read the book I might have let this film get by with a lot. The \"new\" Mattie doesn't fill the role nearly as neatly as Ms. Darby. Her role brings to mind the more modern smarty pants kids written for the screen today rather than one from the 1870s. Glen Campbell's \"Labeef\" is superior to Damon's even with the buckskin (which in hindsight I can't see Campbell wearing anyway). Most of all, I was disappointed that pivotal scenes were just missing as was much of the exposition from the original. Explaining what \"sand dodgers\" are for example. And when Mattie runs into Chaney at the watering hole in the remake it is nothing like the book when she comes down a steep grade such that she could not easily run back up for help from Rooster and Labeef. The original stayed true to this. The remake in fact had Labeef leave very early in the film only to reappear at opportune moments; he wasn't even there to damp the chimney at the dugout when they first run into Lucky Ned! The remake had Mattie do it. Labeef is supposed to be somewhat of a dandy: more talk than action. I think in the end Campbell filled this bill better. Another scene lacking is the ferry scene where the book clearly states that Mattie swum her horse across the river to beat Rooster and Labeef who had sought to leave her behind. The '69 version captures this verbatim; the remake was cheap as was the scene where Mattie falls into the hole with the snakes. The book had Chaney fall in after her as did the '69 film. The remake did not. In fact, in the book and '69 film Mattie's rescue was true whereas in the remake it was not. The remake is anticlimactic in every sense. The 1969 version is the standard.",

Bridges is a damn great actor, and he is good as Cogburn, I won't compare him to Wayne Oscar-winning original role cause that would be unfair. Also, Bridges pretty much copies it verbatim, so there is nothing to talk about with that. This, alas is my big problem with this movie. It has absolutely no reason to exist. It added nothing, it good the same story in the exact same way. The only thing that is different is the ending, which is a touch bleaker, while to original was typical ride off into the sunset western. However, one change does not make a movie full of the same magically necessary.This one was written and directed by the Coen Bros. Such unique, groundbreaking talent they are, you will see none of their personas as filmmakers here. None of their quirkiness is here. This could have been made by anybody. I am coming off as a bit harsh here and am really not trying to. This is actually not a bad movie at all from a technical standpoint. The acting is all great. Matt Damon is a little more grizzled here, and the young Hailee Steinfeld is particularly memorable as Matty, maybe even more brutal than her original counterpart. All the music and cinematography is stunning. The old west is captured very well. It is perfectly watchable and entertaining. A movie, though, almost more than anything, needs to have a reason to exist, needs to have something to bring to the table, to truly work in my eyes, and this one does none of these things, so, honestly, cannot really recommend it.

Both the female and male leads were cold. One didn't feel any true bond or emotion between the two. The only warmth in the movie was when Damon left the two near the end and he said his goodbyes to the girl Jeff, though a fine actor played his part to far. There is supposed to be a warm heart that pours out as Wayne did in the original. A drunken rough man who had a heart for the girl underneath the rough exterior.

Unfortunately, for me, the new Coen brothers' True Grit remained stubbornly naked, and I found myself repeatedly looking at my watch, and wondering if it would soon be over, and what was I gonna have for dinner after.I do like Coen movies, my favorite is The Big Lebowski, but there are several good ones. I enjoyed Brother where art Thou, which I guess is similarly old school. So with Oscar buzz, and those clever Coen boys in charge, I had high hopes.And I like the actors too. Matt Damon has done some great stuff, love the Bourne movies. And Jeff Bridges is always watchable, and The Big Lebowski is probably one of the high spots of his career. So it's not the actors or the acting. Damon and Bridges are good in this movie, and Hailee Steinfeld does a very good job as the heroine Mattie Ross.And it looks good too, nice cinematography of the Wild West.So, I wondered, where does it all go wrong? I've never read the original book, and I can't really remember the John Wayne movie, other than the feeling that it wasn't played totally straight. But my guess is, that in a Wild, Wild West where dudes shoot other dudes in the back over a dollar or an unkind word, it isn't super plausible that a 14 year old girl would make much of a bounty hunter. Today, an opinionated girl can be a mouthy bitch, and get away with it. Seems to me that back then you would just shoot the annoying little tyke and move on to more important business.In other words, I suspect that the book is meant to be rather funny, and not a believable illustration of your typical mis-matched posse with a pompous and loquacious Texas Ranger (Damon as le beef, not LaBoeuf), a drunk, one-eyed, over-the-hill marshall (Bridges as Rooster Cogburn), and the annoying and vengeful innocent (Steinfeld as Mattie), in search of what seems to be a bunch of dim-witted and incompetent outlaws (Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper as Tom Chaney and Ned Pepper). In one scene, Chaney (the, maybe, villain) even explains to Mattie how to shoot a gun properly... while she's pointing at him. There ain't no way this is a serious scene! But... the Coens play the whole thing very straight, as if the source material was a straightforward serious piece of fiction. For me, this didn't work at all. I sensed the underlying comedy, but didn't see anyone laughing.To compound the problem, the Coens combined serious with super retro realism, with a big emphasis on authentic Olde West style, and, in particular, retro style of speech. It's sort of interesting, of course, to get a feel for the old west, but for a modern audience, I just don't feel that it adds anything. I know we talked differently years ago, but, as long you keep the Rolex out of shot, I'm cool if they all sound like you and me.In summary, the photography and acting was very good. But it's played too serious, with too few laughs, and with an overly retro feel that strives for authenticity but is distracting and adds to the seriousness quotient. Not a bad movie, by any means, but definitely not worthy of the hype. And, I think, ditto for the principal actors, Bridges, Damon and Steinfeld. All three are good, and I liked their performances, but I think you have to do better to win an Oscar.",

He repeatedly rebuffs her attempts to talk with him. The next day, she attempts to hire Cogburn offering him $50 after reminding him of the government's payments. He doesn't believe she has it and refuses.Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) has been tracking Chaney for several months for the murder of a state Senator in Texas. After meeting Mattie, he proposes that they should team up with Cogburn, since he knows the Choctaw terrain where Chaney is hiding.After finally securing Cogburn's services for $100, Mattie is instructed to meet him the following morning to begin the search for Chaney since she insists on going. Instead of meeting Mattie, Cogburn leaves a note and a train ticket telling her to go home while he goes to apprehend Chaney.She gets on her horse and find Cogburn and LaBouef on the other side pf the shore. She is no doubt bold and brave to cross the river and reach there.The next day, she learns Cogburn and Laboeuf have agreed to split the Texas reward on Chaney and accuses him of fraud. After a dispute, Cogburn ends his and Laboeuf's deal and he leaves.White in hot pursuit of the \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper gang with whom Chaney is with, they meet a doctor who instructs them to a cabin for shelter. Two outlaws, Quincey (Paul Rae) and Moon (Domhnall Gleeson) are staying there, one of whom Cogburn knows to a friend of \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper.He questions them, Moon is fatally stabbed by Quincey whom Cogburn gun down. Moon explains that \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and his gang were planning on returning later that night. Cogburn kills two members of the gang, as well as Pepper's horse, but accidentally wounds LaBoeuf.During the night and the next day, Cogburn drinks a great deal of whiskey. He and LaBoeuf argues again.The next morning, Mattie encounters Chaney at the river. She draws her father's pistol and shoots him when he tries to take her with him but he survives. The pistol misfires as she tries to finish him off; he drags her back to Pepper who uses her to make Cogburn leave. Pepper orders Chaney not to harm her and to take her to safety.Once alone, Chaney disobeys Ned and tries to kill her. In the nick of time, LaBoeuf appears and knocks Chaney with a boulder. They watch as Cogburn takes on the remaining members of Ned's gang.LaBoeuf shoots Ned through the heart and kills him from four hundred yards away, impressing Mattie with his skill as a marksman. Chaney wakes up to attacks Laboeuf, and Mattie shoots Chaney in the chest and knocks him over cliff, killing him.The recoil creates a knock-back pushing her back into a pit of rattlesnakes. She was bitten before Cogburn could save her. Cogburn rides day and night to get Mattie to a doctor, carrying her after he has to kill Mattie's exhausted horse.Twenty-five years later, Mattie \u2013 now 40 and with only one arm, the result of an amputation necessitated by gangrene from the snakebite \u2013 receives a note from Cogburn with a flyer enclosed inviting her to meet him at a traveling Wild West show with which he is performing when it stops in Memphis.

Even though I know and remember every little detail of the movie, I still watch it again so many times and enjoy it every time.A must-watch!",

            "content": "...is what you must tell yourself if you are a Western hater like myself.Paradoxically, I list Peckinpah's _Wild Bunch_ at the top of my all time favourite films and have a deep soft spot for the lesser _Magnificent Seven_, which I've seen a 100 times and hope to see a 100 more. A great staple of rerun teevee. But the original _True Grit_? Few things make me reach for the remote to change channels quite as fast.But I don't call either of those favourite films Westerns either. They are genius explorations of the maligned and taboo subject of \"masculinity\" - maligned especially in the sterile, ideologically puritanical times we find ourselves in today when anything with even a whiff of musky, sweat drenched maleness is denounced as an attack on women and cast out as the new twin secular Satans of \"rape culture\" and some mythical beast know only as The Patriarchy\u0099.This is the story of a Man. A whiskey soaked, emotionless killer. But one that still possesses a useless trait that has been forgotten in our i-phone and Facebook neutered times - \"honour\". This Man crosses paths with a young girl, similarly weighed down with a burdensome sense of \"honour\" - a girl with pride, fearlessness and steel cold determination in seeking justice for the grave injustice of her father's murder.This is also a a story of a rock and a hard place colliding, and how in the process, mutual respect, then a platonic bond, is forged. This is an archetypal story of a Man and a Woman.Hailee Steinfeld and Jeff Bridges are the two core characters involved here and their performances are flawless. You forget this is a mere Western. And the Coen brothers, this is possibly their finest hour.This is an impeccable film. You would do a great disservice to yourself to not give it a chance to suck you into its magic.Minus one star for Matt Damon as a third leg in an otherwise perfect film. His role was far better suited for someone like Edward Bunker (RIP 2005). Waste of a good role.",

The poetically earthy cadence and content of the richly written dialog was masterful, as was the ease in delivery by all in the cast who spoke it.Bridges completely owned and clearly reveled in his wonderfully nuanced performance, and the young actress who played Mattie filled the tall order of making real and believable the unusual precociousness of her character. The entire cast delivered, not the least of which was the traveling doctor or Bear Man, whose all too brief appearance was a delightful Coen Bros. confection.This is one of the all too few films that measures up to the difficult task of intelligently entertaining the eye, mind, and spirit; something the Coen Bros. have been able to achieve with uncanny consistently.Bravo!",

I hoped to see something that would rival, or at least approach my all-time favorite Western, \"Unforgiven.\" In my opinion, this does not approach the brilliance of that movie. The performances are all very good, and there is clearly an emphasis on witty, stinging dialog throughout the movie. I think this diminished what little tension was present in this movie. Occasionally, Jeff Bridges' character borders on slapstick, particularly when he is drunk. While this may be accurate with the book and the Directors' instruction, for me it had the effect of diluting a movie that in my opinion lacks tension. Also, I felt that Bridges' character and Damon's character had arcs, but I didn't see one in the girl's character. Also, the conclusion felt rushed, and lacked suspense. There was no gradual movement from comedy to the dramatic, just wild swings. For me, the Directors have always had a way of building suspense from very subtle but potent directing. This was clearly lacking in True Grit.",

I never thought I would like this movie after growing up in the John Wayne era and thinking very highly of this great star... even with his short comings and movie flops. This is why this movie was such a pleasure to like and a nice surprise while expecting the opposite. Both movies makes have comparisons and special moments for me: Rooster: Bridges plays this part differently yet as good as the \"Duke\". I enjoy Jeff B in most any movie he makes.. such a talent.Mattie: Hailee is much more convincing (age obliviously)to the book.. splendid performance from a new actress...not perfect but solid.LaBoeuf: Matt Damon is much better cast than Glen C in the original. I wish we would have seen him a bit more.Lucky Ned Pepper: I have to say I was wishing for Robert D to appear.. his performance in the original fits better for me and I could not get past that Moon: missed Dennis Hopper and the chopping of the Turkey :) Tom Chaney: Toss up but I might prefer the original actor to Josh B Other great moments.... the grit and dirt of the movie was so much more realistic than the original...the man hanging along the trail lol. The ending scene.... while I still wanted to hear \"watch a one-eyed fat man jump\" watching John Wayne ride off...I prefer this version much more than as an eight yrs old and needing to feel good as I did then....If I could critique anything... I actually wished the movie would have developed characters a bit more and been longer. Also I was a bit confused by the doctor in the woods performance.. seemed more than a bit strange.Overall a great movie but like any remake.. the only thing I missed was a combination of the two to make something perfect... They did as good a job as anyone could with this ... Not an easy task with such an iconic movie (to me at least) as the original. Great Job!",

It is a great movie, and the Duke is, well, The Duke. But don't be tempted to compare the two movies. They are quite different.Older westerns starring the likes of John Wayne, Gary Cooper, and others are classics. But they also still paint the Old West, despite their efforts, in a fairly sanitized fashion. In the past 20 years or so, we have seen the genre evolve with movies like \"Dances With Wolves\", \"Unforgiven\" and shows like \"Deadwood\". Newer tellings of the Old West show a darker, more authentic and (no pun intended) grittier version of the harsh frontier where the bad guys don't always wear black hats and the lines of right and wrong are not so clearly defined.I'll leave the scene-by-scene retellings to others, and will comment on the film as a whole. It is typical Coen brothers. At first the tempo and use of language takes a little getting used to, not unlike watching a Shakespearan play (after the first few minutes you get uesed to the meter of the dialogue). Not only was it a different time (contractions weren't used a liberally), but the language is an affect and device in itself. We see this early on with Mattie's negotiations with Rooster and with a stubborn merchant. It establishes the the meter of the dialogue and Mattie as the true protagonist.The settings are bleak and forbidding, but beautiful in their desolation. One feels this is what the frontier must have been like and reminds us the sturdy souls and rogues willing to venture into such places. Rooster Cogburn is such a man, hard-drinking and morally suspect by our standards. Bridges's is NOT redoing John Wayne. He wholly owns this character and makes it his own. Matt Damon as the self-important Texas Ranger is excellent. Both are comical and in their own way heroic. Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper lend small but notable performances as the villains. But the true revelation is Hailee Steinfeld. Her maturity and grivitas holds its own and even overshadows the performances for her more veteran co-stars. Personally, I was reminded of the way Saoirse Ronan owned \"The Lovely Bones\" (though the movies are far different). While others in TG are complex and colorful, they are still somewhat caricatures. Steinfeld's performance is the glue that holds the entire movie together and transforms what might be farce into art.Forget about The Duke. Enjoy this movie for what it is. Another triumph by the Coen Brothers.",

The film starts off as expected; Mattie Ross asks Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to help her seek revenge on her father's killer, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Rooster acquires LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who joins Rooster on his quest to find and kill Ross's fathers killer. The film has a unique style, much like the original, and we see a sort of bond create between Mattie (forgot; future star Hailee Steinfeld) and Rooster, while at the side is Damon. The film had some good western action sequences, but this isn't the kind of film you'd expect from the Coen brothers. Matt Damon was out of place and Jeff Bridges (tremendous actor) seemed, to me, a little overdone. Although I respect that they were trying to keep the original style of the older film, it didn't match up as I expected it to.

The originality of screenplay cannot be compared with the one from \"Fargo\", \"Hudsucker Proxy\" or \"No Country For Old Men\". It's just an average one, with some woody lines and nothing to impress me. I love old western movies and i really appreciate the \"true grit\" of Coens in \"attacking\" such a genre, but it really fails to deliver any substance for the future. Stop transforming any ordinary production in a \"true classic\"! How can this movie be a true classic, when it copies a lot of aspects from past masterpieces? The Coens aren't Sergio Leone or Clint Eastwood. After \"Burn after reading\", this average western movie simply proves a lack of originality. Not every movie of The Coens can be a masterpiece. Not even Spielberg or Scorsese can always deliver \"true classics\". Jeff Bridges is stiff, i enjoyed his \"Crazy Heart\" performance, but this one is stiff. Matt Damon shows some soul in his acting, but not as always. The girl has \"true grit\" but sometimes her character is very annoying. In my humble opinion, The Coens must work hard to make a stand able comeback, as with \"No Country For Old Men\". Despite of this, \"True Grit\" will be a contender to the Oscars 2011, because we're all lost in this \"mainstream\" syndrome, that keeps us from voting remarkable movies, instead of LABELS. Attention! This is not a classic western for the future charts. It copies in a bad way many \"a la John Wayne and Clint Eastwood\" themes, but the problem is \"blood simple\": TRUE GRIT simply doesn't deliver a classic movie. It remains an above average film by the extraordinary (not this time) Coen Brothers. 6 out of 10.",

I never really think of Jeff Bridges as a western guy, but he fits in perfectly in this movie. The score was beautiful, as well the the production design recreating an old western town. The only issue is that they focused a lot on Josh Brolin's character, for him to not be in the movie that much. Lucky Ned seemed to be more of the main villain instead. Also, Jeff Bridges is a little hard to understand at times, but only a little. And, I didn't really care for the weird, possibly sexual chemistry between Steinfeld and Matt Damon.

I understand that this 2010 version was more derived from the original book but it was very dry and didn't have any entertaining value. The vernacular was also quite annoying to listen to. The original book may have been written with no contractions (that was the way books were written in that time) but people didn't normally talk that way. This was a very sad vehicle for some otherwise stellar actors and I'm surprised that the Cohen brothers felt it prudent to unleash the final product to the big screen.

The Original -- is a Western / Horse-Opera of singular significance.This 2010 edition is a Historical Costume Drama with slightly hyperbolic & overwrought dialog that, non-the-less, better characterizes the style of speech of the time -- IF you were to see a live performance on the stage of a playhouse -- instead of on the streets of a 's~~t-kicker'.No fault of the cast, here. Their diction, stilted, of the highly filigreed dialogue is fully of the time.Most viewers will scarcely recall the actors in their characters.Arguably John Wayne is too recognizable whereas Jeff Bridges looses himself in Rooster Cogburn. Maddy must be the character who sticks out like a sore thumb because that is the whole point.The lasting impression of the first version upon several viewings is that it is Kim Darby's Maddy who has 'true grit'.The lasting impression of the second edition is that many characters display 'true grit' -- it was, after all, a gritty time. This edition also features great incidental characters.The faithful details and production values of the costuming & set dressing are too well captured by the better technology and are, if anything, too bright & clear -- loosing some of the hard-fought-for realism.This would have been a ten in my estimation if the sound-scape had more ambient character in settings of exterior scenes and the too well lighted interiors of some scenes had revealed more dust motes and a more crepescular office interior in the stables scene.My guess is that the studio pressed for a shorter running time in the final edit which rushes the Last Act.This is one worth owning.

Audiences have been crying out for a good, ole fashioned, character driven Western simmering with suspense, dripping with macho charisma and parching the viewers' throats by virtue of dust coated, sun bleached backdrops. True Grit ticks all of the above boxes and that's before we even touch upon the cast. The film is based on 14-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross who, seeking retribution for her father's murder, enlists the help of the meanest gunslinger she can find. Here Jeff Bridges is superb as a gnarled, world-weary U.S. Marshall, his authentic graveled drawl and practised indifference hark back to the cowboy antiheroes of old. Over-enthusiastic Texas Ranger, Matt Damon is also pursing the fugitive outlaw Chaney (an all too short turn from up and coming Josh Brolin). Damon and Bridges bounce off each other to provide the other key ingredient to any classic Western \u2013 humour. Watching Ross marshal the lackadaisical bemused Bridges and vim filled Damon is genuinely funny, and on a regular basis. The trials and tribulations of this skilfully balanced trio culminate in a heart-pounding finale.For many that are familiar with the somewhat quirky nature of the Coen's work might not be suspecting such a straight and almost reverent treatment of the original 60s John Wayne classic. However it is exactly this that makes for a winning formula. The film relies on tidy screen writing, tight direction, compelling acting and literally jaw-droppingly beautiful, painstakingly detailed sets.

I had seen the 1969 film in a tacky little theater in Virginia Beach 41 years ago. Nothing about this newer film is really better than the John Wayne version but it still holds up as a great and entertaining film.The two films very obviously have two different approaches to tell the story originally created by Charles Portis in the book. From a different beginning and a very different ending, we see that this is a story about Mattie and not Roster. Marshall Cogburn is very important but the story comes from the journals of Mattie Ross' life and not from Roster Cogburn. While watching the film I kept looking for a larger presence in the story from Cogburn and then realized that this was the greatest difference and the Cogburn character was not the driving force as in the first version 41 years ago. I believe it is because, as good as Jeff Bridges is, he is not and never will attain the stature John Wayne had achieved by the time he played this role. But because of that, it was more Cogburn and less Bridges.Better points include a more realistic age for the actor playing Mattie, a 14 year old girl. LeBoef is a more believable character, young and very dedicated to his calling. Maybe only a Texan can appreciate the difference between Matt Damon's and Glen Campbell's performance. The exchange with Col. G. Stonehill is better not having to play it around the persona of Strother Martin. It shows the intelligence and presence of mine that Mattie possessed.Points that were weaker include a very awkward LeBoef in his first conversation with Mattie. The obvious age difference sets this up. I was not convinced by Josh Brolin's portrayal of Chaney the murderer. Continuity errors are rampant as if the audience will believe in an 8 shot revolver or an amazing shrinking and growing rope.But never mind any of this, the movie is from the same book and this screenplay has less of a fairy tale ending than did movie made in 1969.",

            "content": "TRUE GRIT is a Coen Brothers re-make of the classic 1969 movie that starred John Wayne.In this new adaptation, Oscar winner JEFF BRIDGES (The Big Lebowski, TRON, Crazy Heart) takes the reins in the lead role of US Marshall Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn, an aging bad-tempered bully of a man, now well past his prime \u0085 who seems more interested in whisky than in law enforcement.Rooster's life is plodding along at his preferred languid, mellow pace until he is confronted by a 14 year old schoolgirl Mattie Ross (ably played by newcomer HAILEE STEINFELD), who hires him and then demands that he bring to justice Tom Chaney \u2013 a member of the \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper gang and the killer of her father. Mattie is very determined and gets her way to ride along with Rooster on his quest (much against his better judgement) \u0085Along for the ride, is US Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (played by MATT DAMON \u2013 The Bourne Trilogy, The Departed, The Talented Mr. Ripley) who is also after Tom Chaney \u2013 for the killing of a Senator up in Texas. The rest of the film is really about the adventure of the pursuit of the Lucky Ned Pepper gangAlthough some of the performances were good (noteably Hailee Steinfeld), I thought that Matt Damon in particular looked quite miscast \u2013 he really didn't look to comfortable or convincing in the role of LaBoeuf \u0085 and I got the feeling that the \"baddies\" just weren't bad enough \u0085 on occasion they were just too darn polite. I gather that Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld have been Oscar nominated for TRUE GRIT, I feel that might be a tad ambitious.I was looking forwards to TRUE GRIT, but I found that this film was an almost word for word remake, hardly anything was different to the original \u2013 no extra dimensions seemed to have been added or improved upon. On it's own merits as a standalone film, I would have scored TRUE GRIT higher, BUT \u2013 due to the fact that this is a re-make of an existing film classic \u2013 by the usually very talented Coen Brothers, I really don't believe that it added anything to the much better original \u2013 I am dropping the score slightly to 7/10.TRUE GRIT is 110mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday 11th February 2011",

Chaney escaped the law and Mattie feels that he needs to be brought to justice. On her quest to find a bounty hunter she finds an aging drunkard named Rooster Cogburn who may be just what she needs.True Grit is not a bad movie by any means, it's actually a good movie, it's just a severely underachieving one. Considering that it was directed by the Coens, who are the best directors working today, and starred Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon it should have been an instant classic. What it turns out to be is an often touching sometimes exciting film that completely fizzles before it's over.All the acting is exceptional, especially the young Hailee Steinfeld who should have a bright cinematic future ahead of her. Many of the characters are quite endearing as well and you genuinely care what happens to them. And, as to be expected from the Coens, it is expertly directed, until the end at least.Now the bad news. A large portion of the movie is shown in the trailer and so many of the events, in an already somewhat predictable storyline, are known going in. The pace is out of whack. Most of the comedy is too silly for my taste and I found Jeff Bridges' character to be used as comedy relief a bit too often. The ending is also a major disappointment as it seems to happen far too quickly and it feels like there must be a missing reel somewhere.True Grit is an enjoyable movie that will likely please many audiences. I just find it to be very disappointing being such a huge Coen Brothers fan. They usually have a knack for making you think even if you don't particularly enjoy the subject matter or the movie itself. True Grit fails to make you think, but provides you with a mostly fun time at the theater.",

            "review_title": "Oh Coen Brothers Where Art Thou?",
            "content": "Perhaps the Coen brothers are trying to be literati these days. I almost walked out of \"No Country for Old Men\" in the last half, thinking the Coen brothers had creative differences. But no, they were sticking to Cormac McCarthy's novel. Same with this movie: many people say it sticks very close to the novel. My response? Who cares! It's a movie.This was no Fargo or Raising Arizona or anything--just a boring, unoriginal western. The first real scene with Rooster in the courtroom was boring and lacked real drama. Not even that humorous. But the directors spent a lot of time on that scene, which was useless. Then Mattie proves herself to be a hard-nosed negotiator with the town's merchant, in an amusing but also long-drawn out, and unrealistic scene. And how come we don't even see a photo of her father, or have any information about him other than he was a trader? How are we supposed to root for Mattie (who doesn't even show she misses her father that much)?The scene where she plunges into the river with her horse was supposed to be highly dramatic--but it too went on too long, and it was missing something. It's quite sad, esp. for the horse, that such a scene lacked real drama. The whole scene with finding the hanged man, cutting him down, and meeting up with the Bear Man dentist (the most Coen-like character in the entire film, but out of place), was also pointless. I just felt Rooster and Mattie were just sauntering around Indian country (where were the Indians, btw?) in an episodic way. Their horses were moving so slowly, I was wondering if finding Cheney was even their goal anymore, or was it to chew the cud and listen to Rooster talk about his ex-wives to Mattie (yawn)?Some real action happens in a log cabin, where Rooster almost gets Mattie killed telling her to get on the roof and drape a blanket over the chimney. But the motivations of the 2 rogues or their relationship with Cheney or his crew is not very clear. Finally, one of them dies with a shot leg, 4 fingers chopped off, and a knife through his chest, but while he's dying, he looks like he's just winded from a bench press workout--very unconvincing. Where's the coughing up of blood and trauma from such horrible wounds? Then, in a rather ridiculous scene, Damon's character LaBouef gets dragged around while Rooster picks off a few shots from a distance at night. They all get back together but admit they lost the trail, Mattie and LaBouef make up, he leaves, and then the next morning at the creek she actually runs into Cheney (a wasted Brolin). This scene is pretty Coen-like, since Cheney recognizes Mattie but does not believe her to be a threat, she fires at him but only nicks his rib. These actions are mirrored in Fargo, where the thieves come up next to the house but are not deemed a threat until they actually smash the glass, and also the shootings are messy and ill-aimed. Anyway, we come to the best part of the entire film: Barry Pepper's portrayal of an outlaw. His look, speech and mannerisms transport us back into the past. But he gets dispatched eventually by LaBoef's carbine, after another dramatic attempt by the Coen brothers to show Rooster charging the 4 outlaws with 2 six-guns, but the shots and action seem unsatisfying for some reason. Cheney (who shot Mattie's dad when Cheney was drunk) seems to be no more than an illiterate animal, not a trading partner the father would keep around him, and he hits LaBouef over the head with a huge rock (which would probably kill him) and unceremoniously gets shot off the cliff by Mattie, in a very unsatisfying ending to the revenge, which is the main plot line of this movie. She falls down a well and stirs up a rattlesnake nest in the ribcage of this dead man, gets bit on the hand, and Rooster rescues her, sucks the blood out of her hand, and rides like the wind for the doctor, killing her horse from the exhaustion. Years later we see Mattie grown up, trying to visit Rooster, only to learn of his death months prior. She is a spinster and visits his grave. The end.I'm not sure what the great appeal of this vehicle is for a Western, other than the novel concept of a young city-girl who hires a cantankerous sot who happens to be a deadshot (this too was ruined by the errancy of Rooster's shooting the bread, perhaps another Coen touch that diminishes the character unnecessarily) to find and bring to justice her father's killer. I expected more danger, more originality, with the quality of the directors and cast, and even a successfully proved plot. But the movie seems empty, and Rooster lacks charisma, and it seemed just like an episodic Western drama, with no real excitement or passion, except the very last scene when Rooster rides the horse all night to the doctors; that scene was the most dramatic and meaningful of the entire film. Many people have problems with Rooster's speech. I was baffled at this criticism, since most actors whisper these days, and that is why I need subtitles. But I didn't need subtitles here, even with Rooster's cant. And Mattie's speech was also a realistic touch by the Coen brothers to show that in the old West, people actually did have better vocabularies than we would expect, esp. if they come from cities. In the HBO series Deadwood, this type of speech, combining a genteel vernacular with Wild West terms, would seem to be proved. But still many people disliked her \"fast, Shakespearian talk\" which only shows they had no clue that the directors were going for realism in late 19th century American speech.",

So apparently if you want to win best actor, audition for the next remake of \"True Grit\". In 30 years.

They surpass themselves in this film. It is epic and the photography is superlative in color so artful that they bring to life the vistas of the west. The film is much closer to the book, unlike the 1969 film. I was never a big fan of John Wayne because all he did in each film was play John Wayne. Jeff Bridges IS the person he plays in all of his movies. He is the new kind of modern actor who are portrayed as real people rather than as film stars. Matt Damon has quietly become one of the most outstanding actors on screen. My wife and I hardly recognized him at first and his performance was miles ahead of Glenn Campbell in the old movie. Subtle and spot on. The young woman was great though too clean for a woman (girl) of the old west. (a minor Quibble) I admire greatly Josh Brolin who is not only a fine actor but takes on what is really just a Cameo role. The picture, though epic in scope, is tightly filmed and enjoyable in each segment. Oscars ALL AROUND!!",

However John Wayne's delivery of these great lines was funny and touching, while Jeff Bridges are incomprehensible at times and not funny in the least. It's amazing that Hollywood is running out of ideas for movies and doing all these remakes lately, while TV seems to be blossoming with great stories such as Spartacus:Blood & Sand, Boardwalk Empire, Deadwood, and many many more. I've read many many good books that have yet to be made into movies. Where are all the great screen plays of these books. Hollywood if you want to make remakes, make them for movies that originally sucked. I'll give you a good example, \"The Keep\" was a fantastic book but the movie sucked badly.

This film will be remembered years hence as one of the great westerns. I never felt I was watching a remake. I never had the feeling it made any cheesy references, or tried to be anything other than the best possible film portrayal of the original material from the novel by Charles Portis, and it achieves that goal with superior excellence.The performances are all quite incredible, Jeff Bridges should win another Oscar for best actor, and Matt Damon for supporting. Of course the sensational Hailee Steinfeld steals the show with an incredibly touching performance as the spunky, smart, capable young Mattie Ross, forging her way in a man's world in order to avenge her father's murder. If she is not at least nominated for best supporting actress it would be a shame. A perfect balance of humor, realism, suspense and action make this an all around crowd pleaser. Although there is no overt romance, Mattie's innocence, pluck and verve in a world of dark forces provide a romantic quality of good vs. evil that is stunning to behold, and is felt deeply. Of course as an old timer myself, who remembers well the original film version with the great John Wayne, I can say this film is a perfect addition to the record, and somehow pays tribute to the old master without trivializing or even giving a conscious nod. The fact that the film was done in the western tradition, and done so well, is the best tribute one could hope for to Wayne. And Mr. Bridges does that as perfectly and masterfully as could be expected from any actor on Earth. This highly entertaining film carries its own weight and carries one along in its story with such force that conscious comparisons and critiques to the original are all but forgotten while viewing. But too many comparisons are burdensome, and this film stands completely on its own. This is a wonderfully made film, truly \"The Perfect Movie\" and perfect for the holidays to leave audiences satisfied and yet longing for the day when men and women may act again with honor and True Grit.",

I was a boy when westerns were 80% of everything seen on television and at the theater. I was raised on John Wayne. So, my apologies, Duke. This True Grit is a better True Grit. And here's why: This film is faithful to the original story by Charles Portis. Those, on this site and others, who criticize its dialogue should read the book. It takes little imagination to appreciate the disparity in the education (and vocabulary) that surely existed in the American West of the mid-nineteenth century. This phrasing, along with the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail give this film an authenticity and believability I've not seen before in any western.The acting of, then thirteen-year-old, Hailee Steinfeld is simply amazing. Already nominated for two awards for her role as Mattie Ross, I'm predicting an Oscar nomination for her performance. I recently saw an interview with this young lady and I found myself stunned at the differences between the actor and the character she played. Ms. Steinfeld's demeanor, voice inflections, posture, and facial features are nothing like the character she portrayed. To see such sagacity in a young actor is astounding and rare.There aren't enough acclamations for the cinematography of Roger Deakins. Its magical yet realistic beauty pops from the screen like a Rembrandt masterpiece. Known for his work on such classics as The Shawshank Redemption, Fargo, No Country for Old Men and A Beautiful Mind, True Grit is his best work to date and an Oscar nod may be in his future as well.For those who don't like remakes of truly great films, please consider this: There is nearly a half century between the two films.

What's next, a remake of Casablanca? Matt Damon's performance was the only thing worth watching. Bridges' performance was just pushed and strained. I suspect he can play a pretty good drunk. Why did he have to push it so ridiculously over the top. The ending was rather ridiculous as well. In the original, the loss of the Texas ranger was heartbreaking (which is fine in movies), but flash-forward and show her without an arm? Please, that just turns my stomach. Also, you followed a great deal of the script verbatim, but you cut out many of the best lines. Cogburn to Leboeuf about Mattie getting a whipping, \"LaBoeuf. Put it down, I said. You're enjoying it too much.\" Cogburn about the death of the ranger, \"That Texican saved my neck twice. Once after he was dead.\" Also, what's the deal with alternating between using contractions and not using them. My gosh, either get it right or don't do it. It was just annoying the way you did it. It's just (suppose to be) a good movie, not an historical documentary.If you're a Jeff Bridges fan, and want to stay that way, skip this one. Both my wife and I felt that we had wasted the $3.95 Amazon fee and also 1.5 hours of our life. I actually don't believe that the original was John Wayne's best performance, but it was quite good. However, this remake does nothing but show how hopelessly out of ideas the movie industry truly is, and how they are abusing us with cheap tricks to sell a few movie tickets. If they keep this up, they will truly eventually wreck the excitement of going to the movies.",

Would give it a 12 million out of 10 if the scroll option would allow it!A Classic Western story retold by a group of some of the most renowned cast and crew of this century. Roger Deakins (who is one of my favorite cinematographers) exceeds to portray both the beauty of the land and the character's emotions. The beauty of the land is represented in the film by capturing the colors and openness of the western world, the huge mountains, and large landscapes. Tom Chaney's character emotion is fantastically portrayed towards the end when he is fed up with Mattie Ross. There is a low shot when he is sitting down and he slowing tilts his head up and says, \"I don't need no affidavit, all I need is your silence\". The way Roger had that lit from a low angle made the audience understand the frustration and anger that Chaney was feeling.Oh, and the music! Carter Burwell excelled at making each song fit so well into the scene in which it was playing.

            "content": "I must first admit that I have never seen the original 1969 version starring John Wayne, so I can't compare this film with that on any level. I just read all the rave reviews from this film on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, and considering all the greatness the Coen Brothers usually churn out when they make films, I decided to see this with my dad today. I also know that this was picked as one of the Top 10 Films of the Year by the American Film Institute, and I usually agree with their picks when it comes to rating films as well.First and foremost, this film is extremely well-acted by all of its principal actors, most notably Jeff Bridges, who once again has lots of fun creating a roguish, partially insane, quirky character and look. Bridges also supplies much of the comic relief in the film will all his strange antics and attitude. Damon is also strong in his very limited role. His character isn't developed very much, but he delivers his lines well when he gets his close-ups. Steinfield is also solid, as the whole film rests on her shoulders, and she allows us to see a strong and stubborn teen girl who refuses to see herself as a weak, 2nd-class citizen of the time period. The character actor who plays the horse trader at the beginning is also funny and spot on, as well as the lawyer in the courtroom interrogating Bridges, and Barry Pepper as one of Cogburn's formers gangleaders. Most of this film is all about the acting and characterizations of everyone involved, and the film succeeds on that level. This is why I am giving it a fairly decent rating overall.However, at the same time I found the story to be painfully slow and far too simple for my tastes. Perhaps this is because this original was a family-oriented, PG-rated film when it was released in 1969, and it is told from a 14-year old's point of view, so considering that fact, it couldn't a be a more complex story with more plotting. It was almost something in the same vein as Disney or Little House on the Prairie, with some Coen Brothers violence added in sporadically, but still such a sweet and simple story without complexity. I'm all for character development over action scenes and such, but this move simply had too much character development in my opinion, as the first 80 minutes is just conversations and talking while slowly riding horses, without any suspense at all. Literally nothing compelling or engaging is happening on a plot level until the very end when they meet Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin - decent, but not given any screen time to do anything substantial). The film just plods along showing off the beautiful scenery in the background with characters talking and talking / exposition, etc. - but the Coens seriously needed an editor to cut some of the talking down. It's just talking withot advancing the story. I personally loved all the dialogue and talking in \"The Social Network\" - but in that movie the dialogue was always moving the story forward, and that was a more complex story. Here the movie just doesn't go anywhere until the last 15 minutes. They should have had some Indian tribes surprise them with shootout / attacks in the middle of the film a couple of times or something just to add some suspense and energy to the story. It was just way too simple and straightforward for my tastes. I prefer more complex plots that require more characters, more plot strands, and move at a faster pace. This just didn't challenge me or interest me intellectually - but I suppose that's how lots of Westerns are. Just shoot em ups scripts with good guys and bad guys, which is just boring for me. Again, the performances by the 3 leads are great, but I just wish the story had been more interesting and engaging.",

The Coen brothers definitely did not disappoint. The film is a true western, perhaps even 'grittier' than many of the classics my father made me watch over and over as a kid. As with many of the Coens' films, they're attention to detail of the setting is incredible. Despite this, the thing in this film that will be talked about is the acting. It's amazing to say the least. To those of you out there, like me, with a case of nostalgia who are worried about Jeff Bridges not being able pull off John Wayne's \"Rooster Cogburn\" there is no need to fear. Jeff Bridges not only 'pulls it off' but makes it his own. This is Jeff Bridges' \"Rooster Cogburn,\" and it's equally great in its own way. The rest of the cast from Damon to Steinfeld to Brolin is nothing to skip over in a review. They did a fantastic job, especially young Steinfeld who really impressed me. I can't imagine the pressure of being the lead in a Coen film at that young of an age, and yet she takes it in stride. In the end, you can not go wrong seeing this film. Though not as satirical as some of the Coens' other films, it is nothing short of fantastic and should not be overlooked this holiday season.",

I am however a huge fan of both Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, and the performances offered up here were sublime. Jeff Bridges was brilliant, and perhaps his best performance to date. It was a true pleasure to watch his character develop from the morally questionable and jaded lawman to the necessary hero of what is portrayed as a very wild frontier. I loved the way the movie alters your perception of the character without actually changing the character completely. Damon was equally good, and it was good to see him playing a role outside of his usual 'government agent' alter-ego. So, the film in the round? Captivating, gripping, extremely well written and the musical score was perfect for the mood of the film. The sets were excellent and the huge vistas really helped to describe a vast country that is almost impossible to grasp by modern city dwellers. Now I said that I am not a fan of American movies, and I am absolutely not a fan of westerns, but this film was enough to cause me to reconsider. I wont compare it to the original, but it is a fantastic movie and well worth watching (even if you don't like westerns). I definitely will watch this again, and maybe even again after that. Bravo.",

O.k, they kept to the original book, by starting the film with Mattie telling the story as an old lady, but basically it was almost word for word as the original. The shootout between Coogburn and Ned Pepper was not a patch on the John Wayne film for excitement. Remember Wayne twirling that rifle around one handed. Yes, i know John Wayne had a special handle put on the rifle so he could do that, but as i have stated in some of my other reviews, that was what going to the cinema was all about. Watching something and someone that is larger than life. Also the one thing that was missing, which i think is important in any film was first, a good supporting musical score. In the original, after Mattie was bitten by the snake and Coogburn put her on Blackie the horse and then rode like hell to get her to a doctor, there was a good score by Elmer Bernstein, giving the scene more effect and secondly there was hardly any humor. In the original you had a side story of Coogburn's relationship with his servant Chen Lee and a cat named General Sterling Price. As i have said, as a movie it is good in it's own right but why waste time, talent and money on remakes. Kevin Thomas.",

            "content": "I expected that this movie would be great, instead I got an average, overplayed, and drawn out western. The only star of this is Hailee Steinfeld, who easily defeats anyone who tries to stop her with a sharp tongue. Rather than try to incorporate some teenage girl features, the script and directors stick her in a tomboy role. Granted this is a girl who is asked to grow up rather quickly, but no one takes on that persona in a few days. Having been a fan of Bridges for years, I expected better than this from a guy who made White Russians famous. Bridges can be funny at times, but that almost makes up for the fact that it's hard to take him serious. A federal marshal with a drinking problem and who somehow is still employed and a good shot. Gene Wilder's character in Blazing Saddles was more believable than Bridge's and the Coen's Cogburn. The climatic fight scene is laughable at best according to this historian (me). Cogburn's speech would have been interrupted with the sound of gunshots. No one in that time period would have sat and listened to some guy tell them why he was going to shoot them. Then the fight begins and Cogburn somehow escapes with two minor wounds...are you kidding me? Four guys and the most they can inflict on one target is two minor wounds. Keep in mind these are outlaws, who live and die by their guns. Then as Pepper swings around to blow Cogburn's brains onto the dry landscape, La Boeuf comes up with a miraculous shot to save a guy he hated only a day ago. I hate to spoil the enjoyment, but this is pure Hollywood story telling as far as that shot goes. La Boeuf is somehow able to hit a guy in the head from 400 yards away with a gun who's effective range maxes out at 500 yards. For comparison purposes that's like hitting a pencil eraser from 50 yards or so away. Last but not least, is Brolin's Chaney. The audience hates him for killing Mattie's father, but since we're not introduced to him until last quarter of the film we're breathing a sigh of relief that the end must be near. La Boeuf claims Chaney puts on a dim witted act in order to gain peoples' trust easier, yet Brolin apparently decided to make Chaney mentally handicapped or so it appears. Of course, this maybe why Chaney when confronted by Mattie with a pistol in hand tells her the gun isn't cocked all the way back. Chaney also happens to have a rifle on him, which he only uses as a crutch after getting shot by Mattie. I can't decide which would be worse; getting killed by a 14 year old girl while armed with a rifle or killing a 14 year old girl that's hunted you down. Either way you look like an idiot and Chaney succeeds at almost accomplishing both scenarios. I find it laughable that Pepper would decide to leave Mattie in the care of Chaney while moving to a new hideout. Geez, Pepper thanks for setting up the next part of the story for us. A lot of reviewers have raved about the cinematography of this film and in some respects it's good. The negative is that it all looks like the exact same landscape. While traveling on the prairies of western Kansas, you're likely to find different landscapes and habitats in only a short distance. The western town isn't anything too spectacular, although it might be a little too clean. The thing people forget about the west is that people tossed garbage, raw sewage, and everything else in the road. Of course it would rain on occasion and you'd get a nasty blend of all those things plus any animal droppings from the various animals that were led through towns. Sanitation did not exist and people were lucky if they did not get sick from the diseases that lived among the filth.Overall this film goes too long and can be laughable at times due to the various impractical scenarios that the audience is led to believe. Once again though Hailee Steinfeld is an up and coming actress to be reckoned with if she can successfully transfer the energy she brought to this film to other roles.",

Of course many scenes are shared with the 1969 version and the film includes the classic \"Fill your hands you son of a bitch!\" line from Rooster Cogburn.I read somewhere, and I think it's true, that a big difference between this and the earlier version is that the focus on the story is firmly on Matty Ross, not Cogburn, who though a major character, is a supporting one. Some elements are entirely different. For example, in the 1969 version, after threatening everyone and sundry with her lawyer, we finally get to see him and discover him to be a short weedy man with a high pitched voice! There's a good reason that never happens in this version, but I won't spoil this for you.

Needless to say, I went to this movie expecting to be let down and underwhelmed by the remake, but held out hope since it was a Coen Bros. project and they usually produce good films. I was surprised. This is an outstanding movie that now has become one of my favorite westerns, right up there with Unforgiven and Tombstone. I have never read the book upon which both films are based, but I imagine this version follows it more closely. The story is far richer, and the characters are given greater depth. Jeff Bridges does an excellent job filling the very big shoes of John Wayne in his famous portrayal of Rooster Cogburn. In fact, I dare to say he is even better in the role! Matt Damon plays Texas Ranger LaBeouf, and is perfect. Barry Pepper plays Lucky Ned Pepper and even looks a little like Robert Duvall in the role. But the real star of the film, and the person around whom the story revolves is Mattie Ross, who is played with Oscar-worthy depth and skill by the unknown actress Hailee Steinfeld. I'd never heard of her before this film, and I doubt the Academy will recognize her for her work because she is so young, but this young lady really impressed me. I expect to see much more from her after this movie. You will leave the theater a little sad, but the film offers plenty of laughs just like the original. LOVED IT!",

            "content": "True Grit was an attempt by the Coen Brothers, who are known for their postmodern takes in their movies, to make a postmodern Western. They partially succeed in bringing in some postmodern elements, but ultimately, as with many of the recent Coen Brothers movies, the movie fails to deliver.The first thing that stood out to me in the course of this movie was the unemotional and shallow characters. Who, in real life, can be so unemotional and even if we accept that this is \"just a movie\", why would anyone think that such unemotional and shallow characters would hold any appeal to any audience? In any case, the Coen brothers thought so and in doing so, make a muck out of what could have been a potentially interesting social drama set in a Western setting.Now, we come to know by the first few minutes of his screen time that the main character, the anti-hero, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) is a very nasty sort of bloke who routinely makes his unpleasantness known. In my opinion, Jeff Bridges does his best to make good out of an exceptionally shallow role. In one of the scenes, Cogburn kicks two Native American children who are sitting outside a cottage, thereby showing that he is a racist in addition to being a generally nasty person.The other main character was Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), who fills the role of a very business-like and again, unemotional, child protagonist. We rarely come across children who behave in such a manner as Mattie does in this role and even if we did, we can be sure that such a child is suffering from some kind of a social disorder. So much for my pop philosophy. At any rate, Steinfeld again tries to make the best out of a bad situation, but thanks to the nature of the role, ends up again being too artificial to be even fictionally appealing (for an element of realism is always an important element of fiction).After mostly boring and shallow performances however, the scenic settings and the action in some of the scenes form a sort of saving grace. In the end, the movie ends pretty abruptly and we never see any conclusive end to the story as such. Who knows? Maybe in trying to be as shallow as possible, the story unconsciously finds itself reflecting an aspect of reality where many of real human relationships remain unfulfilled and inconclusive at the end.",

The dialogue was very stilted and took away from the characters. It made sense for the precocious girl to speak in this manner, but not anyone else. The criminals with a third grade education spoke as if they were in the middle of a Shakespeare Western. It is too bad, because Bridges is good as is the young woman.Overall a disappointment. It was merely an average movie with a genre rarely made anymore. It could have been so much better. The story line was excellent as was the suspense. I believe that if this movie were made with unknown actors or director that this could have been a made for TV (cable of course) movie.",

There is not a single bad performance in the film.Jeff Bridges shines as Rooster Cogburn. In the original we could tell it was Wayne. Here, we see nothing of Bridges.For it being Hallie Steinfield's first film she is phenomenal and has just as much screen presence as Bridges.After he got away from the Bourne films Matt Damon has consistently impressed me. His performance in this film is no exception playing the exact 180 of Rooster Cogburn.Josh Brolin, despite only appearing in about ten minutes of the film, gives a great interpretation of the film's villain. More of a wet dog than an immediately noticeable threat but is just as willing to kill Mattie Ross as he is anyone else The cinematography is, in many ways, exquisite. There is one shot in particular where Cogburn, trying to show his skills at shooting throws a biscuit in the air and fires. The angle chosen is a highly interesting one The film is rich in humor and smart dialogue. Exactly what one would expect from a Coen Brothers film.Try to remember that the original will always be there. This film does not change that",

True Grit is never the first thought when the talent involved in this picture is ever discussed elsewhere. But it is sincere and well executed; Steinfeld gives a career making performance (if any stands out she does bc of the script) and without a doubt was excellent. The dialogue is sparse, sometimes to the detriment of the story. Some lines seem muddled or unclear. I don't know if the sound was off or the style of the editing. I'm not a technical guy but something seems unmixed properly. The sound design is off but I digress, It's just not the definitive. Even by western standards; 3:10 for Yuma's remake for example is more gritty. True Grit has genuine heart though if that piqu\u00e9's anyone's interest. Every aspect of this film is well crafted. The action is tight. Some day when looked back on the only defining aspect of this film will be Steinfeld. The Coens have down better work, as well as Damon and Bridges. Pepper (supporting) and Steinfeld (starring) were the best acting wise in the end. Ironic bc Pepper filled his performance with realism unlike Brolin unfortunately. Pepper feels of the period, Brolin feels like a star cameo on a tv show, I feel it was the only casting that was interchangeable and could have been filled by any number of character actors. Bill Paxton in the eighties woulda crushed that role. Brolin plays it very surface level, no depth. The film is immersive though I will give it that as stated lots of heart. But also immersive in the unfortunate sense that because you as the audience have to interpret and train your ear for the dialogue.",

Some of the scenes in Jeff Bridges version were over the top, like watching a Rob Zombie movie. John Wayne's screen presence was enough to sell the character of Rooster Cogburn and he didn't need all of the extra graphic language and gore to show that he was one tough son of a b****! The only way to describe the real True Grit with John Wayne is that it was everything a movie could want, a believable plot and not a lot of garbage and distractions inserted to help you like the movie. Again, I enjoyed both, but still think the original is the standard bearer! Just my opinion......................",

This movie was good enough to instantly remove any reservations I had about it and kept me entertained the entire time. I don't even remember looking at my watch. Jeff Bridges did an awesome job with the character and the remaining cast was very good as well. Loved it.There is one thing that disturbs me. I noticed this viewing Open Range on its opening night. When Robert Duval's character, Boss Spearman, unloads the shotgun through the wall of the feed shed into the back of one of his adversaries, the blast knocks him into a wall on the other side of the alley and the dude's leg is twitching as he lays in the aftermath. At this point the crowded theater broke into a laugh.?? I found it disturbing then and did again a few nights ago as Quincy is shot in the head by Marshall Cogburn. WTF?

LaBoef was played well apart from the fact that he was shot in a critical place, with no dressing or medical attention somehow managed to carry on as normal, which was slightly annoying, however his character was played extremely well. Chaney however was exceptionally annoying, how they found him in the end, was as though the audience had been cheated of the trio finding him at the end of their elaborate journey. To have him just killed by the Mattie as well, was a disappointment as firstly she was not authorised to kill, as she was not a Marshall and so would have been trialled for murder, as well as the fact that neither of the bounty hunters in the film would have got any reward, rendering the whole ordeal fairly pointless.This film had brilliant acting, along with stunning shots but lacked the fluency of a great movie, it instead relied heavily on chance, as everything in this movie seems to have been left to it.",

            "content": "For starters, I believe this film will revitalize westerns the way Unforgiven did in 1992. The Coen Bros. have created a remake far superior to the John Wayne classic. I had the advantage of seeing the original, but not reading the original book (I plan on reading it since I got it for Christmas). IMO, John Wayne shouldn't've won an Oscar for this role, it was a usual, run of the mill Wayne character. In other words, Jeff Bridges blew Wayne out of the water. His Rooster Cogburn is a much more deeper, sincere (and obvious) drunk, which strengthens him. At first I had trouble understanding what he was saying, but I gradually figured it out. This further solidifies Bridges' comeback as a really talented, skilled actor. Matt Damon's performance was the most like the original character's, that of LaBeouf; this isn't a bad thing, it's still a great performance. I was disappointed at how little I saw of Josh Brolin, he only has maybe at most 20 minutes of screen time; he's one of my new favorite actors, he's like Daniel Day-Lewis: he can play any role and totally disappear in the role. This is probably the only major criticism I can offer the film: too little Josh Brolin. Now Hailee Steinfeld, she's got a real career ahead of her. She was by far better than Kim Darby in the original film; she made the character more disciplined and determined and believable. It seemed Darby played the role as a little girl trying really hard to act adult and not always pulling it off, she was frequently irritating at it; but Steinfeld plays the character perfectly, by making her totally adult, not trying to act adult, but making her believably adult; as in it's not some act she's putting on, it really is a part of her character. Also, the look and feel of the film was spot-on; although it doesn't establish an exact time (as in, for instance at the beginning it would say,\"Arkansas, 1875\" or something like that), you know where and when you are the whole time, every detail of the film is precise and accurate, from the costumes to the setting to the Southern dialect. The Coen Bros. are among my favorite filmmakers (Fargo is one of my all-time favorite movies), and they just keep on spitting out classics; I still think Fargo is their best, but this one is definitely yet another classic.",

Haillee Stanfield did a good job as Maddie; however, Kim Darby's performance in the original was different than anything I had ever seen in movies at that time. I believe Darby's performance was a ground breaking role for actresses. Still, I felt that the remake was superior to the original in many ways until the final scene of the film. The original John Wayne version left me happy as it wrapped up the odds and ends of the story. By jumping ahead a decade or so the filmmakers took away from the story itself. I liken it to watching a documentary on the 2004 Red Sox and their breaking of the \"Curse of the Bambino\" and ending the documentary with the White Sox sweeping the Red Sox in the first round of the 2005 playoffs.

One of them is Hailee Steinfeld's performance as Mattie Ross, which I found all in all solid, and actually better than those provided by all the other 'big names'.However, aside for that, the movie is quite a bore... the whole story came across as pretty pointless to me: lack of a driving force, no memorable moments, excruciatingly linear plot, seriously underdeveloped characterizations for both main and secondary characters (e.g. what is Brolin exactly doing in there?), etc. The performances from Bridges and Damon felt rather stifled and uninspired, and by the way, it wasn't easy to follow what they were mumbling all the time, as it sounded like they thickened their fake accents by stuffing whole packs of cotton wool in their mouths (set the fake accent switch to Italian-mobster-mode and they're both ready for the lead role in The Godfather part IV).As for the over dramatization... well, that actually happened all of a sudden, and the result is that the last part of the movie was almost unbearable in this respect. Seriously. It almost felt like the Cohen bros. had a sudden change of heart, and that for some inexplicable reason they wanted to turn the movie from a (lame) western into some kind of over the top depressing (and lame) tearjerker.So, all in all I think this movie is watchable (except for the last 30 minutes or so), but not a good one. 5/10",

The Texas Ranger is hilarious, even if they make fun of his Texas pride consistently throughout the movie. Jeff Bridges did a beautiful job of being a drunken- yet soft- Marshall. My personal favorite was the witch doctor, who questioned whether or not they needed \"medical attention.\" Though the Asian man- who owns the store where Rooster Cogburn resides in- was not as prevalent of a character in the new version as he was in the original, it did not deteriorate the eloquence of the movie at all. If you let that be the reason you dislike True Grit 2010, your spit is overpowering.It doesn't matter if you \"can't remake a John Wayne movie.\" It's Jeff Bridges 41 years later and the Coen Brothers accomplished a remake masterpiece.

The score is overused with too scarce a change in melody, and what seems promising as a western at first turns into a tissue melodrama with the obvious side effects. Motivations, except for the female lead, are obscure, and the further the list goes into supporting, the further the characters and motivations go binary.

There are not explosions and special effects every ten minutes, it is just a beautiful story told from the eyes of a precocious and strong willed 14 year old girl! I wish more movies like this were being made for us real adults!!!",

            "content": "I'm not sure why the Coens remade this movie, as it doesn't seem to me that they made any enhancements, and they followed pretty much the same plot. Well, they did their laid-back thing, which is sometimes enjoyable. In this case, I felt they removed any drama or suspense that might have been had and that was very satisfying in the original movie. Maybe it's because I had already seen that previous movie; if you haven't, maybe you would enjoy this. I advise you to turn on the subtitles, though, from the start; I had to resort to them half-way through or so, after I hadn't been able to understand a word that was said between two characters in one scene. Jeff Bridges speaks as though he has a wad of tobacco in his mouth; the other male actors just seem to mumble. It's amazing that the characters seem to manage to understand each other ;-). I facetiously asked my husband, \"are they speaking English?\" The subtitles revealed that they were mumbling a very formal form of (old-fashioned?) English, which turned out to be humorous at times. Maybe the actors just didn't feel comfortable with it. Or maybe the dialog was meant to contrast the female protagonist, who appears well-educated and well spoken, with the rest of 'em. If so, it didn't seem to be an effective ploy. Other than my complaint about their diction, though, the actors did a good job of creating odd-ball characters. I was particularly impressed with Matt Damon for hardly appearing to be Matt Damon, although I couldn't quite \"get\" his character from the dialog that was written for it. That seemed to be true for all of the \"characters,\" none of whom really stood out for me.",

Still it's a good watch and does have it's moments. very good supporting cast performances. Jeff Bridge's rooster was perhaps a little darker than Wayne's version but the low energy acting of bridges could account for this. when i say low energy, i'm not suggesting bad performance. Jeff bridges style has always struck me as a laid back hippie type. Of course i don't claim that my review is unbiased, as i am a duke fan.",

And it basically is the same movie just made in the 21st century to broaden the story's appeal to a new generation. After all how many people will now sit down to watch the old classic westerns? Especially people of a generation younger than me.There were almost the same lines \"If I met a Texan who didn't drink water from a horse's hoof, I'll buy him a drink\" and the same scenes - Mattie swimming the river on her horse. The classic reins in his teeth, guns blazing charge was poorer than the original So if you're going to just repeat it all, then why bother? Nothing new was added. Except for CGI which was frankly poor - the opening scene of the train coming into the station is a prime example. As well as Rooster and Mattie on horseback.Very disappointed.",

For instance the storyline did not focus as much on the essence of the character portrayed of Mattie Ross in this version. I felt her role was considerably weaker, and much of the \"glory\" was given and focused on Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges. In the original, the movie focused more on Mattie Ross' role, however the men in the movie received the greatest focus. However I do believe the gal who portrayed Mattie Ross in this newer version did not act out her role as convincingly and as well as Kim Darby. Thus the \"glory\" was given to Bridges and Damon. However if a better choice had been made on the selection of the Mattie Ross character, the focus would have been on her, as we experienced in the original version. Thus the story would have followed suit with the original because the female character in this version would have been the primary focus of the storyline, as it was meant in the first place. Also the stabbing of the horse with the knife to get it to run faster and longer was fairly corny. Also the ending was so ridiculous because we were expecting the ending we were accustomed to in the original version. The added commentary made no sense because this wasn't a true story, so why the unnecessary dialog of who went where, who died when and so forth. Were we introduced to this information in the original? No! So, why bother throwing it in just to create a \"filler\"?? Overall I felt the movie was more of a bummer than the treat I was looking for.",

In order to bring her father's murderer to justice she hires U.S Marshal \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges); known for getting his man. They are joined by LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) a Texas Ranger looking for the same man for a separate offense.Mattie Ross's character is written with maturity and intelligence. Hailee Steinfeld portrays it wonderfully. She holds her own on the screen in the midst of Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon like a seasoned veteran. I have yet to see an interview with Hailee it will be interesting to hear what she normally sounds like to understand how much a departure this character was from her real identity. Her introductory performance is second only to Jennifer Lawrence of \"Winter's Bone\".The only scene that left me uncomfortable was the scene in which Rooster kicks to Indian children who were sticking a donkey with pointed sticks off the porch. I do not care for animal cruelty but when he pushed the children and the laughter in the audience reminded me off the era; post civil war. The same civil war vet that protected a donkey probably wouldn't have raised a finger to help a Black person.After shaking that off I got back to enjoying the story, which I did. The script was written well and interesting. It was an old fashioned good guy, bad guy shoot 'em up which was worth the time.rivareviews.com",

There is not much else to it, it's that straight forward. Don't get me wrong though, it is still worth a watch if you are in to westerns or if you are in for a good movie, but in all honesty I enjoyed '3:10 to Yuma' for instance a lot more.",

This time around The Coen brothers write and direct this Western tale of revenge. Mattie's father is shot and killed by the outlaw Chaney (Josh Brolin) and now Mattie wants payback. Her mother is too grief stricken and her brother is a baby that leaves her with the job of pursuing down the murderer, but she'll need some help. She is witty and head strong and eventually gets the help of a down and out lawman named Cogburn, who she believes has enough \"True Grit\" to help her track down Chaney. Along the way she meets a Texas Ranger only known as LeBoeuf played by Matt Damon, and the three go off on an adventure and discover a few surprises along the way. This film has a simple premise but is filled with some great writing and characterization. Its gets a bit dialogue heavy at times, but is never boring. Jeff Bridges gives another Oscar worthy performance and Matt Damon surprisingly slips in to his character easily. He is a great actor but in this film he really took it to another level. Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper appear briefly but give memorable performances. I believe this film is one of the best written films this year. It should certainly win a couple of awards for Best adapted Screenplay. More than anything the character that holds this whole film together is Mattie herself played by the relatively unknown Hailee Steinfeld. She is interesting to watch and holds her own against veteran big time actors, throw in an Oscar nod for her as well. I don't think the film itself will win best picture (although the Academy is partial to the Coen Brothers ) but it definitely deserves a nomination. I didn't like \"No Country for Old Men\" or \"Burn After Reading\" but \"True Grit\" is a welcome surprise and one my favorite Coen Brothers films.

At the time this film is set (1880), there were no such things as tampons. Nor were there any commercially available menstrual pads. Women (and girls like Mattie) had to use rags, strips of old towels, etc., to absorb their menstrual blood, and they had to wash and dry them after use. These rags were extremely uncomfortable to wear. No girl or woman would be able to ride astride while wearing them. This would cause chafing, even bruising, and great discomfort, and the risk of blood leaking down their legs, through their clothes, and on to the saddle would be very high. At this time menstruation was regarded as a shameful secret, and no young girl would take the risk of any man becoming aware that she was having her period. How could Mattie have hidden this from the men? How would she have managed to wash and dry her rags? How could she have ridden astride a horse day after day? How could the Coen brothers have made a film that totally ignores this aspect of a woman's physiology? It's completely absurd. Maybe men watching the film wouldn't think about this, but I guarantee any woman watching it would think, 'Hang on, this is is ridiculous.'",

Granted there are quite a few movies that deserve to be revisited . Primarily because they would benefit from better cinematography and effects. However, this is not one of them. The cast of characters perform in true A-list fashion . The cinematography is excellent as one would expect from such a project. The tough part comes when trying NOT to compare Jeff bridges to John Wayne . It's painfully difficult to keep from disliking anyone who has the temerity to attempt to play one of the Duke's roles. Lets face it. There was one and only one John Wayne and Jeff Bridges ain't him !!! So, in closing I will say this. While they managed to do a decent job of it. I hope the movie falls flat on it's face. I find it repugnant that people be rewarded for lack of originality and laziness. And furthermore I myself will go out of my way to avoid any movie with Jeff Bridges in it. There is no way he can claim this as an homage to the Duke. Rather, I feel that ANY actor who would allow themselves to be cast in one of John Wayne's signature roles has little or no respect nor any class . There are certain things you JUST DON'T do. The next thing you know they will be doing a re-make of Casablanca or It's a Wonderful Life .",

            "content": "\"I once lapped filthy water from a hoofprint and was glad to have it\" Inspiring words from Texas Ranger LaBouef as he reclines with his unlikely vigilante compadres by the campfire. More importantly, words reflective of a feeling I was left with upon walking away from True Grit.There's a couple ways one can convey a sense of desolation in film. One is artfully...with an almost abstract yet mournful beauty and longing that ruthlessly sinks it's talons into one's pelt...often drawing blood...blood willingly given because the feeling is both terrible and exquisite all at once. The other is ironically...with a haphazard attempt at the first, perhaps, but without the underlying element of soul there to breath life into the artwork. Ironic still, is the mystery of the Coen brothers giving us an example of each...the first, with No Country for Old Men...and the second, with True Grit.No Country was masterful in its capacity to leave one thirsty for something...ANYTHING...that might provide hope..while simultaneously cultivating a deeper, existential acceptance of the poetry of an ofttimes ruthless, predatorial universe. Alas, no such mastery was to be found in Grit. How can there be mastery when the characters themselves are a bunch of morons? How can there be mastery when the viewer is penned, like a country chicken, in the cage of a myopic, pointless story line? There's just not enough of anything to give this movie free range, which is the signature allure of the Old West. Maybe this is the fault of the original, but I'll never know. I haven't seen it nor do I intend to...especially now. With little to work with (\"no excuse!\" I cry) the Coen's are left grasping at straws...like trying to work in a few randomly inserted elements filched, in spirit, from Jarmusch's Dead Man. It worked for Jarmusch...but flopped in the dirt with Grit, lacking context or continuity. Or trying to wring some remote feeling of heart or nobility from the walking dirt clod that is Rooster Cogburn...something successfully portrayed in Cat Balou or Unforgiven..........or the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.Grit just kind of wanders around, poking in the dirt while occasionally, almost listlessly, killing someone as if out of boredom. The climax? A lazy dust devil, without momentum or majesty. A twirl or two in the heat of the day, then gone without making lasting impression.The music played and the credits rolled. All I can say is, thank god for hot showers and filtered water",

            "content": "It would be futile to review this film without comparisons to the 1969 version. The 1969 version netted John Wayne an Oscar win...the only Oscar win of his career. I'm going to predict that Jeff Bridges is going to get a strong Oscar nomination from this film. In my opinion he deserves it. For the first few minutes of the film it was difficult not to think of John Wayne's characterization of Rooster Cogburn. But it was not long before Jeff Bridges beguiled me into his portrayal of Cogburn. Bridges' portrayal stands very well on its own. The other possible Oscar nomination that may proceed from this film is for Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. The young actress steals your heart with her youth and vitality while presenting a very credible portrayal of a self-possessed, head-strong Mattie Ross. Matt Damon presented an enjoyable LaBoueff, but his portrayal was completed eclipsed by Bridges and Steinfeld. Josh Brolin's Tom Chaney was likewise credible, though it was a bit surprising seeing him play a bit of a dim-wit. Barry Pepper was a very pleasant surprise as an almost charming Lucky Ned Pepper, the leader of the outlaw gang. Unfortunate for Brolin and Pepper that the story necessitated their limited screen time.This movie gets a rock-solid '10' from me. I plan to see it again in the theater, and the DVD will grace my collection.",

At first I thought a PG-13 movie by the Coen Brothers would hold them back from their usual style, but it is plenty violent and often very funny with the usual Coen's dry sense of humor. The scenery is also great, the film takes place in Arkansas, and I'm not totally sure if the filmed on location but knowing the Coen Brothers they probably did and they did an awesome job of capturing the open plains of the State during winter. With it being a western (I'm not the biggest fan of them) and the run time I was a little concerned but it felt no where near the 2 hour length it ran at. As for it being a remake, I haven't yet watched the original but I did see this one with my dad who said it followed the original pretty well and I have also read that the Brothers stayed extremely close to the source material so if you are a dedicated fan to this story no need to worry. I highly recommend this if you are a Bridges, Coen Brothers, or western fan.",

            "content": "From the first scene, this movie showed it had problems. Flicking off a quick adaptation of the 1968 Charles Portis novel, the Coens should have done more re-drafts to translate it into their first actual Western. The protagonist girl, Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), voice-overs from the start, which acts as a poor substitute for action. Mattie chooses \"Rooster\" (Jeff Bridges) to help her find the \"coward\" Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Rooster is not really the true grit US Marshall promised, but more like a mumbling annoying caricature. And Mattie isn't a loving daughter seeking revenge, but a rich swot balancing her moral ledger. The Coens used the book's period dialog unchanged, but inconsiderately have the characters speaking that complex dialog very fast for the period. Rooster has a forced-in-his-throat affectation. To make his dialog even more difficult to hear, he constantly leaves a cigarette in his mouth, and gravelly mumbles out of the left-hand side of it. LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) is permitted to affect a non-Texan accent for his Texas Ranger character. Add these affectations to period dialog and we endure unbearably fast speech without the benefit of subtitles. To further add to disbelief, Joel and Ethan Coen throw in a discussion discarded from earlier movies. To quote the 14-year-old, \"Malum in se. The distinction is between an act that is wrong in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws and mores.\" Huh? You get the idea. Sure the cinematography is beautiful, the period dress excellent, but the movie is boring. And if you like gritty emotion, you won't find it in this movie. The storyline has them trek into Indian Nations, implying conflict with Indians, but again, not in this movie. So for those who usually like the grit of Coen movies such as No Country for Old Men, I would suggest waiting for their next one, their next original one.",

It was laugh out loud funny, and the audience and myself laughed throughout, but I could have swore the movie was about a girl avenging her fathers death, but that played a back seat role to the comedy. I don't know, I just expected some No Country for Old Men intensity at some point, but there was none. The girl barely even seemed bothered that her father was just murdered.

And the script was literate, with familiar passages from the earlier version, and thoughtful amendments. I would not denigrate it by calling it a \"remake\", since it is an entirely original film, resting upon a familiar and well loved story. I have a deep affection for the western genre of film, and this is an extremely worthwhile addition. Deeply satisfying, visually satisfying, storytelling at its best. Highly recommended.

It just make no sense. The whole falling into the hole thing + snakebite was also very theatrical. And one guy against four?

Now I don't mean to offend John Wayne fans but I just found Jeff Bridges performance more entertaining. Now to the movie. True Grit is a good movie. I just watched it and went on the theory that it was based on the book instead of the original movie. I found True Grit very funny and entertaining. It was a bit slow in the beginning. That is my main beef with this movie. The movie moves along at a leisurely pace, maybe to leisurely to me. Now I'm not the type who needs explosions every where to like a movie. If you look at my top 10 movie list I put No Country For Old Men in there. I refer to that because that movie is very slow. For that movie it works. With this movie I wished it would have moved a bit faster and went right into the search for Chaney. When the movie finally picked up it got really good. I found it very humorous. I was laughing throughout the whole thing. Another small thing that I didn't like was the finale with Tom Chaney. It seemed like it ended to fast. As soon as she was captured it only took like ten minutes to get her back. After the very fast ending I thought it was over. After that I was ready for the movie to be over. It felt complete. Then there was an epilogue which left a dry taste in my mouth.Other than the pacing, the finale, and the ending, I really enjoyed this film. It had hilarious moments, great action and great acting. I gave this movie a 7. With me a 7 means I really liked it. I am not to generous with ratings. I've only ever given 2 movies 10's, those being It's a Wonderful Life and Schindler's List.

The acting is good all round and some of the photography is beautifully evocative of the epic landscape except for the epilogue which seems to be shot on DV and was a lame ending anyway. But the film belongs to Jeff Bridges. Matt Damon is a useless appendage and Hailee Steinfeld, the ostensible centre of the film, acts very well but her character seems to learn nothing about herself, a fault of the story no doubt but frustrating all the same. The town is interesting to see in its detail and in its political structure, however, once we leave the town we are supposed to enter a mythic landscape but this is scuppered by the paucity of the story. The only epic constituent of the film is the character Jeff Bridges plays and his performance is the only real reason to watch the film. Barely recognisable under the beard, Bridges is the seen-it-all Rooster Cogburn is a lawman with no respect for the law, a cold blooded killer who risks his own life to save others, a showman who keeps to himself and a stranger to himself and his past.

To be completely fair, I must admit to being a huge fan of the older Classic Westerns. I grew up watching Gunsmoke, Rawhide, etc. and thoroughly loved the Clint Eastwood Westerns. Just about anything Hollywood has unleashed as a Western since 2000 has been a great let down.

            "content": "I loved it! For the characters, every asset is maximized in pursuit of their goal. Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) maximizes the threat and services of a good lawyer, her sharp wit, intellect and many other skills. Rooster (Jeff Bridges) uses his gun for killing, entertainment, and an old West version of instant messaging. And La Boeuf (Matt Damon) maximizes his one good asset, dogged persistence. The movie opens with a tune immediately very familiar and comforting. Variations of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms, never sung until the closing credits, make up most of the score. The song is a song of comfort; I started singing the words in my head during the movie and felt peaceful and strong right away. The message of True Grit is that this feeling of comfort and resolve can be obtained in a violent and unpredictable world by sticking to your guns, maximizing your assets, and rolling intelligently with the proper restaint when something unexpectedly bad happens. Leaning on the Everlasting Arms tell the movie's message in song; the character of Mattie embodies it. The moment she enters any scene in the movie you feel that everything is going to be OK. Mattie, a 14 year old girl, will work it out with her amazing intellect and ability to cut through all bullshit to get to the roots of truth, justice and most of all grit. It is grit that Mattie admires the most and so she picks Rooster as the U.S. Marshall to pursue her father's killer over the other Marshalls. She also picks a Texas Ranger, Le Boeuf to accompany them and comes to admire his persistence though not his fumbling ineptitude at catching criminals. She also develops a bit of a crush on him. While the other characters suffer from mental problems of one sort or the other, and have little plan or talent for executing one, Mattie is optimistic and cheerful every day because as Big Boi recently rapped, she has a \"backup plan for her backup plan\" and she has many tools in her bag (including a gun) to see it through to completion. Most of all she has the ability to pick talent and corral that talent towards her aims. In this regard, the Coen Brothers must of seen something in her they value in themselves. The Coen Brothers surely corralled great talent to present this movie to us flawlessly: the setting, costumes, the beards, the comedy, the score, the violence, the casting, we are once again in the hands of masters and it's all very comforting again. For me the movie becomes epic at the end. I don't use the word lightly. In Colorado and in the outdoors community, we reserve the word epic for an outdoor adventure that has gone completely south. You don't epic when you forget your peanut butter and jelly sandwich and get lost for 10 minutes on your hike back. You epic when you are caught in a whiteout at 4pm at 12,000 feet and can't ski anymore and have to abandon your skis. It's not really cool to epic, usually it means you were unprepared or made a bad decision. But it happens to most everybody who spends anytime outdoors, because we are only human and the natural world and weather and events are sometimes violent and unpredictable. Mattie forgets that there is a pit behind her, in the usual Biblical lyricism of the film, and gets bitten by snakes. As Rooster rushes her to the doctor they hit a point where they are in the wide open, there are no trees, no features. The movie has been reduced to landscape, to effort, to breath, to a sick young girl, and her earthly father for the time being. The heavenly father is supposedly there too watching down on them, they are in his everlasting arms. But for the atheist Coen Brothers, it is not the arms of the heavenly father that save Mattie. It is the powerful athletic legs of Mattie's horse, Little Blackie, a horse that she picked for it's talent and loves. She picked Rooster for his grit and talent with a gun, not his big gut from years of alcoholism and she loves him too. Like all her other good choices it puts her in good stead as the fat man is able to run with her in his arms to the doctors house when Little Blackie dies from exhaustion. We can love others and ourselves and detest those we should detest with confidence, when we make good trades and choices, choose the right people based on their talents and grit and do our best to plan out the achievement of our goals and the overcoming of the epic situations that get in the way. Such a clich\u00e9d movie (actually it's just my review that is clich\u00e9d), I can't wait to see it again.",

            "content": "\"I was informed that it was the Coen Bros. (True Grit) that actually had not seen the original Film as well as Jeff Bridges.\" I argue: It is virtually impossible not to have seen or least in-part True Grit, the original Film. Kim Darby (who played Mattie) in the first film taught myself Drama in Film at UCLA, so of course we all had to watch and hear stories about her experience for a semester. If you own a TV, then you have seen True Grit... John Wayne's only Oscar Performance and being that it was a Paramount Picture Production and the new Film is also and being that Bridges is a \"Duke\" fan, the comments I believe were to draw the attention away from some of the negative reviews and the somewhat hapless advertising that Paramount has done for the sequel. True Grit was the biggest film of the Summer of 1969 and everyone saw or heard about this film then. Glen Campbell who played the Texas Ranger in the original film was on all the Talk Shows and Clips were played! Kim Darby thought then was a new bright young star was everywhere! And John Wayne, for any decent Filmmaker, they have studied the role of \"Rooster\" greatly. The Coen's are sometimes anti-Hollywood and many see anti-commercial Film and are sometimes it seems anti-publicizing their own Films. But that is the way they work... the new Film is more of a Roger Deakins Film, long time Coen Bros. Cinematographer than anything else and his vision is again amazing which makes the film well worth the price of admission! Its the most conservative film they have ever made and their first real western. It fails is many ways and Bridges seems not very comfortable playing the part that Duke made so famous. Again, I don't expect the Coens have to answer to anyone as they have always done it their own way and made wild comments about their films, sometimes positive and many times negative. The new Film draws sometimes verbatim from the Original Script which accounts for the Editors to have drawn from the original film. And of course Thespian Actors such as Bridges applaud themselves by not drawing off somebody else's performance! I strongly advise to screen the original Film. \"The new True Grit will gracefully ride into the sunset!",

I would have liked the characters, especially Jeff Bridges to speak a little more clearly as it mostly sounded fake and very annoying. Subtitles on a few parts would have helped.. It's almost like they thought everyone back then should speak like cavemen (although some of the conversations were very educated which contradicted their ability to speak).I did however really like the humor and one liners added to the movie as well as the great action shots (hanging 3 at the start, chopping off fingers, cutting down man from tree, etc).It was worth seeing for sure but I will not see it again or buy it for my movie collection.",

But the star performance of all was the language - and if the script writer doesn't win an Oscar for this film then there's no justice. Along with Mattie's pony-tails, it just seemed to capture and encapsulate the era perfectly - and it was beautiful - poetic even. Is this better than the original? You might think this should be the six million dollar question: but the truth of the matter is that it really isn't that important a question - because this remake truly stands on its own two feet. My gut feeling is that the original will stand the test of time better that this remake - John Wayne at his absolute best is simply something that is impossible to duplicate - but then this remake doesn't try to - and in this it makes for a beautiful addition to the Franchise.The one part of the film though that might have been better left on the cutting room floor was the slightly random and completely extraneous interlude with the Doctor in the Bear skin.

I really like a good period movie, especially westerns. The look, sound and feel of the time period was captured quite well at the beginning, but once they left town to set out on the hunt there wasn't much to distinguish it from other westerns, as there was only a few people still involved in the plot and there was no towns or settlements to capture the essence of the time. The other thing I didn't like was there was very little action in the first half of the movie. They did a good job of developing the characters, even though mostly the conversations were uninteresting, but it needed a fight or shootout or something to reflect how tough it was in the old west of that period. After all it is a western. The ending was more like an old Disney movie, not what you'd expect from the Coen bros. The acting in the movie was terrific. Gotta give them credit. Bridges and the girl were outstanding as was Matt Damon. I wish Josh Brolin would've been given a bigger part as he was the man they were chasing.",

The first is one of the greats of all time and a classic, the remake is a great movie, in time, maybe a classic. Time will tell on that.I was first intrigued when I read a review that stated the lines in the second version, the Coen version, were straight from the book. After just finishing the book, I can honestly say, the author of that opinion is delusional, on drugs, I wish I had , and flat out wrong. In fact, the first True Grit follows the book, scene for scene and line for line , much more accurately than the remake. It is like A Christmas Carol or Bonnie & Clyde. If you read the book, or book(s) for B& C....all the movies put parts in that follow the books & yet all of them go on their own too. Between them all, you get a lot of the original story....eventually. The first meeting between Mattie and Rooster, in particular, piqued my interest in regards to reading the book. As I assumed, meeting at an out house was not in the book. It is one of the few flaws in the remake that is typical of modern film makers. It appears, some of the least desirable human conditions excite the young movie minds, be it vomiting or bowel movements, the young directors seem to think the public wants to watch these less dignified and visually unstimulating acts. The Coen brothers most heralded film, Fargo, again had a prominent vomit scene, so you should come to expect that in their creations. What is worse is, the scene is completely out of character for Mattie Ross. If you read the book you will know, she would never have chose to do that, no matter how headstrong she is, she is still at the age of 14, a lady. A very practical lady at that, who would have waited for Rooster to re-enter the bar so she could converse.The distinct difference in the basic plot and decision making of Rooster, in the remake, compared to the book or the original movie, is confusing. His knowledge of the Indian territories is discarded to some extent in the new version along with his resolve to catch the bandits and the relationship with the Texas Ranger. In book adaptations, I can't help but always wonder, if you didn't like the plot, why did you do the movie? That being said, this is an excellent film. The look, direction, music, mood, acting, script is all of the highest quality and it was enjoyable from start to finish. Seeing an ing\u00e9nue is always exciting and Hallie Stanfield shines. Between her, Chloe Grace Moretz and Raffey Cassidy, one has to wonder, how can a kid understand life enough to portray that emotion on film? If you haven't seen them, both the original and this version is must see for movie aficionados and for the causal movie goer alike. Both versions are fun and examples of the best of their era or any other era.",

The incredible performance by a young Miss Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross stole the show. While Damon, Brolin and Bridges all turned in wonderful performances, it is my opinion that the theatrical credits on the advertisements should actually have omitted Brolin as a headliner and listed Miss Steinfeld in his stead. Although it was Brolin's character of Tom Chaney that tied the entire plot together, he actually had a total of only 10 minutes of screen time. I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future.I rather enjoyed Mr. Bridges interpretation of the role of Rooster Cogburn that John Wayne had made so famous. \"The Duke\" has some big boots to fill and \"The Dude\" did his best to fill them. Watching Bridges performance, I couldn't help but be reminded of Kris Kristofferson. All in all a great film with actually very little \"blood n guts\" gun fights. I would suggest to all who see this one also take the time to watch the original \"True Grit\" featuring John Wayne and see what a great job Bridges did with holding true to his character.",

I watched the trailer a number of times and after seeing the movie I can tell you they show entirely too much in the trailer. That being said, if you haven't seen the trailer, avoid it.Right off the bat the film gets into the story of Mattie's dad and quickly gives the audience a breakdown of who this girl is based off of her immediate interactions with people in the beginning of the film. The girl who is casted for Mattie did a flawless job. She was truly remarkable in her role.Throughout the movie the dialog is sharp, witty and cunning. Many times I found it hard to keep up with all of the back and forth diatribe. Many of the words/terms I didn't understand to be honest and I fancy myself to be decently educated. You can tell the Cohen's did their research for the time to match the speaking, clothing and decor of the old Western times.The chemistry between Bridges and \"Mattie\" is top notch and even better is the relationship between Bridges and Damon. My respect-o-meter for Damon keeps growing after every film I watch him in and he does not disappoint in this film at all. All of the side casting, who are mostly unknowns are great and more than memorable. The one spoiler I'll give is a simple casting one, Barry Pepper makes a great appearance in the film and until watching him in this role, I forgot how much I like him as an actor and wish he did more work.I loved Crazy Heart and would whole heartedly expect Bridges to be nominated again for this role. This guy has become so much better with age. He is equally impressive in this movie as he was in Crazy Heart. There are some similarities to be sure, but the roles are diverse enough where you won't have the feeling of \"Been there, done that.\" If I had one wish, not complaint, it would have been the score. I'm big on film scores and that is one element I felt lacking in the movie. There were some major opportunities to enhance some scenes with a proper score. Aside from that, I felt nothing but love and admiration for the movie and it'll make a nice edition to my limited Blu-Ray collection.In conclusion, if you're a Western fan, go see the movie. If you like the Cohen Bros.' previous works, go see the film. If you're a Bridges or Damon fan, go see the movie. If you want to know how it compares to the original, \"I can do nothing for ya son.\"",

Most of this was gleaned from the quite misleading trailer and various reviews on this site. Well I can't say it had any of those things. Like previous Coen films I found the story to be slow paced and dragging in parts, I felt there was no development with the central characters, no sense of where they had come from and why they were the way they were, this made me completely disinterested in them or what happened to them, by about halfway through I couldn't care less who lived or died.I feel like cinema is something that has evolved over time with non-linear storytelling almost common place these days. There's nothing wrong with a story having a traditional beginning, middle and end in that order, but it does need to work harder to hold your attention and this film just doesn't and feels outdated because of it.",

What made True Grit stand out was that it appeared to back authority rather than revolution, the rule of law rather than the romantic appeal of outlaws. Westerns haven't gone out of fashion (the likes of 3:10 to Yuma, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford are evidence to the contrary), but it's hard not to approach the film without wondering why the Coen brothers chose to make it.

However, having said that and having seen the new film, I was pleasantly surprised.The Coen Brothers' denials to the contrary, this is a pretty faithful remake of the 1969 classic, but that's o.k. It was an enjoyable story then, and it's still enjoyable now.The performances are uniformly good, with Hailee Steinfeld creating quite an impression, and Matt Damon definitely outshining the rather wooden performance of Glenn Campbell in the original. However, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin, although good in their roles, don't really make me forget Robert Duvall and Jeff Corey.Jeff Bridges is good as Rooster. Don't get me wrong. But he can't compare to John Wayne, especially in the final gunfight. (\"Fill your hand, you son-of-a-b****!\" It's the greatest delivery of a line in The Duke's career, IMO. With Bridges, it's just another line in an good performance.) Overall, a good movie, but all it did was make me want to go back and watch the original.",

The two condemned white men get to say their last words, but when the Indian tries to say something, the executioner yanks the hood over his head then walks over and pulls the lever. Very authentic mindset for a movie based in 1880.The part where they found the guy hanging 50 feet off of the ground, and the ensuing body-trading, was just plain weird.

            "content": "This is my first time I am watching a movie directed by the Coen Brothers and I must confess that I am impressed. In \"True Grit\", Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) was 14 years when her father was murdered by one of his helping hands named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie with a very strong mentality wants to do everything possible to get hold of the killer for revenge. Now, she is in a state where she can only rely on Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), a Federal Marshall whose status for shooting his prisoners makes him the right person for Mattie's intended cause. Later an agreement was reached to embark on an adventure to search for the killer, Tom. Meanwhile LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who happens to be a Texas ranger arrives on the trail of Chaney. LaBoeuf has been pursuing him for another crime concerning the murder of a Senator in Texas. He agrees to work with Cogburn, who is more familiar with the terrain where Chaney is hiding. Mattie did not like the idea because her intension was to make sure that Chaney is hanged for killing her father and not for the crime in Texas. Mattie was left behind even though Cogburn agreed to travel with her and instead left with LeBoeuf to track down Chaney. One point that was questionable to me was when Mattie was refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crossed the river ridding at the back of her horse. LaBoeuf showed his displeasure by whopping Mattie with a switch rod, Cogburn to my surprise waited for too long as if he was enjoying the action being taken before he finally stopped him. The transition on the pace of the film as a whole was based on one of the traditional transitional devices, after critically observing the film; I found that the editor used vertical line to move across the screen to wipe the previous images away. It also show that the slow cut method was often used and this type of cutting more often stimulates the feeling of a tranquil observer which to me is a way to attract a particular group of viewers. The pace was good and calm for viewers especially the application of sound to aid some sections of the transition. I also realized that at certain points the cutting speed changes because the rhythm needs to correspond with the pace of the action. I haven't seen the 1969 version \"True Grit\" but I think there is no need going to see that, this movie will be recommended to others and I hope they will all like it. Kudos to the directors (Coen Brothers), the editors and the producers for the great sound, lighting and picture angles.",

Mattie Ross is unbelievably bright and savvy (she cannot be 14 yrs old!) but still feels the same character as the old version.Matthew Damon disappears entirely into LaBoeuf. I would have preferred Barry Pepper as Tom Chaney because I could have hated him. For me, Josh Brolin seemed misplaced. The frequent full use of not instead if 'nt I found irritating.

            "content": "I recently watched this 2010 remake of True Grit which was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Normally this is not my type of movie to watch but I decided to go out of my zone and try it. The storyline and main idea of the movie is somewhat typical for a western, all about seeking revenge for a wrong, but what makes it different is that it is coming from 14year old Mattie Ross portrayed perfectly by Hailee Steinfeld. She wants to hire a U.S. Marshall, Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and a Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) to bring justice to Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) the man who killed her father over a couple of gold pieces. Mattie and Rooster have such a tumultuous relationship that it is hard to imagine them having anything other than a business relationship. She is constantly trying to keep him sober enough to keep him on track with finding Chaney and shows such control that we tend to forget that she is only 14. Thus the movie title comes in to play with Mattie, Rooster and LaBoeuf always facing some challenge to their own \"grit\" and to see if they have what it takes to continue on.This film reminds me a little of Unforgiven starring Clint Eastwood who is hired to track down a man who cut up a prostitute or whore as they were referred to back then. While there is different elements to the story in Unforgiven, the same hire someone to find the bad person and bring them to justice is still a huge part of it. They both have their showdowns with the bad guys.The cinematography is done well with so much attention to detail. I can still picture the smoke and sun-filled courtroom when we are first introduced to Rooster Cogburn. The lighting was done well too. The sun coming in through the windows of the courtroom was so blinding that you're sure it's hot outside. And the night shots were done so that the audience can still see what is going on without taking anything away from it being at night. The scenery for the west was outstanding in this film. From the mountains and wide open ranges to the river every shot taken made one feel as if they were right there in the old west.This is one of the better remakes of movies I have seen in quite some time. While no one could ever come close to replacing John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn, Jeff Bridges did an outstanding job. I was equally impressed by the performance of Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie. For a movie of this type that I usually don't go out of my way to watch these days, I am glad I took a chance and watched this one. It is definitely one to watch and now I am ready to go back and watch the original one too.",

I am a big fan of the Coens and I absolutely loved \"No country for old men\" but this remake lacks the humor of the original. Some hinted that it wasn't as entertaining as the original and I would have to agree. Honestly, the first time I watched it, I fell asleep. For me personally it is not that much of a stretch to fall asleep during movies, you can ask my friends, but I guess this one is a little long in the tooth at certain points. As for the cast, Jeff Bridges is a good actor but his portrayal of Rooster is too overdone and (pardon the pun) too gritty. He is not as animated as John Wayne and that is one of the missing elements. The girl(Haylee Stanfield) is very good but I still like Kim Darby better. Darby was much more spirited in the role IMHO. Matt Damon is good as LeBoufe, much better acting than Glen Campbell in the same role but still Glen did a fair job and was just there as a means of fodder for the Duke anyway. The guy that plays Lucky Ned Pepper was probably the best in the whole movie but in too short of a role. As for cinematography, it is a beautifully shot film. The Coens do excel in this area for sure.****possible spoiler**** The pace of the movie is better after the first 30 min is over as opposed to the original version which was a laugh riot especially the exchange between Mattie Ross and Stonehill played by Strother Martin in the orig. The guy who plays Stonehill in the 2010 version is a bit too dry and humorless.He is probably not a bad actor in other roles but this portrayal is a little too stiff. ****possible spoiler**** A minor point for those offended easily language wise, there is only one minuscule instance in the orig of cussing but in this one Rooster says one too many of a certain word compared to the original, however, it was not that profuse.****possible spoiler**** I have heard some complain about the ending but the Coens are generally by the book about such matters so the ending didn't personally bother me.",

As for the performances...well, here we go: Bridges done just fine although there's really nothing outstanding about him. He plays a drunk old cranky lawman, so picture that..OK, that's it....Matt Damon is odd in this. He's playing it serious one moment, then smirks and acts like he's in a comedy. He's very mis-cast here. Josh Brolin, well, he's OK for the few minutes he's on screen, but he speaks so oddly I didn't know what he was saying half the time, same as every guy in the film really. It was annoying.When it was over the girl did a good job, probably the best of the bunch but the ending was really lame, trying to go for depth and emotion and really it's a standard ending and it didn't leave me feeling much of anything. Certainly not worth all the nominations and awards, but given them probably because people think the Coen's can do no wrong or something. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. See Tombstone or The Proposition instead.Oh and as for people saying \"It's totally different from the original\"...No..even the dialog is the same in a lot of scenes.

This remake contributes some nice performances but adds nothing of consequence, except perhaps for an almost unpleasantly downbeat and unnecessary epilogue.

The setting was appropriate for the time in which the movie takes place. I thought the costumes and makeup were very well done. Each person looks like how you would picture someone to look during that time. The cast is top notch. I am a big fan of Jeff Bridges (Rooster Cogburn) and Matt Damon (LaBoeuf). Everyone acted their parts very well but Bridges is the star in this film. He does an amazing job portraying Rooster Cogburn. Hailee Steinfeld (Mattie Ross) is also one of the bright spots of the film. True Grit (2010) is about good vs. evil. It is a movie about justice prevailing. Mattie's father is killed by a man named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She goes into town to try and find someone that will help her avenge her fathers death and bring justice to Tom Chaney. Mattie hears of Rooster Cogburn and decides to enlist his help. She says that she heard he is a man of \"true grit' and hires him to help her find Tom Chaney. LeBoeuf is also looking for Tom Chaney so he joins them for the manhunt. The most compelling part of the movie is the relationship that develops between Rooster and Mattie. As they are searching for Tom Chaney they form a bond with one another. I enjoyed watching their relationship develop as the film progressed.One of the better aspects of True Grit (2010) is the dialog. Taking place in Arkansas the characters have the typical accent one would expect to hear from that state. The way that people spoke back then is different than most people speak now and that was evident in the movie. The women spoke very properly in the film much like one would have expected to hear in that time. Laboeuf is from Texas so his diction and manner of speaking are different than that of Rooster's. The film did a good job of recognizing that and it was evident each time they spoke to one another.I was impressed with the way they used camera angles during the film. There were quite a few scenes that made you feel like an observer. In the beginning when three men were being hanged, the camera was down in the crowd looking up at the men. That gave the sense of actually being there and watching it happen. When LaBoeuf was surrounded the camera was up high, giving the feel like you were there with Mattie and Rooster watching what was going to happen to LaBoeuf. Overall I thought True Grit (2010) was a fantastic movie. The story was very compelling and kept me watching and wanting to know what was going to happen. The classic good vs. evil western where justice prevails never seems to get old and True Grit (2010) is one of the better films in this genre.",

If not, I am bothered to be misled, because the dialogue indicates we as a race may really yet have such a capability.But it was the ending that disappointed me. It was just a big let-down.

For TRUE GRIT, the Coen Brothers have written a screenplay of such articulation and cadence that if it does not win an Oscar, then the award should be abolished. I chose not to see the John Wayne version of the film, which is against my custom, but I am very glad I went into the Jeff Bridges version fresh, not knowing the fate of the characters at the end. However, I have heretofore not mentioned the fools that populate movie theaters in 2010, as I did not want to put that illness into my reviews, but this time my viewing experience was so interrupted at the start by punk teens and their DAMN mobile phones, that it did effect me the entire film, though they left five minutes into the movie. Despite that extraordinary bane of modern society, I was still mesmerized by the dialogue and the performances. I will once again declare that if Hailee Steinfeld does not win the best actress Oscar, the award should be abolished. Whoever cast her in the role of heroine of TRUE GRIT deserves an Oscar as well. She was absolutely perfectly cast and delivered the complex Coens Brothers dialogue with skill and gravity so that it did not seem absurd that a 14-year old girl of the old west would speak in sentences just below tongue twister level. Matt Damon did a great job as well in his delivery, as did Jeff Bridges, although his dialogue was of a whole different sort, but no less witty. The adults in the theater laughed often at his quips, and I of course ha-ed. I sincerely wish those punk kids had not robbed me of maximum enjoyment of this film. The Coen Brothers are truly master filmmakers. They just command the screen like few other writer/directors can. They cut no corners. Every second of film time is maximum creativity and pure cinema. It would be my pleasure one day to shake their hands and offer my humble appreciation of their skill. TRUE GRIT reminds me once again how much I, personally, still yearn for the opportunity to be a Man. In the days TRUE GRIT was set in, you were either a Man or a damn fool, literally. And you were free to be a Man. I do not necessarily believe in a soul, but I feel inside of me my spirit thirsting to be a Man out on the land in an organic world that is real and tangible. So much of the 2010 world has no meaning, no physicality, and it all just serves to sissify men. Just the fact that at least half the men my age go around wearing flip-flops! Is there any greater sign of the sissification of society? My footwear of choice? Waterproof Goretex XCR trail running shoes, footwear suitable for any environment from sea level to 4,000 meters (I summited Mt. Fuji in such shoes). Like the gas station scene in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, TRUE GRIT had scenes of dialogue that were aural candy and so exceptionally interesting I strained my ears just so I could hear what comes next a picosecond sooner. Hailee as the young heroine Mattie Ross was a character of utmost class and high ethical standards with great sympathy and compassion, even for those who deserved little. If I were the parent or guardian of a teenage girl, I would use Mattie as an example of what a young person is capable, and to show what the power of having class, ethics and intelligence is because 2010 society is almost completely devoid of both. For example, Mattie speaks to two men during one scene, only one of them rises to talk to her about a serious matter. She gives a warm good-bye to the standing man, and in an articulate dart speaks to the other, \"Trash! Enjoy your seat.\" This may be a very small thing most viewers would not care about, but to me it was a detail and further display of what burns inside the character of Mattie, and what makes her memorable. If my movie experience was not sabotaged by those punks early on, I may be using the word \"masterpiece\" in this review. I still will long think about TRUE GRIT, and its characters. This is a classic modern western and deserves any praise it gets. P.S. \u2014 I requested a refund,but accepted free tickets since the registers were already closed.",

When you add in the talented newcomer Hailee Steinfeld playing Mattie Rose it is not only a good one but a bona fide hit. From the start this revenge themed western classic has a darker air about it than the original movie starring John Wayne filmed in 1969. With the movie starting with a narration by Mattie retelling her story, you feel the focus of the movie has shifted from a story about a drunkard US Marshal as in the 1969 version, to be truer to the novel. Do not mistake this focus on Mattie to take away from Jeff Bridges excellent portrayal of Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. With Mattie's willingness to sleep with the dead in the mortuary you can get the sense that she is sure of herself and will not be put off. Mattie's dealing with Colonel Stonehill (played venerable character actor Dakin Matthews) is something to behold, and the quintessential scene where she proves she is not a girl to be trifled with. After this early verbal jousting the tone is set for the rest of Mattie's conversations. At the onset of any conversation with little Miss Mattie you are drawn to the edge of your seat gleefully awaiting her victory of her thoroughly thrashing her opponent. She employs words like razors and her lawyer (J. Noble Daggett) like a cannon. Rooster Cogburn moves from indignant to Mattie to admiring her gumption. Her failure to yield from the very start of their quest to find her father killer and the many attempt that follow earns his respect. Not many 14 year old girls would ford a river on horseback to be spanked on the other side for the troubles that is where Mattie proves yet again she is not an ordinary young lady. Her interactions with Matt Damon's character Texas Ranger Laboeuf are as fun to watch as the thrashing she gave the Colonel. Laboeuf is a more believable character than from Glen Campbell's portrayal form the 1969 movie. Laboeuf's character is not the only one that stands out against the original. Josh Brolin playing Tom Chaney (the antagonist) and Berry Pepper as \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper (the gang leader) both stand out during every scene they are in. From start to finish there is no scene that you find yourself wishing along or waiting for action. The Coen brothers have not only remade the movie bringing it in-line with the novel but have brought the book to life. Taking the focus from the Marshal that won John Wayne an Oscar to refocusing it on the original heroine adds realism and a True Grit to the film.",

The acting from Matt Damon as Texas ranger LaBoeuf is not bad. Overall, this movie describes to us a different thing about western movie. The visual appearance of this movie is great. It has the setting that the places in that time setting would have.

            "review_title": "Hathaway's and Coen's versions",
            "content": "The story: Don't worry about the plot. We've seen it in the 1969 original, or read the book, or seen dozens of other westerns of the same ilk. The story is there. The movie, True Grit, is an interpretation of fine western literature. This is primarily a comparison of Hathaway's (1969) and the Coen's (2010) interpretations of a novel. To compare a 1969 interpretation with one from 2010 is a bit unfair. The difference in the two interpretations is more of some story telling changes and technical change than a brilliance of the Coen's vs. Hathaway. I saw Hathaway's version of True Grit twice. Once in 1969. I was not a John Wayne fan. I left the theater liking the movie \u2013 John Wayne and all. The Cast: I saw the 1969 True Grit again, about three hours after seeing the Coen's interpretation. Both films had some terrific and some mediocre actors \u2013 Glenn Campbell (LaBoeuf) could sing but not act. Hathaway's interpretation made up for Campbell with too brief encounters with Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper. In Coen's interpretation, Matt Damon has received rave reviews for his portrayal of LaBoeuf. I was underwhelmed. He does provide counter-point to Bridges' Cogburn. He was straight, law abiding and clean. I was put off by Brolin as Chaney (killer of Mattie's father). He was much too pretty for a member of a gang led by the likes of Lucky Ned Pepper. The characters of Cogburn (Bridges) and Mattie Ross (Hallie Steinfeld) nail their roles. Wayne and Darby are weak in comparison. Wayne delivers lines as Wayne, walks like Wayne, and dresses like Wayne \u2013 never dirty or in need of a pressing or a bath. This might reflect the time \u2013 in 1969 heroes were clean guys. Bridge's Cogburn not only looks like he slept in his cloths, you can practically smell him. Darby's Mattie was sentimental at times \u2013 a character trait all but lacking in Seinfeld's Mattie. Darby was 20 when she played the role; Steinfeld was 13. The Dialogue: Some of the lines from both interpretations are identical \u2013 I assume they are from the Portis text. A funeral director tells Mattie (who is looking at her father's corpse) \"You can kiss him - - if you like (she doesn't, thank Portis).\" Or, Cogburn's line \"Fill your hands you son-of-a-bitches.\" And, many more. The Coen's consistently use what sounds like a more formal language. Contractions in speech are used, but less apparent that in Hathaway. This may be the way Portis wrote the material, or the Coen's dialogue may be based on a more formal language of the time. It seems very appropriate. The Story (2): When Mattie takes her horse across the river to join the search, Cogburn turns and watches her. He has attempted to leave without her. At that point, Mattie has hired Cogburn because he has \"true grit.\" In Coen's version of this scene we see that Mattie, too, has true grit and that Cogburn recognizes it without saying so. In the 1969 version, John Wayne says, \"She's a lot like me.\" Was this because 1) In 1969 movies needed to say what they wanted audiences to know and today movies seem to believe that we can figure it out, or 2) the Coen's could structure the scene and Bridge's could act it to show his regard for Mattie, and Wayne could not act anything but Wayne and had to say it. Toward the end of the film, we see that Mattie's situation has set the stage for Cogburn to be as he once was. The guy who could hold the reins in his teeth, yell, \"Fill your hand you son-of-a-bitches.\" Charge four armed me and kill them all (well, at least three of them). In taking Mattie to the doctor, he shots her horse then carries her the rest of the way. Falls once. Says something to the effect that he's not as young as he once was. Then gets up and carries her the rest of the way. In the effort, he has learned what he once was, he still is. The endings of the two movies differ dramatically. In Hathaway's version Cogburn lives on for a sequel, in Coen's he dies. Ala Coen, Mattie is invited to and shows up at the Wild West show where Cogburn is participating. She's an adult 25 years later (she's 38) Cogburn is has 25 additional years of smoking and drinking. Mattie learns that Cogburn has died. We certainly don't want to see him as a washed up cowboy legend. We want to remember him charging the bad guys with the reins in his teeth, or carrying Mattie through the snow. He has to be dead. As for Jeff Bridges, where could have he gone from Crazy Heart? Did we want to see him in a suit as a Wall Street Banker? (No.) Do we want to see him in \"Grandfather Focker\"? (Hell, no!) Cogburn is his 2010 role, just as Cogburn was Wayne's role in 1969. The Directors: A single Coen film will never stand alone. It will always be part of a collective works. Let us accept True Grit for the western it is, the novel interpretation it is and it is terrific! Photography! I was absolutely chilled by the snow scenes in the Indian Territory and the scenes of Cogburn racing to the doctors. The land was sometimes beautiful, often foreboding. Unlike the 1969 Technicolor version, cinematographers have become able to shot in the dark. It certainly makes a huge difference. The sound tracks were also striking difference. Hathaway used the orchestral sound of Bernstein \u2013 sounding like Bonanza's theme. Coen's version used hymns like \"What a friend we have in Jesus\" and \"Leaning on the everlasting arms.\" They were much more like the music of the era.",

Wait, did you say \"from the directors of No Country for Old Men, The Big Lebowski, AND Fargo?\" It ALSO currently holds a 95% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes? This True Grit must be one amazing movie! 2 Hours Later.What a let down. Dare I say it, but True Grit was kind of...boring.For those of you who don't know, True Grit is a movie about a young girl who hires a U.S Marshal to track down the man who murdered her father. While it doesn't sound like a boring premise, it gets dull pretty fast when there are long stretches of the movie where the main characters are traveling by horse and pony. There's also too much talking, if I may be so crass.Sometimes Jeff Bridges' character has something funny to say, that is, when you can understand him. There are also some great bits of dialogue that come out of the young girls quick-witted mouth, like when she haggles stubbornly with a man with whom her father had previously made a deal with. But there's too much talking when I start zoning out of people's conversations and waiting for the next scene. And no, I'm not some brain dead 11 year old who only wants to watch things blow up; but that doesn't mean that I'm entertained by a movie when two thirds of it are either horse-traveling montages or excess dialogue that I don't feel is necessary.As most people have already said, Hailee Steinfeld (the young girl) delivers a strong performance - as do Bridges, Damon and Brolin. When Steinfeld's character is first introduced she comes off as a sharp yet stubborn little girl. At first I was charmed by her character, but then she outstayed her welcome and I started getting really annoyed with her fast-talking and overly clever dialogue. Is it bad that I actually sympathized with Damon's character when he started spanking and whipping her? Let me note that there are some very good, though few, action scenes scattered across this movie. In particular the last act is very entertaining. Unfortunately though, the movie ends with a very unsatisfying and hurried conclusion - which I won't spoil.I am very disappointed to be giving True Grit just three stars. All signs indicated that this may have been one of my favorite movies of 2010; but just like Black Swan, this movie was hugely overrated. It was praised so high when in reality it's just an average movie albeit a movie by the Coen brothers.Read all my reviews at www.jasonthecritic.com",

It is a mystery to me what happened after \"Fargo\" - as this was the last movie where it was possible for the viewer to at least care A LITTLE BIT about the characters. No doubt Jeff Bridges does a good acting job with his mumbling drunkard \"Rooster\" Cogburn, same for Hailee Steinfeld's dead-serious little smart-ass Mattie Ross - but really NOBODY CARES. None of the characters have any depth, and therefore, the viewer is left with shrugging and waiting for the end titles to roll. The action goes along without any real surprises, the directing is Hollywood standard, the cinematography is okay. And until the final 15 minutes, the viewer has the impression of watching a so-so Western: nothing special, nothing original. - And then, the Coens pull the worst out of their hats: an endless scene where you wish for either one of the characters (or both) or the horse to die immediately. It DRAGS along, with cheesy music, cheesy cinematography - and it's a pain to see this movie being ruined. Whereas the final sequence starts with the remarkable voice-over line: \"25 years is a long time.\" - And boy, 110 minutes can be a long time, too! - What is left is a stale taste in your mouth, even the impression of having wasted almost two hours of your life for a Western that requires new vocabulary - as \"overrated\" doesn't capture the disappointment in the slightest way. Go watch \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" instead, an underrated gem.",

            "content": "True Grit: An excellent American novel, by Charles Portis. I've seen every film version, and read the original book.Story: Mattie, a young woman, travels far from home to claim her father's remains, and hire a bounty hunter to bring her father's killer to justice. Mattie, in this movie, is characterized perfectly: She is independent, humorless, businesslike, brave to a fault, and very direct in manner and speech (criticizes others without hesitation), but impeccably honest. And, she expects the same from others.Rooster (Bridges), the man she winds up hiring to capture her father's killer, is shabby, careless and crude in habits and mannerisms. He often takes liberty with the truth, even under oath in court. But, his reputation as a killer of men impresses Mattie enough to override any personal distaste she has for him.What follows, turns into a legitimate adventure. When Rooster catches up with the killer of Mattie's father (Josh Brolin, as Tom Chaney), he is in the company of a gang of Desperadoes, including Barry Pepper (also wanted by the law). Rooster and his Texas Ranger partner are unfazed by being outnumbered and outgunned. To grizzled veteran Rooster, it's just another day at the races.Much excitement follows, in the grand surroundings of the American West. Close encounters in the woods ensue, with the upper hand changing sides several times. Mattie becomes a hostage. Now, Rooster's bounty hunt turns into a rescue mission as well. An excellent performance is also turned in by Barry Pepper. His countenance and mannerisms flesh him out as an intelligent, deadly adversary. Josh Brolin correctly depicts the character of Tom Chaney - a man who might have once been intelligent, but who has descended into alcoholism, murder and theft. He tries to speak eloquently, but his articulation is slow and almost painful to listen to....he is a ruined man. Many people, myself included, will question: why was this movie even made? After all, John Wayne really covered it well in the 1969 version (one of the best performances of his career). I would say that this movie, in some of the details, is more faithful to the original book - especially in the depiction of Mattie's character and ultimate fate. There is just a tinge less \"Hollywood\" in this version, compared to the Duke's. It's a tad more gritty and realistic, which I always seek in a Western movie. It is an excellent re-make, up to date, which if nothing else, will appeal to younger viewers. Those younger viewers may be more able to relate to this version of True Grit, simply because it was not filmed decades before they were even born....and, they get to see actors in this movie that are still alive and making movies today. That alone justifies the making of this movie.If this movie were not a remake - if this was an original screening of a written story; the first effort - I would have rated it a \"10\".",

I have not seen the original and therefore this review is based solely on this iteration.To begin, this film is beige beyond belief, dull. Boring. I found this movie to be slow moving, yet lacking any meaningfulness and/or depth to keep me as a viewer engaged. I wasn't expectant of a fast moving action flick, nor am I adverse to taking in and enjoying a slow burner, however this film fails at all points.The acting, pretty much all round, is as wooden as a saloon door, other reviews have rightly called that the delivery of dialogue does indeed feel like the actors are stood there with scripts in hand merely reciting their lines - devoid of emotion and delivery. As pointed out by others too, Bridges feels miscast in the role and his accent is incomprehensible - detracting from what little is happening on screen.There is little to save this film from a harsh criticism from myself. My default is to fall back on cinematic and scenery shots to revive a poor score, however this film is shot mostly at night eliminating such scenes. The wardrobe varies little for the main characters across the film too meaning there is little to appreciate about this picture.To sum up, if you haven't seen the original and wish to sit down and take this in, I'd recommend to save your effort and watch something else.

Not enough of Josh Brolin though :) Even if he was the bad guy.I loved this film up until the end that is. The Cohn Bros. completely changed the ending and I don't know why - it seemed so weak. Maybe that's the original story ending, but I didn't like it. Who wants to see a wrinkled up 40 year old Mattie? It just seemed like they ran out of time or something and quickly slapped something together to end the story and it was purposely done or else they would have just gone with the classic 1969 ending.But all in all it is well worth a watch and maybe even an Oscar nod.

She brought back memories of Natalie Portman in Leon: The Professional, except with a more prominent role. Steinfeld does a stunning job on screen. At only 14 years, she fills the boisterous snarky shoes extraordinarily. And her character is rounded out quite well with the more natural undertones of her character as the stories goes on. Cogburn is a great as the drunken headstrong fool. Sprinkled with silly antics and one liners, his character is less fleshed out, but provides a great deal of entertainment when interacting with Mattie and Laboeuf. LaBoeuf rounds out the trio well, with the logical and structured side, albeit a bit odd. The interplay between the characters is priceless.The film starts of strong. The introduction scenes are entertaining and memorable. The short caricature introductions each match the flavor of their characters exceptionally. The pacing is well done, with nice downtime scenes between. The film does a good job of rewarding careful viewers: little tidbits of foreshadowing that are followed through. Interspersed throughout the film are bits of comic relief between the trio, and it is well timed and fresh. Thankfully the film rewards logic over brash courage in the end. My only concern is the ending. It's a bit anticlimactic, which initially is a letdown. But there is a bit of appreciation for an unorthodox ending for an unorthodox story. It leaves you high and dry, which one may not always appreciate Following the clich\u00e9s of westerns, True Grit begins looking like standard fare. With a slow fade in scene, silhouettes, and warm tones, we're pleasantly surprised when the film strays from the beaten path character wise. Some scenes are very well shot, such as the ending frame. The only problems I had with the cinematography were the stereotypical traveling fades: a bit too much. Yeah, I presume they were trying to mock westerns, but the cuts were too fast and short.While the film attempts to build up the sympathy for Mattie, the emotional investment of the story is diluted by the unorthodox humor. It wouldn't suit this film to become too invested in the film, it's more akin to something you just sit back and watch. At the climax points of the film, I just didn't find myself caring all that much. But it was still highly entertaining and the ending was unique in a good way, once the initial dissatisfaction fades away.

It may be a western made now, but it could easily stand beside any number of westerns made over a half century ago.

Coupled with the rather magnificent score, the look and feel of the film may just be their most ambitious work yet. I have never been one to be a fan of westerns, but this film easily makes me have a greater appreciation for the genre.The script is fairly well done as well. Everything we have come to know the Coen Brothers for is here: plenty of light and dark humor, a script filled with a wealthy amount of exposition (almost too much), a rather tightly knit story revolving around an odd cast of characters (and even more bizarre supporting characters), and a surprising amount of graphic violence. You know you are in the hands of master filmmakers the moment the production company logos disappear, and easily forget this is a \"re imagining\".

She is especially impressive since she has several of her scenes with Academy award winning actors.In many of those scenes you almost forget about Bridges, Brolin or Damon. Yes, Hailee Steinfeld is that good!The movies is well paced. The movie sustains a high level of suspense. Because you bond very early on with Mattie, you care about her and want her to exact her revenge. I wish the best for Hailee Steinfeld and hope she chooses great roles because she already is a great actress. But then again I love old fashioned themes. Lord I remember when times were less complex. meeks lewis",

The use of camera angles were OK, could have been used in a way better manner. i would have done a lot of things differently, I would have added more drama, more emotion, things that would make you feel for the characters. The best scene in this film wads the ending scene where Ruben Cogburn saves Mattie Ross from a rattle snake bite. Overall the movie could have been way better.

And I do agree with Mr. Impossible when he correctly states Hollywood makes to few westerns anymore. And that is a shame. I also liked Kim Darby's performance better in the original True Grit. Again, Darby was made for the role of Mattie Ross. The scenery was also better in the original. I loved the location scenery in the original where the \"dugout\" was located. That is the same location used in the movie \"North to Alaska\", also starring the Duke. But I really did enjoy this movie and I do recommend it.

Why would anyone who has actually read the book say that this version is closer... it isn't... in word and definitely not in spirit.As for this movie... it is VERY good, worthy of viewing whether you have seen the original movie, read the book, or any combination. Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld do a much better job than Cambell and Kim Darby. Interstingly, to me anyway, is how Berry Pepper did what seems an obvious choice- instead of reworking Lucky Ned Pepper's 'character,' he stuck to Duvall's interpretation.If you read a review that says the 2010 copy is closer to the book than the 1969 copy-read the book, watch both movies, and you too will wonder why the reviewer says otherwise.",

            "review_title": "Review of True Grit",
            "content": "The movie \"True Grit,\" is a remake of the original 1967 version which starred John Wayne. This remake includes actors Jeff Bridges (as Marshall Rooster Cogburn), Hailee Steinfeld (as Mattie Ross), Matt Damon (as LaBoeuf), and Josh Brolin (as Tom Chaney) (\"True Grit,\" 2010). They are the main characters in the movie. This document will review the plot of the movie, the theme, techniques used which support the theme, and an overview of the overall feelings with which the viewer is left.The movie starts with a girl on a train. That girl is Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), whose father (Frank Ross) was unnecessarily murdered. The viewer is able to gather that Mattie loved her father very much and that he was someone who stood up for what was right in the face of adversity, even to death, which unfortunately was his demise. The movie is about Mattie avenging her father's death. From the beginning of the movie, the viewer can tell that Mattie shares the same qualities as her father, boldness and tenacity. At the very beginning of the movie, there is a Bible verse that appears on the screen, it is Proverbs 28:1: \"The wicked flee when none pursue . . .\" (Coen & Coen, 2010). This verse sets the tone for the movie, as the movie is about Mattie's pursuit of justice by seeking out Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father. She realizes that she needs to hire the best possible person for the job of avenging her father's death, as she cannot do it alone. As mentioned, Mattie is bold; which is very fitting to the remainder of the verse in Proverbs that is completed by the statement that \"but the righteous are as bold as a lion\" (Proverbs 28:1, 2011). She finds that Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) is someone with \"True Grit\" (2010) and tenacity and that is exactly the type of person she needed to ensure that justice could be served. She recruits Rooster and they set off on a journey together.The theme of \"justice\" is portrayed in a variety of ways throughout the movie. The first and most obvious, is the Bible verse in the beginning of the movie. This is indicative of the theme. Next, Mattie herself stands for justice. Not only does she strive for attaining justice for her father's death, but she stands for all things right. She is bold enough to go to the man who sold her father ponies and ask that he make things right, by giving her what was rightfully her father's. Additionally, later in the movie, she reminded Rooster that they promised the kid in the house who was killed, a decent burial; although they would not be able to fulfill that promise.Often in order to achieve justice, one must have tenacity and boldness. This type of boldness and tenacity is seen in Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) and Rooster (Jeff Bridges). This type of tenacity was also represented in the movie \"Friday Night Lights\" as the football team continues to get \"pummeled\" and hangs in there and continues to fight (\"Friday night lights,\" 2012). Mattie exhibited this type of tenacity throughout the movie. Despite naysayers, having to sleep among corpses, etc\u0085 she continued with her pursuit for justice. She was left by Rooster (Jeff Bridges) and LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) and she used her pony to cross a raging river to catch-up. Her tenacity is also demonstrated when the viewer sees the implication that all these years, she's gone on living despite the loss of her arm. Rooster also demonstrated this tenacity in his willingness to take on a fight with the odds of five to one (him being the one), and when he saves Mattie from the snake bite and goes for miles on the horse until the horse collapse then carries her for miles in his arms.Next, various techniques used within the movie tie back to the theme. Main techniques that were used to show tenacity and the means to justice were camera shots, and transitions. The Camera shots used showed how evil the wicked could be, for example: the scene when Mattie faces Chaney, it shows that Chaney really is evil when it zooms in closer and we can see that he is going to take Mattie. In addition, the camera angle when he takes a knife to Mattie shows how evil he is. This shows us just how evil is, and demonstrates why it cannot be allowed to prevail. In addition, the camera shots show that Mattie is not really a killer, when she pulls a gun on Chaney, but rather, she is prepared to do what she needs to do to ensure that justice is served. Next, the transitions between the scenes are used to show tenacity and the gall needed to ensure that justice was served. The transitions indicate the passage of time, the length of time that the journey took. The transitions made the journey seem very long, especially after Mattie had been hurt, when Rooster was carrying her in his arms. At that point, they had taken revenge on Chaney; however, Mattie was injured as a result, and in order to ensure that she (the righteous) was not killed by her pursuit for justice, we see that Rooster carries her in his arms to safety.The movie was very well done. The theme of justice and the tenacity required to achieve it, is very well portrayed. In closing, the main take-away from this movie was essentially, when the righteous do nothing, the wicked prevail. Though it is often easier and to cower in the face of adversity, look the other way (do nothing), or remain the victim, this movie shows us that even though justice may come at a price to the pursuer, there is great satisfaction that accompanies the attainment of justice and comfort in knowing that justice has been served.",

Any man with the experience he had in the country at that time wouldn't have ridden a horse to death, especially if another was available to take along as a relief.

Such critics should revisit the 1969 original. In many instances both films are word for word the same. The Cohen Brothers' take on 'True Grit' lacks the narrative pace and drive of the original and,generally, has poorer performances. Bridges looks as if he must have spent hours watching John Wayne's Oscar winning role and has not got anywhere near it. Quite apart from being rather unconvincing in the role, he is sometimes incoherent and makes one wish for sub-titles. ( A feature of many US movies today is that actors have poor articulation and recording techniques are also poor - there were never these problems with Ronald Colman, C Aubrey-Smith, David Niven, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Stewart Granger or James Mason).While the film's ending may be true to the novel, it is less satisfactory than the 1969 ending. It doesn't always follow that adherence to an original source makes for a better film: read 'Double Indemnity' if you do not believe me; the book's ending is silly.",

I feel slighted cheated by the Coen Brothers film, it was good but could have been far better. It should have been made longer and contained more detail - the scene where the two outlaws are captured in the hut is oddly succinct and superficial, obviously foreshortened for whatever reason is just one example so, for me, the John Wayne version remains superior.I suggest that anyone who hasn't read the book buy a copy, it's a terrific read.",

There is suspense, there is a little bit of gore, and even a moment that will make you jump out of your seat. How many other Westerns can you say that about? Superb acting with top notch direction!

I thought the acting was flawless, especially from the two leads, the setting and cinematography was breathtaking and the dialogue could be quick, witty and very moving. I could not stop looking at Hailee Steinfeld. What great casting! She had the perfect look and attitude for this role. It stirs such deep emotions in me and while I was watching it, I was reminded of watching Badlands for the first time. Of watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time. The themes are universal, the narrative very simple but I think it's a rare thing and will hopefully become a modern classic.

I don't know it actually was possible to mess up such a great concept and story, but the Coen brothers certainly did. Not only did they rush in a lot of action scenes without any connection to the story but they let something that could've been such a great relationship and story between the young Mattie Ross and the marshal Rooster Cogburn go completely missing. Hailee Steinfeld as the brave but innocent girl Mattie made me happy and I really enjoyed her character, therefore I found it extremely stupid when the Coens decided to take the innocent away from her by making her shoot the film's bad guy in such a rushed, confusing and very unsatisfying way.The scene where Rooster is trying to save her life after she'd been bit by a snake, which I would call the climax of the film, was also extremely rushed and with no satisfying feeling to the audience what so ever. I feel like they've rushed all the scenes that actually MAKES the story in the place of stupid happy violent shooting scenes, a random guy hanging in a tree, too much whiskey and a poor development of the characters.It left me with a sad feeling that they managed to spoil what could've been a thrilling, heartbreaking and epic story. The only reason I'm not giving this film the bottom rating is because of the lovely Hailee Steinfeld and the wonderful Jeff Bridges who both acted excellent and deserved more developed characters.",

Secondly, the young girl in the film reminded me far too much of Anne of Green Gables, with her braids and staged voice, which was simply too bizarre.

She has no trouble keeping up with the men in the movie, and does not shy away of what she came to conquer. The men didn't think that she would help out, but they end up working together as a team to take charge of the problems they face! This movie has a lot of different emotions tied in. You will find yourself on a roller coaster through the lives of others implying that women can conquer just as much as men!

I still enjoy the 1969 True Grit, feeling most of the performances there are also very good (well, Glenn Campbell leaves a bit to be desired). I attribute my enjoyment to the original novel True Grit by Charles Portis, one of America's great writers.Both movies, not only 2010, used Portis' dialogue extensively. Both Matties speak as Portis had her speak during the 1878 period. She is one of the most unusual book heroines ever written, and Hallie Steinfield is better than Kim Darby. The cast and cinematography are great, and the plot stayed fairly true to the book. Matt Damon was excellent in the part of La Boeuf, and the character parts true to the novel.I recommend this movie as a very good addition and timely upgrade for today's audiences to the '69 film, but I still have the '69 DVD which I treasure.",

I can only report my feelings for the movie. I was extremely excited to hear that True Grit was being made by the Coen's with Jeff Bridges in the role of Rooster Cogburn. The addition of Josh Brolin and Matt Damon was icing on the cake. But let's face it, the girl almost stole the show. I say almost because she was almost as good as Bridges. This is a good thing by the way, not a criticism. OK the good first. The writing and directing are always fantastic in Coen Brothers movie. The cinematography was spectacular and far out-did the original movie. The acting was excellent (possible Oscar nominations?) and I think Bridges added a depth to the Cogburn character that John Wayne could only dream about. I say that as a John Wayne fan, but let's face it, he didn't have a lot of range. The Cogburn Character was somewhat different in as much as he talked and talked and talked. Most of it was funny though. Steinfeld was a surprise and I felt she also was a step up from the Kim Darby version. Damon's version of Laboeuf, was way different than the Glen Cambell version. There was more of a tenderfoot quality to the character, yet he was supposed to be a tough Texas Ranger. There was a lot more humor in this one than the original and the classic Coen dialog was pleasing. The not so good.I think this movie suffers a little bit because it is a remake. While it wins almost all comparisons to the original, it is still compared to the original. If this movie was alone in the world, it would have been seen as groundbreaking. But it is not the ORIGINAL. To do a remake I think you need to distance it so far from the original that you almost can't make the comparisons. This movie followed the ORIGINAL too closely. I kept hearing that this follows the book, not the original. I din't read the book, but I saw the original and this didn't seem to be that different. Yes the characters were deeper and darker, but still not that much different. While the dialog was a lot different, the plot and even the scenes seemed to be almost identical to the original. Too close perhaps. I was just expecting something way different and it wasn't that different. Probably it is that I was just expecting something else. The Brolin and Pepper (Barry Pepper, who played Ned Pepper) characters were not in this movie for very long. The last part of the movie was like it was on fast forward compared to the original. I would have enjoyed seeing more of these characters, especially Ned Pepper who seemed to be a truly despicable person. Loved the teeth...The movie seemed to stall at some points. I think the dialog was intended to fill these up, but it seemed to me that the scenes were slowed down specifically for the dialog.I know that much of my criticism for this movie is only because I was expecting something else and that is my fault, not the movie makers fault. But even with my criticism I give this movie 8 out of 10 because it is a very good movie. I just don't think I can say it is great. I should go down as one this years best movies though and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes a really well made western.",

A Texas ranger (Matt Damon) also wants to get Chaney as of a crime he committed in Texas.Onto the review. Oh I'm not going to ramble I loved this film. I've never really seen any westerns before and this introduction to the genre was fantastic. The cinematography is gorgeous, rolling plains and the wild west \u2013 it's all stunning. Roger Deakins was totally snubbed at the Oscars lazy year. The direction is spot on and they're interpretation of the book is great, granted it is a rather straight forward plot they execute it brilliantly.Hailee Steinfeld, oh well you're just magnificent aren't you? You fall in love with her when she begins to barter with a man about horses, she is the heart and soul of the film. I don't think there's a scene where she isn't present, obviously apart from when her character is older. For me she was the standout of this film, if I had it my way I'd give her all the awards. Jeff Bridges is good as the marshall and he deserved his Oscar nod, but half the time I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying?! I was unable to figure out his ramblings for parts of the film. The supporting cast is equally good, Matt Damon was great along with Josh Brolin.

SoI decided to give it a shot, and man was I surprised. Yes, the movie has a dark undertone; yes, the movie is pure western; yes, the movie is depicts realism and very realistic characters; but, for almost two hours I had forgotten I was actually watching a western. This movie depicts a journey not just of revenge, but also what self-respect and retribution means for a man (no matter what the age); it not only focuses on darker sides, but also expresses a glint of light in every character, no matter how bad ass. This movie is an ultimate classic, and should be watched by all ages, of course children will definitely want some guidance, and people like me (belonging to Asian Region) may also require use of subtitles because of Jeff Bridges' awesome western accent (Hats off, and hands down to this guy for stealing the show), but it still worth every penny you spent on it and every moment you had with it.And even if this does not persuade you, then understand this, I have never written a review for a movie, but this time I just couldn't stop myself.

Jeff Bridges is his own version of Rooster Cogburn and while their are similarities he does not attempt to be John Wayne. Hailee Steinfeld brings Mattie Ross to life. Pluses of this film from the original are the technical improvements in camera, lighting, and sound effects. Certain scenes are sure to make you jump. Additional aspects of the film that should be appreciated are the scenery and the costumes utilized. From the background scenery, to the dusty streets, to the lighting from the camp fires, will help an audience feel as if they have gone back in time. The costumes and clothing are well done and fit the era well. It is apparent that much research was done to make the time period as realistic as possible.Well done and my recommendation to other fans of the original movie, go into this with an open mind, avoid comparison to the original, and enjoy a good western!

The character of Mattie Ross is not well written and we never get to understand her nor the reason for her 'grit'. (Can't blame the actor for successfully failing at creating a good impression)John Wayne playing Rooster stands out definitely as compared to Bridges.Even the handling of the guns is not \"west-like\" as we have been led to believe by myriad westerns in the past.Lucky Ned was played very well, but Chaney just disappointed to the core. (But again, the movie seems rushed-in and the character was not well written so can't really blame the actors there)Only the scenery got the feel of Old West, not the accent (and even the dialogue was pretty straight forward as compared to other westerns we have been led to believe..)The only good thing about this version is the End.. It is much better than the old movie's end.",

            "content": "True Grit is not just another western that deals with gunfights and a damsel in distress, this movie goes much deeper than that. It takes the viewer on a ride with a 14 year old girl seeking revenge for her father's murder, a Texas Ranger that is pursuing the same man for a different reason, and a colorful U.S. Deputy Marshal that helps the young girl. Mattie Ross is the 14 year old girl that wants revenge for her father's murder. She was played by the actress Hailee Stienfield who does an amazing job in drawing the viewer into feeling like they are right there on the journey. The Texas Ranger La Boeuf is depicted not so well by Matt Damon who in my opinion could have been portrayed better; I feel that he tried a little too hard to act like he was in a western instead of just acting. The murder they are pursuing, Tom Chaney, is played by Josh Brolin who I feel did a really good job in portraying him in the way that he was a criminal but wasn't really the brains of the operation. The Marshal Rooster Cogburn was played by the actor Jeff Bridges who in my opinion did an amazing job in portraying the many faces of Rooster to their fullest.This film was given a rating of PG-13 which I feel was a good rating for this movie for the fact that it isn't just a lot of fighting and swearing but it did have some in it. The visual appeal of this movie is great it has the setting that the places in that time setting would have. You feel like you are actually watching something that could be from that time era instead of a modern movie. All together I believe that this is a superb film not just for the western genre but an all-around great movie.",

            "content": "True Grit comes from a Western novel written by Charles Portis and has been made into two different movies. The first one that comes out was released in 1969 starring John Wayne as Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. The second one that comes out was released in 2010 starring Jeff Bridges as Cogburn. From my perspective, the 2010 version can probably never be passed.The Coen Brothers created Oscar-winning pictures such as No Country for Old Men and Fargo. However, they turn into the Western side of film-making and creates one of the greatest modern Western films of all time! True Grit (2010) is directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. The film involves Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) swears to take revenge on Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) for killing his father. She gets help from the toughest U.S. Marshal around named Rooster Cogburn and a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). She creates a sudden relationship with the two lawmen, but they go on a searching trip that can take them anywhere.True Grit (2010) is an amazing Western film with many great performances in acting, direction, and score. Jeff Bridges shows his great determination as Cogburn that also includes his pretty hilarious voice. Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld also provided great performances throughout. However, I noticed that the violence was a little bit over-the-top and shown in some sequences. With the PG-13 rating, it can go too far. Even with the rating, this movie is absolutely fantastic considering the Western genre. While I was watching True Grit (2010), I saw great messages including the act to stick right by someone through terrible events. The story was absolutely fantastic!True Grit has always been a great Western story throughout many movie adaptations. However, I don't think any other version can overtake this one. Including certain understandable messages, I loved the Coen Brothers' adaptation of True Grit! I give credit to the brothers for their absolutely amazing direction throughout the Western film. Also, I give credit to Bridges and the rest of the cast for their performances. This Western film was absolutely amazing! I give True Grit a 10/10 for its outstanding direction, soundtrack, and acting. I would definitely give this movie a recommend!True Grit was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (Bridges), Best Supporting Actress (Steinfeld), Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.",

Now making the remake shorter in and of itself is not necessarily bad, but the parts they did put large and important holes in the story and character development. The acting is generally terrible, particularly Bridges and Damon who overact so much its makes their characters seem comical and nearly incomprehensible. Honestly I couldn't understand half of what Bridges said because he mumbled so much, and Damon's character is barely in the movie and is never developed like in the original. Only Steinfeld did a comparable job, which was fairly true to the original, but with her touch to the character. Brolin is completely wasted in this film as he literally had only 5 minutes of screen time. The Coen brothers would have been well advised to have completely reworked the story so as to avoid the comparison's (which are fair considering they tried to keep it as close as possible), and put their own touch on the story.",

            "content": "What an excellent film about a teenage girl who is willing to stop at nothing to avenge the murder of her father. After hiring Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who is a U.S marshal that is full of \"true grit,\" the young Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) finds herself on a journey of lifetime while trying to track down and capture Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who killed her father. On their quest to bring Chaney to justice, a Texas Ranger by the name of LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who has been tracking Chaney for months, joins their party.Rooster, Mattie, and LaBoeuf are a dynamic trio that performs some of the best acting I've seen in a Western movie in a long time. The characters of Rooster and Mattie are stupendous. Each character has a unique personality that seems to hilariously rub each other the wrong way throughout the entire film; however, by the end of the movie a great deal of respect is shared between all of them. This special bond is formed as a result of the trials and tribulations incurred on their hunt for Chaney.A common theme of the movie is \"an eye for an eye,\" which Mattie certainly makes clear in her relentlessness to keep Rooster and LaBoeuf on his trail. This is a typical theme found in many Western movies. The ways of the Wild West forced individuals to deal with their problems on their own. However, this film has many more themes entwined within in it. True Grit delves deep into a theme dealing with basic human compassion. Rooster Cogburn is as rugged and as rough as they come on the exterior, but even he proves to be affectionate and ultimately to have a heart of gold.From the perspective of cinematography, the shots of the countryside were absolutely beautiful. The camera pans and the extreme long shots of the various types of landscape bring the Old West to life. The lighting in each scene is suburb. Several scenes use lighting to draw attention to a specific character; for example, the scene of Rooster in the courthouse with sunlight shining on him from the window at his back. Perhaps such shots are foreshadowing Rooster's benevolence? Nonetheless, this is a must see film; especially, for those of you who enjoy a good Western movie.",

            "content": "Spoiler Aler..... True Grit is a memorable Western about a young girl who hires a tough US Marshall to hunt down her father's killer who also stole his horses. She decided to join the hunt despite the Marshall's orders for her to stay behind. The hunt is joined by a Texas sheriff who also wants the killer for other reasons and crimes he committed. The three then head to Indian lands to find the killer, but they face harsh realities on their journey. The main Character is Mattie Ross played by (Hailee Steinfeld) who is the protagonist in the film. She is filled with the need to avenge her father's murder committed by the outlaw Tom Chaney played by (Josh Brolin). She enlists the help of a US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) who is a ruthless individual with deep mental scars and a itchy trigger finger. At first Marshall Cogburn is hesitant, but gives in after she persists in having him work for her. The two are also joined by LaBoeuf (Matt Damona) a Ranger from Texas who is intent on bringing in the fugitive.The main themes deal with revenge and redemption. Other sub themes are mentorship and determination. The theme of revenge is evident because Mattie is intent on killing her father's murderer without regard for her own life. The theme of redemption surrounds around Marshall Cogburn's character that seems to be in search of a purpose in life after killing so many people throughout his lifetime. The theme of mentorship is visible because the relationship between Mattie and Marshall Cogburn is that of a mentor and student as well as father figure. That is because Mattie doesn't really have good memories of her own father especially after he left her with the burden of avenging his life. There is also a love story between LaBoeuf and Mattie that never blooms. Mattie is wise for her age and is frustrated because people won't take her seriously. She manages to find some respect among equals who happened to be the ones aiding her in finding her father's killer.Character development is what makes the theme relevant. The character of Mattie Ross is a complex and at times stubborn and we learn that she is amazingly smart for her age which occasionally gets her into trouble with both Rooster and LaBoeuf. She is determined to catch her father's killer, but never considers turning him to the authorities. She is intent on exercising her eye for eye philosophical rights. On the other hand, the LaBoeuf character is set on bring Tom Chaney to Texas to face consequences. Just like another western called, \"3:10 To Yuma\" where the main character is intent on bringing a fugitive to justice and face trial. Mattie and LaBoeuf are both committed to their ideals, but they just happen to be on two opposite sides of the law. They are similar in many other ways because they are articulate, smart, and persistent. Because of their differences, they happen to be attracted to each other. The character of Rooster Cogburn is a drunk with many bad memories of his previous life and doesn't enjoy being a US Marshall very much. He views this hunt for Tom Chaney as his last chance for redemption and doing something worth doing. He and LaBoeuf have a strange somewhat uptight relationship and argue about everything. He takes to passively mentoring Mattie and is willing to sacrifice his life for her dangerous mission. Their undertaking is justified as the film progresses and each character states motives for embarking on such a operation. The dialogue in the film helps the believability of the characters and makes the theme come alive.The film uses incredible cinematic techniques such as lighting, costumes, and sound effects. The film also uses narration to speed the continuity and stays at a steady pace throughout. The lighting in the film is appropriate and adds an element of controlled chaos to the film. For example, some shots are done with full lighting takes advantage of outdoor lighting and sunlight while other shots are done with three dimensional shadows. The film is superbly edited and coherence is extremely calculated. The film is directed by the Cohen brothers Ethan and Joel who also directed a similar film called \"No Country for Old Men\" which explores the world of revenge and a US Marshall's search for a killer. True Grit is a film that speaks to the heart of revenge, redemption, and willingness to continue when odds are stacked against an individual. The film employs unbelievable cinematic techniques and is driven by powerful dialogue and spectacular acting by Haille Steinfeld, Jeff Bridges, and Matt Damon. Although it is a remake, this film is sure to become a new classic.",

Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a young, but very wise, strong and intelligent girl who has left her home to find the man who murdered her father. She employs the assistance of U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). Although Cogburn is hesitant at first, eventually he agrees to assist Mattie in capturing her father's murderer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Joined by LaBouef (Matt Damon), a Texas Ranger also in search of Tom Chaney, the 3 set off into the wilderness on a wildly entertaining man hunt. The Coen brothers did an amazing job in both the direction and editing of the film. Scenes were setup perfectly, and the transitions between scenes were clean and non-obtrusive. Particularly enjoyable were the action sequences. The camera follows the characters and switches back and forth between the people shooting and the people being fired upon. This sort of camera work goes a long way toward making the viewer feel like they are part of the action and the viewer also isn't stuck staring at a boring and static objective camera point of view. The lighting of the film works for the setting and feels very natural. The glow of campfires, the blazing sun, and the soft flickering light of candles all seem very realistic. The lighting is yet another example of how this film draws its viewers into the setting.The story of the film itself moves along at a quick speed, but not so quick as to confuse the viewer. The drunken and often humorous comments made by Marshall Cogburn often give the film a lighter and less serious vibe. In other words, the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, and that is what makes this film so entertaining. Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the film is the characterization and story development. Although Marshall Cogburn, Mattie Ross, and LaBouef have different pasts and different personalities they are all searching for the same man for one reason or another. The characters types of the lead actors play very well off of each other even though each character's motivation seems to clash with the others. The story develops in such a way that the viewer develops a solid emotional attachment to the characters even though the film is relatively short. We learn a lot about each of the characters and in the end, we want to see them succeed in their task.Overall, True Grit is a fantastic western style film that shows a true passion for film making. The relatable story, the memorable characters, the realistic scenery, and the action packed gun fights make True Grit an extraordinary remake that is truly better than the original.",

            "content": "A young girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfelf) wants to go on a wild goose chase for her father's killer who she firmly believes is Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie uses her stern tone and unwillingness to give up to get her way with whomever she comes across in order to get help to chase down on obtain Tom Chaney. Mattie is able to save up some money and gather information on the Marshal with the most \"grit\". This marshal is Rueben Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). Mattie visits Cogburn and hires him to help her fine Chaney, but with the stipulation that she must be able to come along. Before going out on this adventure Mattie is approached by Texas Ranger LaBouef (Matt Damon) who also has interest in finding Tom Chaney. Mattie has no interest in the Ranger LaBouef's assistance because Mattie wants Chaney all to herself to being into justice in her hometown. Mattie has no intentions of letting Chaney go to Texas to be returned to justice.Texas Ranger LaBouef and Marshal Cogburn head out to find Chaney without Mattie. Mattie catches up to the Ranger and the Marshal advising that she will be going along with them regardless of what the two men say about her not coming along. LaBouef is appalled about a young girl traveling along with the two men and being exposed to the roughness of what the chase for Chaney could bring. Cogburn knows that it is not a good idea either, but he lets Mattie come along. Cogburn seems to have an attitude knowing that the young girl cannot keep up with the two men, but he will let that be proved to Mattie because she's too stubborn and determined to find out any other way.The theme of this movie is focused on the plot. The plot being that Tom Chaney is a killer that needs brought to justice and Mattie, Ranger LaBouef and Marshal Cogburn are determined to make that happen. I am not much into Western movies and most likely would not have watched this movie if it had not been a selected movie for my movie analysis class. It actually turned out to be a really good movie and contained many more areas of focus than that of finding Tom Chaney. This movie was about proving a young girls determination to find the person that killed her father and proving to everyone that she could do what a grown man could do. This movie was also about Cogburn caring about someone more than himself. Cogburn was a stubborn, self-centered, and boastful drunk. He did not have time for anyone but himself, his alcohol and the target of who he was to kill. In this movie Cogburn grew to care about Mattie and was willing to protect her and help her at any cost. This movie reminds me of The Land Before Time movies. (I just spent the weekend watching several sequels of these movies with my niece). The plot of The Land Before Time movies is that the baby dinosaurs are determined to be grown up and to fight nature and other dinosaurs just like the grown-ups. Mattie's determination to find Tom Chaney and hunt for him like a grown-up reminds me of the baby dinosaurs and their determination to show that they can be grown up too. In the movie there are a lot of shots that the camera angle is high above where the action is happening. The area in which the camera is at is usually with Cogburn, Mattie and LaBouef looking down on the Tom Chaney and his posy. This happens several times in the movie and it gives an impression that Cogburn, Mattie and LaBouef are people of a higher value than that of Chaney and the men that ride, support and kill with him. The film angle giving this impression goes along with the attitudes of the Marshal and Ranger as they are the law, they bring in justice and no one can be above the law. Also the camera angles being high above Chaney and his posy also provide support to the self-assured attitudes of Mattie and Cogburn. Mattie and Cogburn were a lot alike with their stubbornness and boastful attitudes.The movie ended with Mattie, Cogburn and LaBouef getting what they wanted most, Chaney getting what they felt like he deserved. The movie jumped about twenty five years ahead at this time Mattie was looking to meet up with Cogburn again, but missed him by just a few days as he passed away from a health issue. Mattie never saw or heard from Ranger LaBouef again. Mattie stated at the end that she never married as she did not have time for bothering with a man, though she did not say why. My guess is that Mattie was too stubborn for a man and she found it less bothersome to handle life how she wanted rather than worry about her and someone else. Showing Mattie at this age and Mattie stating why she did not marry supported my earlier assumption that Mattie and Marshal Cogburn were very much alike than not with their stubborn and boastful ways.",

It's shot beautifully with viewers being given a chance to take in the expansive scenery as they follow Mattie Ross and Rooster Cogburn deep into the Indian Territory to track down the murderer Tom Chaney. I love that the run-time is just short of two hours long and that's all it needs! It's a straightforward film plot-wise(but it's not at the same time when you think of how deeply drawn these few characters are!), doesn't involve that many main characters, is short and sweet in some ways and yet still feels epic! You really get into it and feel like you've gone on this big adventure with these few characters that you've gotten to know. And when the characters don't speak, it's mainly to allow the actual backdrop and vast setting of the movie (which is like another character in itself thanks to the very talented cinematographer Roger Deakins, who made almost every frame of this film beautiful!) to speak to the audience, whether it's accompanied by music in some places or none in others. Having grown up watching westerns as a kid (thanks to my Dad's influence), this genre of film always has appealed to me in it's many different forms. I've always liked how a lot of the films could share similar(sometimes identical) plots, settings, characters and still feel different to the viewer. One can compare the early John Wayne westerns and even westerns like 'The Magnificent Seven'. A lot of these were classics that for the most part shared a lively and cheerful tone to them, even while containing gun violence and what would normally be considered dark themes. Compare these to when director Sergio Leone came out of nowhere with 'The Dollars Trilogy'! He took the genre by storm! The amazing music of Ennio Morricone, the hard-ass Eastwood and the much more gritty violence all made people change the way they thought about what a Western was! They had their playful moments for sure in their own way, but these were no longer the good old' jolly westerns the whole family would watch on a Sunday! They brought such an enormous contrast to the genre and laid down the foundations for so many more westerns that would even go an extra mile in darker tones! Back to True Grit! This remake I think successfully balanced the optimistic tone and sense of adventure from the original film (without being hokey! I know. I'm sorry John Wayne! It was good for it's time.), while also being gritty, more realistic and actually leaving a real emotional impact on viewing. And like a lot of other Coen Bros films, it's main heroine is unique and really surprises audiences. It may not be an all-out Coen Brother's film, but it has enough of them in it to be noticed and have a new twist while also being one of their more accessible films for wider audiences.",

            "content": "True Grit (2010)The Cohen brothers take on True Grit was simply great. They took a movie and novel and did not do the traditional \"remaking\" they turned it into something better in my opinion. The story of True Grit is about a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross, played by the very talented actress Hailee Steinfield, that takes matters into her own hands to try and avenge her fathers death by going after his killer Tom Chaney played by Josh Brolin. She enlists the help of Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges and is accompanied on the trip by another traveler Texas Ranger LaBoefu played by Matt Damon. The theme of the movie to me is Mattie must learn to accept that in the world, there are crooks and outlaws and we just have to accept that we are not always going to have everything our way.The actors and actresses in this movie did and outstanding job. Jeff Bridges take on Rooster really made it his own character. After seeing John Wayne play this part, I thought it would be very hard to top it. I believe Jeff thought this too and instead of trying to top it or make it better he took the character and made him his own. Actress Hailee Steinfield also made her presences known on this film. For a fourteen-year-old girl in this movie she really steals almost every scene she is in. Her stubbornness and perseverance are impeccable and you cannot help but watch the film in awe as she actors with actors who have been doing this far longer then she has even been alive. The Cohen brothers use several techniques in the film to help tie in their themes such as lighting, and angles. One scene they use great lighting in is the cabin scene where Rooster and Mattie stumble upon the true outlaws waiting for Tom Chaney and his gang to arrive. This was an intense scene and they use the lighting to give it that feel in those scenes. In addition, angles were important to the film to help give those scenes of them traveling or having the shoot out with Tom Chaney and his gang a more dramatic feel. This was a great film and I would recommend it to anyone because of how versatile it really is.",

The screenplay adaptations from the original were poor, with random characters such as a man in a bear suit in the wilderness who has no relation to the story. the ending was poor also, showing two random cowboys who give news of Roosters death and an older spinster type Maddie who turned out to be a crotchety witch of an old woman, nothing near true grit. Matt Damon was too old to be the Texas Ranger, a weak dichotomy between Rooster and LeBouef. Entertaining, but a weak remake of an original.",

My hat's off to the Coen Bros. for their details and portrayal of the old west the way I think it really was. Once Mattie opens her father's trappings to a beautifully blued 2nd model Colt Dragoon and his Masonic Square and Compass I was totally sucked-in. When Mattie confronts her father's murderer she unleashes the wrath of that Dragoon only to land on her backside from the recoil. Now her Dragoon is wet and prone to misfire. Beautifully portrayed here but not so in the original 1969 version. The shoot out on the open flats below has to be exactly right; true grit without fears. When Matt Damon off loads the 45-70 Sharps you see the dirt fly on the other side of it's intended target. That's the kind of details only a shooter would know.

            "content": "The film is obviously brilliant in many ways, but I have no interest in listing them here because everyone who has already read the reviews has come across lavish praise. Rather, I would like to add two observations, one wide-reaching, and one incidental.1. Dialog: The Cohen brothers seem to have carved out a nice little niche for themselves that allows them to write dialog that is completely over the top, time and time again. Most characters \"sound\" the same in terms of their word choices; as such, they lack individual personalities in this regard. Vocabulary is a huge part of character building in any film or a written piece of literature. It is a mystery to me why the Cohen brothers overlook this factor, to a large extent. Why? In my opinion, they like to \"show off\" their fifty dollar words. It started out as a need to \"prove\" themselves and now it is the millstones around their necks that allow critics to overlook this glaringly amateurish aspect of typical Cohen Bros dialog. I, myself, love language and words, but never at the expense of character building. The Cohen Bros proclivity for verbose and prolix dialog grows tiresome as the years wear on, especially when critics lavish them with awards for films that consistently showcase this glaring problem. Nobody will tell these \"emperors\" that they are buck naked in terms of their word choices. As William Blake would say, \"enough or Too much!\"2. Casting--specifically eye color and facial structure: Elizabeth Marvel looks nothing like Hailee Steinfeld. The most obvious problem with casting is eye color. Marvel has steely blue eyes and Steinfeld has dark brown eyes. On a large movie screen, this glaring inconsistency is unforgivable. Also, Ms. Steinfeld has multi-racial features owing to her exotic mother and Marvel looks like Pilgrim stock (emphasis on the \"grim\"). That severeness of appearance would have been fantastic if the Cohen brothers had cast a WASP for the young Mattie's role. But they did not, so why the heck did they cast Marvel? What were you thinking Cohen brothers? Dumb, dumb, dumb. This said: The choice to cast Steinfeld was brilliant. The choice to cast Marvel was anything but Marvelous. In short: this film should have been Marvel-less. There are plenty of multi-racially striking and brilliant actors who look more like Steinfeld. My choice would have been Jenette Goldstein. Her performance in Aliens back in 1986 was quite liberating, and she has the face and manner to pull off the tough/spinster roll of Mattie in 1903, sans arm. In short: She also looks enough like the young Mattie to be believable.",

            "content": "I told my wife that I wanted to stay and watch the movie again before we were fifteen minutes into it, so this review is not about whether I liked the movie or not. This review is a comparison of this movie to the original version.When there is a remake of a great movie, the obvious question is always why was it done.In this case, the obvious answer is that the makers of the new movie thought that the original True Grit was not gritty enough. \"Gritty\" is a somewhat amorphous term, but generally seems to mean that it's realer. It was apparently felt that a movie that was essentially a tragedy shouldn't look so pretty, and that it shouldn't have a country western singer in a starring role.Therefore, it was taken out of the California Sierra in Autumn, and put in Texas in Winter, and the serviceable performance by Glen Campbell in the original is replaced by the usual polished performance by Matt Damon.The overall level of acting in the movie is diminished, even by casting Damon as LaBoeuf, when Robert Duvall is replaced in the role of Lucky Ned Pepper by an actor whose last name happens to be Pepper. This tepid irony seems to be the only Coenism that I detected in the movie.There were unexpected plot turns, but none that seemed quirky and intentional. It seemed more like a Scott Rudin production than a Coen brothers production.The unexpected, and inexplicable, plot twists came mostly at the unsatisfactory ending of the film. Why didn't LaBouef die? If he wasn't dead, couldn't he have helped in getting Mattie to medical attention? Why did we need to know that Mattie never married, or that she lost her arm. What was that gratuitous snub of Jesse James at the end about? My daughter feels that the Academy committed a crime when the 1969 Best Actor Award was not given to Dustin Hoffman for playing Ratso Rizzo, and instead was given to John Wayne for playing John Wayne. It just so happened, though, that John Wayne was just right to play Rooster Cogburn, and Jeff Bridges didn't play John Wayne as well as John Wayne did.Making a movie more real is interesting and sometimes important when telling a true story, but True Grit was a made up story. There is no reason for a patron to feel sad at the end of a movie instead of happy if one is as real as the other.As I said, I enjoyed the new version of True Grit, but it wasn't as satisfying as the original.This doesn't mean True Grit should not be made again. The only failing of the original version was that it wasn't made in 3D.",

Such as the language used, I would be interested in knowing if the take \"type\" had been researched.

An old west tale of vengeance is nothing new, but when done right it is still a workable model and this was brilliantly executed.To my viewing eye originality is crucial, but if a new story is not the way you are going it has to be stunning, this fits the bill. The casting was impeccable.

Being a fan of the Hathaway version, in which Wayne - a limited actor but a great screen presence - gives a truly iconic performance, I wondered just how this would measure up. It's not bad but it is, I think, a missed opportunity to put an authentic reading of Portis' novel on film. In view of the Coens' insistence that they had gone back to the novel I was surprised at some of the deviations from the book, not to the script's advantage. The cast is fine, with Bridges wisely not trying to out-Wayne Wayne, but trying something different - perhaps nearer to the Cogburn in the novel. This is a really good acting performance. Damon is good (as always) and the young Mattie is fine, although not always being quite assertive enough as Kim Darby was. What I found missing was the droll humour of the first movie. Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable movie. It's just that I think it could have been better.",

She goes out and hires a tough marshal, Cogburn , played by Jeff Bridges to catch Chaney.Jeff Bridges is hilarious in the first scene when he is on trial in the court for murder. He is the kind of tough marshal who takes law into his hands and does not accept failure. He is getting old but has seen enough in his life time to trace out a fugitive in the desert.Matt Damon's character, Labeiff, a Texas ranger, starts out as a ranger who is out to do his job of catching Tom Chaney and joins the girl and marshal. He is good cop but not a tough one at it like the Marshal. Defensive at first but more mature and out to prove what he is capable of. You see Cogburn and Labeiff hesitating to proceed ahead sometimes and withdrawing their efforts, Cogburn terminating contract with the girl and Labeiff going back to Texas. It's the girl with the \"True grit\" having the motiviation and hunger to stick it out, no matter what. The girl's wit and innocence and childish sense of responsibility and ignorant braveness and her stubborness played out perfectly. It's what brings Cogburn and Labeiff back to save her.Overall, a nice western revenge drama with good fun played by excellent actors.

The cinematography is a work of art the shots look like paintings with falling snow and well lit cabin sets. Yet despite what it has going for it seems the writers can not get past their own perceived brilliance, often dragging out a 10 minute scene with issues that could have been resolved in 3.Jeff Bridges of Big Lebowski fame plays Rooster Cogburn a U.S. Marshal with an itchy trigger finger who is nagged into going on a man-hunt by a manipulative young girl who's father was murdered by a bumbling out law named Tom Chaney. The film itself is not so much about the hunt though as much as it is about the relationships between the characters. This is part of the Coen's style. They use characters as archetypes to get the point across; the bratty girl, the drunk trigger happy U.S Marshal, the half witted outlaw who is possibly using it as a act to appear less dangerous. Seeing them interact and go through one crazy scenario after the other is the major bulk and focus of the film, not the western brutality, or the hunt for Tom Chaney. The problem is the duration. Was it necessary to hear Rooster ramble on about his wives, or to see him get into it with LaBouf over his Texas heritage? No it wasn't but it's the Coen's trademark so don't expect that to change soon. Inexplicabe characters will show up then disappear never to be expanded on (the man in the bear skin), and some will receive a anti-climatic demise (really that was the fate Tom Chaney?).However script complaints aside this was a good experience to feel taken back to the era of cowboys and revolvers. Few times has the presence of the west been filmed so convincingly, and the dialog is spoken beautifully using words people don't normally speak these days, at least not like that. It's a shame it was over done. You see dialog is like oxygen molecules fusing with carbon... too much makes it poison.",

We see the recreation of the growing settlements, the restrictive gender situations and social differences. No detail has been left out or spared. It takes almost a documentary feel, but this is contrasted with the realistic approach and the attention to the speech of the times. Yes, the words and their delivery was different. People went beyond \"see ya\" or \"talk 2 u, 2\" back then.

With a run a time only 18 minutes less than the original it feels like a good 30 to 45 minutes less, because of how much is cut or rushed. Now making the remake shorter in and of itself is not necessarily bad, but the parts they did put large and important holes in the story and character development. The acting is generally terrible, particularly Bridges and Damon who overact so much its makes their characters seem comical and nearly incomprehensible. Honestly I couldn't understand half of what Bridges said because he mumbled so much, and Damon's character is barely in the movie and is never developed like in the original. Only Steinfeld did a comparable job, which was fairly true to the original, but with her touch to the character. Brolin is completely wasted in this film as he literally had only 5 minutes of screen time. The Coen brothers would have been well advised to have completely reworked the story so as to avoid the comparison's (which are fair considering they tried to keep it as close as possible), and put their own touch on the story.",

However, I found that throughout the film the script attempted to make the actors repeat almost the exact lines from the original film. This made me focus on comparing John Wayne with Jeff Bridges and Bridges was a pale imitation of Wayne in my view. Couldn't the scriptwriters have varied their script from the original? Same for the character Ned Pepper, originally played by Robert Duvall. Some of the acting appeared a little stilted possibly because they seemed to be speaking their lines almost verbatim from the original film. Josh Brolin in particular seemed a little uncomfortable with his lines. Just my opinion but disappointing. However, Hailee Steinfield was superb as Mattie.",

Berry Pepper was good too, and maybe he will grow into a Robert Duvall some day - but not yet. Hailee Steinfeld plays the Mattie role more stiffly than Kim Darbie, but both did a great job.

Jeff Bridges was pretty good as Cogburn but he seemed to be trying too hard. Came off more as a caricature than a role. Matt Damon's portrayal of a Texas Ranger didn't fit in at all. He looked and acted like a 20th Century cowboy rather than someone from the rough and tumble frontier. Some of the scenes were far-fetched. For instance, why Cogburn, a seasoned horseman, would ride his mount into the dirt is inexplicable. Can't say I would recommend this flick to anyone. The Coen's missed on this one.",

In my opinion, Coen brothers created a very successful western world in true grit.when we look scenes of true grit, we can see how they are simple. for example; the scene of sheriff Cogburn's judgment include simple dialogs and simple decor. moreover, when sheriff Cogburn and Mattie Ross trail in pursuit of tom Chaney, there is not complicated. their target is certain and, their lifestyle are simple life.In my opinion Jeff Bridges played very well, he played such as a real sheriff. moreover, Barry Pepper played very well as a lucky Ned. maybe his scenes are not so much , however he played very well. this film is the very good example of the westerns.",

Damon doesn't seem to understand how to capture the soul of a 1800's Texas Ranger. He seems quite uncomfortable in that role. Overall its a wonderful movie full of Oscar level acting. The back drop and scenery is completely believable as you feel swept back 150 years. The tension between the gruff Marshall and the headstrong girl keeps you enthralled.

Don't mean to blame Damon...the Texas Ranger is an odd character. Didn't much care for the action as it played out when the Texas Ranger encountered Ned's gang. The writing slipped at that point.The setting was probably truer to the novel's as was the ending, and using that ending was to the movie's detriment. I don't think it has the satisfaction of the first movie's ending. And I didn't like the new version of Tom Cheney's demise which deviated from the novel and the first film.Even so, hat's off to all involved in attempting a movie remake of a film (and from a novel) some of us regard highly.

At first I read this as being weak and the Coen brothers trying to get the film out to a more accepting audience. But as i reflected on the film further, i came to a realization of sorts. If Cogburn had been shown leaving the room of a prostitute at one point while he was in town, and there was some nudity or sex, it would have added nothing at all to the film. We learn exactly what kind of a man he is without sex or nudity. As for the language, it didn't need to be any worse. Not everyone in the west had to drop the f- bomb at the drop of a hat.

It's only 110 minutes, the movie doesn't got enough time to do some fun, it only showed some depressed scenes, allot of long dialog scenes and Bridges and Steinfield running on horses.

In most cases- you'll scratch your head and ask yourself why you waste so much time watching horrible acting.In the case of this film- it was the character of Miss Ross that was completely off of the original. In the original film, Miss Ross is very much a Tomboy/daddy's girl that is set on making sure that her dad's death has seen justice.

            "content": "Does nobody who wrote such glowing reviews of this depressing pile of pony-droppings remember the original \"True Grit\" with John Wayne, and that razor-witted firecracker who played opposite him (Kim Darby)? I'm not even old enough to have been there, but it's still widely available, and cheaper than the price of a movie ticket. The 1969 movie was as fun to watch as it was shocking, without all the depressive realism which destroyed the point in spending two hours of your life watching a movie. While it's a valid point that too little realism is insulting to modern, educated viewers, how many have so little pain in their own lives, and so much time that they can stand to watch movies of the trend set by \"No Country For Old Men\" and \"The American\" - movies which are only painful to watch, and always end on a depressing note?John Wayne and his directors struck a reasonable balance between entertainment and realism. The 1969 movie showcased an acerbic wit in both Wayne's Cogburn and Darby's rendition of Mattie Ross. Wayne portrayed a functional drunk, who could still manage to shoot strait, even if he was in the process of losing that. There's nothing funny about watching the Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges, an old man who can't even speak, kill himself with hugely exaggerated drunkenness. Honestly, it was less believable than Wayne's drunken hero Cogburn to see Bridge's much older, and much too exaggeratedly drunk act. Considering the hypothermia-inducing conditions, animal and firearm dangers of the territory which he was supposedly on, nobody would expect him to pick himself off the ground in the morning. Anyway, if the Coens want to preach Prohibitionist politics, then it should be the appropriate political parties who pay them, not the viewer. Ross was not all childish virtue when portrayed by Kim Darby in the original movie, and the remarkable cunning which she displayed was entertaining, inspiring, and her script was more honest in light of what she was up against.The movie, when made in 1969, also paid far more actors, and more interesting scenes, while treating the viewer to much stunning outdoor footage, accuracy to the location or season notwithstanding. Many of the scenes in the 2010 rendition were done in the dark, which besides making it more painful to watch, saved the Coens much money on set and footage detail. Altogether, the 2010 remake, for those who know better cinema, stunk worse than a rotting corpse in a snake pit of cheapness, and the re-tooling of the dialogue served only to completely remove all of the fun. It's a waste of time to watch if you've seen The Duke, and all who played in the 1969 movie, and it's a ten-dollar movie ticket wasted.",

I sat through the film quoting dialogue along with the characters from the original, so that couldn't have taken long, or cost much. Due to the lack of westerns nowadays this was a very good effort but I thought the ending was lame compared to Wayne's fence jump.

It also boasts excellent performances from the two leads.I've said it's a traditional western-that's true in the sense that it has a much more black/white morality to it than those of the Eastwood/Leone school (not to the discredit the latter). However it does give the viewer some space to reflect on the action-it's clear who is in the right but are they doing the right thing? In the context of the Coens' previous work this is not their best, it is up there, though without the quirky humour and irony it might disappoint fans-but it is a very good, well executed, compelling film.

But it's hard not to compare the overall impression to that of Tarantinos Pulp Fiction in terms of genre-crossover-experiments. In this perspective, True Grit positions itself as a post-modern production, where Monty Python-like dialogue meets ultra violence. The Cohen brothers does their best to tender the audience with twisted anecdotes of the west, masters as they are. But the sole appearance of a fall into a pit of snakes \u00e1 la Spielburg leaves you wondering if this is a standalone masterpiece or a clumsy remake of more than one movie. I'm entertained but I long for a non-Hollywood Cohen production.",

How disappointed I was this 'new' version is a frame by frame remake of the Duke's classic of 1969.It reminded me of the pointless color remake of Psycho- the Hitchcock classic- some years ago.True the new movie is more gritty and realistic, but thats to be expected in a modern movie, particularly made by the Coen's. Although Jeff Bridges tries very hard to avoid an impersonation of the Duke he doesn't quite succeed, in fact he largely reprises his Wild Bill Hickok character from a few years ago. The photography is good but the lethargic pace and lack of action make this production a meaningless process, and a greatly over-hyped one at that. Stick to the Duke's original and save on the popcorn and rental fee!",

How expensive is it to film some horses out on a dusty trail? I'm no film expert, but I'm sure it's pretty cheap.Some classics need to be left alone.

Starring: Hailee Steinfeld, Academy Award Winners Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. I recommend this movie to action/adventure lovers like myself! It had an overall great beginning, middle, and end. Not to mention it's a remake, and truth be told, most remakes are busts. Not only that, but you could feel for the characters, they weren't just some slob of meat actors, they were expressive, emotional, and quite frankly, it's a movie that you could sense the actors and actresses wanted to be in. But it wasn't a perfect movie, there were some long and boring monologues that really didn't seem like they belonged in the movie. So in conclusion, if you have a few hours you should go along and watch the movie. Thank you for reading-- Sammychicawammy",

Its a sobering watch at times, with a variety of characters. Its quite tense, atmospheric and reasonably quiet at times, with the noise of the wind blowing being quite clearly heard. It has a sombre and mysterious feel to it which I quite liked too. Its safe to say there's plenty of time for viewers to contemplate the fate of the various characters, namely Reuben Cogburn (played well by Jeff Bridges) and Mattie Ross.\n\nThis is certainly not in any way a sentimental re-telling of the wild west, so its not quite 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' territory, although this is a Coen brothers film. As Westerns go, I thought this was quite a good one. Worth a watch.\n\nThe music played isn't especially noticeable but I suppose it does add to the sense of atmosphere during scenes in which we see the main characters trekking across the land. I suppose this is a film about finding out other peoples true characters, putting trust in to others, whether for right or for wrong. I enjoyed it overall.",

            "content": "A first-class western, solidly entertaining and rich in fine craftsmanship. The Coen brothers went back to the harsh terrain of West Texas, where their Oscar-winning masterpiece 'No Country For Old Men' was set and shot, to film this epic quest of justice. It's a decidedly straightforward exercise in genre filmmaking, lacking the quixotic touches Joel and Ethan usually bring to their films. To be honest, were their names not in the credits you could suggest this film was made by any good filmmaker. They pair up with cinematographer Roger Deakins once again, and he shot this beautifully--strikingly lit scenes, winter nights that look as cold as they are, lovely scenic vistas that recall the visual glory of the best movies in this genre. The brothers have stated with persistence that this is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film which won John Wayne his Oscar. They stick more closely to the Charles Portis novel both films are based on. The film's most savory asset is the pitch-perfect period dialogue, rich in local color and cadences. The great Jeff Bridges tackles the Duke's role, growling/grumbling his lines, relishing playing drunk and craggy but terrific in suggesting the hard-bitten intelligence his Rooster Cogburn has. Matt Damon has superb timing and makes an intriguing, chatty Texas Ranger all too ready to get defensive about his job title and his home state. Josh Brolin, despite getting third billing, only actually appears on screen for a limited amount of time in the third act. But his chiseled face and menacing eyes instantly suggest the rattlesnake lurking beneath the guise of a slow-witted man. He's so good you wish he had more screen time. Barry Pepper, a superbly sturdy character actor in role after role, shows up as another villainous outlaw thug. But the real standout is Hailee Steinfeld, who is a knockout in her first role. At only 14 she nails the part, able to suggest her character's beyond-her-years wisdom and resourcefulness, her \"true grit\" as it were. But she also conveys the understandable fear a young girl would feel when she walks into a situation and comes to understand she's in over her head. That first-timer Steinfeld more than holds her own with Bridges, Damon and Co. is one of the great movie-going pleasures of the holiday season. The film's meandering pace will test some viewers, but the shocking bursts of violence, the dark, dry sprinkles of wit, and the thrilling confrontations of the third act are enough--along with the performances and direction--to make this one of your best bets for entertainment at the cinema right now",

While I did like the 1969 very much, although I didn't like Kim Darby, this version does make some improvements, such as the pace and Mattie. But it also has some hindrances, the ending is abrupt, and some of the characters perhaps are not quite as intriguing as they are in the 1969 film, Rooster especially has a more somewhat cantankerous personality there.\n\nLike all the Coen Bros movies, True Grit is beautifully shot, the scenery is stunning and there are some typically quirky moments in the cinematography. The story is compelling, and the dialogue is surprisingly droll which enhances the bleak atmosphere even more. The direction is superb, Carter Burwell's score is wonderfully atmospheric, the pace is more secure here and the final shoot out which stood out in the 1969 film is glorious. The performances are also really good. Jeff Bridges had the great John Wayne to compete with, not an easy feat at all, and while he is a more monotone Rooster Cogburn he is a revelation charisma and performance wise. Matt Damon impresses too, and Hailee Steinfeld is a big improvement on Kim Darby and comes very close to outshining her co-stars.\n\nAll in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I think this is a picture that nearly everyone will appreciate. It's rare I think. Coen's have done so wonderful work, and although it's very difficult to say what their greatest achievement has been, I can say with a fair amount of certainty that True Grit is the one I enjoyed the most.

But, in a time where so many remakes are thoughtless, pointless, and useless, the Coen's craft a masterpiece of the western genre, focusing more on adapting the original novel than interfering with the 1969 film. Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges are excellent, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Hailee Steinfeld in a debut role as the young daughter whose father is murdered by a hired hand. A modern classic.",

            "content": "Gripping Western drama from the ever delightful Coen Brothers.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's Revisionist Western True Grit (2010) is one of the greatest remakes of all time. The Coen Brothers take you on an American adventure into the deep South for a Western full of disquiet nights and sudden encounters. I loved the adorable and no nonsense lead actress performance from Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross in which she bosses around Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin with equal fervor. Steinfeld is a force to be reckoned with as she's the embodiment of True Grit. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal as the grumbling, alcohol U.S. marshal Rooster Cogburn with his incessant stories, silly complaints, and blunt commentary. His stunning gunshots, final charge, and last ride for decency are incredible moments in cinema.\n\nMatt Damon is hilarious and compelling as Texan ranger LaBoeuf with his extravagant vocabulary and constant whining. He's an excellent foil for Bridges' stubborn Rooster. Josh Brolin cameos as the dim witted murderer Tom Chaney with his foolish gait and idiotic mumbling. Brolin is always funny to me. Barry Pepper is captivating as \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper with his heavy gravitas and total command of his bandit gang. Domhnall Gleeson is sympathetic as the bandit in Pepper's gang called Moon as he begs for help. Ed Lee Corbin's cameo as The Bear Man is just hysterical. Elizabeth Marvel is striking as the older Mattie remembering Rooster.\n\nRoger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography features ultra wide landscape shots that would make John Ford or David Lean proud. Deakins' framing is cool with these strikingly focused medium shots on main characters. Roderick Jaynes' editing is very sharp and quick, giving True Grit a rather steady pace, which is generally unusual for Westerns. True Grit is 110 minutes of laughs and suspense as characters mouth off pithy one liners and remorseless stories written by Joel and Ethan Coen themselves. \n\nThe Coen Brothers adapt Charles Portis' novel with gleeful, gruff, and whimsical writing like all great Coen pictures as well as a reverence for these characters made iconic in the John Wayne film. The Coen Brothers depict the Southern wild West as a kill or be killed frontier with general lawlessness unless paid in blood to bounty hunters, U.S. marshals, or Texas rangers. True Grit shows that it takes both manly toughness and a willful perseverance of character to withstand these God forsaken lands.\n\nCarter Burwell's score is excellent with angelic reimaginings of old folk and country songs. I really like the repeating theme of \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" like a sweeter version of Robert Mitchum's eerie rendition in The Night of the Hunter. Jess Gonchor's production design cleaves out a wooden rustic look for all the sets, while Nancy Haigh's set decoration has a rugged charm and brutally deserted aesthetic. Mary Zophres' costumes are super stylish with fur coats and leather everything. Cowboys have rarely looked so good on film.\n\nIn all, True Grit is constantly funny, quite charming, and often gripping with suspenseful shootouts and conversations. True Grit is a cool Western from the always entertaining Coen Brothers.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers and the Western genre: at the latest since their Oscar winner No Country For Old Men, we know that this combination fits. In True Grit they take a completely different, almost conventional path. Based on Charles Portis novel of the same name, which spawned the 1969 film classic starring John Wayne, young Mattie Ross sets out to find her father's killer. She is assisted by a marshal who seems to be long past his prime.\n\nThe story focuses on three protagonists. On the one hand, there is the young Mattie Ross, embodied by the then 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld. Considering that this was Steinfeld's debut in a leading role, she appears almost too experienced and is on an absolute par with her more experienced colleagues. By too experienced it means that one hardly notices her young age. Yes, in those days one probably had to take on more responsibility earlier and shed the infantile behaviour prematurely. The latter is most noticeable when Ross makes her cheeky and disrespectful announcements without regard for the possible consequences. Of course, she is na\u00efve at times, but this is less due to the writing of the character than to Steinfeld's authentic acting. She is particularly fun in combination with her companions Reuben Cogburn and LaBeouf. The former is in none other than Jeff Bridges, who once again delivers a veritable firework of cool. Bridges makes almost every role he plays look easy, even if it's one that's really tailor-made for him. As Cogburn, he is filthy and frustrated on the surface, but doesn't want to let it show in his appearance. When signs appear that he has long since ceased to be what he once was as a marshal, he immediately plunges into stubborn confrontations. He usually leads these against LeBeouf, played by Matt Damon. It often seems that this character was cast just for these arguments, which hurts Damon's presence somewhat. One hardly buys the role of the sovereign and almost ruthless cowboy because he only fits into this kind of role to a limited extent. Much more adequate is the villain part of Josh Brolin, who does exactly his job in very little screentime. \n\nTrue Grit is on the one hand a typical Coen film. Bloody brutality when you least expect it, beautiful images from the wild Western, captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins and peppered with clever and eloquent dialogue. On the other hand, the film is very different from their usual style of making. And this is precisely where the problem lies. The abstruseness of Fargo and No Country For Old Men is missing here. The approach seems almost generic and in its plot the film leans too much on the old version. As a result, it's nothing you haven't seen before multiple times. Still, the Coens put their stamp on the film again, especially with the stellar cast, and make True Grit a very atmospheric film experience. Nice homage to the Wild Western, even if that's about it.",

Jeff Bridges is a great big ornery drunk bear, and comes off like a mean Mark Twain.  I liked his character.

Hailee Steinfeld is a young girl looking for revenge for her murdered father.  She is a feisty, precocious little girl who is oh-so-lovable because she is a feisty, precocious little girl.  Jeff Bridges is the old, hard-drinking, rough-around-the-edges curmudgeon who is oh-so-lovable because he's an old, hard-drinking, rough-around-the-edges curmudgeon.  The old, curmudgeonly drunkard helps the young girl on her quest for revenge.  Matt Damon shows up in this movie and just utterly sucks -- he is NOT oh-so-lovable because, well, he's Matt Damon.  Josh Brolin is the bad guy and he is probably one of the lamest villains in any movie ever.  The way the characters talk in this film is so annoying -- it reminds me of certain people I've known who love the sounds of their own voices and love listening to themselves yap, yap, yap.  I never cared about the little girl or the old drunk guy with mush mouth or the utterly useless Matt Damon character.  *Spoilers*  Near the end of the movie, after the girl gets bitten by a snake, the old, drunk, mush mouth guy rides a horse to death to try and get the girl to a doctor.  He shoots the horse in its head after it keels over from exhaustion.  Then old, drunk mush mouth guy picks the girl up in his arms and runs to the nearest town to try and save the girl until he too is exhausted.  Then, he pulls out his gun and fires it to signal to the townspeople that he needs assistance.  I swear, when he pulled out that gun, I wanted him to shoot himself in the head. Or, shoot the little girl in the head.  *End Spoilers*  Yeah, I didn't really care about the characters in this movie at all or the little girl's quest for revenge.  The weak, underdeveloped villain didn't do anything for me either.  This movie was mostly just made in America trash.",

Three versions of Spider-man within twenty years. Enough is enough. But this film as I watched it, it was somber. It was breathtaking. Humorous even. It seemed grounded and made the cinema come alive and it was a breath of fresh air. Not only were the leads compelling, that of Jeff Bridges, and Matt Damon paired up but also Haillee Steinfeld just broke it in. Some parts were shocking, other parts were highly questionable, but it all made sense at the end. Not only is it a story about revenge, we also have a story about finding her father one way or another. It didn't tell that, but it was there. All around, this story was superb. I recommend this fully. Out of everything that came out from 2010, it was one of the best films. Highly recommend it. ",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers continue to impress and deliver another film that highlights their versatility as filmmakers. They've made thrillers, comedies, gangster pictures, musicals, dramas, and now a western. There's been a number of interesting westerns over the past 20 years, but they're all typically revisionist westerns, where the genre has been subverted (i.e. \"The Revenant\" \"The Proposition\" \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" \"Bond Tomohawk\" \"Django Unchained\" \"The Hateful Eight\" etc.) and have not embraced the more durable tropes and archetypes of the genre. \"Appaloosa\" and \"Open Range\" are the only westerns of the last 20 years I can recall that were of the classic mold and were any quality (all western fans should go out and watch these films immediately if you haven't). The original \"True Grit\" is a classic in the sense that it was a popular film with a memorable performance by John Wayne as the colorful one-eyed lawman Rooster Cogburn, but it's a far cry from being a masterpiece along the lines of the best westerns by Ford, Hawks, or Peckinpah. This was smart on the part of the Coens to take a well known story and character and put their own spin on it. It's harder to remake a masterpiece than it is to remake something mediocre (i.e. remaking \"The Fly\" versus remaking \"Poltergeist\"). As quirky of filmmakers as the Coens are, they have crafted a surprisingly straightforward western, though filled with rich characterizations and a balance of elegance and grittiness. In this retelling Jeff Bridges takes on the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn and Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross, a young girl who enlists the help of the gruff marshall to find her father's murderer. The Coens are often credited with their visual panache, but they don't get enough respect for their writing. Take this exchange early in the film when Maddie is looking for a marshall to help bring in the man who killer her father:\n\nMATTIE: Who's the best marshal?\n\nSHERIFF: Hmm, I'd have to think on that. Bill Waters is the best tracker. He's part Comanche; it is a pure joy to watch him cut for sign. The meanest is Rooster Cogburn; a pitiless man, double tough. Fear don't enter into his thinking. I'd have to say the fairest is L.T. Quinn; he always brings in his prisoners alive. Now, he might let one slip by evrey now and then, but...\n\nMATTIE Ross: Where would I find this Rooster?\n\nThat exchange perfectly sets up up both Maddie's intentions of what she wants the end result of her manhunt to be and it also informs the audience about the character of Cogburn, even before the audience has met him. As with the original film, the story is mainly a character piece focused on the dynamic between the determined and quite proper Maddie and the gruff jaded Cogburn. Bridges chews the scenery as Cogburn in a way that he hasn't in a film for years. And in the Coen's introduction of the character, Bridges makes the most of their dialogue in a courtroom scene where he describes his bringing a group criminals to justice under cross examination:\n\n\nCOGBURN: I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy, Aaron Wharton, down there on the creek bank with some hogs. They'd killed a shoat and was butchering it. They'd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water.\n\nMR. BARLOW: What did you do?\n\nCOGBURN: Crept down. I announced that we was U.S. marshals and hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys. He picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.\n\nMR. BARLOW: What did you do then?\n\nCOGBURN: Backed away trying to talk some sense into him. But C.C. edges over by the wash pot behind that steam and picks up a shotgun. Potter seen him but it was too late. C.C. Wharton pulled down on Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me with the other. I shot him and when the old man swung the axe I shot him. Odus lit out and I shot him. Aaron Wharton and C.C. Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but Odus was just winged.\n\nThe Coen's tapped into folksy dialogue in a number of films, but in \"True Grit,\" wether this is authentic language or not, this old west dialogue sounds great and is some of the best I've heard since \"Will Penny\" or Peckinpah. This dialogue also tells us that Cogburn may be a fat old man, but he's also a force to be reckoned with who's quick to violence. Maddie and Cogburn make quite an odd couple on the trail and are also joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, pronounced Le Beef, played to the hilt by by an erudite Matt Damon, who is a perfect foil to the gruff Cogburn. LaBoeuf's know-it-all attitude is also hilariously challenged by the self confident young Maddie. Cogburn's take on the trio is:\n\nCOGBURN: \"I'm a foolish old man who's been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpie in trousers and a nincompoop.\"\n\nThe Coen's follow the original film's story for the most part, but they bring a richness to the characters and a gritty elegance to their representation of the old west that was missing from the Wayne version. In a time when the traditional western story has become pass\u00e9, the Coens have managed to make it relevant and accessible again for modern audiences. ",

            "content": "Westerns have never been my favorite genre although I do like Hud (1963) and Johnny Guitar (1954). This is a film that causes me not to want to see other films in the genre as it features the hammy performances that the Coen brothers are so fond of and dialogue that seems very pleased with itself. It's a film that's never particularly involving and that wastes talent capable of much greater things. I don't think it's one of the best films of 2010 as it is a highly forgettable film that is painfully dull to watch. When films like Rabbit Hole (2010), Greenberg (2010) and even The Company Men (2010) were released in the same year it seems odd that a film this weak would be showered with so much praise.\n\nIn the old west, Sassy fourteen year old Mattie Ross, Hailee Steinfeld, has her father murdered by Tom Chaney, Josh Brolin, who is under the command of Ned Pepper, Barry Pepper, and has fled Arkansas before she can catch him. She employs bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn, Jeff Bridges, to kill Chaney for her but intends to follow him on his mission. He deceives her and heads off with well meaning Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, Matt Damon, who wants Chaney because he murdered a senator. Cogburn, Laboeuf and Ross eventually team up to try and track down Chaney but face many obstacles to finding him as he is well protected. Eventually our heroes prevail but not without our heroine losing her arm.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the film is the lack of interesting characters as the female lead is downright dislikable, Cogburn is meant to be folksy but charming and Damon is rather stolid as the third banana. This is an issue I have with most westerns as it can be hard to care about the characters who feel more like empty shells of human beings built to kill than the sort of people you would want to watch for nearly two hours. Their wasn't any in point here because I was frustrated at the sight of the arrogant, smug faced Ross attempting to swindle those around her and with Bridges doing a routine he's done about a million times the novelty had well and truly worn off. In Johnny Guitar I was immediately drawn in by the tough, quick witted Vienna and the inimitable screen presence of the feisty Joan Crawford, there was none of that in this film.\n\nIn addition to this issue the film doesn't present anything in the way of being technically impressive as it lacks the groundbreaking cinematography of a John Ford film and borrows from so many other better films. At least in certain western films that bore the living daylights out of me I can at least appreciate that the shots have been choreographed with great care and there is a certain drama to the landscape that lends itself to cinema. I am usually amazed by the work of the legendary Roger Deakins who did brilliant work on Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and Sid and Nancy (1986) but here he brings the same bland flavor he brought to Fargo (1996) to a story that should feel epic in scope. I want to see sweeping planes and dramatic cliff faces while tall, thin men in cowboy hats cut a sharp against the skyline.\n\nThe multiple acting nominations that this film received at the Academy Awards baffle me with Bridges and Steinfeld both earning undeserved nominations. I don't think that John Wayne's original performance should have contended for an Academy Award but I would argue that Bridges does not hold a candle to him in terms of performance and therefore he should not have a nomination, especially in a year as strong as 2010. Steinfeld is spectacular in The Edge of Seventeen (2016) which she deserved a Best Actress nomination for but here she is intensely annoying as a main character who is meant to be adorable and endearing but leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Brolin and Barry Pepper give the most colorful, entertaining performances in the film and inject some real fun into a project that takes itself a tad too seriously.\n\nObviously, I would not recommend this to people even if they love westerns because even I, practically foreign to the genre, can see that this film fails on almost all levels.",

The film stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie and Jeff Bridges as Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn. \n\nThe acting in the film I found was really good and realistic especially from Jeff Bridges as Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn I personally think that he gave a gritty but loveable portrayal of the character. I also have to say that Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie was a really good casting choice. At this moment in time she is among the best child actors I have seen. The film also co stars Matt Damon as La Boeuf and Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney the bad guy of the story.\n\nThe characters in my opinion were written well and enjoyable to watch especially Marshal Reuben. There were a couple points in the film where there characters were a little too much but I didnt really find that as a problem. \n\nThe cinematography was strong and gave the film some slow but beautiful shots. I especially like one shot were Mattie is inside a cave looking outward. \n\nThe setting like most Coen brother films is very good and gives the era/destination a very realistic feel to it. \n\nThe set design and props in the film is down to the point from the guns to the building design.\n\nThe costume design like the set design is to the point and fits the era extremely well.\n\nThe style of the film like most Coen brother films has a rustic but beautiful colour design.\n\nThe film has some very good special effects especially with the blood and action. The other special effects are good but not as strong as with the action. The film does also have some good CGI along with the special effects. \n\nThe action is pulled off really well from the special effects to the tension. My personal favourite action scene in the film takes place in a cabin with two other people played by Paul Rae and Nicholas Sadler. \n\nThe film I noticed also had some very good sound design from the gun shots to the sound of people hanging. \n\nThe Coen brothers I find are really good with dialogue and using the correct words to use for the era.\n\nSome of the music in the film I found was sometimes to overwhelming which put me off a little bit luckily the film doesnt have too much music.\n\nThe story of the film follows Mattie trying to avenge her fathers murder by hunting down the man who killed him. Along the way she pays the Marshal to help her track down her fathers murderer. \n\nThe film also has some very good comedy especially from Jeff Bridges.\n\nThe film at points also has some strong atmosphere especially toward the end.\n\nThe film surprisingly is also quiet emotnial toward the end.\n\nThere are a couple other things wrong with the film but it doesnt take away too much.\n\nOver all it is a very enjoyable and well made film. So that is why I give it a 8/10 - worth paying for two tickets",

I have been putting this one off for quite a while, but being a fan of the Coen Brothers I decided to finally give it a chance. \n\nI was extremely pleased, aside from the film being filmed so beautifully the storyline was so enthralling, Hailee Steinfeld was a tour de force that left me in awe when I discovered this was her cinematic premiere. Matt Damon and Bridges both also bring extremely impressive performances, but that's to be expected from two seasoned veterans. \n\nThe plot was extremely satisfying, the only reason I didn't give this movie a full rating is that I felt the ending falls a bit flat. It's not surprising, and some may even say the ending was brilliant, but I expected a little more of a resolve. Not a terrible ending in any sense, just wasn't what I was expecting. \n\nI loved this movie and not only would I watch it again, but I would also actively seek it out and push others to see.",

            "content": "Im late to the game in writing this movie review, but I must say that the movie does live up to the hype!\nThe story line moves along in a very straight forward and simplistic style. Its a classic heroes tale in the wild west. SO what makes this movie so damn enthralling?\n\nWell our characters of course! We are immediately pulled in by Haley Seinfeld as Maddie, a strong, stubborn, naively courageous girl on the search for her father's killer. Her educated tongue, her adult-like manner, feel contemporary in a setting far more rigid and outlandish. Our US Marshal Cogburn is a more typical western cowboy; a rough around the edges drunkard who understands the workings on the anarchic west, but who has a soft stop for our outlandish protagonist. Finally, we have our Texas Ranger LaBouef, a man who holds himself to a higher moral, with strong views of the world, others, and himself.\n \nWatching these characters interact feels unimportant. The simplistic nature of the film really hides how much these characters change from start to finish. This is where I think the beauty of the film really shines. The Cohen brothers are masters at making these characters that shouldn't fit in to the wild west, fit right in. For starters, our protagonist is a 14 year old girl! And the viewer is able to accept this fact because we watch Maddi struggle and fight for her right to join on the man hunt. We see a texas ranger with an air of sexism and biggotism, that by the end of the movie, we admire for his moral compass and respect for Maddi. We have a drunkard who makes no attempt at improving himself at all. \n\nThe strangest thing for me was how human our villains were. Maddie shoots Tom Channey off the bat, reminding us that he is no evil villain, he is just a man. We have Channey's team of outlaws treating maddi with a certain level of respect, insinuating there is sore form of hierarchy in the group. Throughout the film, these villains are made out to be the worst of the worst, people willing to kill for no reason at all. In the end, they are shown for what they really are; human beings. Though all of these villains are killed at the end, they felt much less dangerous in reality than they were in stories. \n\n\nIn addition, hidden within this plot is a a weaving of feminist occurrences hat fly under the radar. We have our main character, maddi, successfully kill the villain. This is huge, as our two detectives have been hunting for channey for years. We have our two men by the end of the film, treating our main character with respect and dignity, even as a 14 year old girl. This is a dynamic unseen in most western films other than (name that movie from CIMS101). The magic is in the Cohen Brothers ability to make these hugely feminist and weird themes feel completely normal in the setting of the wild west. \nFinally, we have our ending. The killing of Tom Channey. This victory was IMMEDIATELY brushed over as Maddi falls in a pit and is poisoned by a snake. Suddenly, right when things feel calm and \"peace\" SHOULD be restored, were off to the races! In saving Maddi's life, her success, and the success of the team, is completely overlooked. \nI feel uncertain as to why this decision was made. Why did maddi have to fall in the pit? Why did she have to lose her arm? Why were the three unable to say any form of a good bye? \nIt feels as though Maddi is being punished for what she had done. A possible statement about women attempting to be more in society? She lost an arm, her horse, her friends, and we see that she never marries later on. Could this all have been the result of attempting to do too much? The ending feels very much like thelma and Louise; A powerful victory for women that in the end winds up in defeat. \n\n\nOn a more personal note, I found the dialogue of the film to be a true wonder to listen to. Though Tom Channey speaks with a more barbaric tongue that fits the status quo of the West, LeBouef and Maddi bring educated tongues with them on their journey. Another oddity that the Cohen Brothers seamlessly intertwine in their movie without raising any suspicion.",

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way. Well...they didn't. In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen. Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything. Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original. In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed. The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting. Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes. I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book. That must mean the ending. It is very different, and honestly, better than the original. However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done. The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film. I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

Fortunately, the responsible team in here, is trustworthy and doesn't fail to deliver too. The Coen Brothers; as usual is no short on execution and this time has got appropriate editing on their side. The real game changer of the feature is their smart adaptation of Charles Portis' novel that is not only gripping but sensibly thought-provoking. The background score and the costume design is apt for the tone of the feature. The performance is strong and something that factors a lot in its favour, reason being a great star cast on its side. And addition to that, the performance given by them is appreciative too, especially by the protagonist Jeff Bridges who is supported well enough by Hailee Steinfield, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin (no matter how much runtime he gets in here). The writing is more practical than usual western feature does, as there is too much practicality involved in it that sends out this eerie vulnerable feeling in the audience for the characters. True Grit breeds essential sentiments in its self-created grittiness, but still somehow fails to draw out the anticipated emotion from the screen and the reason would be its perspective.",

The humor, music, sounds; way they speak fit in so well with the tone of the film. This film definitely makes you root for Mattie, Hailee Steinfeld, because she shows such determination in seeking justice for her father who was murdered by Tom Chaney, Josh Brolin. It's not an easy world they live in and the Coen brothers do a remarkable job showing it. The river that Mattie crosses to get to Rooster Cogburn, Jeff Bridges, and LaBoeuf, Matt Damon, is wide and swift.  She was lucky she had her horse, Little Blackie, or she would not have made it. The tree Cogburn makes Mattie climb to cut down a body that was left hanging is tall and the branch sways after she succeeds making her hang on tight so she doesn't fall. It was definitely not how she pictured it would be, but she sticks with it. The humor in it is more random and successful through the timing and editing. Like, the first time Rooster and Mattie are talking, it's a close up of Mattie and all you see is that she is talking to Rooster through a wooden door. After she says, \"You've been at it some time,\" it shows that she's talking to him while he's in an outhouse. Also, when they think LaBeouf is following them, they stop and wait. They make it seem they're waiting 20-30 minutes and some guy wearing bear fur shows up and all Cogburn says is, \"You are not LaBoeuf.\" The score does its job. It's soft where it needs to be. Like, in the scene where LaBoeuf leaves in the night. It's also dramatic when it needs to be. Like, when Chaney says, \"All I need is your silence.\" It's an all-around great movie.",

When we see all are paying for hard times when competition & prices are getting high. When we see we all have a price when others pay those for help, and we are an extra hand that is free. When we see we need to pay those the discipline they deserve to lay some ground rules and spanking. When somethings we see we pay attention to when they lurk in the dark while we sleep. When somethings we see we pay no attention or business when we need to make them focused on the task at hand, lighten the mood and make sure we make others pay to get everyone to along. When we see we can't pay for other things to get along when there is no price for pride. When we wish to see somethings when we pay to have it our way. When somethings we see we pay the decency to put a stop to somethings inhumane.

When we see we rather pay for other things when we see just about anything out in these parts. \nWhen what we see others have paid a price for and are of value after death when you can trade for something for it. When there are somethings we don't wish to see nor pay attention to but it's a business that is flourishing when body snatching is used for medical research. When what many don't see they don't get paid when they don't see the living in somethings. When we see there is a small price to pay when we die, when it's worth little in hard times, when there is no one to see to it you die right and pay for a proper funeral. When other things we see pay the price when they are of value in harsh conditions. When we see there is a price we pay for everything even information. When we see some places we have to pay closer attention to when we are not welcome and hiding something when we are the law. When what we see we pay them the swiftest hand of the law. When what we see we pay our dues when it's our time to go. When somethings we see we need not to pay when it's free when we prefer our own style of justice. When we see some places we pay a visit to danger lurks behind us to know we have each others backs. When somethings we don't wish to see but others wish to see is settling once and for all whom we pay our respects too when we fight to which aims are true and whom can hit their targets to know we pay any price for when we are great. When other things we don't pay attention to impairs us. When we see some arrangements are not in contract thus no need to nullify when payment is terminated.

When somethings we cant see but know by reputation when they are paid to kill criminals. When somethings we see we know we owe to pay but cannot allow when our living is to not abide by the law. When what we see we don't want to pay when we wish to get away with things. When somethings we see we return and pay the favour and pay it forward for saving us. When we see our moment of payback our aim is true when we brought those to justice. When we see we can't escape our fate in some conditions when we can't pay ourselves to get out of somethings we are in that other things dont have a price but prefer somethings be left alone and prefer to let the laws of the world do its work. When somethings we see we put more then a price to pay but their life when we push them to their limits to get us to where we need to go. When see the costs of living to putting a price for everything to get us there in the end, to not have to pay for what reckoning we may have caused or been apart of. When we see we paid a lot to see what we see to continue to see all what we have and those whom got us here. When we see the cost of living puts a price over everything, some that we prefer to be close to and not have a value after death when sentimental value is more. When we wish to see all those who do us wrong pay the piper in the end. When we wish to see progress reach us sooner to fall short and slow down when we can't pay for everything we wish to see by the time it's too late.",

Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), she sets out with him---over his objections---to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man.\n\nIn this Western filled with gorgeous landscapes and action-packed shootouts, the Coen brothers display a vision of a Wild West that is indeed wild---but also honorable. They went back to Portis' original text and have transformed it into a work of art that stands on its own, apart and different from the 1969 John Wayne classic. Laconic stretches explode with violence and relax with wit and humor on a stage peopled with extraordinary actors, with Bridges as the master. It's a true Western, made for both the genre's connoisseurs and newcomers. The biggest revelation, besides how hokey-yet-winning Damon can be, is Steinfeld. Her role requires the ability to stand up against two award-winning actors and portray a teen who tackles adult responsibilities fully while both grieving and avenging the loss of a parent---true grit, in other words---and she executes perfectly. From start to finish, 'True Grit' plays as it should, and well.",

Speaking of the perfomances: JEFF BRIDGES you are awesome dude! Everytime you saw his face and heard his great voice it was magic. Pure perfection. And also Matt Damon, Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Brolin bring their A-game to this movie. This is a very goodlooking, awesome acted, almost taratino like western.

Surprisingly, I did end up enjoying certain elements of the film, but was overall left dissatisfied.\n\nThe cinematography of the wide open landscapes in the film were pure mastery, and the close detail paid to historical accuracy was much appreciated, but some aspects of the film just missed the mark. Plot holes such as when Mattie Ross rushed into the river with her horse but emerged mysteriously dry left me slightly irritated. I felt that the plot dragged on and on and left me impatiently waiting for the movie to end. I did appreciate the character arch of Laboeuf and Cogburn and how Mattie facilitated/catalyzed their archs. \n\nI'm unsure if this is a valid criticism or not but I also found extremely hard to hear and/or understand the actors words and found myself rewinding the film a lot.\n\nOne aspect of the film I did really enjoy was the musical score. A good musical score for a movie will enthrall you and help the ebb and flow of the plot and this movie's score did exactly that. Without it, it is very probable that I would have fallen asleep watching it.\n\nFor me, watching this film felt a lot like watching a historical documentary of sorts and it did not leave me very fulfilled. In terms of the quest archetype, I felt that it may not be the best movie to represent it well. Because of its ties to western cowboy culture, many may think that it is symbolic of the American quest, but I think a film like The Pursuit of Happyness would have been a much better film to represent this because the quest is much more nuanced.",

Contains the perfect recipe that has all the ingredients in perfect measure for a western - motivated and stubborn protagonist in pursuit of revenge, supporting characters with vested interests, technology for the best wide shots and beautiful locales going with them are the super talented cast. How can that not go down well? \n\nMattie's (Hailee Steinfeld) father has just been murdered by his help Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She identifies the perfect man Rooster (Jeff Bridges) to exact her revenge who is a bounty hunter notorious for his trigger happy fingers who reluctantly takes on the mission due to a meager negotiation. LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) is a U.S. Marshall in pursuit of Tom Chaney for various previous crimes and wants in on their pursuit but falls short on his ability to please and differences in approach. Rest is how they fix their differences and accomplish their mission. \n\nA lot rides on making Mattie's character likable and Hailee Steinfeld does an excellent job by showing the stubbornness and innocence associated with her age and maturity to deal with the veteran gunslingers. Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin and Matt Damon are accomplished and talented actors and there should not have been any doubt about their output. It is gritty than stylish, realistic than audience pleasing (except for the climax). Screenplay and character development are textbook and well executed. The pre-climax where Rooster pushes the horse to its limit is exhilarating and something I have never seen before. But the climax was totally off leaving all we have digested of Mattie's character down the drain. \n\nIf the climax is chopped off, it is a classic winner",

The use of scene and silence in this film shows the true loneliness and absolute obscurity that these characters live in, every scene seems unforced, as though we the viewer, have simply been dropped into this living, breathing world that has its own pace and tempo. Entire scenes seem to exist outside of the viewer, and even outside of the characters, as though we happened in on part of a much larger world, giving a very real sense of the life around them. The use of proper grammar takes what would have been nothing but pure dirt digging badassery, and turns it into a shakespearean play, the narrations flowing like beautiful poems, playing over images of the true west; unforgiving, hard, and quite gritty (as the name would imply). This is only further reinforced by the top tier performance of every actor in this film. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who is into Quentin Tarantino films, as many of the scenes are driven by speech. However, it certianly does not skimp on the action. This film still remains one of my favorite westerns",

            "content": "True Grit is directed and written by the Coen Brothers, and it stars Hailee Steinfeld, Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin in a western film about a teenager girl who's getting someone to help her capture Tom Chaney who killed her father. I rarely watch Westerns these days as they don't seem to make them in the present day. When seeing True Grit, I was excited to see it as its from the Coen Brothers, and as their first Western film, it's honestly one of the best Western films that I've seen. Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is terrific in it that I'm glad that she got accolades for it, even though it's odd that she got nominated for Best Supporting Actress as she's the main character here. Jeff Bridges is very intimidating when he needs to be, but can still get behind by being a likable guy. The minor characters are really good like the Bear guy, the bank guy, and some others. Matt Damon is good in it, which some people have problems with him like for the fact that he kind of sticks out like a sore thumb, and maybe he does, but the character that he plays, is from the Texas Rangers, so that makes sense why he probably seem out of place for some viewers that has issues with Matt Damon being in this movie. The action scenes were entertaining to watch, and the chemistry between Rooster and Mattie are interesting and it gives out some funny moments. The writing by the Coen Brothers is very well written, and the direction by them is very well done with some great shots of it. I heard that the ending is different from the original, and I think it's for the best because of what the main character's determination is. The Coen Brother's True Grit is a fantastic movie that has a good story, and memorable characters that make this remake once in a lifetime ordeal.",

When her father is murdered by a cowardly low life, 14 year old Maddie goes on the hunt for the man responsible, using her intelligence and determination to enlist the help of a US marshal and Texan ranger, to aid her cause. Its a wonderfully simple concept, crafted so expertly and built upon in so many ways, its truly engaging to witness. True Grit, comes straight out the gate wearing its tone firmly on its sleeves, its brilliant blend of humor and mature content, make it such a pleasure to watch, feeling invigorating and never as simple as it ultimately is. With a stellar cast in Bridges, Damon and Brolin, Hallie Steinfeld comes hurtling on screen with a performance that matches the Hollywood heavyweights. The script is dialogue heavy, with its use of eloquent language always prominent, however the young actor, never flinches or falters, delivering line after line flawlessly and expertly and crafting a performance that grips from start to finish. Each actor takes on their roles in such a brilliant fashion, all of them stand out with their own character traits, while managing to never outshine each other, its a brilliant piece of ensemble work that holds a strong script high. Visually the best cinematographer in town, Roger Deakins, yet again provides a flawless and breath taking vision of the wild west, his use of lighting is inventive and powerful and his ability to frame harrowing images, in such a unique and stand out fashion is beyond credit. True Grit paces itself perfectly, galloping along at a continual pace throughout, it introduces characters at exactly the right time, allows everyone room to flourish and revels in its performances and script writing stature. It looks glorious, it sounds glorious and it is presented in expert fashion. Maybe not as genre defining or daring as other westerns, True Grit takes a simple concept and executes it to perfection.",

Bridges character had a frustrating gargling voice that made him hard to understand and while seeing the purpose of his tone, it hurt the film.

Nothing big or exciting happens and the \"bad guys\" weren't so bad and did not put up a fight. My final and biggest complaint is Hailee Steinfeld. I disagree that she did a great job.

            "content": "I will start by saying that the Western genre is not a favourite of mine. Bar a few notable exceptions, they are not what I sit and wait for as I would the next superhero film. Films by the Coen brothers, however, are what I sit and wait for year round. So despite my initial surprise at their latest choice of subject, I waited eagerly for the film to arrive. First there was that inspired poster, then the captivating trailers, then finally it hit the theatres. And while the story is adapted from Charles Portis' novel, with already created characters and a very strict set of rules in terms of speech patterns, True Grit comes off feeling entirely original, fresh and, most importantly, unmistakably Coen.\u00a0\n\nWhen Mattie Ross' (Hailee Steinfeld) father is murdered by a man named Tom Chane (Josh Brolin) she embarks on a \"great adventure\" to track him down and avenge her papa's death. However, being only 14 years old, she decides to enlist some help in the form of Marshall Reuben 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges).\u00a0\n\nThe Coens have already proven themselves to be extremely adept at recreating existing stories to make films, whether it's real life stories like Fargo or books like No Country for Old Men, always with fantastic results. Here they have managed to wring out every single Coen-esque aspect from Portis' novel, whether it's a dentist in a bear suit or a man who speaks in animal sounds. At the same time, they also create indelible characters in Mattie and Rooster, she a stubborn 14 year old who witnesses first-hand the depraved violence and ruthlessness which man is capable of, he an old hand who is all but desensitized to everything that the world has to offer. The script is fantastic. Blending humour and drama is something that the Coen's have proved themselves in time and time again, and here is no different. And for those who thought that The Social Network was the only movie with some speedy dialogue, try throwing Old English into the mix.\u00a0\n\nThe actors have the hard task of living up to such a script, and they do so perfectly. Jeff Bridges is simply amazing as the mumbling Rooster, feeling no need to fill John Wayne's shoes, creating his own character and never once straying from it. He's larger than life and Bridges fills him with nuance. Whether he's telling his life story to pass the time or having a drunken shooting contest, he's great fun to watch. Matt Damon's LaBeouf, though not as likeable as Bridge's Rooster is also a fascinating character. His different way of doing things and annoying habit of, well, talking may not make him a favourite in anyone's eyes, but Damon plays him with sincerity and confidence, holding his own against Bridges at every turn. But the revelation here is the much talked about performance by Hailee Steinfeld. People may have heard enough about how fantastic she is by now, but she is simply amazing. She is able to capture the strength and fire of Mattie as well as her innocence and naivety, and cope with the script she's been dealt which is a feat in itself. Even better is the chemistry which all three of these characters find, especially the friendship between Rooster and Mattie as he recognises the fire and courage in her and she sees the soul in him. The supporting characters such as Tom Chane and Ned Pepper are not overlooked either, each of them fleshed out in a matter of minutes with a fantastic script.\u00a0\n\nWhat the Coen brothers have done, and what many other directors have tried to do, is completely reinvigorate the wild west by making it seem completely fresh while paying attention to the conventions of the genre itself, with help from an incredible cinematographer in Roger Deakins. And where else are you going to see Jeff Bridges with a revolver in each hand riding a horse with reins between his teeth?\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe climacitic\"One eyed fat man\" scene.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIt is rare for a film that was previously cherished to lose some of its affection, as usually I am the type who finds the beauty of those that was previously misunderstood. True Grit in my eyes before was a near perfect film, but I think I felt that way during the time because of my then limited knowledge of the Western genre and usually the first few films that one sees from the genre would become the reference point for all other films. Now in my second viewing, I was able to find certain flaws that were covered by its sweeping atmosphere and hard-edged characters, leaving me a bit underwhelmed as compared to the directors' greater films; No Country For Old Men and Fargo.\n\nIn a Coen brothers film, it is common to find well explored themes, some recurring, and it is these cinematic depths that allows their stories valuable and stand out. True Grit is not as thematically dense as the other films that I mentioned earlier, and because of this, I wasn't able to gain that sense of satisfaction from this tale of revenge and self-worth. I felt the film did not expose enough of the characters or the story for me to chew on long after the film has ended; once True Grit ended, so was my attention. Though, the film is not completely empty in its themes as obviously the ideas of revenge and justice are in display, along with moments that touches on the male ego and how that ultimately affects their purpose and values. But like I said, the film doesn't do enough with it for me to heavily contemplate on. I also had a problem with the film's primary antagonist Tom Chaney who did not come off as threatening as I expected him to be and his purpose towards the deeper aspects of the film felt underdeveloped.\n\nIn saying all these flaws, it may seem unreasonable for my score to be so generous, but this was one of the rare times where its superficial elements were strong enough for me to be swept away and produce a worthwhile experience. True, the film lacked the intelligence that was expected from a Coen brothers film but it makes up for it with an immersive atmosphere of its time period; dazzling me right down to the costumes and props. Roger Deakins, the film's director of photography captures the environment in such a natural way that at times I forget that it was a period piece. There have been a few Western films in recent years that match the scope and detail that True Grit has but none of them have completely wrapped me, as they always left me in awareness of the fact that I am viewing it from a screen. True Grit does not over-emphasise the elements of its genre, instead it uses it to shape the physical qualities of its characters; keeping our attention on them at all times. The film also features interesting and humorous dialogue, a trademark of the brothers, and through that it keeps its audience engaged, even during the quieter moments.\n\nThe cherry on top of True Grit's visual beauty is the gorgeous musical score by Carter Burwell, driven by the soft and tender sounds of his piano. It created a sense of sadness to the world that these characters are in, and possibly connected to the pitiful demons that lurk beneath its male individuals. It doesn't at all self-gratifying like a classic Western film and understands its intentions are on the characters, not beyond it.\n\nTrue Grit features fine performances from Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld, featuring wonderful chemistry, particularly during the earlier areas of the film. Bridges brings a similar feel to his character like the one in The Big Lebowski, but with a slurring lower register, and a much dirtier physical appearance. One can see Bridges is having fun here but stays committed to the role, ensuring that he is still taken seriously regardless of his sometimes comedic remarks. Steinfeld stood out due to her firm attitude and articulate speech; it allows her to create a sense of dominance towards her male companions, forcing us to see beyond her childlike physicality. Matt Damon is also a prominent cast member in this but I felt his character was not as outstanding, playing a man that is \"appropriate\" to the world around him. The same statement could go to Josh Brolin and his performance, delivering that is less satisfying to those playing the central protagonist; sometimes leaving me in a blank when retrospectively recalling his role in the film.\n\nTrue Grit could have been more ambitious in its themes and ideas but this flaw does not prevent the film from being an entertaining and immersive watch. Simply view this, sit back and let the visuals and music take you in a world that has long passed.",

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way.  Well...they didn't.  In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen.  Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything.  Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original.  In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed.  The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting.  Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes.  I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book.  That must mean the ending.  It is very different, and honestly, better than the original.  However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done.  The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film.  I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

I haven't seen the original film so I won't be comparing the two and just judge this as its own piece.  I haven't seen too many Coen brother movies, but the ones I have I've enjoyed.  I love No Country For Old Men.  In fact, it's one of my favorite films.  I like The Big Lebowski but I don't adore it like most people seem to.  I've also seen this film obviously and I'll say this is a really good one.  There will be minor spoilers so be warned.  \nThe story follows a teenager named Mattie Ross.  One night her father was killed.  Mattie seeks to track down his killer with the help of a U.S. marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and another lawman named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon).  \nThe characters are fun and quite interesting.  Besides Matt Damon's character these aren't your typical band of heroes in a western.  Mattie is very cold, intelligent, and very determined which is very rare in a child character in a film like this.  Back in the Wild West women didn't really go on manhunts or acted this way so it's probably not that realistic.  However, at least it's different, and it's much better than having your typical whiny kid around that's just here to get kidnapped, whine, or try to be funny.  She can get annoying at times with that attitude though which brought the film down a bit for me since she's the lead, but it doesn't ruin her character.  Plus, the actress, Hailee Steinfeld does a great job acting-wise.  \nRooster is an old drunk who's basically given-up on everything and just waists away.  He's a lost soul who cares nothing about his actions but does try to do the right thing on occasion.  He's not really heroic but still sympathetic enough as well as fun to watch.  I'm not a big Matt Damon fan but I think this is one of his better roles.  It's fun to see these characters interact as they go on their adventure.\nThe film looks beautiful as well.  The look of the Wild West and the countryside is just stunning.  The action scenes are pretty fun too though there aren't that many.  The music is fine.  It's nothing great but it gets the job done.  The acting is also on-point.  Everyone gives a great performance especially Jeff Bridges.    \nI especially love the ending.  This mainly because it's not an ending we typically see in these types of movies.  It's not a downer ending but it's not happy either.  It's years later and we see that Mattie's vengefulness has led to her feeling very lonely and empty.  We also find out that Rooster has died in a very sad way.  It wasn't an honorable death at all.\nOverall, True Grit is a great as a western and as a film in general.  The film looks, fantastic, has fun characters, has a stellar cast that gives great performances, and has a different but good ending.  No Country For Old Men is still my favorite Coen brothers movie so far, but this is a close second.",

With high octane fights and acting not too bad to say this is made up with lots of CGI, The producers of this film really don't do a bad job in getting it all together and one of them executive producers is none other than Steven Spielberg. \n\nThe film itself is a good length and although it made me feel slightly sleepy at times, it still conjures up good things. Hugh Jackman is OK as the main character Charlie and his son played by Dakota Goyo is actually well cast, as Goyo seems to fit well with the story and he could be a young actor to look out for in the future. Evangeline Lilly is charming as ever and although not at her full potential as an actor here, she still brings a certain air of calm headed coolness and seems a refreshingly different pace in the film.\n\nShawn Levy directs this and his eye is not immediately on point it can seem and parts can be a little, say dodgy with too much action in certain parts but then none at all for a good length of time. I felt the heavy metal score placed down on this film was not one that drew me into the fighting, it only caused me to want the fight to end but I can see for some that they would find it more exhilarating than me. It is written well and the two guys who do the screenplay(Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven) don't hurt the movie but don't provide any assistance to the already seen type of plot.\n\nThe effects are one thing that stand out in this movie and on reflection they are very nice and it's no wonder it got an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. It may seem or feel that the effects could over shadow the true feeling in the film but I felt any emotion the characters show is shown well enough through all the big budget stuff. It's not over dramatic storytelling(although the ending without spoiling is well, cheesy cheesy and more cheese), you'll notice if you see how the movie starts slow but really picks up a pace and although not rushing into it's ending, seems to want to finish without a bang.\n\nMy review may seem as if I did not enjoy this, or maybe even like I liked this much more than I did but in truth I found it kind of OK and although not quite Good, still acceptable in the vast CGI action movie catalogue, that seems to get bigger every year. I gave it a C- and that may seem harsh and I know for sure that some people will read this and completely disagree with what I have been saying but you have to like action to like this, not just Sci-Fi story telling, you have to like straight all out fighting. \n\nThe film has true heart there is no doubt, one last thing I want to say about this is that you can feel for those involved and Hugh Jackman although maybe not at his absolute best, still draws you in. Give it a go even if you don't enjoy all out action because it may just surprise you how much you actually liked it, not easy to like but possible and it is wrong to say only a certain demographic would enjoy this.",

Damon plays his best character yet and is equally as unforgettable. Brolin, while not in the film for long is less than at his best. However Pepper is excellent as Lucky Ned.

            "content": "\"People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood. But it did happen.\"\n\nTrue Grit is a flawed yet highly entertaining piece of cinema, written and directed by the impressive hands of Ethan and Joel Coen. It's a Western with a straight-forwardness which will confuse many; it doesn't seek to provide much commentary or cyncism. It wishes to tell its story with its heartfelt poignancy and character-centric pacing. Whilst uneven in the way that it drifts between sequences, it is undeniably affecting and well-paced, and is perhaps one of the strongest Coen brothers films in terms of sheer acting prowess. This is a film which is certainly worthy of acclaim, but one must be prepared to accept it's multitude of issues.\n\nTrue Grit centres around Maddie; a young 14 year old girl, played by Hailee Steinfeld, whose father has recently been killed by a man known as Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Utilizing the help of a drunkard U.S Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and a Texan Ranger (Matt Damon) named LaBoeuf, Maddie treks across the Wild West, seeking revenge against the man who murdered her father.\n\nA simple but heartfelt story is what makes True Grit ultimately so undeniably satisfying but overtly saddening and potent. It's a brilliantly acted, well shot picture, that captures the heart and soul of the Wild West, and completely immerses the viewer in the landscape and rugged terrain. The fantastic performances from Bridges and Steinfeld primarily are what allow the audience member to become engrossed in their plights, both of them aptly fitting into their roles. The writing, also from the Coen brothers, isn't particularly impressive, but does get possibly the most important factor of the film pitch-perfect, and that is the relationship between the quick-witted and highly intelligent Maddie, and the loathsome, tough and rough Cogburn, who quickly form a bond between them that is instantaneously relatable and likable. This emotional connection they form resonates most towards the conclusion, when certain events render their friendship vital to each others survival; the Coen brothers layer on the sentiment and get the viewer suitably transfixed by these characters, before delivering multiple emotional gut-punches towards the closing moments of the picture.\n\nThe usual comedy from the Coen brothers is not lost, the film engaging in numerous hilarious situations which garner praise from myself. Unfortunately, the film does sport numerous faults in terms of its pacing, and also possesses an irritating and lacking score from Carter Burwell which contains little more than a primary theme that is repeated constantly for the duration of the picture (a primary theme which doesn't seem to suit many of the scenes in which it is implemented within). The film seems to jump from one sequence to the next, and lacks substance in-between. Whilst you do become connected with the two protagonists, the film is too intent on letting the main events play out, and it doesn't feel as if there is any down time in between.\n\nNevertheless, True Grit is a competent film; it doesn't do much, or leave a huge impression on the viewer. It has numerous faults, and lacks strength in its plot and pacing; but what it lacks in these areas it makes up for in character and sheer dialogue alone. The action scenes are often slightly anti-climatic but nevertheless thrilling; the locations are stunning; the cinematography fantastic. It's a strong, adequate film that will undoubtedly keep many a viewer entertained.\n\n\"That didn't pan out.\"",

Back in 1969 there was film of this story which is based on this very novel which means this is a remake and i hate remakes. But in this modern time with all the great technology they decided to remake this anyway. Since they cut off a few scenes that were from the original it was very disappointing but they had some funny quotes and some blood which did make the film seem a little better. If they had stuck with the same scenes as last time and had those funny quotes and blood that would have been more satisfying. Director siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have made yet another modern classic with True Grit, the best Western since Unforgiven. The Coens' film is based more on the Charles Portis novel than on the 1969 screen adaptation of True Grit, which won John Wayne the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe story follows Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld), a fourteen-year-old girl out to avenge her father's muder by tracking down his killer, cowardly outlaw Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Chaney has fled into the Indian Territory, a lawless region where desperadoes believe they can hide from the law. Shrewdly regaining money owed to her father, Mattie quickly establishes herself as a force to be reckoned with despite her youth.\n\nShe hires a hard-drinking mankiller of a U.S. Marshal named Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges, the Dude succeeding the Duke), to help her hunt down Chaney. But another man is also after Chaney, a proud Texas Ranger with a penchant for bragging named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). Rooster and LaBoeuf join forces to find and capture Chaney, with the implacable Mattie proving her own true grit by going along with them on their dangerous journey.\n\n\nMore True Grit Videos\n\n\nJust when you thought the Coens had made their career best with the neo-Western No Country for Old Men they make this gem. True Grit is one of the top films of 2010, and can now be added to the ranks of Best Picture Oscar front runners such as Inception, The Social Network, The King's Speech and 127 Hours.\n\nBeautifully directed by the Coens and strikingly shot by Roger Deakins, True Grit boasts a fantastic script (also by the Coens) which, like Deadwood, isn't afraid to have its characters speak in language that is both familiarly twangy to fans of the genre and almost Shakespearean in its formality and strangeness to the modern ear. And no cast member is saddled with more of that challenging dialogue (or nails it better) than Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nSteinfeld is a revelation here. Not since Ellen Page burst onto the scene in Hard Candy has a young actress made such a smashing debut. Steinfeld simply owns the screen from her very first scene, fast establishing herself as a commanding presence to both the other characters and the viewer. She is smart, tough, vulnerable, funny and has range. It will be very intriguing to see where Steinfeld goes from here professionally as she'll most likely earn an Oscar nomination for her performance.\n\n\n- Paramount\n\nJeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld star in True Grit.\n\nSteinfeld has plenty of high-caliber veterans to play off of here, all of whom are great as well. Bridges is equally riveting as Cogburn, who is almost as self-abusive, funny and lazy as The Dude, but with a fearlessness and violent streak. Colin Firth will have some serious competition in this year's Best Actor race from Bridges, who could likely win his second one in as many years (a win that would be ironic and touching given that Wayne also won for playing Rooster). Bridges is fully his own Old West badass here, with no cute winks or nods to The Duke in his grizzled portrayal.\n\nMatt Damon finds the humor in LaBoeuf (pronounced \"LaBeef\" and not like the Transformers actor), a man so proud of being a Texas Ranger that he'll gladly remind people of it at every opportunity. But he's also a fiercely determined lawman in his own right, proving as able (if not more so) than the inebriated, sketchy Rooster. (I have to wonder if Damon's Texas accent and portrayal of the vain LaBoeuf isn't a nod to his very accurate imitation of Matthew McConaughey.)\n\n\n- Paramount\n\nClick for more images from True Grit.\n\nBrolin is certainly better served in this Western than he was in Jonah Hex, and finds both the humor and repellent qualities in his weasely bandit. Barry Pepper (almost unrecognizable behind disfiguring makeup) plays a small but compelling role as outlaw leader Lucky Ned Pepper, the boss of the gang Chaney has fallen in with. Ned has a sense of frontier honor about him, something Chaney most certainly does not. Although Robert Duvall played the role in the original film, Pepper is almost reminiscent at times here of the great character actor Harry Dean Stanton.\n\nMy only nitpick about True Grit -- seriously, a nitpick -- is the awkward and very phony-looking visual effect background that's used during a climactic nighttime horse ride that Rooster and Mattie make. It's the film's one false note, the only thing that pulls you out of this otherwise immaculately recreated period and reminds you that you're watching a movie. Otherwise, True Grit -- with its stellar writing, direction, performances, cinematography, and score by Carter Burwell -- is truly great. This is why i GIVE TRUE GRIT a 4.5 out of 5",

I've also come to the realization that Matt Damon can carry off just about any role he wants (although that spanking scene made me uncomfortable) On that note I imagine PETA was fairly involved here -jeez that last scene with the horse!  10.13\n\n\"Coen brothers remake of John Wayne classic; an alcoholic US marshal (Jeff Bridges) and an independent minded 14 yr old girl track down her fathers killer with the help of a Texas ranger (Matt Damon)\"",

Joel and Ethan Coen go down a different path from their unique storytelling and take on a Western, one which John Wayne occupied in the original outing. The Coens take a very toned down approach to what we are accustomed to see in their films, but they still have an eccentric tone to the film when the dialogue comes into place. Hailee Steinfield delivers a confident and mature performance as Mattie Ross, a young girl travelling away from home to see justice take place after a ruthless man murders her father, she is a well read and surely individual, wanting the help of the local bounty hunter, Rooster Cogburn, played with grit and hardened experience by Jeff Bridges, who begrudgingly agrees to help this 14 year old girl track down Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who committed the murder.\rCogburn is a battle-hardned individual who doesn't care much for the consequences of his actions, he's getting old and doesn't care much for anything anymore, much to the dismay of LaBoeuf, a young ranger who enjoys bragging about his achievements in the wild. The three set out on a long and tiring journey in search of the criminal, facing various obstacles which most of the time is each other. The film has the polished touch of a Coen piece, it has strong accents, eccentric dialogue and exceptionally memorable characters throughout, creating a standalone film that shouldn't really be seen as anything other than a retelling.\rCogburn seemingly takes the place of the father the way the story unfolds, teaching Mattie about the ways of the wild and the decisions he has made, this film is very much about these two individuals, how their characters develop and how they react in each others company, but its also a very good Western through and through, combining the slow paced and character driven moments seen in many of the greats, but also a shoot em' up adventure that never fails to entertain.\rIt certainly has a different touch than the typical Coen picture, but it still brims with excitement, unpredictably and heart, but it also stays true to the classic Westerns of yesteryear to deliver a nostalgic plot with a modern kick to make this an entertaining film fromstart to finish.",

The Coens combine their original and witty dialogue with incredible performances by top notch actors to create a film thats so engrossing that you're taken on a ride back in time with true outlaws. The plot centers on Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father was shot and killed by a loner named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who also made off with the father's 2 gold pieces. Mattie is determined at all costs to find her father's killer, and hires U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to do the job. A Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon) arrives on the scene already hot on Chaney's trail over a murder he committed in Texas. The trio set off together in hopes of finding Tom Chaney before anyone else does. The plot delves in deeper than that of course, and it emerges as a true Western flick that actually works. While it doesn't involved all that heavily on action (minus a few great scenes), it's involved mostly on the characters and the experiences that they must face. With the Coen's classic dialogue (equivalent to Fargo) the slower paced scenes are genuinely enjoyable because the most random of conversations will occur and the outcome is either hilarious or heartwarming. Jeff Bridges is flawless and Oscar worthy portraying a Rooster Cogburn so exceptionally well that he completely overshadows John Wayne's portrayal multiple times over. Matt Damon is unrecognizable at first as a desperate Ranger though his times on the big screen are enjoyable especially the many quarrels with Bridges such as arguments on who is the better shot. Hailee Steinfeld is completely flawless as well. Her portrayal of a headstrong 14 year old determined to track one man down is so spot on that I actually tricked myself into thinking I was watching an adult in the same role. The supporting roles of Josh Brolin and Berry Pepper were great as always, although their screen time was dwindled down to only a small percentage, but both of their roles are great. The many different camera angles the Coens use really outlay a vast and open landscape to the many different types of crimes committed there. The pacing is slick and perfect. The many action scenes are great and house outstanding shootouts and they aren't as heavy on the violence as the earlier Coen brothers films. In between the few key action scenes, there are the funny and enjoyable dialogue moments that keep the momentum in place and this style never falls flat. All in all True Grit really delivers a stellar experience that zooms through quick from beginning to end thanks in part to the great action scenes, and the truly flawless characters and dialogue. If you're in to look for a great Western film, this is the one true and great modern experience.",

But after watching this movie, I feel like the enlightened one in a sea of gullible moviegoers! Can anyone else appreciate just how TERRIBLE this movie was? First: the script plays on screen like it was written by a school child. Sure, there's some witty one-liners and laugh-inducing reparte now and then, but in the context of a (supposedly) serious film, these parts of the dialogue transpire with the feel of a cheap David Spade movie... (not that there's anything wrong with David Spade movies, it just doesn't belong here). Second: certain scenes of this move are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE, and do nothing in the way of character development or plot advancement! The man in the tree who Rooster Cogburn \"does not know\"... The painfully awkward, random meeting with the medicine man in the bearskin... the inane, often incomprehensible ramblings of Cogburn... the lame-ass cornbread shooting contest... Do you need another four WORTHLESS scenes from this film? I'd be happy to list them. Third: I think it would be fair to say that this movie *attempts* to portray a special bond between Cogburn and the little girl, Mattie Ross. To steal a line from today's youth: EPIC FAIL. Jeff Bridges is a (usually) great actor, and Hailee Steinfeld seems like a wonderful young actress. But taken together, these two have the chemistry of oil and water... Summary thoughts: This movie is boring, hamstrung by hollywood cliches, rather poorly acted, INCREDIBLY poorly written, has a very uninspiring \"gotcha, bad guy!\" moment, and perhaps shouldn't have even been (re)made in the first place. The 2 points I have awarded are for the (surely unintentional) entertainment value derived from the aforementioned campy one-liners, and overdone, humor-inducing melodrama... Enjoy, but probably if you're over 70.",

True Grit is about the attempt to be heroic in the face of the realities ofThe Coen Brothers are American and this movie speaks to the culture and value of our country.  They are at the peak of their game and have been for quite a while.  True Grit is about the attempt to be heroic in the face of the realities of life, that is, filled with violence, randomness, personal failings and our questionable chances to control what happens to us.  There are potential traps with this story: if the girl is precious the movie can veer towards sentimentality and life is anything but sentimental.  Each of the characters show the balance that exists in people.  Rooster Cogburn is not heroic in most senses of the word.  He admits that he was a terrible father, he kicks the Indian kids off of the porch, he sets up a plan to help the girl while he pursues his money by attempting to catch the leader villain.  The Texas ranger is quite simply a doofus, and yet miraculously makes the shot with the rifle.  He doesn't re-enter the story.  Finally, the girl devotes her childish mind to revenge, which we should know, offers no reward but ashes.  She finishes as a one armed spinster, she is not cute and she finds solace only in her grit.  For me, I am old enough not to expect perfect heroic people or even a chance to act nobly in many situations, but the film shows perhaps what is the best that we can do.  Finally, the cinematography, much like Fargo or No Country for Old Men, shows the open spaces in a way that immerses the audience and reminds us of the beauty, the physical beauty, of America.  Most seriously considered art deals with the challenges that life presents us with, what to do with our lives, and as an American, I feel uplifted and excited each time I see the Coen Brothers attempt to illustrate the issue with a new filter, whether it be set in very un-Hollywood locations as Texas, Arkansas, Minnesota or North Dakota.  My son suggested that for the United States, the art form that is ours the most (apart of course from Rock and Roll) is film and that the brothers are our true geniuses of that art form.",

If you are expecting the eccentric storytelling and essential rawness seen inUnderneath the drawn out tension of the Coen's Brothers remake True Grit, is a subtle and lighthearted emotion led by the break out performance of Hailee Steinfeld. If you are expecting the eccentric storytelling and essential rawness seen in Fargo or No Country For Old Men, True Grit is ultimately uninspiring. But in this effort, the Coen brothers smooth out their usual sharp edges, in order to make a film that is pure and an effective homage to a once prominent genre in film.True Grit as stated earlier, is a remake of John Hathaway's 1969 film starring John Wayne, which led to the legendary actor's only Oscar. After her father's death, we follow Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) , a precocious 14-year old who seeks retribution on the murderer John Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie decides to hire U.S Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) because of his merciless manner in dealing with the law. At the beginning of the hunt, Cogburn decides to team up with Texas Ranger LeBeouf (Matt Damon) in this often humorous and gritty journey.While Bridges and Damon both put on respectable performances-with Bridges putting on a different twist to Wayne's character- it is newcomer Hailee Steinfeld who steals the show. Steinfeld's puts intensity and zeal into her character that emphasizes her independence and her presumptuous manner. The Coen brothers put more focus into Steinfeld's character rather than Bridge's Cogburn.  I find this a wise decision as the film is able to blend an affable feeling with the somewhat dark humor reminiscent in Barton Fink or Fargo. While True Grit provides great performances, it is not the action adventure that its advertisements imply that it is.  Rather, the film is extremely talky, which is one of the few film techniques similar to the Coens' previous efforts. This is not necessarily a bad aspect, as most of the lines are derived from the Charles Portis novel that the film is adapting.  In other words, the dialogue still remains humorous and intriguing, but it lacks the action and zest of a contemporary Western. As a result, there is a whole lot of drawn out tension that is only somewhat released by the end. Overall, True Grit is visually beautiful and packs a punch in great acting. But as I have to emphasize again, the film is essentially a disappointing Coen film, but is a solid remake to a classic film.",

True Grit is about a drunken US Marshal and a **** Texas Ranger helping a stubborn 14 year-old finding her father's murderer. Rooster (Jeff Bridges) was offered $50 to find the murderer for Mattie, played by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. Meanwhile, Texas Ranger Le Boeuf (Matt Damon) was offered a reward to find the same guy who also killed a Senator. Conflicting each other on the journey and finally catching the bad guy Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the three each developed their character skillfully. Jeff Bridges playing last year Crazy Heart's Bad Blake only with a gun and an eyepatch. Matt Damon used his own personal style to play this **** but humorous Texas Ranger. Hailee Steinfeld played a stubborn 14 year-old who's determined to find Tom Chaney and bring him to hang. Though expected performances from both Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, newcomer Hailee Stenfeld was as good as her castmates. The one thing I kept in mind while going in this film was that Bridges and Damon are going to give applausable performances and Hailee Steinfeld was getting nominated for some major awards. But when I was finished, I didn't see what all the buzz was about. Sure, Steinfield was good, but compared to Bridges and Damon, she sure didn't have much. I have to say though, beating thousands of other girls for this role is impressive, but I'm sure other Hollywood stars had to do that as well. Even though I find her not as great as I hoped, she still delivered well.\rThe directors are the two and only Coen Brothers. With ten Oscar nominations and four wins for each Joel and Ethan Coen, they are Hollywood's most wanted in directing dark Western dramas. Well known for their lastest work \"A Serious Man\" and \"No Country For Old Men', True Grit is another fine addition to their long and impressive resume. Directed with true grit and impressive performances, True Grit outsmarts the original and simply entertaining.\rOscarBuzz: Best Picture (good chance), Best Director (good chance), Best Actor (Jeff Bridges, better chance), Best Supporting Actor (Matt Damon, a chance at a nod), Best Supporting Actress (Hailee Steinfeld, a chance at a nod), Best Adapted Screenplay (Coen Brothers, better chance)",

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way.  Well...they didn't.  In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen.  Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything.  Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original.  In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed.  The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting.  Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes.  I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book.  That must mean the ending.  It is very different, and honestly, better than the original.  However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done.  The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film.  I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThe original \"True Grit\", directed by Henry Hathaway, and starring, no less than \"The Duke\" himself, made its initial theatrical run in 1969, just two years after Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" blew away the production code. Once Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway went down spasmodically in a hail of gunfire, that was that, and there would be blood forevermore. No more smuggling. The days of \"beating around the bush\" were over. No more fade to black. You could \"hump the hostess\". In Elia Kazan's \"Baby Doll\", released in 1956, smack dab in the middle of a sexually repressed era, the handcuffed filmmaker somehow managed to adapt \"27 Wagons Full of Cotton\", the Tennessee Williams play that depicted a middle-aged man's eroticization of his underage wife, without getting arrested on indecency charges. While neither Archie Lee(Karl Malden) nor Silva(Eli Wallach) get anywhere near first base with the titular character(Carroll Baker) in the official narrative, the first generation Italian does have implied sex with her, twice, suggested by a phallic symbol in one instance, and the cotton baron's dry humping performance(while mounted on her hobby horse) in another. Whereas \"Baby Doll\" predictably focuses on the man's needs, and likewise, in the John Wayne vehicle, LaBoeuf's libido is on display when he expresses his wish to kiss Mattie Ross(Kim Darby), this seemingly square western, with the utmost subtlety, delves into the fourteen-year-old girl's growing pains, in which her crush on the Texas Ranger runs deeper than the stealing glances she aims his way at the boarding house dinner table. When LaBoeuf inquires Mattie about her name, the young girl excuses herself from his company and adjourns to bed. Away from the menfolk, the recently bereaved girl and the boarding house owner gab about the strapping young lad, both agreeing, do the smitten pair, that the federal marshal is handsome. Before the lights are turned out, the girl cries, the waterworks being attributed to her slain father, no doubt, but also, perhaps, out of guilt, for feeling the first pangs of lust. Suggested by the snake pit she later falls into, in all likelihood, Mattie touched herself. There's a sin involved, but it can't be murder, since Cheney(Jeff Corey) is still breathing after the recoil due to Mattie's firing, which only grazes his head, so the snake bite that the girl endures must correspond to some earlier transgression. (Rooster Cogburn kills Cheney. John Wayne has to be the hero, even a deeply flawed one.) In the remake, Mattie pays for the self-induced orgasm with her hand. Seen as an adult, the moviegoer can't help but perceive Mattie's missing appendage as a scarlet limb. Unlike the original, it's Cogburn(Jeff Bridges) whom Mattie(Hailee Steinfeld) admires, initially anyways, as indicated by her divulgence to LaBoeuf(Matt Damon) that she had chosen the wrong man. Bridges' rendering of the one-eyed marshal contains none of the inappropriate feelings that may have stirred in his predecessor's heart. As Mattie bandages the Texas Ranger's hand at the McAllister homestead, Cogburn appears miffed by her charity. Why? Does he have sex on his mind? Maybe. Because Darby was twenty-two at the time, to a certain extent, \"True Grit\" could get away with its pedophilic undertones. Conversely, Steinfeld is age-appropriate, so when Damon repeats Campbell's line about stealing kisses, he comes across more strongly as a child molester. The filmmaker leaves out Wayne's original comment about LaBoeuf  \"enjoying it too much\"; the Texan's spanking of Mattie's behind, probably out of fear that the hunting party would resemble some sort of unseemly threesome, a malodorous \"Jules & Jim\" playing wet nurse to a lolita. Ultimately, the most striking feature about this otherwise well-dressed mounting of the ultimate John Wayne experience(\"The Searchers\" was John Ford's bag) is its political incorrectness, or rather, the arch self-awareness that many westerns were shameless in their depiction of Native Americans. Right away, \"True Grit\" announces itself as the anti-\"Dances with Wolves\", in which an Indian's speech is cut-off by the executioner's hooding of the tribesman, disturbingly enough, to comic effect, just before he dangles at the public hanging. Later, at the site of an abandoned house, the liquored up law officer kicks two small \"red-skinned\" children off from the structure's wooden foundation without any protestation from his female companion. (Mattie names her horse Blackie in front of a \"Negro\" stable-boy.) In another sense, Mattie loses her fingers because she didn't lift a single finger to stop the needless cruelty of those innocents.",

All I know is that I was highly entertained (something that movies haven't done for me in a while, recently). Being a western, I expected gun fights, horse-riding, booze drinking, outlaws vs. marshals, etc; and this movie delivered that, and more. Hailee Steinfeld plays a very smart and determined young girl that will not stop until her father's murder is brought to justice. She hires an old, beat-up, drunkard of a marshal that manages to find ways to bring men to justice, that few can do (though his methods are questionable, often unorthodox, impromptu, and frequently lead to someone getting hurt or injured.) Matt Damon's character is a Texas Ranger that's come to Arkansas (the setting of the movie) to hunt down the same criminal that killed ms. Steinfeld's father for a different crime that occurred in Texas. These actions bring the three together in a terrific story that manages to be traditional, yet hold a lot of its own originality at the same time.In true coen-brother-fashion, the comedy was engaging and hilarious. Matt Damon stays true to his lack of speaking roles (which is a plus). But the one who steals the show, is Jeff Bridges. His role is played exceptionally well, and he manages to find a way to bring laughter to the audience, even in the most tense and action-packed scenes. His banter between the young girl, as well as Matt Damon's character makes for very classic scenes that will resonate with me for a long while. I found this movie thoroughly entertaining, hilarious, dramatic, meaningful, and action-packed all at once. Very few movies (especially those that have come out recently) can pull that off. If you enjoy being entertained (and who doesn't?) then I highly recommend this movie. True Grit will be a must-have purchase by me upon it's release to blu-ray.",

This version changed just as much, if not more than the original did.  I understand that the book is narrated through Mattie's eyes but they left out so much of what made the book so great that it was almost a different story.  Too many characters spoke lines in the movie that other characters in the book had actually spoken. Parts of the movie were out of order and the role of Rooster Cogburn himself was literally relegated to second fiddle.This movie gets a 6 because it was a decent western.

We don't see Mattie Ross start out naive and powerless and grow stronger on her journey. She's intelligent, driven, and capable from the beginning. Rooster Cogburn never really loses his wild, do-as-I-please attitude, nor does LaBoeuf really lose his arrogant superiority. instead the movie shows what I think is a more realistic depiction of a cowboy/western adventure. Yes, it was paced slow. Yes, there were scenes where they are just babbling or doing nothing. Yes, it lacks the theatrics and (overdone) aesthetics of recent movies. But I don't imagine a western journey being fast - paced, easy or pleasurable, or very exciting. Why were there boring and slow scenes? That's all they could do while they traveled. In terms of the acting, I think Matt Damon was miscast - not a terrible job on his part, but it was lacking in believability. He does the accent pretty well, but he's just not a cowboy. Hallie Steinfeld was great - the maturity and stubbornness was spot on. But Jeff Bridges was my favorite portrayal. I thought he was perfect for the role. He pulled off a messy, throaty, alcoholic marshall with a bit of a spark, and had some of my favorite one-liners. Overall I enjoyed the movie and it had a decent message and a dramatic finish.

We enjoyed it, and when I say enjoy it I don't mean we thought it was extremely good, we just enjoyed it. The acting was the biggest highlight of this movie by far. With absolutely exceptional performances by Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld. The group of these four amazing actors in my opinion is what made the film.However a good film does not come without its flaws, and in this case, this movies biggest major flaw was the slow progression of the storyline, the dull setting (It felt like it was just a dusty desert town, nothing really that drew me into the scenery. Hailee did an amazing job in her breakout role, that's the main thing I noticed, she seemed like she was an absolute natural. Continuing, as the story continued onward, I was noticing that the film was trying to draw us to the characters, make us relate to them, however it was not the cinematography that brought me closer to the characters, it was the acting of the characters themselves. However I felt at the same time that the characters themselves were undeveloped.As for action... Well It seems as if the Coen Brothers tried a little too hard on story rather than actually having qualities that would keep people interested, because the story seemed to be strained in all cases, making it hard to watch this in the way that I personally thought the Coen Brothers wanted us to watch the film like.All in all it was a pretty good movie, I congratulate the Coen Brothers on making a movie with this much promise and nearly living up to the expectations (acting was amazing, story.... not so much).Final Rating: 7.2/10Closing Words:If you want to see amazing acting and follow the characters of this movie, go see it, if your looking for an action packed wild west gunfight cowboy brawl, this isn't for you.If you would like more reviews like this, please sign up at http://gamerspurgatory.darkbb.com, contact me (my username is DarkZX on there as well) and say which movie/video game/music album you would like me to review.",

I have watched almost all of his movies, with this being one of my favorites. I was a little nervous on how Jeff Bridges was going to do in regards to taking on John Wayne's previous role and surprisingly, I thought he did a pretty good job. As a whole, I thought all of the acting was well done and particularly thought Hailee Steinfeld did an excellent job with portraying the role of Mattie Ross. I also thought some scenes were better than the original, like the scene where Rooster is trying to squeeze the information out of the two men in the cabin and one guy chops the other guys fingers off and stabs him in the heart and Rooster blows that guy's head off. I thought that seen kept the suspense moving and really moved the audience. However, I thought the first half of the movie really didn't build up the story at all and the fact that an hour of the movie took place in the town, I felt like that made the second half of the movie (the action scenes) feel rushed and we, the audience, didn't get the feeling of evil that is supposed to be portrayed through the rival gang of cowboys. The other thing that I felt really hurt the movie was the focus that was on how Rooster is a drunk. There was probably 3 different scenes that was focusing on how he's a drunk and I felt like that really hurt the plot. Overall, I thought the movie was good but most definitely not as good as the original. Hats off to you John Wayne...",

This is my favorite film of the year, other than perhaps \"Toy Story 3\". Everyone involved here has risen to the challenge. Having just viewed the original John Wayne version, this one is far superior in almost every way, starting with the sharp, witty script, which often prompts the viewer to ponder over the sometimes antiquated, but always revealing turns-of-phrases. Perhaps this is why some viewers have suggested the film is too talky and slow. In fact, much of the film's action takes place in the dialogue between the characters, rather than merely in the form of physical action. The performances, as noted by all the reviews, are uniformly memorable, but Jeff Bridges is truly great here. The cinematography is beautiful in a stark and haunting way, and the score, by the Cohen Bros. consistent collaborator Carter Burwell, is stirring. The characters here, unlike most westerns, have shades of gray, and all but the most vile of them retain a sense of humanity. This is probably the most emotionally effecting, and also one of the wittiest westerns I've ever seen.",

With the  often brilliant Coen brothers at the helm, Steven Spielberg producing and Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon starring, this film promised to be the exception---especially if you read the critics.  I don't know what film they thought they saw, but the one I saw was decidedly not the exception that proves the rule.  Gritty it was, but truly entertaining, engrossing and exciting it decidedly was not.  Jeff Bridges was a cross between Wallace Beery and Lee Marvin's \"Kid Sheleen\"---in either case his unintelligible dialogue needed subtitles. Matt Damon's bland performance almost had one longing for the original's Glen Campbell.    A disappointing dud.",

Joel and Ethan Coen have once again produced a visceral film, with moments of intensity (particular with the indoor scenes) and characters that are unforgettable (like that instant when the narrator is left behind with her father's killer). But there are moments that really concern you, and you wonder who it is that you're supposed to care about most. And, as a result, the film falls flat - its feels incomplete and without heart, despite the amazing quality of everything that went into its production. Would I recommend it? Absolutely - but only in the hopes that you discover what is there that I didn't see.Admittedly, I think the best story was that told by Jeff Bridges' character. If only his was the main reason to watch the film. Haillie Steinfeld - well casted and well acted - doesn't quite fill the needs of a protagonist. You don't notice anything change in her... you don't feel anything change in her. At the end you wonder why it is that you've just watched the film - because Jeff Bridges' character would've been the best protagonist to make the film have a purpose.As it stands it doesn't provide anything other than a story that doesn't make you feel. And that is not a good thing - even when you consider Joel and Ethan Coen's hard-style of directing and lack of interest in \"feelings\" in the past they have always managed to produce something more magical than this...",

This movie has a well supported cast, its the ONLY thing the movie has tho. Its well acted, the sights/sounds/horses/scenery is all fine but I just found the movie boring and somewhat just rambled on without much action, they could have done wayyy more with this and I have to say my expectations were somewhat high for this when I seen the trailers for it, but I have to say they make the movie far better then it is by those trailers...not bad but not the best remake of a western by far, 6/10 for me for just didnt keep me entertained throughout, didnt keep me wanting to watch it.",
