            "content": "I saw this with my family in a theatre. Superb film.\nFound the movie to b a bit drag at times. No overacting by Srk this time. I ain't no fan of Srk but in this movie he was decent. He got into the character this time. Kajol was good. The flood scenes were a bit cheesy n unnecessary. Nonetheless a decent watch. It deals with racism, loss, stigma about a particular community, communal hatred, hope, perseverance.\nIf you want your life to be rocked go see it. A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than \"copycat BARFI\" and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.",

            "review_title": "Mr. and Mrs. Khan",
            "content": "My Name Is Khan is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date - powerful, moving and involving. Johar, not a particularly good director, seems to have learnt a lot from the feedback he must have got for his previous films. At times it was difficult to believe it was actually directed by Johar and written by Shibani Bathija, who finally proves considerable talent as a writer. The film is thoroughly entertaining and the evident attention Johar paid to the smallest of details is commendable. The film does get sentimental at places, but it never goes over-the-top like Johar's other films and remains fairly restrained and completely authentic, which makes the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is traditionally a love story more than anything else, but the ever relevant message behind it is wonderfully conveyed through such terms as innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, love and hate. All these contrasting terms intelligently swap places through the story of innocent civilians accused for no fault of their own post the 9/11 attacks. The result of this tragic incident made the lives of so many of them miserable. This part of the film is unpleasant viewing even though it is one-sided and not entirely credible.That's where our hero, Rizwan Khan, is thrown. He has Asperger's Syndrome, he's different, he's naive, he takes every word literally, but he is intelligent and talented, and his perception of life is as his beloved mother taught him: the world includes only two groups of people - good people who do good and bad people who do bad. This is so overly general yet so very true. The memory of his mother follows him always, and it's easy to see why. The portrayal of Rizwan's childhood is wonderful. His relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a young and vibrant single mother who works as a hairdresser and who ultimately agrees to marry him, is totally charming.The narrative style is exemplary. The serious proceedings are flavoured with humour, romance and some wonderful songs. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy create another magical soundtrack and give life to the film with such tracks as \"Sajda\", \"Noor-E-Khuda\" and \"Tera Naina Re\". The fact that songs are playing only over montage sequences letting the actors no chance to lip-sync in a true Hindi film style, is appreciable but I, for one, at points really missed the glamorous and colourful numbers from mainstream films, the more so as it stars Shahrukh Khan and Kajol after so many years.The film clearly works better in the first half. It is much simpler, lighter and more enjoyable. The later half introduces the post-9/11 America with all of its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is quite flawed though as a film it works. From one side we have Rizwan who goes to tell the world of his complete innocence and his not being a terrorist, and from the other we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice post a very tragic incident of which she blames Khan himself. Sadly most American characters are portrayed as stereotypes, especially the teenagers, although it's forgivable within the context of the film.Khan's journey in the US is enjoyable. It unfolds in several episodes, each one presenting the different people he meets on his way, all quite caricaturish: a motel owner named Jitesh, a lovely Muslim couple who offer him some food, a group of Islamists led by Faisal Rahman whom Khan reports to FBI in order to destroy their violent plans. The most memorable episode, however, is that of Mama Jenny and her son 'Funny Hair' Joel from the rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is incredibly heart-touching despite being stereotypical to the core. The story of Mamma Jenny is moving, and Johar captures the spirit of the village and its people with skill. The gospel choir in the church singing \"We Shall Overcome\" is one of my favourite scenes in the film.Well, there comes the acting. Shahrukh Khan's appearance in this film in this kind of a role has been the subject of much attention, and rightfully so. This is clearly one of his most challenging roles. He is really good. It's amazing to see him transform from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and play it with conviction. His mannerisms, body language, tone, dialogue delivery and his occasional breaks into timid and embarrassed laughs are all spot on and make his character extremely likable and endearing. This is not his best performance, but it's interesting and more than anything, he still manages to be a star, which is a good thing.As expected, he is totally matched if not surpassed by Kajol, whose charismatic nature, easy charm, evident experience and strong screen presence all rally here into one heartbreaking performance that is replete with authenticity, maturity and strength. As Mandira, she looks incredibly beautiful and is as natural, intense and compelling as ever, playing the part with passion and depth and infusing it with energy and warmth. In some moments she outdoes herself. No, I'm not only referring to her powerful breakdown scenes (which are great), but also the many scenes showing her interaction with Khan. Note for instance the one in which she promptly decides to accept his earnest proposal. It's one of their best moments together.Johar selected a great supporting cast. Every actor, no matter how lengthy his character is, performs well. Zarina Wahab is outstanding in a brief but memorable role as Rizwan's caring and loving mother. Jimmy Shergill is very effective as Rizwan's brother Zakeer, who has always felt deprived by his mother because of his brother's mental disorder. Sonya Jehan is superb as Zakeer's wife Haseena and acts with grace. So is Katie A. Keane who plays Mandira's friend, Sarah. Tanay Chheda is first-rate as the young Rizwan. Jennifer Echols is lovable as Mamma Jenny.To sum it up, My Name is Khan is a nice film and an altogether worthy effort even if not a particularly good film in and of itself. It is interesting for the most part, quite entertaining throughout, and it may definitely make some look at certain things differently. It is well performed and is beautifully shot. Kudos to all involved in the technical area. But above all, it works because of Mr. and Mrs. Khan, who steal the show and take over the film itself and the faulty script. Watch it for them, I recommend you to see their story.",

            "content": "Welcome to a new world: Rizwan's world! There is no religion in his world only good people and bad people! He suffers from a form of autism; asperger's syndrome but that doesn't stop him from differentiating between good and bad and mind you he is a genius and has a pretty good memory.. He doesn't hesitate in saying the truth and is always ready to help and love others.. He says the Khans don't break their promise! He hates yellow color and says the use of mobile phone will kill bees and eventually human beings!This movie isn't a copy of New York or Kurbaan as people say.. In fact this is the only movie in recent times with a super strong message.. The music is soulful and gels along with the movie very well.. Cinematography is top notch! Hats off to Karan Johar for his marvelous direction and special accolades must be given to Shibani Bhatija for superb dialogues! But the man who deserves special kudos and a standing ovation is the king khan himself!! Forget Chak de! Forget Swades or forget anything you remember about him!! The moment you are out of the hall you wont be able to think SRK as a normal person... Funny but yeah he has acted so beautifully that you will only remember Shah Rukh as Rizwan! Yes Rizwan is his new name now!! Kajol was also good in her role even though she doesn't have a big role in the movie! Her sizzling chemistry with SRK is visible whenever the duo are together on screen.. specially in the song Tere Naina!He doesn't care what problem is he in or how famous he has become by doing those deeds which every human being should do! He only cares about a promise that he has to carry out in order to rebuild his shattered dreams of a successful life.. He loves Mandira(Kajol) and her son very much and he is ready to do anything for them!! He never forgets anyone who helped him! All he wants is peace in the world and for every human being!!SRK is back with a bang!! My Name Is Khan will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you fall in love with Khan!! So please take my advice watch the movie as soon as possible!! My Rating 10/10Thanks and Regards!",

            "content": "As a middle school teacher, I think there aren't many better movies for showing how 9/11 effected our migrant community. The movie is a bit broad, and it is definitely not flag waving, but it tackles real issues, and is emotionally taxing. The lead actor is very, very popular in South Asia, Africa, and China. Many of my students whose parents are from other countries easily recognize the actor. My students are at a point where they are very concerned with others opinions, and are not sure of their place in the world. This film allows my students to empathize with other cultures. It makes my students whose parents are foreign feel less alone. If you are looking for a great American drama, this is not it. If you want a window in to how the rest of the world lives, views America, and how they sometimes feel left out, this is it. I have yet to have a parent, a student, or a fellow teacher watch it and say, \"blah\".",

            "content": "My Name Is Khan is yet another film that will put the Indian film industry on the map. And this is a new phenomenon that America will have to get used to, foreign film countries shooting in the USA and examining our society. For better or worse this is how we seem to many foreigners.Shakrukh Khan creates a character in Rizwan Khan that many Americans will recognize if they've seen Being There, Rainman, and Forrest Gump. Bits from all those films will be found in My Name Is Khan. Khan is a Moslem citizen of India who emigrates to the USA and finds love and happiness when he weds a mother with a son from a previous marriage the wife played by Kajol and the stepson by Yurgon Makaar. She's Hindu, but the different faiths don't seem to matter. Khan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and its challenge enough for him to make his way in the world without picking up on the subtle nuances of the differences of religions and why one group has to hate all the others.All this changes on September 11, 2001 when some fanatical Moslems hijack some airlines and change the course of history forever crashing them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and killing a lot of innocent people, including a few hundred Moslems by all counts of the victims. As in the past here and other places bad behavior by some inflicted a stigma on the group.Young Mr. Makaar is killed in a hate crime incident which changes Khan's relationship with his mother and Khan himself through a combination of circumstances gets on a terrorist watch list. Khan conceives a mission to tell the President of the United States be it George W. Bush or Barack Obama that he is not a terrorist. Both in my professional and family heritage I've got some history with these kind of events. In my former job with Crime Victims Board I had a claim involving a bias attack against a young Arab American boy the same age as Mr. Makaar. It was only when I questioned the young man and his parents I learned of the bias nature of the events. Together with the GLBT liaison with the Kings County District Attorney we went to the Bias Unit of the NYPD and got the case reclassified as a bias attack. Sad though that no one was ever arrested for the crime, but it wasn't for lack of trying here. This was during the years immediately following the first Iraqi War and there was an upswing of attacks on Moslem Americans then as well.After World War I, we had the Palmer Raids in which the Bill of Rights was torn up and under the Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer many suspected radicals of Jewish or Slavic origins were deported in wholesale lots. I had a grand uncle on my mother's side who had such radical politics and he missed being deported by a hair. This was after the Russian Revolution and a number of anarchist bombings including the Morgan Bank on Wall Street and a mail bomb sent to the Attorney General himself. Duly elected Socialist members of the New York State Legislature were expelled at this time. It was not a good era.In the tradition of Peter Sellers, Dustin Hoffman and Tom Hanks, Shahrukh Khan might have an Oscar or nomination at least in his future. Two Magic Kingdom regulars from their teen shows have parts in this, Shane Harper of Good Luck Charlie plays one of the bashers and and Kenton Duty of Shake It Up playing the best friend who turns on Yurgon Makaar show far more acting chops in this than on the Disney Channel.There is no excuse or reason, no justification at all to make war on children. If you want to fight terrorists there's a war now in Afghanistan and probably future wars for the USA unless both we get it right and certain Moslems realize they are not taking the world over for Allah. Ditto the Christians who want to win the world for Jesus. We all have to live together and secular humanism may yet save us all.And this review is dedicated to the late Liz Garro of the Kings County District Attorney's office, the late John Lucyshyn my grand uncle who lived in the USA until his 90s, and to Ziad Abdel-Dayem of Brooklyn who last I heard is a married man. All three of you made the world a better place.",

            "content": "My name is Khan tells story of Muslim people living in US before and after the 9/11 tragedy. Although the movie is bold and quite a breakthrough in Bollywood landscape, it still doesn't do justice and overall subjective. Sharukh Khan is a great actor, he played an autistic Muslim who travel the continent with one mission, to meet the president and to clarify (based on his wife request) that not all Muslims are terrorist, obviously not him nor his dead son, victim caused by the race riot. I liked him, he gave honest and thrilling acting - a solid reason just to see the movie. Kajol, the dark beauty is also good, I used to love her but she kinda over-reacted at some scene and leave me cringe on my seat. But the chemistry of this two lead is undeniable, dare I say it's more 'real' than any Hollywood romantic couple on screen. Like I mention earlier, My name is Khan is a breakthrough but at the end of the movie you get a mixed feeling, that is it's subjective and not satisfying enough. But, taking in hand a very sensitive matter I do appreciate the director, Karan Johar from his 'escape' of the comfort zone and direct a delicate project. 9/10.",

            "content": "MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie. At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important. Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'. As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels. The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact. We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad. Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill). One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan. Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected. When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.' Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found. Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe. There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet. Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll. Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol. Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth! Grady Harp",

            "content": "This is a great three hour movie and every minute of it is a gem, so be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster. An Indian film taken and set in America but more Hollywood than bollywood but nonetheless this is a truly International film and you will definitely enjoy it and want to watch it again.It really does entertain, there is comedy and drama, melodramatic in excess at times, like with the church scene in Wilhemina with mama jenny, but who cares, the film is a movie not a documentary.reminds me very slightly of Tom Hanks situation in Terminal but more so with the Kite Runner than Slumdog Millionaire and of course Rain Man with the Autism factor.Confused about the timeline because 11 September happened of course in 2001 but the story appears set in 2007. And who was the funeral for which the two boys, Samier and white boy. Did something happen to the other boys Father which triggered the conversation and unease between the two Mothers? Mystified why Shahrukh Khan, who was the main character of the movie, is not shown in the film credits by IMDb? others have made comment about this.A really wonderful film which should not be missed. Don't be put off because it is an Indian film, this is much better than Slumdog and much more worthy of Oscar nomination which it has missed.More films like this please!

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: My Name is Khan",
            "content": "Early in the film the tone is set, where Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) is taught by his mom that there are only two groups of people in the world \u2013 those who do good and those who do bad. It may be an oversimplification, but if you think about it, that's is exactly what it boils down to, regardless of language, religion and the colour of one's skin.And it is this message that Rizwan, who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, brings along in his extraordinary journey in the United States, and to the people he meets along the way. Schooled by the love of his mother, Rizwan finds himself migrating to the USA thanks to his brother's early entry into the country, and Rizwan's job as a salesman brings him to the love of his life, Mandira (Kajol). In some ways the film provided a tinge of reminiscence to Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump, where a simple man with a disability and living on values of love that his mom had imparted, embarks on the journey called life, encountering love, helping people, and inspiring everyone to become a better person.Karran Johar wrote and produced Kurbaan last year, starring Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor in yet another film which touches on terrorism on US soil, and how intolerance and violence aren't proper solutions to air one's grievances. That film didn't do too well at the box office, probably because it's somewhat of an actioner and a love story rolled into one, and perhaps everyone got distracted by the real life couple in Khan and Kapoor starring opposite each other. In MNIK, Johar takes up directorial duties, and in a stroke of casting genius, put the evergreen SRK with Kajol, who together in their 5 films long before had resulted in nothing other than box office success. My bet is this will likely continue for MNIK.And bringing people by the masses to the cinemas would mean that it's ample opportunity to re-emphasize the strong message of peace, love and tolerance. Yes it has a strong religious flavour to it, especially when it goes on the quiet offensive to take back a religion of peace, and to straighten out the negative effect of misconceptions and prejudices no thanks to extremists hell bent on furthering their selfish gains. Rizwan may not have a quip like Gump's chocolates, but here he stresses from the onset, that his name is Khan, and he's not a terrorist, with childlike earnestness and honesty, in a film of almost an equal stature in its epicness.As with most Bollywood films told in two halves separated by an intermission, the first part comes off much stronger than the second, where we learn of Rizwan and his medical ordeal, where in India his mother struggles to bring up a child who's different. We learn more about Asperger's syndrome as the film wore on, and get enlightened on elements such as the hatred and fear of the colour yellow, an inability to lie and to tell it like it's like without sugar coating, a demeanour unable to express feelings easily, and in the mastery of a skill, in which case here it's being a technical expert. The romantic angle also gets drummed up as we see how Rizwan courts Mandira in his own way, with the narrative told in flashbacks (with nicely done transitions) as we move forward in time with Rizwan's quest to meet the President of the USA, which we will find out why.The later half focused very strongly in that quest, as we see how others touch and lend their support to Rizwan, as much as he reciprocates. Ample time also gets dedicated to the post- 9/11 America with its growing suspicions and mindless attacks on those on the wrong end of racial profiling. The story in this part goes two-pronged, with Rizwan's quest as well as Mandira's thirst for justice to be done. More time gets spent away from each other, and Rizwan's journey proved all the more interesting, with episodes such as that with Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) and Funny Hair Joel (Adrian Kali Turner) which will tug at your heartstrings, bringing back to mind that Bollywood hardly lets up on moments to turn on the melodrama if it can. Between the two halves, it's likely to feel that the initial half is the better of the two, though with minor plot loopholes aside, the second did suffer from a last minute gasp of a sub-plot involving religious radicals, but wrapped everything up rather nicely in a full circle fashion.SRK disappears into the role and becomes heart and soul of the film as Rizwan, no longer the mega-star boasting an awesome physique, but a simple man who lives life as best as he can given his condition, seeking to help others and to become that symbolic beacon of light against bigots. SRK gives a superbly sensitive performance and it's likely the unfortunate, uncontrollable antics of Rizwan would endear the character to you, eliciting support as you root for him to complete his mission despite the challenges laid out for him to overcome. In his last two major films, he had introduced the likes of rookies Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma to the world, but I guess one probably needs a seasoned veteran in Kajol to hold her own opposite the Khan when he delves into what could probably be his best role to date.And that character's name is Khan, and he is not a terrorist.

Their last collaboration Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna left me slightly unsure about whether Johar had lost his touch(even though I didn't think it was as bad as people had told me). My Name is Khan has been all over the news in the past weeks over Shah Rukh's comments about his comments about the Indian cricket team and it incited riots. I won't pass comments about who's right and who's wrong but all I can say is I hope his comments don't make people wary of seeing it because it is a truly entertaining movie. see it with my mother and two sisters and was completely in awe of it till the very end. I had doubts about this movie because from the ads it felt like a movie about terrorism which has been covered many times in the past couple of years in Bollywood(New York,Kurbaan,Fanaa etc)but I was surprised at how different it was from other Bollywood terrorism movies. Instead of dealing with the lives of the terrorists it dealt with the impact terrorism has on the normal citizens. In my life I have only cried watching three movies and My Name is Khan is one of them. It is truly a heartwarming movie and has reestablished my faith in the goodness of strangers. In a way it didn't feel like a Karan Johar movie. It didn't have lavish sound and dance numbers for one. It didn't even have any special appearances by actors(Salman Khan in KKHH, Rani Mukherjee in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham etc). Although Jimmy Shergill also starred in it but he had a rather lengthy role.

            "content": "\"My Name is Khan\" is a film you simply must watch with a box of Kleenex nearby. You will shed quite a few tears and it's an emotional roller-coaster watching it. But, it is worth it.The film is about a man named Rizvan Khan, a Muslim Indian man who would be diagnosed has having an Autism Spectrum Disorder. While he's much more functional than many Autistic folks, saying he has Asperger's Syndrome isn't quite right either. Like someone with Asperger's, he is highly intelligent and very functional in many ways...but lacks the ability to understand social graces and nuances. But he also acts a bit odd...avoiding eye contact and behaving, in some ways, like someone classically Autistic. The fact is that there is no one way folks with the disorder act or think...and it is an excellent portrait due to good writing as well as acting by Shahrukh Khan.After Rizvan leaves India for America, the film focuses much on his life and love life...which is very sweet and much like a traditional Bollywood romance...though set in the States. But this is only the first portion. The final half is like a completely different film...a bit like \"Forest Gump\" in that Rizvan goes on a trek across America...meeting some amazing and famous folks along the way. Why does he go off on this journey? See the film.It's pretty obvious that this film was a personal project of love by Shahrukh Khan. He is a Muslim married to a Hindu..just like the characters in the film. And, like the characters in the film, there were a lot of haters who inexplicably attacked Khan for marrying 'an infidel'. This movie is a plea to everyone to stop this hate...and emphasizes the universal goodness (as well as wickedness). The film shows hate in India as well as America...as well as goodness. And, the film shows Muslims being oppressed...and behaving awfully...much like so many others in the film. All in all, it's a modern morality tale...one intended to both entertain and educate the audience.While I loved the film, as did my wife, it is not perfect. A few of the characters (particularly the wife in the story) are inconsistent and some of their actions are confusing and make little sense...and a few seem a bit like caricatures. But even then, there is so much compelling material and the overall story so good, I can easily overlook the flaws.",

            "content": "I stepped into the theater to watch 'My name is Khan' 1 month after I had watched Avatar,so I was mentally prepared to be let down as the bar raised by AVATAR was sky high.Also I felt that this movie would be a typical KARAN JOHAR flick with love story intermingled between family ties,also in bollywood,most over-hyped movie really disappoint,but 15 minutes into the movie,I just got absorbed in it,such that the magic continued till the end.The movie is basically comprised of adventures and misadventures of an Autistic named Rizwan Khan but beware,it is not one of those movies which cash on the sympathy of suffering from a anomaly,it does have a hero who has a heart of gold,but the movie carries a marathon message,it raises questions,like WHY ARE MUSLIMS SUFFERING POST 9/11? ARE ALL MUSLIMS TERRORISTS? WHAT EXACTLY DOES Islam TEACH AND MEAN? Being a Muslim myself and having suffered same extra security checks at airports just because of my religion,I really got connected to the movie instantly,the realistic depiction of life after 9/11 is much more effective than KHUDA KE LIYE or NEW YORK..But its not a movie for Muslims only,it asks non-muslims to judge the person and not the religion.Something any other bollywood movie hasn't ever done.Now to the performances,MNIK was tailor made for Shahrukh Khan as Rizwan Khan and it demanded an equally towering performance.Shahrukh has always been criticized for similarity in his acting performances but this role is entirely different.To play an autistic and deliver is not easy,and Shahrukh does it so naturally and perfectly.You get in love with SK in the very first scene in airport,you cry with him,you laugh with him,you fall in love with him and as the movie ends,you feel good for him,its not an easy task at all to accomplish,this is Shahrukh's best performance to date and this really silents people who question his number one slot in bollywood.Kajol has always been a class to see and this time its the same with her.Being a mother of 2,she doesn't look aged at all,though this time Karan Johar doesn't give her much screen time as compared to previous movies,but still when she is on screen,you just feel so fresh.Her role as Mandira who falls in love and marries Rizwan is a delight especially her scenes as mother.SK-Kajol Chemistry has always been a blockbuster (BAAZIGAR,DILWALE DULHANIYA LE JAAEN GE,KARAN ARJUN,KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI,KABHI KHUSHI KABHI GHAM) this is now 6/6 for their roles together and what an achievement that is.The rest of cast does fine especially Navneet Nishan does make you smile whenever she is on screen.The music of the movie is according to the flavor of the movie,cute,melodious and unlike other bollywood movies,doesn't slow down the progression of the movie.Another plus of this movie is the script written perfectly by Shibani Bhatija.The teachings of Islam intercombined with Sk's character,love story,sub plots all blend well,not a single piece of dialogue is weak,not a single scene blunt,but perfectly executed.Since he rose to stardom as director of KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI,there is always a lot of expectation from Karan Johar which rises with each of his movies,this time he changes gear to pure DRAMA,the movie has a Hollywood look to it,the scenes captured are really pleasant,be it Washington DC or Georgia,as you travel with SK,the camera angles the sky views,the scene where SK takes Kajol to top of a hill,the roads of Sans Francisco,its all a journey from A to Z and Karan's direction makes it utterly enjoyable.Well done.A lot of people have complained about the sub plots in 2nd half in the movie but people,this movie is just not a love story,but about the problems of Muslims in USA and also about the life of RIZWAN KHAN,so sub plots were needed to carry the movie forward.Don't listen to people who are criticizing this master piece,its an Indian epic and a very very different movie.Go watch it,feel it,and come out realizing NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS.",

            "content": "My Name is Khan is the first movie created by Karan Johar without keeping box office in his mind. Seemingly inspired by Forest Gump, the movie is based upon the hatred and bias towards the Muslim community because of the terrorist activities by certain groups, especially in USA after the unforgettable 9/11. The movie very correctly emphasizes that a person should be assessed as a good person or a bad person only whatsoever religion he may be practising. Why should a good and kind-hearted Muslim and his family face the hatred and discard when they are in no way connected to the anti-human deeds of the Muslim terrorists ? Their religion is their identification and their faith. If they are good, loving and kind towards the other communities and the mankind in general, why should they suffer ?However Karan Johar could not find himself able to underscore this point through a normal Muslim individual. For his cinematic convenience, he has created the character of Rizwan who is suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. He is naive and innocent like a child and hence believable with all his mannerisms. But then the story does not look like a really flesh and blood individual's story. It seems a bit artificial since beginning. After losing the little child who was born to his Hindu wife through her earlier marriage, in the post 9/11 hatred in USA towards Muslims, Rizwan has to face the brunt of his beloved wife who feels that she is a loving wife later, first a grief-stricken mother. Challenged by the discarding wife to meet the US president and convince him that despite being a Muslim, he is not a terrorist, Rizwan starts a journey covering many people and events full of sensitivity. In typical bollywood style, Rizwan ultimately succeeds in meeting not George Bush (to meet whom he had started the journey) but Barack Obama. Reason ! The US gets a new president, an Afro-Americal one, till Rizwan's journey comes to conclusion. Obama (the actor and not the real Obama) tells him - Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist. And our beloved Rizwan (Shahrukh) Khan is happy to have achieved his objective and quite naturally his lost love.The treatment of the story by Karan Johar is highly sensitive. The character of Shahrukh Khan is simply lovable courtesy his marvellous acting through which he has put himself aside completely and attained the soul of Rizwan Khan, a golden hearted person suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. However, some incidents are unnecessary as well as making the look of the movie a bit unreal. The easier path has been followed by the director to bring his movie towards the desired climax. However for the first time, a director has shown the courage to depict a Muslim showing mirror to Muslims themselves by quoting Koran Sharif and the Muslim legends like Hazrat Ibrahim, warning them to beware of the Satan (the misguiding Muslim leaders in the modern sense).Shahrukh Khan has made even those people his fans through his performance in MNIK who were earlier his critics. Simply a gem of a performance by him. Kajol is as natural as cold in Delhi in the month of December. But the complete supporting cast deserves a special mention for the cameos by different characters making a greater part of the movie's ultimate impact upon the viewers. Zarina Wahab, Sonya Jahan, Jimmi Shergill, Vinay Pathak, to name a few. The child artists have also done a splendid job. The music is according to the mood of the movie. The art direction and the locations are highly impressive. Overall a good movie, not for the people fond of movies like KKHH or K3G (Karan's formula ventures). It is a movie low on entertainment value but high on inspirational value. A thought-provoking one. Strongly recommended for all the Muslim and non-Muslim viewers who believe in the religion of humanity.",

            "content": "The story of Rizvan Khan a Muslim man with Asperger's syndrome who in fact one of the most beautiful human beings I could think of real or fictitious, perfect by design and world view nothing else. His story is one of simple understanding, love and devotion. I believe that the first scene in which we meet Khan, first searching the presidents travel itinerary and then packing his belongings for this unknown trip. There is no indication at first about his disability, then in line to board the flight he is detained for two reasons, one he is acting oddly and speaking in a foreign tongue and because he is also very strikingly in resemblance to a middle eastern Muslim, which he is. This scene is set up by daunting music suggesting something malicious might be about to happen. Once he is detained you are able to see the process in which he is searched, they only find the things he needs for his journey, identification of him as a special needs individual and his itinerary of the presidents travels. Khan is interrogated briefly by men who are obviously making a joke at his expense and they despite their racism are inclined to let him go because they understand his threat is very little as they can witness. I believe this is a demonstration of them being law abiding despite their racism is a foreshadowing to the tone of the movie. Showing Khan as a main character through his interrogation and examination but also telling about his and his special needs but also speaking to his, although limited in some sense, understanding of the world through which he builds his life and pursues his goals. I believe the setting is very important from an area of conflict where Khan learned about good and bad people in the midst of Hindu/Muslim riots in which he learned the basis through which he would judge all people for the rest of his life, with very good examples of what is and what is not. After his move to San Francisco he receives his American education and is also exposed to modern psychology through his sister in-law who finds his diagnosis. This is important because San Francisco which is the place where many criminals were sent historically but also where there was a large rate of acceptance of people who were discriminated against such as gays and many other racial groups who historically and still seek residence there where they might be accepted. I have noticed that a song or sound that has been implemented in the movie to indicate something is called Tere Naina, this song is played all through the process in which Khan and Mandira are getting to know each other through his sales of his brothers product and then after when they become friends and start to see each other outside of the salon where Mandira works. This song is supposed to be indicative of the love which is developed and shared between them throughout the movie. This relationship being an exact illustration of Khan's character, beauty and love no matter which differences are fabricated for them by the world they see nothing that should hold them back from their blossoming romance and relationship. There are several grouping themes in this movie; the most important one is identified in the beginning of the movie is when his mother tells him there is only good and bad, no Hindu and Muslim, no white and colored. There are obvious examples of good Muslim through Khan versus the bad extremists, good white family versus the bad white people who don't understand or support him trying to share in the memorial ceremony as a Muslim. There is also his brother who believes Hindus are a threat to Muslim way of life but he tells his brother there is no good Muslim, bad Hindu only good person and bad person. There is also good and bad FBI representatives good is the minority woman who gives his psych evaluation and bad is the man who tortures and interrogates him. Good women and bad women, good men and bad men. The one thing I did notice is that the majority of the people who help him are minorities or happen to be educated about his condition, such as the women from the center who did his diagnosis in the autism center, the wife of his brother who teaches at a college, the FBI psychiatrist. I believe that there is an overarching idea of American ignorance throughout the movie. This ignorance causes more suffering than the actual attacks on the world trade center not only for the people who are suffering because of direct loss but those who are involved in hate crimes such as the ones perpetrated on Sameer Khan, first when his locker is stuffed with photos of Osama Bin Ladin and then again when he is killed because he is beat to death. There are many other minorities which there are hate crimes filmed from the shop owner to the motel owner to the wife of his brother. All of which are assaulted by people who are scared and hurting and all the while there is propaganda giving false ideas about the Muslim faith from public schools to the news and other public news media sources. I gained a better understanding of why in fact the Muslim faith tradition is one of love, from Khan quoting directly from the two religious books the Hadith and the Qur'an in order to reinforce the love he showed to everyone. As a further demonstration there is the scene where he travels to Wilhelmina Georgia in order to be with and help save Mama Jenny and Funny Haired Joel.",

            "content": "Mandira tells Rizwan she'll buy 6 hair products from him but he tells her he'll only sell her four because the remaining two will go to waste. He may be the world's worst salesman but he's the best human being. This is Rizwan, an innocent, clean hearted, simple guy who believes there are only two types of people in this world; those who are good and those who are bad. The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. You see he may be different but he definitely isn't stupid, in fact I believe we can all learn from him.The plot of this film is well known so I won't bore you with too much detail. This film is essentially a love story between Rizwan Khan (Shahrukh Khan) and Mandira (Kajol). However due to the events of the time their relationship is destroyed and Rizwan innocently sets out on a journey to clear his name.When watching the film you'll see Karan has once again used flashbacks to portray his story but this is not your typical Karan Johar film. It is clearly more realistic than his previous films and I must say he has matured well.The first half is focused on the Rizwan-Mandira love story. And it is done in a style that only Karan could do. I am a big fan of his previous \"young\" love stories but he is even better in this mature, realistic portrayal of \"love at first sight\". He makes us feel what Rizwan feels through his direction.My only problems with this film are in the second half when it begins to get more dramatic. And SRK mentioned himself that he wished the film was handled in a different way. And I completely agree with him. Where the first half succeeded in being fluent and tightly knit, the second half begins to become more far-fetched and loose. And I blame this on Shibani Bhatija. In terms of cinematography, you've got to give it to Ravi K Chandran, the film was filmed beautifully. The locales were very pleasing to the eye, were not over-powering and used simply as a back-drop. Coming onto the extras, I think this is possibly the only Bollywood film that has managed to correctly use English speaking actors and not turn them into caricatures or use fake dubbing. And for once, these extras can actually act! They have been used brilliantly and are totally believable.The supporting cast is flawless, they are relatively unknown actors (apart from Jimmy Shergill) and this is effective in making the story believable. They give heart-felt performances that compliment the lead actors.Coming to the lead actors... Rizwan Khan is without a doubt my most favourite character from any film. His sincerity and innocence is heart wrenching and there is only one man who could have done justice to this role and that is Shah Rukh Khan.Is there any role this man cannot do? He's done it all and yet he can still leave us gob-smacked. While watching the film I was in awe. In the scenes where Rizwan is faced with some sort of confrontation or hard- ship, he goes back into his shell and finds comfort in his religion. SRK makes you feel Rizwan's loneliness and confusion of how the world can be the way it is. When Rizwan is happy, you feel happy; when he is sad, you feel sad; when he is hurt, you feel hurt; and when he is confused and lost, you feel like reaching out and protecting him. I could keep going on about Rizwan and SRK but I would not do them justice, you have to go see the film to realise what I mean.I'm so glad to see Kajol back and especially with SRK. Their chemistry in previous films has created history and they do it once again in MNIK. She compliments SRK so well because she is a great actress herself. Look out for the outburst at Rizwan that has been mentioned so many times and her breakdown just before that. THE greatest actress Bollywood has ever had, periodGo watch this film now and I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Shah Rukh Khan alone will make sure of that. I myself am going to go watch it a few more times and I can't wait!",

            "content": "After watching this prestigious project of King Khan, the most interesting revelation to make is, that in MNIK the two close friends of Khan, Kajol & Karan have scored well ahead of Shahrukh in all respects. In other words, the movie and its emotional experience entirely belongs to Kajol, for her outstanding performance and Karan, for his unexpectedly hard hitting & thoughtful direction.It right away starts off with the already famous scene of Shahrukh's interrogation at the airport and then keeps on moving into a series of flashbacks. The first half has a slow pace and is more or less predictable. Still, the subtle scenes between Shahrukh & Kajol are nicely written and finely executed. However the scene where Shahrukh shows Kajol, the city from a hill top is quite similar to the one in \"Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi\". Besides this, the childhood sequences of Khan's life, lack the required depth and could have been much better.The real action starts post intermission, which also leads to major glitches in the screenplay. The sequences where Shahrukh is travelling through various places, meeting variety of people is a bit lengthy also highly inspired from Tom Hank's \"Forrest Gump\". Actually as the main emphasis shifts onto the theme of meeting the President, the film takes an unexpected turn and goes over the top to some extent. The un-necessary focus on media coverage and political references takes away the emotional essence of the story, making the viewer a little uninterested.To be precise there are three strong merits in MNIK.1. One is the amazingly natural and highly expressive performance by Kajol. In fact I would like to rate Kajol's emotional scene with her son, as one of best ever tragedy scenes in Hindi Films till date. The sequence reminded me of an equally great hospital scene of \"Sharaabi\".2. Second is the director Karan Johar, who surprisingly returns with a more realistic, dark and controversial subject, completely in contrast with all of his previous projects.3. Third and the most important merit of the movie is its solid and hard-hitting message to the world that \"Everyone in a particular religion or community cannot and should not be punished for the inhuman crimes committed by a few people of the same origin.\" Coming back to Shahrukh Khan, the hard work is clearly visible and the effort is quite admirable. Shahrukh no doubt comes up with a noticeable performance as The Khan. But truly speaking, there are undeniable glimpses of Dustin Hoffman & Sean Penn, clearly visible in his autistic act. Khan's performance will surely impress millions of his Bollywood fans who love watching only Hindi Films. But for the movie buffs who are well familiar with Dustin Hoffman in \"Rainman\", Sean Penn in \"I am Sam\" and Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump\"\u0085\u0085., Shahrukh has simply done a good job. He visibly tries hard to move away from all the above references and does come up with a fine performance. But the impact of all the above three names in their respective roles is so huge that it unintentionally leads you to a comparison.In addition to this, the writing also shows some major faults in the screenplay. For instance, I am still not able to figure out that which Hindu-Muslim Riots happened in 1983 in Mumbai. Secondly, in the few initial scenes, it's shown that Shahrukh has a serious problem with Yellow color. Yet in the second half he is shown holding a yellow cardboard in his hand.Lastly in the final hour, everything just goes on happening so easily, which completely contradicts the realistic feel of the movie and lessens its final impact on the viewer. The movies also raises a question that why Karan approved of making \"Kurbaan\" on a similar subject of 9/11 impact on Muslims in America, when he was himself making MNIK on the same subject? Apart from the impressive Kajol act, Jimmy Shergil excels in his few scenes and so does Sonya Jehan who plays Jimmy's wife. Parveen Dabbas shines as a Sikh who opts for cutting his hair after 9/11 in order to survive the hate attacks. Both Vinay Pathak and Zareena Wahab make their presence felt in their small roles.Cinematography is great with some new unexplored locations looking fresh on screen. But I found Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music lacking the melody part once again. However, Karan very intelligently, uses only few full length songs in the movie and rest of them are just there as a part of the background music.Summing up, \"MNIK\" is surely one of those few good movies which are capable of raising a question and starting a debate. Many of the viewers might miss the regular glossy & romantic feature of a Shahrukh-Karan film. But MNIK is a clear indication of changing times in Bollywood and should be taken in good spirits.It's not a perfect piece of art but a laudable effort indeed from Dharma Productions.",

It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!This movie deserves a full 10!!Thanks and Regards!",

            "content": "\"My Name is Khan\" is a highly watchable fairy-tale drama about a Muslim man with Asperger's Syndrome - the Khan of the title, Rizwan Kahn (Shahrukh Khan) - who goes to live in America and makes a career as a cosmetics salesman. He falls in love with a beautiful girl Madira (Kajol) and forms a life with her young son Sam (Yuvaan Makaar). However, tragedy strikes as a result of 9/11, forcing Khan to go on a cross-country journey where he comes to the aid of a hurricane-stricken village, is placed in captivity for being a terrorist and finally meets the President of the United States.Those of you who are reading this have presumably heeded the spoiler warning above so I hope I haven't given anything away. The movie clocks in at 170 minutes and I was surprised that, despite the many flaws with this film, I did not once feel bored.This mainly comes down the performances of the three main characters. Shahrukh Khan's performance is brilliant and readily engaging. He is credible as his character and works well with Kajol and Yuvaan Makaar as his surrogate son. The relationships are funny, touching and credibly rendered.The storyline really needed work, however, and is in many respects dishonest. These kinds of supposedly uplifting fairy tales may be superficially entertaining but in this case obscures the reality of what living with Asperger's is like. I know this myself as someone who has the condition. I know it's only a movie, but I am not being dishonest when I say the character has it easier than many others on the autistic spectrum both here in my country and across the world. In later scenes, the autistic aspects of Khan's character are completely ignored in favour of making him a poster boy for 'good Islam' in response to a hateful or ignorant American public. While it's good to have this distinction between positive and negative Islamic people, this topic deserves a more serious and less pat treatment than it gets here.The film is slickly produced, with some fantastic cinematography and good use of Bollywood music - it's lovely to hear a Bollywood version of \"We Shall Overcome\".I know I've just lambasted it's storyline but I'm giving it 8/10 anyway because I did enjoy it and I hope it kicks open the door for movies that have more serious treatments of the topics of Islam and Asperger's Syndrome.",

This movie like what all the audiences already felt that is a heart-to-heart story of Islamic view in America after 9/11 tragedy. Most of the scenes were portrait really well I hardly could find any flaw from this movie.I almost cry hard when I was watching this movie, an innocent yet never give up person that what the hero (Rizvan) did is amazing even a normal person will find it hard to do a journey like he did. A forgiveness, a confession, a bitter anger, and a loss are most told in this movie. Sharukh really acted very good as what his character supposed to do so is Kajol.This movie tells about racism and false accusations about Islam that had been prejudiced all this time because of 9/11 tragedy and how often Muslim is often being familiarized with terrorist which in fact it's not. It's all human doing with false perception who makes any religion looks bad not the religion itself, that's the main issue in this film.A great movie that will be memorized in my heart forever.",

The way Shahrukh Khan has projected himself as an autistic patient is just awesome. Kudos to him. This is by far his best acting. After this movie, he has proved why he is called The King of Bollywood. He is in a league of his own. No one is even close to him. I have loved the movie. You will not be able to take away your eyes for a single minute in this 160mins movie. This is just fabulous. Kajol as Mandira was awesome too. She had played an excellent character and supported SRK very well. Their chemistry is to die for. Few moments in the movie will make you cry. The way he goes to an only Christian event and donates the money and says \"Take this money for the Africans who are not Christians, darling\" is awesome. This movie will be an all-time blockbuster. Go and Watch this movie !!",

Please let this movie change that, and become an eye-opener not only to cultural and religious tolerance in the US but all around the world, including in Egypt.

            "content": "My wife and I were a couple of the very few white faces in an overwhelmingly Asian audience in a north-west London cinema for this Bollywood movie which is almost entirely in Hindi with sub-titles. We might not have been there if it was not for seeing an interview on the Jonathan Ross television show with the actor in the eponymous role Shah Rukh Khan - but we were so glad we did.The film is very different in both style and substance to traditional American and British work, although it is clearly aiming to be a 'crossover' between east and west so that there is no dancing or on screen singing. For western audiences, the acting will seem somewhat exaggerated and the storyline (by Shibani Bathija) rather simplistic and sentimental, but the powerful political messages - that traditional Islam is not a threat and that Muslims are not terrorists - are very effectively communicated and deserve a wide (especially American) audience.Shah Rukh Khan - himself a Muslim married to a Hindu - is excellent as Rizwan Khan, a Muslim from Mumbai who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, and Kajol is convincing (as well as beautiful) as his Hindu wife Mandira. These two have starred in many Bollywood movies together but this is their first pairing for some years. Shot partly in Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as Mumbai with an atmospheric score, director Karan Johar has given us an Indian film with a global reach.",

            "content": "My Name is Khan is a terrific film, and of course I really enjoyed seeing all the Bay Area scenes. It is amazing that, despite living in India, how much Karan Johar has an NRI mindset. All the scenes, dialogs, situations, characters, and extras seemed so authentic as if he's taken actual snapshots of life in the US. Minute details such as California fashion, American dinners, the Autism alert card, arrogant attitude of interrogators, or even gospel choir in the rural South have been paid close attention to.Kajol acted flawlessly as always. The role of Rizwan Khan is an utmost demanding one and really has tested SRK's limits. Dustin Hoffman has immortalized his character with his perfect performance in Rain Man. While SRK has the milder Aspiringer's Syndrome, rather than autism, comparisons between the two performances are unavoidable. It looks like SRK didn't win this competition, but his performance was still relatively good, no doubt. All the supporting actors did a fantastic job. I particularly liked Aunt Jenny, Jimmy Shergill's wife, and Sarah.While KJo has done a fantastic job of making his film look truly American, it has been presented in a \"too polished\" manner. I don't believe realistic cinema is KJo's forte. His films are too glamorous, glossy, and fine-tuned to bring out the raw emotions of a dark world. KANK was a disaster in this regard, while MNIK is a huge improvement but still could have been better. Well-established stars also can be a deterrent. We all know what the film is about, but come on; every Bollywood fan wants to see SRK-Kajol in a Bollywood musical romance--not the way they were paired in this movie. Films like New York and Kurbaan have done a much better job with the post-9/11 genre. For the first time, KJo's film didn't have a must-buy soundtrack. Sajda is a nice song, but that is the high point of the soundtrack. Another major flaw in this film is the timeline; the \"incident\" is shown to occur in the wake of 9/11 (not later than 2002), and SRK begins the search to meet the President; 6 months later, it is 2008.",

            "content": "Ever since its release, reviewers and audiences have been busy comparing MNIK with Forrest Gump. So, is it true? Definitely Not! While Forrest Gump was an extraordinary lifetime journey of a low-IQ-nice-guy, MNIK deals with the mending of a relationship smothered by typecasting of communities in the aftermath of terror attacks. The protagonist\u2019s condition, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome adds a third angle to the story.Born with social interaction disability, Rizvan detests anything yellow or loud, but is gifted with the ability of repairing appliances. Events lead him to the US where he falls in love and marries the vivacious Mandira. Things change post 9/11 when Mandira\u2019s son is killed in the communal hatred for his last name \u2018Khan\u2019. She now hates Rizvan for giving them the last name. It is now up to Khan to regain his lost love! While being sentimental, MNIK packs in a message that every Muslim is not a terrorist, and Khan wants to tell this to the US President. Too many obstacles are thrown in, including a hurricane, terror suspicions, imprisonment, et al. But northing bothers our undaunted hero who even simplistically offers to repair the Air Conditioner in the prison! Ah yes, he also teaches us about pronouncing \u201cKhan from the epiglottis\u201d.Religious tolerance is a hackneyed Bollywood theme. But, MNIK does it with a lot of heart. Khan lives by his mother\u2019s principles that no religion is bad, but it is people who are either good or bad. His sincere journey touches hearts, admonishes hardliners and pines to re-unite with Mandira who now finds strength in hatred and prefers it to the weakness of love for Khan. The SRK-Kajol pairing here is simply beyond words! Coming from a director best known for \u2018loving your parents\u2019 family movies, Karan Johar has carefully blended his \u2018relationship\u2019 skills with stronger themes of religion and disabilities, all into one film. Considering that SRK is one the producers, I won\u2019t entirely believe that his airport security drama was not a publicity stunt! The producers must also thank the politicos for giving a nitrous boost to the release and its profits! What makes MNIK tick is its cast. While King Khan is probably the best \u2018emotion\u2019 actor, adding Kajol to the combo makes it a killer. Tannay Chheda of Slumdog fame as the young Khan has some resemblance with SRK and Zarina Wahab as his mother is apt. Jimmy Shergill as Khan\u2019s brother is decent but Sonia Jehan is outstanding in her role as the professor sister-in-law of Khan who identifies his condition and helps him.Some of the songs like Sajda are Tere Naina make Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy\u2019s work worthwhile. The songs don\u2019t interrupt the flow either; a credit to the editors. Filming locations are the glossy as usual but those one that is over the top is the little Georgian town that propels Khan to Stardom. While it is undeniable that MNIK has an overdose of drama, it has packs in a lot of little moments that touch your heart. Try it out!",

I have seen MNIK and it's a strictly OK film and it is certainly not by any means a path breaking piece of cinema. In fact, in many places it's way too sentimental and over the top. The overall message the film is trying to deliver is admirable, but it could have been much more effectively delivered were it not packaged as a typical \"K-JO\" love story. And therin lies the film's biggest flaw. A film on a subject like the one tackled in \"My Name is Khan\" should NEVER have been attempted by Karan Johar who is Bollywood's equivalent of Richard Curtis. Could you imagine Curtis directing \"The Lives of Others\" or \"The Counterfeiters\"? Of course not.A 10 out of 10 rating should only be reserved for cinematic masterpieces which MNIK certainly is NOT. This is exactly why IMDb ratings for Bollywood movies can never be taken seriously. In my opinion, MNIK is a 6 out of 10 film at best. Possibly 7 for SRK + Kajol acting.",

            "content": "Rizvan Khan (SRK with a serious hangover of Hoffman from 'Rainman' but with neither the legendary touch nor the convincing seriousness) is a man suffering from Asperger's Syndrome. He has a clearly secular mother (Wahab in a decent role) who has taught him that there are just either good or bad people in the world. Something, as we all know, just isn't true but then considering the already complicated personality of Rizvan, Mr. Johar decides to dumb it down to 'his level'. Tragic.He then arrives in You-Yes-Yeah following his bizarrely irreverent brother (Jimmy Shergill in a role that never quite manages to find ground) to sell cosmetics for his company. So far, interestingly, things chug along evenly. Steady storyboard and all that. Bam! Mandira enters (Kajol in her usual indulgent self as evidenced in her groupie's directorial flicks) and things start getting 'Bollywood-ized'. The clich\u00e9 rain begins. Rizvan almost instantly breaks into 'Tere Naina Tere Naina' and a few frames later asks her to marry him. She, a divorc\u00e9e with apparently a seriously troubled past, gives him a mundane task (watch the film for this one) so that she may 'consider' marrying a guy she recently met. Even if I looked past the cinematic liberties here, the fact that she actually agrees to marry him raises serious questions about her character's conviction. A single mother who is just moving to a new place in a country like United States might, umm well, think twice before remarrying and that too with, ahem, a person with a clear form of autism. But not Mandira \u2013 no no \u2013 she is all for it in a blink. Heck, it is even hinted that they have sex on their first night thanks to 'Intercourse for dummies'. Made me think a lot of Indian men probably need that book too.Now to the nucleus of this tale \u2013 9/11 and its affects on innocent Muslims in the US. Whats that you say? That was almost a decade ago and people might find this theme a tad overused now? Well not according to Mr.J's yarn since we have random rednecks flipping off shopkeepers just because they wear a white cap, we have unnamed yanks smashing windows of desi motel owners and heck, we even have kids at school smashing that 'Paki' kid since his skin is brown. Yaaawn. How many movies have already dealt with this over the last decade? I lose count now.And so Mr. Khan embarks on this supposedly iconic journey (much like the 'run' Hanks did in Gump which brought the entire nation to him. Remember that?) to meet the Prez and tell him \u2013 'Mr. President. My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist.' And for what? Just because the love of his life \u2013 Mandira \u2013 told him to. I wonder what he would have done had she told him to go say 'Stop it man! You are making us all look bad!' to Osama bin Laden?And so during this journey, Khan meets an array of people who apparently don't really have a problem that he is a Muslim. The best part of the movie in terms of ridiculousness is when Khan finds himself in a church with a dozen African Americans and tells them ( (in Hindi of course, since it is the second language in all American schools and so everyone there knows it!) that Mandira's son was his 'best friend'. Not one scene existed when the kid seemed remotely interested in what was going on in either his mother's life or with stammering Khan who randomly gifts him shoes for no reason. This is where I lost all possible interest in the rest of it considering the climax became so obvious.My instincts about this movie being a giant load of cheesy performances and over the top 'Umreeki' reactions were bang on. Not only do we have an American cast just waiting to be salvaged from their racial ignorance by an autistic Indian Muslim, but he is also shown as some sort of messiah who becomes an inspiration for other Americans to help their own kind. Any ounce of credibility this story might have managed, gets vaporized at this spot when a crowd lead by his brother and sister-in- law leads a handful of Americans to aid in rescue efforts of a disaster area. The rest of the story is seriously predictable from this point on so I will let you waste your hard earned doe in experiencing this 'magic'.What aches me most about a movie like MNIK is that Johar decides to voice each and every thought Rizvan gets in his head. This, because he once again assumes his audience are so dumb, that they cant even digest this high school essay of a story. So while we have to put up with SRK's never ending, almost annoying, portrayal of a man with a serious disorder, we also have to contend with Kajol's wide eyed histrionics that oscillate from meaninglessly irrational to just plain absurd. I look around me and find leading websites announcing this as SRK's finest till date and it hurts me. How can they possibly call this a performance that overtakes 'Swades' or 'Chak De'? Is it because this is the first movie where he plays an 'unconventional' hero with a medical condition? Puhleez. Anyone who cites this as the reason isn't qualified to be a reviewer.If the audience who watches this so called 'movie about peace in Islam' that only highlights racial stereotypes calls it a successful attempt then surely it is a sad day in Indian cinema. I would prefer the movie 'Aamir' ten times more just because it was honest in its statements instead of choosing to design its script based on newspaper articles from a decade ago.",

To begin with let us examine the Director of this movie and his ingenuous skill in making a fool of himself and everybody who participated in the creation of this three hour misadventure. All the events in the movie start abruptly , end abruptly and needless to say leave no impression on anybody's mind. The Director has tried his best to ruin the screen presence of all his key players. Shahrukh's Reebok shoes were the only lucky fellows, for enjoying a rather prolonged presence in the camera's lens.Moving on to the screenplay and story. A stale plot and social message. The same old tendencies to blame it all on 9/11. The writer was a bit confused I guess. Shahrukh's ailment, whose nature was quite conveniently displayed on the screen at the beginning of the movie is too hard for any reasonable man to understand. The writer made Shahrukh's character a self contradictory specimen. His mental condition takes U-turns throughout the movie. Sometimes he is as bright as the sun and sometimes as gullible as a Kunal Kohli fan.It is quite sad to note that the writer failed to accurately and clearly bring forth the ailment in an intelligent manner . Shahrukh's acting . One word for it. Can't write it out here. Undoubtedly one of his better works but seriously ......he should reconsider making tall claims about his Kingdom in Bollywood.At the end of the movie I felt defrauded, cheated and swindled out of my money and time. I have seen bad cinema but this one sets new standards. Of course Shahrukh's Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi gives it tough competition.",

But then everything changes when Twin Towers in New York are attacked.Starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Arjun Mathur, Soniya Jehan , Jimmy Shergill, Jennifer Echols and Zarina Wahab (special appearance), the movie is directed by Karan Johar, produced by Hiroo Johar and Karan Johar, while Shankar Ehsaan Loy provide the music score.Shah Rukh Khan has gone on to prove that not only is he able to act in romantic roles, but those roles that are serious such as this as well as he has certainly excelled in this movie. He has shown what acting is all about and that an actor cannot just stick to one kind of role. His co - star, Kajol, with who he was last seen in \"Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham,\" has gone onto re-establish herself as a top actress and why she is always favoured to act with Shah Rukh Khan. Its also nice to see the return of Zarina Wahab after such long time away from the screen and she always goes on to make an impact, though hers is only a special appearance.Director Karan Johar has certainly moved on and has shown that not only is he capable of making movies such as \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,\" \"Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham,\" but he is also able to make movies such as \"Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna\" and now this one - topical and serious movies. He has used the attack on the Twin Towers as a backdrop to the story, which has a message for everyone. He has handled the topic exceptionally well.The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, is something to listen out for. The song \"Sajdaa\" is worth listening to. But if one is expecting all the song and dance and spectacular locations for this, then for them it will be a disappointment. The cinematography is also worth watching as it provides some excellent scenery.This is not a typical Karan Johar movie and those who are expecting it to be, may find it rather disappointing.

Well, to start off, Karan Johar's My Name is Khan has realistic elements. Second, how the camera moves. I don't know if too many people know this, but, SRK was the stunt co-coordinator in the movie. Those were very well directed too! I don't know what the critics' problem was with the hurricane scene, but, I think it was needed to move the movie forward. If there hadn't been a hurricane scene, then, the movie wouldn't have moved so smoothly and would've had some loopholes. GREAT JOB KARAN AND SRK ON THE BRILLIANT DIRECTION!!!2) Performances -- Probably the best part about the movie. Looks like Mr. Khan has done his research about Asperger Syndrome. Kajol looks charming. The chemistry between SRK and Kajol brings magic into the world. Kajol has done a wonderful job. BUT, the movie totally belongs to Shahrukh Khan. The extras such as Jimmy Shergill, Sam (Son of Mandira and Rizwan), the young Rizwan, Vinay Pathak (motel owner) and Christopher B. Duncan did an amazing job.3) Dialogues -- Great as well! There are some cheesy dialogues, but, the really excellent and influential dialogues outnumber the cheesy ones by so much that you pretty much forget about the cheesy ones.I would STRONGLY STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend you go watch this one.

It was also edited well.Ratings.Shahrukh \"Khan\" - 20/10.Dialogues - 10/10.Screenplay - 9/10.Editing - 9/10.Cinematography 10/10.Music 8/10.Lyrics 10/10 Direction 10/10.Overall, the film's great theme was it's USP and it will surely be good on the box office. If you are thinking about watching it or not, go for it! You will not be disappointed!!! GO FOR KHAN, HE WILL WIN YOUR HEARTS!!!! LOVELY FILM!",

            "content": "Rizwan khan ,an undiagnosed autistic(aspergers actually) moves to San Francisco after his mother dies not before teaching him all about secularism. While Working in a cosmetic shop for his brother and selling them ,Rizwan falls in love with a hair dresser Mandira.The rest of the movie deals with the couple trying hard to save their love amidst cultural discrimination against Muslims that seem to tear them apart.MY NAME IS KHAN is a kind of movie that will have you seriously thinking about secularism and at the same time will make you smile or at times will bring a lump in the throat with moist eyes.You will find yourself seamlessly connecting with KHAN and you cant help but accept the fact that Sharukh khan, who has mostly been 'the lover boy' of India cinema SO many times that it actually made you sick, is actually one of India s FINEST actor. KAJOL playing a distressed mother delivers a flawless performance that will remain in your mind long after you have left the theater and probably you will recall every time you hear her name or see a distressed mother in real life.It is that strong.JOHAR as a director has matured with his audience and has moved far away from his silly rom coms or melodramatic family dramas to this very meaningful love yarn.This movie tat grips you for the most part suddenly slips in the end with a climax that was predictable, nothing wrong with that ,but a bit too much of over-dramatic background score and over acting will leave a small halo where you would expect the filmmaker to wrap up the enjoyable show with a final master stroke.Nevertheless definitely worth your time because rarely a movie comes along that will make you think if YOU have been unfair sometimes and if YOU need to change your biased perspective. This movie might just raise such uneasy doubts in you yet in the best way possible.8/10",

This is one of the best and most powerful films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.I am not an expert in Bollywood film, but I daresay MNIK has made me a fan. For those of us who are mostly exposed to the American mainstream, the best example I can give of similarity to this film is Slumdog Millionaire, which also had very Bollywood-esque overtones.But enough about that...onto this amazing movie. There are few films I have seen which I could call \"flawless,\" and MNIK is one of them. The characters are portrayed with undeniable strength, and you feel a closeness and empathy for each of them. The storyline gracefully balances out a love story while also tackling issues of culture clashes, religion, disabilities, politics, natural disasters, and morality. Everything is so successfully interwoven, you don't notice until after you are done watching that you essentially just watched six or seven different movies rolled into one.But where MNIK is most powerful is in its statements about world issues that are very recent and very relevant. Through the eyes of Rizwan Khan, all that matters is whether you are a good person who does good deeds or a bad person who does bad deeds. It is an incredible lens to look through, and it can teach you a lot about how you perceive and treat people who are different than you.Please take the time to watch this movie. It is beautiful, honest, and powerful in every way.",

            "content": "My Name is Khan 8/10 Clarification: I'm a SRK fanboy (ya, the big one) and this is a biased review. If you want an unbiased one look at the bottom section for a few words on that. A few years or decades ago the movies used to be on themes like Muslims and Hindus, their clash, pain of clash, fear of being dragged into it. But for some years now the human species seems to be divided into two sections, one is human and another is muslims. Classification of human on religion is dangerous and disgrace to humanity itself. For years and quite recently movies are being made to portray the message that Rizwan's mother teaches him at early years there are only two kinds of people in this world good and bad. But movies have their own style and language of telling this and My Name Is Khan has its own.After a long time I saw SRK did a character role. Those of you hate him for being repetitive, watch this,its sure a breather for u guys. And, those of u liked his Swades and Chak De, then add this one too in ur list. For those of fans like me, it was a treat to watch him exploring a totally different ground, we were tired of convincing that he can do it, those other two movies are not from fluke. Best thing in this movie is (SRK obviously) the dialog. SRK is given such beautiful dialogs, totally unmatched comments in some serious scenes puts u in dilemma, should u think over the serious matter or laugh on SRK's innocent comment. Songs, when heard in audio only format, are just average, nothing special. BUT, surprisingly they are so so appropriate for the scenes they are used that u don't feel them un-necessary at all. The songs just blend with the scenes, a true use of song in a movie. Movie and songs both are incomplete without each other. To all, watch this, there are something for all of us. TO SH1TSENA, yes his name is KHAN and he's not a terrorist!!!A few words for those who came directly here, please read above one too!!! Rating 7.5/10 Story: Good with a very strong message to deliver. Hats off to Karan for the bold theme. Cinematography: Good. I felt at some conclusive parts the finishing dialogs were not so impactive as they should have been. Editing: Could have been much better. The mid-part sure slows down a bit and if u r too observant, it may bore u. A shorter version would have been much appealing. Acting: SRK good in a very different role and does very well. But a few scenes I felt are just out of tune. Kajol pre-marriage scenes are very lovable and charming, later her role was not in focus. Basically these two persons are who the movie made of; rest could have been done by any-one. Both the child artists are worth mentionable. Overall a good movie with agood message, with its share of loopholes. Do give it a try, u may end up loving it.",

            "content": "It's about time to make a movie that could balance the general point of view. Thiz movie tries to answer that someone is not measured by his religion, but more about his good deeds. The story applies some \"Forrest Gump\" (1994) elements into it. The film is starred by India superstar Shahrukh Khan along with Kajol and directed by their friend Karan Johar. Although Johar is a very well-known Director in India, but his works are very rare. There are only four movies include his first phenomenal movie \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" in 1998. All Johar's movies appeared Khan and Kajol. The following are \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gam\" (2001) and \"Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna\" (2006) where Kajol is only appeared in a small role (uncredited). On thiz movie, Khan's performance tries to reach Dustin Hoffman's character in \"Rain Man\" (1988). But like all the Bollywood movies, I think some moments are quite overacted. Khan suffers Asperger syndrome that made him difficult to interact with other people. However, he is gifted with special abilities, in some ways he is smart. The entire film is about journey of his life, meets his love one and what happens after 9/11 incident. The cinematography is awesome.The plot has many layers of side stories. Most of the times, the conflicts are quite good. But the ending is too simple and easily solved. If we want to be honest, thiz movie delivers some clear explicit messages. It takes us to see from another point of view where some things become more sensitive after 9/11 incident. Thiz movie doesn't try to judge who is right or who is wrong, but it simply wants to remind us that we are actually in the same boat. The title and character itself which points to Khan is very acceptable. The movie is anticipated to be neutral by putting the main Actor real name onto it.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

            "content": "In the last five years, Karan Johar has tried to tackle more mature themes after having yielded to the general public's material with the usual masala like 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'. As horrendous as the aforementioned movie was, it became a smash hit. Thus, I respect Johar's attempt to do something that's a little outside the box and somewhat of a challenge for him. However, with 'Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna' and 'Kurbaan', he miserably failed to do justice with the story and tackling the themes. Does 'My Name is Khan' suffer the same fate? No.To be honest, it did exceed my expectations. The first half of the movie is tightly knit and solid as it introduces the viewer to Rizwan Khan's background, his entry to America, his meeting with vivacious single mom, Mandira and them settling down. The development of the love story between Rizwan and Mandira is beautifully portrayed. The film also succeeds in the technical side with its stunning cinematography and the visualizations of the great locales. The soundtrack is great too and most of the songs are placed in the background.It is in the second half that things go a little haywire. The story becomes a little far-fetched and the writing appears sloppy in places. For example, in the scene where Dr. Terrorist's right hand man pays Rizwan a visit in Wilhemina. It has a 'Forrest Gump' feel to it (I'm not saying that's a bad thing and not implying that it's ripped off but it is quite an odd turn). The background score is intrusive at times and the sets, for example during the storm sequence in Wilhemina, look obviously staged. Moreover this latter portion of the film is a tad too saccharine and the ending is a little too convenient.The casting is very well done. Non-Indian actors are often cast as caricatures in Hindi films but here the American actors are treated well with respect. There's none of that poor dubbing or pinched face expression and most of the actors, like the ones who play Mandira's neighbour and Mamma Jenny. Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are first rate. Their chemistry is as strong as ever. Khan's Rizwan and Kajol's Mandira brilliantly complement one another. Zarina Wahab is superb in a brief role. Arjun Mathur is effective. Jimmy Shergill is competent and the stunning Sonia Jehan shines.For Karan Johar, 'My Name Is Khan' is definitely an improvement compared to his previous recent works and I believe he is heading the right direction. In spite of its flaws, 'My Name Is Khan' is entertaining and poignant. I appreciate the message Johar sends and he has done a good job of getting it through.",

            "content": "This movie has a very grandiose ambition of touching upon the hurt and disenchantment caused to people of a certain colour, who are mostly American by nationality. It also touches upon the self-alienation brought upon many by the events of September 9/11.At the core of the movie is a story and a script with deep and universal symbolism with characters that represent innocence, mistrust and hope.Caked over that promising central basis of the film is unfortunately a lot of bad direction, loose screenplay and a wholeheartedly bad, unnecessary and wretched use of music and emotional drama. What could have been a resoundingly powerful journey of poignant cinema, instead comes across as a commercial hijacking of sensitive issues.At its heart, it is still a film with a positive message from the production company, but in terms of execution it shows all the limitations of the cast and crew behind it.It is nevertheless a bold venture in it's scope of spelling out a genuine emphasis on the morals of unity and hope by weaving the different issues and obstacles depicted in the story into one cohesive whole that might take audiences a long time to be endeared to, on the same level as the previous films from Karan Johar.The movie is in many ways similar to the main character, who can apparently learn to fix anything. He is a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. And as such, is the movie. There is too much scope on covering all the different issues, and not enough emphasis on a coherent narrative with steady characters.There is none of the fun factor of the 90's Dharma movies. The music here is dry and dull, possibly to infer a sense of the austerity of the faith of the main character.Overall, a movie not to be missed because the story here makes it unmissable. And that's a line which is too cheesy even for this movie.",

Fox guys were really keen whether the $16 million they spent in buying the rights are justified? The answer is a resounding yes. This film is gonna blow away mainstream Hollywood if properly marketed. Shah Rukh Khan is in the role of his lifetime and as Rizwan Khan, he is in his best performance ever. Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. The climax is the crux of the movie, and the 2nd half is so compelling that people will just stand up and give a standing ovation to the maker, Karan Johar. Shibani Bathija needs to be credited for such an awesome screenplay, and Ravi Chandran's cinematography gives the film an international look. The theme is tailor made for North America, and as I already mentioned, if marketed properly, this one has potential to gross $20-30 million in North America alone. Having said that, being primarily a love story, it has all the right items to hit the Indian box office. Due to the lead pair coming back after 10 years, the hype in India is inexplicable. Overall, I would give it a 8.5/10 rating, and advise everyone to celebrate Valentine's with KHAN.",

I watched this movie without any high expectations because i somehow knew it was going to be soapy and thats exactly how it was! And i realized that all the hype was about SRK and Kajol uniting on-screen after 10 years, which I'm not particularly fond of. That said, now let me start with the actual review if the movie..This is one of the dumber movies you ll see and the fact that it is surrounded by so much hype doesn't make it any better(actually, it makes them worse). Let me start with characterization...The movie has a handful of underdeveloped characters. for instance, SRK's in-law, when she was shown as a student of psychology and and that she found out his syndrome i was expecting that she would have a chunky role in treating his condition but one never gets to see her in the movie alone. In every frame she appears after that she's just a insignificant person in the entourage.Next, let me talk about the script. Karan himself seems not to be sure if he's making a love story or a movie with a 'purported' message and the scene where Kajol asks SRK to go tell everyone that his name is khan and he is not a terrorist is the most prosaic of all prosaic stuff int he movie. And the fact that it happens to be the 'MacGuffin' of the plot makes it all the more painful to watch. And SRK and Kajol marrying just like that and separating even swifter s just utterly unconvincing!Next come the banal dialogs. The scene immediately after Sam's death in the ER when SRK comes back after referring to a dictionary or something(he finds out what spleen rupture is) Kajol tells him that Sam is dead using the most risible dialog of all 'time o' death 8.05 pm'clich\u00e9s!'That all hackers have to be fat dudes with longhair and beard in a dim lit room with lots of computer monitors around them' is a clich\u00e9 you must be familiar of and is found here(more reason to hate). And there are a couple of black American ethnic stereotypes.And the fact that Bollywood has gone this far to make a movie about a social issue in America makes me laugh even more. Don't tell me its a universal issue because you know thats not what i mean. There are a lot of social issues in India Karan and you try your hands at them. And Bollywood doesn't seem to realize how awful its movies are and that it isn't ready to go global! Summing up: My Name Is Khan is a preposterous, overly-long, boring, eager-to-please piece of crap!",

Let me try.Story: My Name is Khan, a journey of Rizwan Khan -Sir Shah Rukh Khan- to win his love Mandira Khan -Kajol Devgan- back in an unconventional but an inspiring way. It's story of a human being who on his way inspired a nation which apparently looks unrealistic but underneath it's real on term 'Hope'. A Phrase we usually say 'Chah Ko Rah' proves it. He touch you with humanity, with love and with his rawness. It's a journey of Mandira Khan who live an old song 'Hum Honge Kamyab', it's a journey of her fights and her iron conviction. In the end it's a journey of everyman who believe in goodness. Its a journey of a lesson Rizwan carried and spread unknowingly.Screenplay: Shibhani Bhatija is one who deserve accolades for her Brilliance in writing and sheer conviction in it. She doesn't sacrifice her write-up anywhere. If first half went in a blink of an eye, second half doesn't even give you that liberty. Shibhani, write more and more.Direction: I always loved Karan Johar's direction, whether if was Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. He is known for his Candy-floss Cinema, but he proved everyone today he is not limited. He is in fact sharing Top Spot in Bollywood among the geniuses. The angles, the layers, perfect. Karan Aced this one.Cinematography: Ravi K Chandran excels here with his top-notch work with camera. He surely is one of best Bollywood has today.Music: Shankar Ehsan Loy each score is a gem in it's genre and it's perfect use in movie without disturbing the flow makes it even more enjoyable. Noor-e-Khuda leads and heals listener in a magical way. Background score is enduring as well as intriguing.Dialogues & Lyrics: Niranjan Iyengar with his lyrics and Dialogues by him and Shibhani Bhatija are powerful.Performances: I always hold an opinion about Sir Shah Rukh Khan that he is best Bollywood ever produced but from this he openly entered a new Era of Global Contender. Sum-Up his career and put it one. That's Rizwan for you. He aced it. I read, i saw a lot about 'Asperger Syndrome' and i can say he nailed it. He proved his talent, this one surely should shut mouths of critics. And if they still argue, they deserve to live on Mars. Kajol, after a big gap came and won it all over again. She excels in her portrayal of Mandira Khan, a mother and a fighter. She gives her best performance till date. Evergreen chemistry between Shah Rukh and Kajol is visible on a different scale altogether. Supporting Cast as well is Good to Magnificent, Jimmy Shergill as Rizwan brother was good, Soneya Jehan was superb and Zareena Wahab was excellent in her brief role. Special Appearance by Vinay Pathak and Tarun Mansukhani were good too.Best Scenes: I still can't pick one here are few of gems.1-Church Scene. 2-Mosque Scene 3-Sam's death 4-Rizwan and Mandira Separation 5-Motel Leaving Scene.On the whole, My Name is Khan is an exceptional experience. In Rizwan and Mandira's Journey you will laugh, you will cry and in the end it will shake you within demanding some questions. Are we good enough? If audience can take 25% of movie home with them, world will be a better place. This venture of Karan Johar has Top Notch Story, Hard Hitting Dialogues, Stellar Perofmrances and one of best Directions in near or far times. Don't Miss It.5/5 Exceptional 'My Name is Mansoor and I Hope I'll be a Better Human'",

MY NAME IS KHAN is Karan, SRK and Kajol's best outing to date. Do I need to add anything more?A number of sequences are endearing. For instance, the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle, yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst \u2013 first, when her son meets with a catastrophe and second, when she confronts SRK \u2013 are truly shattering.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heard/read/watched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also, the movie states \u2013 and states very strongly, without mincing words \u2013 Not all Muslims are terrorists.There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction \u2013 exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation, he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind. With MY NAME IS KHAN, Karan takes rapid strides as a storyteller.On the whole, MY NAME IS KHAN is a fascinating love story, has an angle of religion and a world-shaking incident as a backdrop. It not only entertains, but also mesmerises, enthrals and captivates the viewer in those 2.40 hours. At the same time, a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a far-reaching influence due to its noble theme...MUST WATCH!!!",

This film is Karan Johar, Shah Rukh Khan and Indian cinema at its best.The plot is very new and different and the message of the film is carried very well by the characters. The individuality of the characters stands out in this film. Especially Khan's character who is very unique. His dialogs makes you laugh makes you cry but more importantly his innocence, childlike personality and his message of Love makes you sympathize and fall in love with him right from the beginning. Unlike most Indian films the humour is not cheesy and mostly never before heard. The message of love is about a bigger picture which may start from the love between two people but takes a more global meaning. Karan Johar as a director and contributor to the story line should definitely be credited for his work and deserves recognition. The scenery and shots are really appropriated and well done.Performance wise ShahRukh khan has definitely given his best performance so far. His portrayal of a person with asparagus syndrome is amazingly and artistically done in terms of acting on the same level as Sean Pan's performance in 'I am Sam'. Kajol gives a better performance at the second half of the film but her absence from the cinema shows in her acting during the first part, and although she goes through her own journey in the film and has an equal share at the second half her character is overshadowed by the strength of Khan and his performance.No dance number in this film unlike a Bollywood film, but the music is beautiful and very well placed within the plot.Over all this movie has taken the Bollywood cinema to the international standard. A must see for everyone. Even if you don't know anything about the Indian cinema",

Everyone loved it and people laughed at the right times, i heard gasps at the right time and there was even clapping at the end!My personal opinion and this is where I divulge what this movie meant for me. This movie has made me appreciate Islam even more. I always knew that it only propagated peace for humanity and love. The difference is with this movie is that it proves that. Watch out for the scene when Rizwan is in the Mosque...it touches your heart. The subject has been dealt with respect and the sensitivity has been realised earlier on hence such a powerful movie. The movie shows how the only difference in human beings is whether we are good or bad. Religion is the path we choose on our own accord to guide us to become a good person. The film doesn't get preachy but when you come home and you are on your own, you do think about the message of the film. People may claim that the movie is slow...but think about it...the film is a journey of the protagonist. When we are on life's journey, is it very fast for us? Or do events in our life slowly unravel infront of us? I am sure anyone with the right mind will see it as the latter. When you leave the theatre and if you are with friends, take my advice...don't discuss the movie until you have had 10 minutes to recall the movie and its messages. The film first hits you like any other movie but when you absorb the messages, you just realise that you went through an experience alongside Rizwan Khan. Also, Rizwan Khan shakes Obama's hand and I feel this happens due to Sam. Rizwan overcomes his fear of shaking hands to prove justice to the message that gave birth to his journey. I felt that love should be like Rizwan's. It should be unconditional and full of pure innocence. I feel so inspired by the message that the movie gives. Truly I do feel that I need to become more like Rizwan. The movie is NOT about terrorism, it is a love story at the core! The movie shows how great the message of Islam is and how humanity is the core of its teachings. The film confirms my pride and joy in having Muslim friends!Hollywood will accept this movie with open arms. This is the true crossover movie and it will be easy for anyone to understand. I believe the film is done in 40% English but I do believe that even if the dialogues are not heard, the film can still be understood. The acting is immensely powerful that the dialogues feel like a bonus treat for us. Good people will accept this movie and will welcome the message into their lives. Bad people will not understand this movie. That is the judgement the movie gives too when we introspect into our own lives. A movie that contains so many little but effective messages needs to be watched more than once. It is a layered film if watched with the heart and one cannot capture it all in one viewing! So here comes the crucial part. What is the rating for this movie? The movie does not meet the expectations...it goes beyond the expectations. Since it's positive in all areas, I am giving it a 5/5! Watch it to believe it!Rahul N. Singh - My name is Singh and Humanity is my mission!",

It was laughable in some scenes, and quiet frankly, horrifying in others. There will be people who do not have the benefit of education about modern political events and religious motives for the world we are in who will simply see the west as being barbaric racists whilst Muslims apart from one or two minor misunderstandings ( ie. the attack on the WTC and the pentagon) save the day for all mankind and humanity with their abundant and endless love for everyone. give me a break!to an educated audience, this move is jaw droppingly corny folly...to the uneducated, this is a serious propaganda tool.\" Black Friday\" and \" Mumbai mere Jaan\" aside, this film is further conclusive evidence that bollywood is simply incapable of making a film that can be believable and encourage healthy debate.laughable and embarrassing are the kindest words I have for this utter garbage.SK should consider more serious roles as he played the part of Khan very well...if only SK could read a script first before agreeing to work on such a pitiful project as this one.",

This is a straight drama, or rather melodrama because the emotion strings are all tightened to eleven but it never quite gets too sentimental and slushy. Some people have likened this to Forest Gump - the main characters are quite similar but the stories are very different, they both however have that similar awesome epic feel to them. Although this is newer than Forest Gump so looks a bit more slick and polished, it has an almost cosy 1930s Hollywood innocence to it as well - that makes is even more endearing.It's the fourth film made by the prolific and talented Karan Johar and in it he reunites the two stars from his very first movie which was a romantic comedy starring the now Bollywood megastars, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. As you would expect from these top of their class superstars, the acting is faultless, sensitive and natural so in no time, you will believe that you have known them all your lives so you will experience their tears and laughter just like they do.Although they speak English, there's also a lot of Hindi but you soon get used to the subtitles; make the effort, you will love it.",

It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!!

            "content": "This entire review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/02/my-name-is-khan.html Not for even a wafer-thin moment of the two and a half hour long movie do we see the slightest glimpse of the star Shah-Rukh Khan. The King Khan is vacuously missing his place is taken up by another Khan with a heart of gold who shows us the world in a different light. Gone is his confident signature (somewhat fakish) smile, to be replaced by the mannerisms demanded by his character.This is Karan's best movie. He was able to, with the help of an incredible script and directorial ingenuity, keep Shahrukh Khan from dominating the character he was playing. The songs fade in and fade out like a piece of weightless pastry that melts on your tongue, meshed in so well that you are in the middle of the song even before you realize it.When watching a movie that focuses on people with disabilities, one is usually bound by sympathy towards the condition of the characters. Remarkably, that's not the case here. Rizwan, through his righteous actions, slowly grows on us to become this endearing person that we connect with. Bhagwad Gita's principal teaching of Karm Yog (focus on doing good things without worrying about the end result) kept coming to my mind throughout the movie, which in itself is a little bit strange considering that Rizwan is a deeply religious Muslim.The success of this movie is critically balanced on the shoulders of three people, two of them we have already discussed, the third one being Shibani Bhatija, the writer of this movie. Kudos Shibani!!! This is exactly the kind of intellectual fodder that needs to be fed to one billion ill fed minds. The Indian movie industry seems to be slowly coming out of the creative slumber that it found itself in thru the 80s, the 90s and the early 2000s when it came to script. For me, with this script, Shibani joins the ranks of the thought leaders in Hindi cinema script writing, Pooja Ladha Surti and Amol Gupte among others. Even the lighter moments of the movie were brilliantly scripted (and then executed), like Rizwan's shy, face covered laughter on marriage proposal or Mandira's friend joking on death of all men due to bees.Kajol as Mandira was adequate.Now let's put my love fest for the movie on hold and talk shop.I don't completely agree on the number of hurdles Rizwan gets tested under (Asperger/Autism, 9/11, Floods, lethal racial attack on family). And the only justification I could find, it was necessary for bringing out his character and I am not convinced.I like to see the main characters undergo some sort of a change, like an uncut diamond being converted into a finished beauty due to the punishing and polishing experiences it undergoes. That was not true for Rizwan, he remained pretty much unchanged (OKAY, there was one tear in his right eye in the end).I also felt that some of the racial (re)actions depicted in the movie, post 9/11, on the brown skinned folks were a tad bit over the top.The TV coverage of this Indian who is the first one to lead the Katrina 'reconstruction' efforts is just plain unbelievable.Katrina happened in 2005, Obama got elected towards the end of 2009 so it seems highly unlikely that Rizwan, his brother and their supporters were fixing the broken church in Georgia for four years.Rizwan's brother had a university of Mississippi on a scholarship (given the time line it had the likely hood of being a computer related field of study) but he ends up being a herbal beauty products dealer. Something here doesn't Gel.Mandira's response to the Reese's confession is also bizarre. Reese who was himself a kid was threatened and was afraid he himself didn't do anything wrong, in fact tried to help Sam.The doctors potential cohorts showed an unnecessary aggression to know who the instigator in the story was in the Shaitan scene, as if the villainous doctor was the only one on the planet who had access to Koran. Haven't they heard about Google?Few more things, but I don't want to get into, primarily because despite all of its flaws, the movie is so well executed that I was OK letting them slide by.For me this not a movie about terrorism or love or disabilities but simply a beautiful poem on how to live life based on principles and promises.Mel Gibson might not have figured out what women want, but Rizwan Khan has certainly cracked the seminal code, they want to be listened to /really listened to/, and Rizwan does just that. May all women be blessed by husbands who have a slight sprinkle of Asperger Syndrome spiced into their personalities J ______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Not a single memorable dialogue in the entire movie including the title which owes its impact to repetitions * Limit the number of hurdles in Rizwan's path* Just because he can't express himself doesn't mean that he cannot feel or change* Change Mandira's response to Reese after confession* Correct the timelines between Katrina and Obama's election, which in fact becomes unnecessary if we reduce the number of hurdles* I don't know why it bothered me, it is really really inconsequential, but Officer Vaughn coffee cup was slightly tilted down, which showed that he was holding an empty cup, I would have liked to have the cup held correctly.

A seemingly impossible task, which a common man will never undertake,Rizwan Khan carried on and in the process of doing so..he touched the life of everybody he met with love and humanity,later to emerge as a national figure after high profile media chase.His message is simple, every Muslim is not terrorist,and people with Muslim names should not be humiliated. Kajol is brilliant as well, Kjo Direction could have been better, but the performance of SRK-Kajol..and the story manages to cover up his directional flaws. For me 10/10",

            "content": "Karan Johar's episodic, scattered and unfocused My Name is Khan is a laborious and unguided effort with the best of intentions but the worst of executions; a film looking to shed light on a disability or \"a form of high-functioning autism\" so as to help the rest of the world understand or be aware, but just comes to resemble a languidly played television soap melodrama between people we're not entirely interested in. Johar's film doesn't necessarily earn the right to go to the places it eventually comes to venture off and away to; a film which comes to spread its wings from simplistic and down to Earth roots to a searing; sweeping; Into the Wild inspired piece meshed with Fincher's Benjamin Button film that will eventually come to believe that the marginalisation or misjudgements incurred unto that of autistic people sort-of doubles up as a racial marginalisation born out of national reaction to a globe-bearing event.The place in which it is difficult not to begin when it comes to films such as My Name is Khan is that of Levinson's 1989 duel Golden Bear-Best Picture Oscar winning film Rain Man; a film that brilliantly utilised the 'road movie' arc to actually explore the general ignorance's, epitomised within Cruise's initially unlikeable character, that are incurred unto people of the titular Rain Man's ilk. The joy was in a realisation process born out of all of that misunderstanding and exploiting, Levinson perfectly combining the element of mental illness and the film's singular stranded framework to weave a heartfelt and emotional film about changing attitudes and shifting senses of awareness. My Name is Khan is no Rain Man, a film about a simple enough guy going about his business in America; getting married; travelling some more and capturing most of it by way of a DV camera and a notebook, to the point we have to ask whether or not the character's special needs characteristic is even necessary to proceedings.The film begins with an unnerving procession of shots in an American airport somewhere at the back end of last decade, the titular Rizwan Khan (Rukh Khan) fiddles with the pebbles he holds and mutters to himself as airport security pat people down prior to a flight boarding; the construction of the sequence designed to alienate us from Kahn, designed to misinterpret him; to fear him. When he's pulled up for making a snap remark about the then President George W. Bush, it turns out the kid is anything but a terrorist and is just, in the eyes of homeland security, a simpleton there to be mocked. The sequence goes a long way in trying to encapsulate the misthinkings and misrepresentations that the general outlook on a man of Khan's disposition consists of; the later reveals showing us all up for being so ambivalent in the first place.Prior to his journeying of the globe so as to try and meet Bush for reasons that later become clearer, Khan had a life at the very beginning of the decade just past; the passing of his beloved mother in native India pushing him off out to San Fransisco so as to work with his successful businessman brother Zakir. There are a lot of early Asperger's 'symptom' sequences, a montage of sorts establishing Khan's tendencies even at a very early age to succumb to what the condition demands: the sharp, effective memorising and ability to recite reams of information on menial things; the hatred of noise, large expansive events and big crowds and the ability to state precise figures and stats that he may have read \u2013 Khan's airport-based babblings on specific flight details, for instance, a typical symptom in action; an event designed to highlight blunt ramifications of the condition but really just calling to mind that of Hoffman's own Qantas related murmurings in the aforementioned Rain Man.Once there, the meeting with a young beautician named Mandira (Kajol) gives way to all manner of wacky encounters; one fleeting moment of interest sees them stand in a coastal park and speak freely, the city's high-rises dominating Mandira's background suggesting an already prominent integration with society as well as an unsuppressed and 'free' existence amidst all the buildings and such; Khan's is quite simply Alcatraz island jail, a highlighting of how his condition close to all but literally \"imprisons\" him, in this sense. One thing leads to another and they are married, the garnering of a step son in Sameer (Makaar) another addition to proceedings when it is established few men other than Khan would be able to act as such an effective father; an early example of Khan using his syndrome to win a prize where all other mentors have failed with young Sameer a slow bringing of the man's condition around so as to instill degrees of likeliness or usefulness to the man.Johar's film is too scatty in tone and content to truly get excited about, the film is rabid and kooky but then highly solemn as it brings everything back down several gears for certain instances. Somewhere along the line, the proverbial reign is let go; the horse bolts and tangents left, right and centre each open up mercilessly pushing our lead down each and every one of them. The will to explore the illness is there, the substance that comes with it most probably hiding somewhere beneath the surface; but the film is pure cheese, a television soap opera in episodes stretched out to an unnecessary length and aiming for places it doesn't really have the ability to go. The film may very well begin with the world, encapsulated through Johar's editing and camera work, shunning Khan but it will limp to its finale of the world embracing him in a melodramatic and contrived way.",

            "content": "5 reasons why you should see My Name is Khan (MNIK):(1) MNIK is an important film in the journey of deconstruction of SRK into an actor. (2) His critics would hate to read this but the truth is Karan Johar is one of the best we have. He is in total control of every frame of each his films. MNIK is no exception. Sadly, his deconstruction has not started yet. (3) We get to see actors like Vinay Pathak and Arif Zakaria play roles with hardly 5 minutes of screen time. The importance given to characters roles is amazing. Also amazing is the fact that actor are valuing the meat of the role rather than duration. Good start! (4) Ravi K Chandran's cinematography. He shows us things differently every time he is behind the lens. The arial shot where SRK is walking through the maze of electricity towers and wires in the Arizona desert is a work of a master. We don't have directors to challenge Chandran enough. (5) Strong messages.5 reasons why you should not see My Name is Khan (MNIK):(1) It assumes Hindi is the second language of USA - everybody speaks and understands it, including the 'Mr. President'. (2) Either they should not have shown George W Bush in the original or they should not have faked Obama. And what a fake, he looked a basket ball player more. An intelligent option would have been to always show Obama's back, never show his face. That would have been true to history completely. (3) If there is a place in their country that the US administration cannot reach to provide relief, trust me, a bunch of enthusiasts just cannot reach there with plastic covered cartons on their backs (Ref: The flooded Georgia town rescue scene). (4) The truth is that even our PM cannot meet the 'Mr. President' just because he wants to, leave alone one of us immigrating into that country. (5) A film with such strong and relevant message should be rooted in reality to be relevant over time. At the end, MINK is still masala messaging.",

But than it goes down hill so fast with very annoying stereo types, stale dialogue, dreadful cheesy acting. Khan didn't bother to give an authentic or even an own original , or forget original how about life like, twist to Aspergers Syndrome and copied Hoffmans Rain Man performance in epic grotesqueness.Everything beyond the 911 attack is not worth watching. All white people are racists and all Muslims are angry resentful crazies. Most irritating is the overacting of the shrieky Kajol who contributes nothing to the story except \"meaningful\" gazes, loads of tears and hysteria.Apparently this movie wants to send a message into the world but the only lesson to take from this is the correct pronunciation of the name KHAN When will Hindi movies step away from sugary story lines that leave the cast with nothing else to work with than making pretty faces and a meaningless boy-chases-difficult&spoiled-girl script?

The problem with My Name is Khan is the theme of the movie, they tried to hard to make the message come across. The direction was amazing, and cinematography was good but they could have used it for better use. One example was the walk in the park, excellent cinematography, but they used it in the wrong timing in the movie. The walk in the park should have been used in the second half because it made more sense as Rizwan Khan was about to leave. The characters were not believable, Shahrukh Khan did over the job acting. The problem with Shahrukh Khan was that he overacted in a lot of scenes, he did research but he did not recognize how it was going to be used. A huge overacting scene was when he was in bed with Kajol, and trying to close his eyes. Kajol was fantastic, I hope she gets an award, she truly outshines everyone in the movie. Karan Johar I wish you better for your next project, you tried to get message across to hard, but I'm glad you attempted at it. Overall this movie was below average movie, but it's still a one time watch for any Indian movie goers. 6/10",

I also felt they were shoving the fact that \"khan\" was very devoted to Islam way too much down our throats. Way too many Islamic references. By cutting out the last scene and any of the no longer necessary Islamic refs, the film would be shorter by half an hour, which is very necessary. The close to 3 hour length is completely not necessary for this tale. Khan did some fine acting in this film though, I'll give him that. Superb actually. Kojal did a good job as well.Overall, I'd suggest this film to people who barely watch films and are entertained by anything.",

            "content": "Karan Johar's sagas have depicted the bonding of friends, families, married couples and now, cultures within diversity. An autistic Khan's journey of redemption and clarification to the President of USA that he is not a terrorist, falls short of being epic because it so apparently glorifies its melodramatic and incredulous nature. The theme is potent and moving but the filmy execution in most parts not only makes it a drag but also unreal. We did not expect a docu-drama from the master of Bollywood melodrama but in the age of redefining story telling, 'My Name is Khan' struggles to overcome the expectations of a masterpiece about the aftermath of the War on America and its effect on an innocent Muslim resident. In the end, it just ends up being far better than 'New York' and 'Kurbaan' but that's not giving it much credit is it?On the bright side, the film has a few outstanding moments, courtesy some good screenplay and a fine act by ShahRukh Khan. His cajoling of Kajol in the cutest manner, his righteous teachings that he implements, the bond he quickly establishes with Mandira, Sam, Mama Jenny, his dedicated effort to fulfill his mission to meet the President and his one straightforward discrimination between what's good and evil. Like Rancho and Gandhiji, Khan's simple philosophies in life are didactic for the audience and King Khan's acting easily convinces us. Khan's asperger's syndrome prevents him from emoting during tragedy, anger, joy, confusion and fear but such challenges are once again portrayed well by SRK as he smoothly dissolves into his character. Karan Johar's direction of Shibani Bathija's story and screenplay seems thorough but lacks the editor's necessary scissors. While the musical score runs in the background without obstructing the story, it is essentially the melodrama and filmy angles that drag the film well beyond its deserved limit. There are too many characters who seem very eager to get as much screen time as possible, thus, digressing from our character's journey. While the concept of Khan's journey to redeem the tragedy caused by his identity of being a Muslim in the post 9/11 era is inspiring and epic, the enhanced focus on him meeting the President and having hurdles and diversions in that attempt simply takes the juice out of the concept. Yes, meeting the President of a country should not be such a big deal for a resident but making it such an ordeal of a film is what makes My Name is Khan a little incredulous and tiring. Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy deliver a pleasant score with Noor-E-Khuda towering above all other tracks with its music, lyrics, singers, presentation and pertinence to the movie's theme. Tere Naina and Sajda are hummable and sweet because it has the sensational pair of SRK & Kajol romancing. Although Kajol doesn't have the role of a lifetime, she still brings the energy and bubblyness that we have seen in her previous Dharma films. Though, sometimes a little overboard with that. ShahRukh Khan's portrayal of Rizwan Khan still has his trademark style in every scene but this time, there's more subtlety due to the character's autism. My Name is Khan is not a landmark film by any standard. Not even the best of Kajol, SRK or Karan Johar but it still is worthy of a watch because of it's theme and the various underlying messages it tries to convey. The non-filmy scenes including the one in the mosque where Khan is confronting Prof Faisal Rahman hold water and those are the moments you will remember from the film. Barring those few moments, the film is a lengthy drama in a familiar backdrop with some indigestible achievements. 7.092 on a scale of 1-10.",

The king of Bollywood really shows why he has got this name. The movie is a great experience and I will recommend it to everyone cause there wont be much great films this year. Actually this may be the only film that will be worth watching in cinema in 2010, for Bollywood. And please don't consider the comments from People who are comparing SRK with Aamir, they have not watch the movie, but just writing comments. SRK and Amir are the actors that are keeping Bollywood alive and we should be grateful to them instead of getting into those childish comparison. MNIK is a film that has a great story and Oscar winning performances. Thats why Fox has accepted to distribute it. Just go for the film and you will never look at life the same way again.",

            "content": "Some love stories are built on passion, some on courage and some on hope. Very rarely do you come across a love story that encompasses itself around a journey. My Name Is Khan introduces us to the world of Rizwan Khan, who mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal, but his vulnerability which makes him endear-able. The audience falls in love with Rizwan because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey, that you no longer root for SRK and his victory, but for Rizwan and his belief, which makes My Name Is Khan a winner right from the opening credits.His name is Khan, Rizwan Khan. Brought up in an unforgiving society, Rizwan battles the alternate evils of racial profile and scornful peers with equal focus, trying to make sense of the world that burns homes, bullies people at school and make a false show of sympathy. He goes by the doctrine of his Ammi, who teaches him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Rizwan carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.My Name Is Khan is appreciable because of its brilliance, acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Karan Johar weaves in a tale of love, faith, religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 160 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system, through the filtered sensibilities of a patient suffering from Asperger's Syndrome, one who cannot understand the world, but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Rizwan, Karan succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.The story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film, constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising, casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Shibani Bathija is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Rizwan through his smiles and tears , laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Bollywood.In the end, My Name Is Khan becomes the experience it is because of Rizwan and Mandira, essayed flawlessly by Shahrukh and Kajol. Shahrukh exudes the spirit of Rizwan in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Rizwan , who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by Kajol whose very presence lights up the entire room with just a flashing smile. She balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Shahrukh and Kajol form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jimmy Shergil as Shahrukh's brother delivers a matured and restrained performance while Zarina Waheb as Rizwan's mother blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Tanay Chheda is exceptional as the young Rizwan in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Vinay Pathak in a dazzling cameo.There will always be movies that enchant us with their magic, but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. My Name Is Khan is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will never be one Rizwan Khan, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.Earlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events. After 12th February 2010, the scales of humanity would mark the world before and after the release of My Name Is Khan.My Rating- 5/5 (Exceptional!!)",

            "content": "Karan Johar just keeps getting bolder as a director. The ambitious filmmaker who once debuted with a candy-floss romance like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai has ventured into issue-based films. It all started with his take on extra-martial relationships in his last film Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. This time, and probably for the first time, Karan's film isn't about romance. (Not the basic premise, however) MNIK is about a simple autistic man out to \"Repair\" the world.The big question is, does Karan recreate the magic of his last films? For the most part, yes.Rizwan Khan is an autistic man from India who comes to America to live with his brother after his mother's demise. Rizwan, who sees the world in either black or white, falls in love with a Hindu single-mother named Mandira. Against his brother's wishes, Rizwan marries Mandira and they are ready to start their happy life. However, the day that changed the world had come. 9/11 attacks occur which leads to the racial attack on Mandira's son. An outraged Mandira blames Rizwan's last name for the murder of her son and tells him in anger to go tell the world that he's not terrorist, tell the president he's not a terrorist. From then on starts Rizwan's journey of love, peace and realization.MNIK is Karan Johar's strongest script, there is no doubt about it. The plot is linear and depends on defining moments in the script. The direction is compelling and the screenplay is engaging for the most part. The biggest plus of MNIK is Rizwan Khan, the character. One of the best written characters in Indian Cinema. Add to that, the production values, performances, music - the whole packaging is excellent.Having said that, I do feel that MNIK is Karan's weakest film. (Yes, weaker than KANK) However, that isn't a bad thing since Johar has such a spectacular track record. Why I say this is because I feel the film drags in the second half more than it should. Also, the whole \"Hum honge Kamyaab\" and \"Momma Jenny\" scenes are cheesy at times. There is a scene that really angered me - it's a scene of an American teacher telling young children that all Muslims are terrorists. That is a horrible scene. I don't think that happened in most US schools during 9/11. I've grown up in the U.S. and it is much more tolerant than shown.A significant highpoint is of course the chemistry of arguably the best on-screen couple of Indian Cinema. SRK and Kajol light up the screen as always.There are some hair-raising moments in the film. Starting with SRK's first meeting with Kajol. One can't help but put a smile on. SRK in the mosque lashing out against a Muslim activist. The best scene, in my opinion, is when Rizwan goes to a church to have dinner with the president and is rejected. His response is applaud-worthy.The writing is superb in the first half. As mentioned, second half could have been better. Dialogue is outstanding.Shankar-Esaan-Loy's music is soothing and magical. Every song is terrific. Picturised well too.Karan Johar's direction is in form, like always. It's a tough film to make and he's definitely outdone himself when it comes to executing scenes. It's a great achievement.Kajol is looking like a million bucks. Her acting is no surprise, she never disappoints. Jimmy Shergill makes a strong presence.MNIK belongs to Shah Rukh Khan more than anybody. Rizwan's innocence, honesty and sincerity is all thanks to SRK. Every expression, line, just mind blowing. SRK lives the role and gives a performance to remember. From the scene where he tells the church about his son to his expression when Kajol asks him to marry her. Every expression, big or small is flawless.Overall, a film that has it's flaws here and there. Looking at the big picture, it's a film that's not afraid to be loud and clear about what it wants to say. It's surely worth a watch for brilliant moments, a great narrative and it's worth a second watch just for Rizwan Khan.",

Although people mistook MNIK to be a film on terrorism judging from the famous one liner from the movie where Shah Rukh says \" My Name is Khan And I am Not a terrorist \", it wasn't one.It must have required a sheer amount of hard work & dedication. Bearing a strong resemblance to Russell Crowe's role as schizophrenic in Ron Howard's ' A Beautiful Mind ', Shah Rukh Khan managed to pull it off quite well & enacted the role of an Asperger's Syndrome victim with subtlety. Sources say that he used to live as the character of the film even at his own residence only to perfect himself more & more.As far as the sensitive & riveting storyline, outstanding direction & lead actor's extraordinary brilliance put into the film was concerned, the films had all its points up as the contender for a National Award. As far as the story of the film is taken into view, if you listen to it verbally it sounds too naive since story of an autistic who goes on a journey to win back his love sounds a little boring but a Karan Johar- SRK film can never be so underrated & simple. It has to be powerful & poignant.Overall, on the celluloid , the movie is a love story; a genre where Johar has expressed his mastery before in collaboration with Shah Rukh in films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hain, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham & Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. However main focus of his previously directed ventures was on human relationships; may it be a father-son relationship or may it be showing an extra-martial affair .However, MNIK was bigger & dealt with some real-life issues, adding a religious flavor to it. The plot line is engaging as it progresses. Rizwan Khan suffering from Asperger's Syndrome stays with his mother & brother in Mumbai. \" There are only two types of people in this world. The good & the evil. There exists no other difference \" Zarina Wahab who plays Rizwan's ammi gives him the most important lesson of his life thus setting up the tone of the film. This message is the only platform where the whole movie stands firmly on as you see numerous occasions where Rizwan applies various other values, which his ammi has successfully inculcated in him.But soon after her death, Rizwan migrates to San Fransisco, USA to stay with his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill ). But soon a void is created in the relationship between the brothers as Rizwan decides to marry a Hindu girl, Mandira (Kajol). The film shows some of the really enchanting scenes as Rizwan desperately tries all possible ways to win the heart of his lady love & finally succeeding in his attempts. Gradually after few years of marriage, 9/11 tragedy creeps in & all thanks to the evil prejudices of the extremists, every Muslim in US gets frowned upon as a downright terrorist by the inhabitants and in such atmosphere even an autistic Muslim was not an exception.Further, Rizwan's step son & his only best friend Sameer gets beaten up by the college bullies & dies eventually due to internal bleeding. The cause of his intentional beating up was the fact that he was a son of a Muslim and this enrages Mandira who thinks it was her fault that she married a Muslim & out of fury, she tells Rizwan to leave the house who out of pain & agony, embarks upon a long journey to win back his love. His repeated failed attempts to tell the President of the United States that \" His name is Khan & he is not a terrorist \" showcases Khan's wish to broadcast it globally that even if he is a Muslim, it doesn't imply in any sense that he is a terror causing entity.MNIK is a story of this man's journey who inspires humanity in every way possible. A clear display of tolerance, perseverance, religion & the strong power of love is dis played in MNIK. It captivates you for the entire duration & keeps you totally mesmerized with some strong performances by the lead cast.The most emotional & lump-in-the-throat causing scene was the one where after being revived of the charges of being a terrorist, Rizwan goes to rescue one of the best acquaintances he had; Mama Jenny & her son Funny Hair Joel from floods in Wilhelmina, Georgia. The media covers the scenes of his rescue attempts & broadcasts it on TV claiming that very person who was suspected to be a terrorist is rescuing the flood- stricken victims in Georgia. Rizwan not only does good but also inspires it in every way possible.An artistic direction, excellent cinematography, an engaging & a new concept & award-winning performances by the lead pair itself make MNIK a worthy endeavor to bag the National Award for the best film.",

But as a MOVIE, the second-half of the film was terrible in this readers' views.. truly disappointing. To elaborate, the second half of the movie brings down what would have otherwise been a nice film. Things happen in the second-half of the film that will leave you scratching your head wondering \"Is this the same movie? The same director?\"The plot reaches heights of ridiculousness in the second half, with the main character becoming a \"superhero\", conquering the effects of a Katrina-type hurricane in the South (U.S. South, that is), and performing other quite un-believable acts of heroism that will leave you wondering \"Why?\" So it is a disappointing second half..In other respects, the film was good. The acting of Shah Rukh Khan was excellent.. though by the end, it appeared he had mastered a few mannerisms of autistic people, and then simply repeated them throughout the film. One might imagine it is not as difficult as it might seem to be to play the role of an autistic person...Kajol was phenomenal. She LIGHTS up the screen! With her exquisite face and that twinkle of happiness, and mirth that often lights up her eyes. She was quite fun to watch.The plot is complicated, the story is compelling and engaging times - until the second-half where the development of the story crumbles into ridiculousness.Alas, it could've been so much better...",

            "content": "I came into this movie with high expectations. As a child growing up in the US during the 2000s, I witnessed firsthand the country-wide anti-Islam movement that proceeded 9/11. Here was a movie that sets out to demonstrate that not all Muslims are bad people. Which I wholeheartedly agree with. However, I feel the makers of this movie weren't very creative or original in telling this fictional story.The protagonist, Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) is an Indian man of Muslim faith who has Asperger's syndrome. He has immigrated to San Francisco (pre-9/11) in hopes of a better life. After September 11, he and his family experience the backlash of the consequential anti-Muslim sentiments throughout the country. Khan sets out to meet the president and tell him he is not a terrorist.Khan bears resemblance to the character Forrest Gump. In fact, many parts of this movie feel borrowed from the movie Forrest Gump. Khan travels a lot in his pursuit to meet the president. While Khan never accomplishes anything quite as farfetched as Forrest, the filmmakers are overly optimistic about what Khan is able to do, making him out to be an \"unlikely hero\" much like Forrest.One of the things I really disagree with about this movie is the \"black and white\" classification of people. Khan's mom teaches him as a kid that there are \"good people\" and \"bad people\" in the world. This simply isn't true. Good people can do bad things and bad people can do good things.To take things a step further, this \"black and white\" dichotomy is reflected in race in this movie. White people in general are shown as racists. This is taken to the extreme in the cringeworthy scenes of Khan dealing with authority figures, where we as the audience are supposed to feel bad for Khan for being discriminated against and abused by white officials.Black people and people of color in general, on the other hand, are shown as angels who have never done anything bad in their lives. I understand that Black people in the US have historically been marginalized by society. Khan's solidarity with the Black community at the end of the movie is symbolic of how the Muslim community also became marginalized after 9/11. However, the way Black people are displayed is very stereotypical and one-dimensional.Khan's relationship with his wife Mandira (played by Kajol) feels forced. At no point is Mandira, a strong female character, explored. Her backstory is only ever briefly alluded to. She and Khan fall in love way too quickly. She just serves as Khan's \"love at first sight\" stereotypical romantic interest who worries about him because of his disability.In conclusion, this movie fell way short of my expectations. It was way too long, not to mention overly optimistic and farfetched. It may be one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. I saw the ending coming a mile away. It isn't fair in making white people out as villains to prove the point that not all Muslims are bad people. Perhaps really the only thing I like about this movie is the Bollywood-style music. As a white person, I don't know what it feels like to be a Muslim in the US in a post-9/11 world. But I feel this movie completely blows things out of proportion.",

I am not so good in writing reviews but maybe my point of view on this one is different from others , lately i have not seen any SRK movie being a really good one since CHAK DE , in terms of his acting and everything , in this one i agree SRK & Kajol acted really good , they do deserve accolades for that , and maybe that is why most of the critics appreciated it as well , my main reason for not liking the movie were following. 1. Death of their son made no point plus it was too extreme. 2. SRK going back to Georgia the whole hurricane issue made the length even worse. 3. Man stabbing him during that and the whole hospital issue. 4. The length and pace of movie it could have been finished in 1:30 mins but was dragged a lot for no good reason. and some more Story issues. The reason i liked the movie. 1. First half was pacey and entertaining with some good acting and emotional expressions. 2. Performance by the lead pair SRK & Kajol. Now the movie may break records in the early days on box office but during week days i predict it will fall. Still i give it a one time watch. 7/10 For Humanity.",

            "content": "My Name Is Khan mirrors this sickening trend that is prevalent throughout the world and gives a very very important teaching that is the utmost need of the hour-there are only two kinds of people in this world: good people and bad people. Wonderfully made and marvelously performed, My Name Is Khan deserves not applause but a respectful standing ovation!The story of the movie: Rizvan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) suffering from Aspergers Syndrome moves to San Francisco from Mumbai with his brother (Jimmy Shergill) and sister-in-law (Sonya Jehan). Here he comes across Mandira (Kajol) and instantly falls for her. She also falls for Rizvan's honesty and childlike-innocence. Both marry and start a new life together. Soon, 9/11 incident occurs which changes the way of the world in perceiving Muslims. At this point, disaster strikes in Rizvan's happy family life. Rizvan and Mandira get separated as Rizvan undertakes a journey across the length and breadth of the United States. His motive-to meets the US President. To find out what tragedy struck in their lives and why Rizvan wanted to meet the Prez, please watch the film!The film engrosses from the first scene itself. The initial sequence between Rizvan and his mother is beautifully touching. The film gets better when Rizvan starts leading a happy life in SF by working in his brother's company. But the best was yet to come and it happens as soon as Kajol enters the narrative. The number of sequences between SRK and Kajol in the 1st half is amazing. The 9/11 angle was wonderfully treated too. The intermission arrives unexpectedly. The shocking tragedy was also sensitively handled. And the entire journey of SRK is undoubtedly the best part of the enterprise. The film begins in a flashback mode and the way the film goes back and forth is worth appreciating.Another plus-point of the film is Rizvan Khan's characterization. Although he isn't normal, he has a very sharp mind, is funny, sensitive and very honest and innocent. Man, I wish we all were like him! World today would have been a better place!Kajol looks stunning and pitches in a stupendous performance as well. She compliments SRK very well and as usual, it was great to see them together. Let's hope we can see more of her! With her looks and talent, she can still easily give the current lot of actress a run for their money!Jimmy Shergill was great but Sonya Jehan leaves a better mark. Arjun Mathur who got a lot of flak for his performance in Barah Aana impresses a lot here. Zarina Wahab as SRK's mom is extremely likable. Tanay Chheda, last seen in Slumdog Millionaire, plays younger Rizvan in the film and leaves you awe-struck with his bravura performance! At the same time, the other child actors in the film-Yuvaan Makaar (as Sameer, Mandira's son), the actor who plays Sameer's neighbor and 'Funny Hair Joel' were terrific. Vinay Pathak was funny in special appearance. It was as every time great to see Parvin Dabbas on screen. Sugandha Garg, Navneet Nishan and Sumeet Raghavan were okay. From the American actors' lot, the actors who played the neighbor's and Mama Jenny leave incredible mark. Christopher Duncan plays Obama in the film. He doesn't exactly look like the US President but does a great job!Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music didn't impress me much when I heard it. But I have started loving it after watching the film. The songs do have soul and are wonderfully placed in the film. Sajda, Noor E Khuda and Tere Naina are the best songs of the lot. The trio's background score is fabulous too! Ravi K Chandran's cinematography is visual treat. Some of the scenes are breathtaking.Finally, Karan Johar is fabulous as the director this time. Making this kind of film is no easy task but KJo does it convincingly. He also presents the other side and nicely exposes how people misconstrue religious teachings and spread hatred. Also, the film has so many characters and handful of additional tracks too. But Johar is cautious to see to it that the film doesn't deviate from its central character Rizvan. Lastly it's an achievement that KJo manage to make a great film that is so Un-Joharish and that too of just 2.40 hours duration! Also, the past films of his production, Kurbaan, Wake Up Sid and Dostana have been different from his trademark films. So think twice before next time you want to be label KJo as 'candyfloss film wala' or anything of that sort!Some of the best scenes of the film: 1. Rizvan and her mom 2. Rizvan selling beauty products and giving their description to the sellers 3. Mandira's entry 4. Rizvan introduces himself to Mandira and her colleagues 5. Mandira proposes to Rizvan, which makes the latter blush! 6. The entire 9/11 incident 7. Sameer gets bashed up 8. Mandira's outburst 9. The entire journey of Rizvan 10. Rizvan's sequences with Mama Jenny and Funny Hair Joel (beautiful scenes!) 11. The last 15 minutesOn the whole, My Name Is Khan is without a shred of doubt, one of the finest films churned out of Bollywood. The USP of the film is SRK and its message, both of which you can't afford to miss! Contrary to beliefs hold by some people, My Name Is Khan is not based on terrorism like New York and Kurbaan. It's a humane film and such flicks are the need of the hour! It's great to see that the film has got a huge release worldwide. The film will be seen by more people and its message will thus have a far-reaching impact! Book your tickets, FEAR NO ONE and go for it!!",

Acting has been as good as Chak de and his attempts do work well to present a case of an alternate Muslim conscious. Its tough to get such messages across when popular understanding is so much in opposite direction. Music is not the high point of this movie; yet two main songs are already popular and catchy. Vinay Pathak, Zareena Bahav and Actor who played Obama did pretty well in their small spaces. Inital and last hour were well tied up and sequenced but in between movie did dragged a bit. Finally I felt that showing death of Son was a bit too unrealistic setting for a turning point. It could have been played mildly and yet message would not have been lost.",

I had this in mind before going to watch this movie and I was right. This was the most Nonsensical movie I've seen in a while, the director was confused about the plot and the message could have been delivered better.The Story starts of with a young Shahrukh khan suffering from Asperger's disease and as a boy has issues fitting in the society, he sticks to his mother and brother for comfort, but his younger brother hates him for being smart and close to their Mom. The story takes a turn when Sharukh Khan's character Rizvan Khan brother sponsor's his immigration to the US after their Mother dies. His brother owns a beauty products business and asks Rizvan to be a salesman, he stumbles upon Mandira (Kajol). Rizvan falls in love with Mandira and proposes marriage and promises to take care of her son since she too had a past(yeah right!) that her husband left her and the child for another woman.Moving forward after the extremely boring courtship between the two, they eventually get married (Karan Johar maybe stupid enough to think that was believable)and settle down with the son. Then 9/11 strikes and their whole world tuns upside down, Muslims were being profiled and targeted,her son Sameer Khan dies due to a so called racial attack and she loses her business due to her last name.Finally she asks him to move out of his life and go tell the president of US that Khan is not a terrorist. Rizvan then follows the president around the country, goes through many towns, repairs things to earn money, gets food from an African American lady called mama jenny in Georgia He finally gets a chance at a Rally where president is addressing students and shouts out \"My Name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist\" and everyone mistakes him for a terrorist and is arrested, after that he is finally freed after they know the truth and his help in catching a terrorist cell.He then by himself saves the Georgia village from floods and appeals to the world to save them. President finally meets him and apologizes and he goes back to Mandira End of story!!! The director seems confused about the plot, he mixed Asperger disease and racial profiling theme together, he could have picked one instead and gone with it. Shahrukh khan was unbearable in this movie, it was easily his worst performance in a while, Kajol was OK but nothing great, direction was awful and the whole movie didn't make any sense at all.The Shiv Sena is actually doing you favor, in my opinion DON'T WATCH IT!!!!",

This movie has morals at top notch that there is only and only one difference between the people apart from their religion. They should be either good or bad. The main protagonist Rizwan Khan, an Asperger Syndrome patient, grew with this line as his talisman. The movie too defines the journey of Rizwan Khan, trying to prove the world and specially the president of united states that he is a good man and not a TERRORIST.The concept of the movie lies in this punch line \"MY NAME IS KHAN AND I AM NOT A TERRORIST\" Being very straight forward to his storyline, Johar tries to capture the lives of the Muslims after 9/11 through Rizwan, that how a name could change your life in those times? Some scenes get shot beautifully showing the discrimination with Muslims. The movie although, too, justifies the actual concepts of Islam.But if we come to problems with MY NAME IS KHAN, you find its length a main issue. Some scenes would have been better to omit. The whole Hurricane sequence seems to be stretched in Johar way.Come to performances, Shahrukh Khan gives a sensible performance portraying Rizawan Khan but somehow, i should blame it on the movie length, the act sometimes irritates you. But no complains to SRK, he is just doing his best to keep you on seats.Kajol as Mandira Khan, plays her part beautifully. She should get nominated at least for BAFTA. She is getting better and better in her second innings in Bollywood.Some fine actors were wasted though in cameos. Pravin Dabas, Sonya Jehan, Vinay Pathak, Sumeet Raghavan, is among them.At the end, My Name is Khan surely deserves a stand for its simplicity. Its good in parts and tear jerker in some other. Worth a watch.The slogan is still the highlight \"MY NAME IS KHAN AND I AM NOT TERRORIST\"",

Hence showing India's free thinking attitude and acceptance of people of different faiths and backgrounds.And now he is out to show the world that the USA is full of bigots who stereotype Muslims as nothing but terrorists. With all due respect the attitudes of the majority cannot be accounted for by a minority of small minded ignorant fools. Yet that is exactly what MNIK does or at least what forms the basis for this film.The film in itself is nothing spectacular. The best way to put it would be Forrest Gump meets 9/11. It's neither here nor there. If you want to make a film that raises serious issues and educates people it has to be done outside of the Bollywood style of film making. No sooner have you put a big star in the lead role, the audience has already taken sides regardless of what the issue is. And when the issue is very much one-sided you have no hope of giving an honest account of the situation that exists in the world today.I must admit I thought SRK was good and showed restraint in his portrayal of Rizwan Khan, but I am just sick of films based around terrorism and 9/11.

This movie shows a man of peace and compassion discriminated against and hated for a religion he is practicing in the most loving way. He represents a majority of Muslims who seek simply to love God and others. After spending time getting to know this man, you than sense the overwhelming wrongness in accusing him of being associated with terrorists.A bollywood film isn't bollywood if it ain't over the top dramatic and this film is no exception. At certain points, you can almost hear the screenwriters saying to each other, \"Ok we know this is crazy dramatic. But, how can we make it even more over the top?\" I imagine some folks might rightly roll their eyes at such dramatics. I choose to accept it as part of its charm.Yet because of this high drama, it is often the simpler, quieter moments that draw out the most emotion. It is when Khan is talking to the congregation at an African American Church that we start to see the absolute ridiculousness and evil of racial inspired hate. It is those moments and others, like when he is pleading with a \"good\" girl to marry him, that we most connect with Khan. And we're not connecting because we are like him. Quite the opposite. We are connecting because he is so different and because of those differences, he is oppressed. Our connection is not in our similar backgrounds, for I am just a white Christian man, but in our common desires for those who are oppressed to overcome. He just happens to be the one experiencing the oppression. And I am on the outside, cheering him on.",

But the reason is unknown till the very last part of the movie.Dialogs, music, director, storyline, cinematography and even the acting by most of the actors are outstanding. Shahrukh surely has proved why he is called a Superstar.",

While KKL was an extremely well made look on the gloomy lives of Pakistani's caught in the turmoil, NY and Kurbaan turned out to be merely \"entertaining\" stuff. Now, what to expect from the king of family melodrama, Karan Johar. But, he surprised me .MNIK reunites SRK and Kajol after a very long period. Kajol i remember last in Fanaa, a film with a mediocre script, but raised to awesome levels by Aamir and Kajol's gritty portrayals.. SRK last really touched a good string in CDI... RNBDJ was more of a parody, a very good one, with real heartwarming schlock thrown in..MNIK deals with the post 9/11 issues with a \"special\" person and a very special woman thrown in between, who try to overcome odds, be it in a cinematic manner, to put through an important message \"KHAN doesn't equals terrorism\". Many wannabe reviewers have rated it badly, like those at PFC and even many here, but I couldn't get their point... Isn't cinema supposed to be fantastic? Isn't it supposed to be swashbuckling and epic in scope? And with all this, if it addresses some issues too, isn't that wonderful? Liberties are to be taken with a pinch of salt. I wish SRK, KjO, Kajol, and all associated with MNIK a hearty congrats for making a good movie, not just another \"coz i'm a hero, i'll be very successful in the end of film\" saccharine fluff like 3 idiots... Only fools call themselves Idiots, real people call themselves \"intelligent\"... Hopefully SRK wont go back to Farah khan's parody land ...",

The plot does not have any favorism for any religion or sections of society and still comes out with a strong message that humanity is above any religion and full credit goes to Shibani Bathija for a powerful multi-layered story and screenplay that holds the attention of the viewers from scene one.Shah Rukh Khan once again proves that he is the Badshah of Bollywood and if you enjoyed his serious performances in Chak De or Swades, I am sure you will love this one as well. Kajol is a power-house of acting and her performance tells us that talent is permanent and does not fade with time even if you are not performing. Jimmy Shergill does justice to his supporting role along with Sonya Jehan. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is always at its best and songs like Sajda and Noor-e-Khuda are very soothing to ears. Technically, the cinematography by Ravi Chandran is awesome, especially the ariel shots are splendidly done and crisp editing by Deepa Bhatia makes the overall movie watching experience worthwhile. I would like to tell my readers that though there are news that the collection figures of the movie has slide down in the second week, I would humbly request that checkout this awesome movie and decide for yourself. I am sure when you walk out of the movie hall you will be happy that you made a good decision and followed your heart.",

But the surrealism of his character takes away all the sheen from his effort.Influence of 'curious case of the dog in the night time' is much evident. But the director, in pursuit of acceptance as a matured filmmaker has produced a spoof 'forest gump'. The protagonist is made to involve in diverse situations as varying as lunar water and Tendulkar's tax evasion, in an effort to impress us with the complexities. The result is that the viewer is left wondering as to what the director is actually trying to say.The movie is not without good parts. There are good dialogs and scenes enriched with subtle warmth.

            "content": "My Name is Khan has a mind blowing first half. The introduction of the protagonist and his subsequent life until the turning point of the movie will keep you glued to the seats. Character development is done while keeping amazing restraint. Everything is spelt out for the audience but it isn't exactly spoon-feeding. You instantly connect with the characters and feel set for a strong emotional journey with the KHAN which the second half promises to bring. And thats when the movie falters. The by now world famous journey itself isn't the problem, it is the attempt to coat every incident within and along the way with the line of the year \"My Name is Khan and I am not a terrorist\". And it does get so repetitive that u feel that the scriptwriter believed the audience have short term memory loss just the way another Khan had 15 months back. And whats more, while many a sequences in the first half have genius written on them (eg: SRK's reaction to the proposal, god!), the movie post intermission, suffers from irritating clich\u00e9s (suddenly we are on stereotype planet). If proper care was taken, the movie could have had audience leaving the theater with tears in their eyes and a smile on their faces, but alas, it's an opportunity missed.Performances wise, the movie is brilliant. Everyone from the extras (including a presidential lookalike and a heart of gold American mom) to the supporting cast (Zarina Wahab is great as the smart ammi) are excellent. It feels nice to see Kajol back with a strong performance. The sparkle in her eyes are so captivating, and her chemistry with SRK so explosive, that the good old romance of bollywood feels as if it was never lost. Yes, there are certain places where her performance feels stretched, but it is mostly the director's fault. As for the man himself, one cannot help but admit that this is KHAN at his very best (yes, i have seen darr, swades, baazigar and chak de). He plays Rizwan Khan earnestly and with such conviction that he manages to tug at your heart strings. Even SRK haters can rejoice,because you just cannot find Shah Rukh Khan in Rizwan Khan. It is a stunning portrayal and a glorious display of the actor's range. No Rahul-Raj stuff this is. U wish you can give him a hug, although Rizwan hates it. What a performance! Technically the film maintains high standards, the songs are good, the cinematography, brilliant. A mature film from KJo? yes indeed. A welcome change from the director. Watch it, because whether your name is Khan or not, u really don't want to miss this Khan playing the role of a lifetime.",

As for the mass public opinion on this movies grandiosity , i just have one simple question for them just to check if they are as autistic as khan or not or are they so stupid . What made sense to them , when have they ever seen a person with autism do stuff what was portrayed by the protagonist in the movie ? sometimes i feel i just should not take into account any authenticity or accuracy of the reviewers out here , because its a given assumption that they are not as much retarded as to like this nonsensical plot of a so called film .",

If just three stars are to be dished out then Shahrukh gets them after Swades and Chakde India. Imagine only three movies out of so many where he really did act! Karan is or wants to be a storyteller but he doesn't makes sense! He starts to lose way after building up the tempo (Kurbaan bombed because of this reason) and what we see are gaping loopholes in this one, too (KANK had many!)! Where he elicited moist eyes at Sameer's death then bringing in mama J and son with cows and ducks and the hurricane only invoked guffaws and chuckles and groans: 'When will this end?' Everyone turning up in the waist deep water, and lo! A fanatic popping up to stab Rizwan (what the heck!!) seemed like the MTV pool party with shades of a black (pun unintended) comedy!! And if this wasn't enough, Rizwan instead of meeting 'the' president during whose tenure Muslims took the flak for 9/11, he meets a bouncer like Obama! Making it all very satirical! Why San Francisco or California where it was pretty peaceful after 9/11? Why didn't Mandira approach Sameer's best friend after what happened to the former? When Rizwan (the hero), a devout Muslim wasn't targeted or accused of being a terrorist, then why the Sameer episode? Did Mandira really loved Rizwan (to think of it? I think it was platonic and 'we are friends' from her side)? And hey! Was the first meeting between Rizwan and Sameer ever filmed (a special moment missing there)? Khan-Jo and co will claim conducting research etc re Islam but it's the red chillies brand of Islam \u2013 going by the company's logo. Be it who to give Zakat (charity) to, or marrying a non-Muslim such matters are simply divine, and not what Shahrukh and the other khans there would like Islam to be.

I went to watch the movie with a close friend of mine who is definitely not a fan of SRK (rather she dislikes him for one expression acting school.) She had some prejudices about Islam and Muslims like a lot of other Hindus. Previously I've tried a lot to make her understand but she appeared to be quite rigid on her views.

Sorry Karan, your slip is showing. Stick to your usual routine of making senseless fantasy movies. Now coming to the more serious part, the movie's motives are suspect as it bases its story on some insidious lies. There was hardly any serious fallout because of the 911 incident. The American govt and the Americans handled the situation remarkably well. But the US govt took care, and still does to ensure that such an evil act of terrorism does not repeat itself. Any govt worth its name should do that. For an unfortunate event of such nature like 911 , the fallout was virtually negligible. And to base your story on a twisted representation of this vital truth , gives away the false bona-fides of this movie. Karan will do well, instead to make a movie about Gujarat where just because some 40 odd Hindu devotees were brutally murdered - an unfortunate event no doubt - the whole state was virtually on fire with communal riots breaking out in every nook and corner of Gujarat, and with the govt being mute spectators. As to the aesthetic merits of the movie- SRK and Kajol are loud , garish and have overacted, and the rest of the cast, nothing much to talk about them. Music is about OK .

It is the most simple, pure & beautiful movie of this era. It is the story of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) who is affected by Asperger syndrome. He is afraid of bright colors, loud noise & strangers and unable to express his feelings. But he understands one thing which his mother taught him, that there are only two kinds of people in the world, Good & Bad, and there is no other difference. This is the story of Rizwan's journey to bring back his love, which also teaches us that love & peace is the only path to the salvation. Direction, as they say, is the backbone of every movie. Not even for a second I thought that this film is directed by Karan Johar, you cannot resemble this work of his with any other previous blockbusters given by the same director. Karan Johar had proved himself the Jack of all trades. The direction of the movie embraces you, shows the concern & beautifully teaches you the basic moralities of life. Coming to the performances, hats off to the God of acting, Shah Rukh Khan. Whatever I say for him will be of no value. Once again he had proved that he is the best. The command he had over his character was unimaginable. He is truly the genius of our times. You can feel your heart beat changing the rates through his journey & as he says to Vinay Pathak,\"My name is Khan and I am not a Terrorist.\" Although being disappeared from the industry for a while, Kajol hasn't lost her touch. She is simply superb. The innocence with which she portrayed the character of Mandira is amazing. Soniya Jehan, Zarina Wahab, Jimmy Shergil & other casting are quite decent & sincere at their places. Shibani Bathija has done a tremendous job. Screenplay of the movies is one of its biggest assets. The way the story unfolds is obviously magnificent. Dialogues of the movie are remarkable; my personal favorite is the one,\"wo khushnaseeb hai, wo ro sakta hai\". The art work of Sharmishta Roy is also outstanding. Music & background score of the movie is another brilliant work done by Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy. All over the movie teaches us the toughest thing in a simplest manner that we are greater than our limits, stronger than our fear and we are more than just a name.

No doubt the canvass is huge and the lead pair get enough time to show off their acting skills but, somehow it doesn't work for me. Three reasons: KJo has desperately attempted to get a far-fetched and contorted story rolling to a terribly banal ending. Those who have watched Dustin Hoffman in Rainman and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump will pity Khan's role as Rizwan. Then, the film is built on the 9/11 episode which has already spawned a generation of films around the world, including India. The idea comes too late and KJo attempts to be clever by making a film which makes a moral preaching out of Christian-Muslim divide post 9/11 and cash in on the American sentiments. Finally, you make a film to allow more screen space to actors just because they can act. Well, sir, you just lost the plot. Curiously, KJo's latest work seems a clone of his previous works KANK and KKKG. Same stars, same sets and same deliverance. The cinematography and music are a treat. So I give the film a 5 of 10. Watch Ishqia for money's worth. And, you will know the difference!",

The second half includes disturbing images of discrimination .In addition to that, as I said before,every actor performs very well.

In fact it is an emotional torture during the last 40 min....each n everywhere Karan Johar tries to work out emotions...which simply gets you irritated.....Climax was made pretty ordinary......and ended in a rather cheap way...Shah Rukh scores full marks with an excellent performance and excellently portrays Rizvan Khan..... Kajol was also beautiful and acted pretty well...in fact all the performances were above average.....but too many unnecessary castings makes the thing complex... Karan Johar was definitely not at his best form..... Avoiding at least one side line may improve the box office performance very much..i felt....As expected this movie contains the same theme repeated in 2 movies previous year( New York n Kurbaan)......In fact i would rather watch Kabir Khans take on this theme(new york) two more times than watching Karan Johars take one time....as the previous one is far more entertaining n captivating than this one.....Anyway i liked it more than RNBDJ..n one among shah ruck khans best performance till date....music section being weak is a big big drawbackStill i cannot hate this movie just due to this last parts....it was pretty much good till then....and definitely a one time watch is recommended....

            "content": "I understand that there are major differences when it comes to the background of the people this movie is about (americans) and for (indians). I also understand that Bollywood just happens to have a different agenda to Hollywood, where in the former, long-winded song and dance numbers are the norm and the stories usually carry as much substance as typical smalltalk at the hairdresser, which is fine, to each his own.However.The creators are trying to do the impossible here, bringing together Bollywood's simplicity and joie de vivre with Hollywood's showmanship and superficial but poignant narrative of social problems. It does succeed in not being Bollywood. It's very apologetic about even the slightest sign of this being an Indian movie, and does it's best to act like it's a western one.In that, it falls straight on it's face. I would expect these sort of one-dimensional characters in Bollywood and I would be happy to go with them. If -however- we measure them by western storytelling standards, then the actors are rubbish. This must had the worst cases of overacting I've ever seen from a western movie. The story is entirely predictable, the protagonist first succeeds against incredible odds, then falls against some hardship they've been building up for a while, after which he succeeds again, to find an even greater happiness and recognition throughout the country. This in itself is not necessarily bad, I can name several great movies with the same dramaturgy. The problem here is that narrative itself feels empty. No great truth is being searched here, beyond \"prejudices are bad\". Example: The plot is so thin, that the \"wisdom\" being repeated \"There are good and bad people in the world\" is one of the deepest thoughts of the whole story.I can't find a single character who had any life in them or wasn't made up of primitive stereotypes of personas. The lovable mentally handicapped, the struggling single mom who finds it hard to trust a man again, the conflicted, neglected brother vying for success and attention, even the motel-owner who has to fight people off with a shotgun all the time. These clich\u00e9s might be new to a certain audience, but I've been watching them since the day I was born and if you're reading this, chances are you have too.Stay away.",

            "content": "To provide an opening gambit, it can be easily stated that Karan Johar's obsession with the life of expatriate Indians continues and \"My Name is Khan\" is another refined version of that.The setting of the film is the US; 6 years after the WTC wreckage. Rizvan Khan (SRK) happens to be there who is an autistic patient with Asperger's syndrome. He attempts to meet the President of United States (Christopher B. Duncan) in order to give him a message (which is my selection as the title of this review). The message was a vital one having a long painful background for someone like Rizvan who was not gifted with the ability to express his emotions except writing it.Khan has been a round character. Other characters did awesome jobs as well. Shah Rukh Khan was absolutely brilliant as his expressionless-ness was the ultimate expressive aspect in the film. Kajol is always a candid actress and this film is no exception. Other characters especially Zakir Khan (Jimmy Shergil) is a round one but his seriousness has seriously been overshadowed by the acting of SRK.Technical elements in Indian films sometimes make us remember of the cheap technicality of Indian soap operas. But there are some refreshing technical delicacies by the Director here. The triangle composition of Khan, his mother and his teacher Mr. Wadia is simply great. There are some annoying framing errors (seemingly necessary characters and objects are cut out of frame). Editing is okay as the transitions are smoothly done. The inter-playing transition between past and present was not quite a blunder if not that crafty. The music has been an absolute stunner. An A1 job by Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy as always.Thematically this film is more than a family drama. The film tried incorporating themes beyond the familial confinement. Mentioning them would be simply repeating. But the main mention-worthy point is the handling of the theme(s). It eschews no vital aspects and yet reaches at a conclusion (however implausible that may be).The film is worthy of recommendation. Technical flaws apart, the plot is powerful enough to provide a good time as it ripples emotions of many levels. Worth giving a try!",

Having said that I thought that Kajol was a little over the top in some scenes...but I still loved her role.I must say that if I was not in a theater full of strangers I might have wept buckets of tears. I kept having to wipe my eyes. There was also a lot of laughter.I really have not seen a movie tackle this issue like this before.

He could not be match with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump (English) or Kamal Hasan in Swathimuthyam (Tamil).More over, the story goes very slow. that doesn't mean it is an art movie. I felt like the movie is ending, then I realized that not even Interval is over. :-/Entertainment? What is that? None of the songs you can remember after watching.

SKR the actor is the one we saw in CHAK DE India and DIL SE. SRK the star is the one we saw in KABHI ALVIDA NA KEHNA and OM SHANTI OM.Last month I saw two movies I thought I was not going to like. I went to see AVATAR with a preconceived notion that I am not going to like it because I am not a big fan of animated movies nor I like Sci-Fi as such. I am glad I watched AVATAR and I really liked it.The other movie was Three Idiots. My only problem with the movie was that the hype and feedback from my peers had taken my expectations too high and I though the film will not be able to deliver. It still did. I went to see MNIK without any biases. I went with an open heart and wanted to like movie and to be honest, it did not start bad either. It was the second half that ruined everything for me.The positives to start with areSRK the actor. He has put up an admirable performance. His body language, his eyes and his consistency throughout the film shows his ability as an actor. His dialog delivery, although highly inspired from Tom Hanks of Forrest Gump as expected, still is charming. He has played the character with devotion and sincerity unlike his KANK and OSO portrayals. Young Tanay as young Rizwan is even better. Comic scenes are decent.The research work that has been done for the movie. References to the Holy Quran, history of people and cities and Asperger's syndrome. Watch out for the scene in the mosque where Rizwan confronts a terrorist recruiter.Cinematography\u0085 the DOP has done a brilliant job and this is an area in which the movie is at par with Three Idiots. Just for the records, he is the same DOP that delivered Dil Chahta Hai, Gajini and Yuva.The biggest problem with the movie is its story. There is no story. They have a character of Rizwan Khan and they have done excellent character sketching for the man but how the story unfolds itself as the film progresses, believability index touches rock bottom. FBI's inability to find killers of a boy from the school creates doubts, Kajol reaction to her problem is ridiculous and Khan's attempts to save the hurricane affected people are funny. Surprising how he can reach there with the entire group and nobody else can. A few Bollywood touches in the end were of course unavoidable.Kajol is good but she always is. She does not outdo her previous performances, something we see Amir Khan doing in every film of his. Shibani Bathija is a weak story teller. Her previous ventures KANK and KIDNAP also lacked the killer instincts. She fails to take control of the story which might have a decent central idea.Karan Johar the director puts in a good effort to save the story. I am not saying a great effort but a good effort nonetheless. Karan Johar the producer, I have an advice for him. K Jo, please focus on soft romantic comedies. I have heard you did a bad job in Kurbaan and I have seen you did a bad job in MNIK. Leave the social issues to Amir Khan. Had MNIK been released in 1999 or 2000, it might have created history. It still might be a success because of SRK, Kajol and Karan Johar but it will never become a phenomenon. The bar for emotional movies has been raised by Taare Zameen Par and Three Idiots to a level that mediocre efforts will not be able to change opinions.I'm glad I did not spend my own money to watch it and watched it on special screening.My friends, My Name is Sami and I did not like the movie.",

Then flash back to his childhood, directly grabbed your attention, because it's so deviate from Karan johar style. The scenes rocked, impressive. Then start the romance angle which come across as a very mature romance still with sweetness and innocence. What we can expect when SRK-KAJOL are together, it lights you up.. Shah Rukh khan doesn't directly look at Kajol, OR DIDN'T TAKE her hand and staring at her like he did in KKHH or K3G or DDLJ, which led him to be the greatest super star across the globe and won billion hearts, specially of ladies, but he was able to win them more and more with his unique romantic style. Rizwan own you, again and again and more and more.SRK is playing Rizwan WITH such ease and shows what a great actor he is...The inidian treasure who is gifted with super charming personality+ skills, it shows why he was treated as the global known actor and why people are such close to him. The most importnant part is, people feel Rizwan's pain as theirs. SRK scored a century with that, cause the pain, the expression, the sadness which he give without a tear, he puts his heart out and absolutely giving the best acting in his career.I always believed, karan is not taking a full advantage of the capability of SRK's skills, because in I thought he is too emotional and don't guide SRK's takes when he doesn't give the best shot.But here he proves you wrong. SRK is in a such a balanced act and I believe that's the greatest act by a main stream actor in cinema, at least one of the....kajol, surely charming lady and she proved who she is..such a shame for bikini wear heroine wannabes who is just there to fill the screen and show skin. Bollywood is really missing her, she stood up with every scene and gives the ease performance.after the intermission, I felt I am watching the greatest movie of my life time. The first half is full with emotional, heart is at right place and I believe it's flawless.Everything is perfect, just brilliant, outstanding. bit let down comes in the second part with few over the top scenes, but lead pair fill it up,but i wish it could have been 15 minute less.camera, music is awesome and screen play is great, but wish it was more tight in second half.All other supporting actors are doing an awesome job, actually the lady who played Rizwan's wife was great.favorite scenes. 1. church one- the power of srk's acti9ng WOW 2. Intercourse for dumbos..LMAOO all laughed like crazy and \"can I have sex\" 3. Introduction scene 4. all SRK-kajol SCENES. 5.the funeral of Rizwan's mother 6.the way Rizwan's mother taught him to identify the good/bad people..What catchy was, there are many entertainment parts were there which I didn't expect. The awesome film which could have been much better in the second half, i surely hope they will edit it when it goes for non bollywood audience in MAY.I will go again and again, and I watched it with Nadee yesterday. Thank you NADEE for great help in ticket bookings, otherwise it will be difficult for me to watch it on first day, if not you help me.The film scores big time because it's heart is at the right place. perfect first half and good second half and OUTSTANDING Performance, SRK and kjo and kajol have a big winner. It may be less funny and mass oriented than OSO, but I hope it will get it's due in BO big way.Finally , I would like to tell, western world may have BC and AD for define world, eastern world have another definitions..but when it comes to Rizwan's act of SRK, HE SHOWED the definitions of him are not enough to define the skills of this actor. you go SRK, you rock..MNIK, watch it. The lead pair's performance and perfect first half was enough to give it 10 on 10.My favorite till was swades, I think now it's MNIK. But may be changed later, cause I already watched SWADES like 25 times and more I watch it, more I loved, hopefully MNIK will be same for me when I repeatedly watch it.",

Also I think we can find more than 20 films in similar plot released after 9/11. So nothing new in the film. Also I think the film doesn't have the any entertainment aspect. It can be describe as a journey of an innocent man to prove that he also belong to the majority of the world's population who doesn't support religious terrorism rather than a love story. The music of the film is OK but not like KKHA or DDLG or even KKKG. Kajok is OK as the film is all about SRK and his journey.

            "content": "There are many benefits to being bi- (well actually tri-) lingual (*toot toot*), clearly one being the fact that I can torture myself in three different languages and in case you're looking for new effective non- (physically) scarring methods of self harm then this easily replaces your cutting blade. Believe me when I say that I write this review with a metaphorical barbed wire coated weight on my heart (or maybe I'm having a coronary?) because unlike most SRK fans I'm a truly \"out of the closet\" shameless SRK fan, so watching this Parkinsonian dribble felt more painful than having your nipples twisted by a hungry, death rolling crocodile. From Karan's typical brand love story and the political propaganda message to the whimsical inaccurate use of medical and physical terminology, I felt like a college girl whose innocence was stealthily being robbed by five teenage boys after she's had one too many alcopops.Let's get to the meat. Firstly, my favourite, the so-called Asperger's syndrome. SRK plays an exceedingly inaccurate; inadequately written character that masterfully tilts towards the \"I'm a retard\" act whenever Kajol or the US president is looking whilst being otherwise perfectly capable (blame Shibani Bathija for that one). SRK plays dim whilst being completely sociable at times, lacks classic repetitive and restrictive behavioural patterns whilst displaying savant-like qualities and is fully self-reliant, enough so to save a drowning village, report terrorists to the FBI, kill Godzilla single-handedly, find a cure for cancer and oh yes, meet the president.Secondly, don't think the dastardly attempt at a Hollywood brand propaganda movie went unnoticed! I've always believed that propaganda movies were a Hollywood speciality, subliminally polished and buffed to perfection in order to turn their worldwide audience into stars and stripes loving drones ready to baptise their children in the name of George Bush, but it seems our beloved, potentially gay director Karu has also jumped on that soldier-blood stained bandwagon (I hate bandwagons). Don't get me wrong; the Islamic community is topping my minority ethnic groups of all time top ten, second only to chocolate coated gummy bears, but this was just scandalous to say the least. Why is Rizwan always called Khan (yes, he does have a first name, in case you didn't catch it during the movie)? Why an almighty Muslim guy with \"Asperger's,\" it doesn't add anything to the storyline (neither do the Wilhelmina sections for that matter), an omnipotent Muslim version of SRK's character in Kal Ho Na Ho would have played just as dramatically? Oh... I just remembered this movie is co-produced by FOX entertainment; the propaganda angle suddenly makes more sense...Positives. The post-911 Islamophobia was very powerfully and accurately depicted, the non-Indian actors could actually act and Kajol looks more beautiful than ever... her mesmerising smile and enchanting laughter coupled with those angelic eyes easily pinch the movie *AHEM* erm, sorry about that...Overall, this movie is to be avoided, it makes every attempt possible to prove the unmistakable \u2013 that autistic people can fix anything. The only way I see this movie existing as anything other than an obtuse illegitimate FOX/Johar creation is if the entire film and PR crew were held at gun point by middle aged Asian and black autistic terrorists dressed in pink jumpers and flip flops compelling Shibani Bathija to succumb to their demands. And did I mention this movie is just too long?",

Why And How He Meets Him That Is The Rest Of Story.Before Anything Else This Movie Is Great Teacher. I Might Not Think Twice To Say It Best Movie Ever Made On Earth (Personal Opinion Differs). It Teaches A Beautiful Classification Of How Homo Sapiens Exists On Earth. It Shows How The Love Could Change Ones Hatred.

Every Single Frame Is Beautifully Captured. Kudos To Red Chillies VFX Too For A World Class Work They Have Done.Captain Of Ship Karan Johar, Its His Best Work Till Date Without A Doubt.Music By Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy Is SRK's One Of The Best Album And Underrated Too. Sajda, Noor-E-Khuda, Tere Naina And Allah Hi Reham Are Gems. One Song Which Is Not Picturised In Film, i.e. Rang De (Its A Must Listen. On Top Of My Playlist From Last Few Days).Moving To Performances Kajol Is Treat To Watch. Shah Rukh Khan Rocks (Underperforms In Few Scenes Though) But He Is On Some Other Level In Many.

Hats off to Mr SRK for his sincere work with simplicity. For some people it would be over the top but certainly not for those viewers who can understand the character. I can see the movie could be nominated for Oscar due to its global message.The unconvincing part of this movie is definitely the hurricane scene. They could have edited this part.

I just thought i should share my experience with all of you so here it goes...First things first it ain't a typical bollywood masala flick! It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!This movie deserves a full 10!!Thanks and Regards! habeb Al_janaby",

            "content": "MNIK is all hype and low on delivery. It's narrative is boring, scenes are poorly constructed, screenplay is stupid and direction is senseless. I don't know why Shahrukh tries to copy Dustin Hoffman when he is such a talented actor himself. The movie is a colossal disappointment. The only good thing in the movie is it's opening scenes and acting by child actors, then the movie just loses it's way. There isn't a single scene in the movie which a normal person can relate to. It's one liners are bland and irritating. Scenes depicting airport security, Rizwan falling in love, Black child singing 'we shall overcome', Rizwan meeting the President, and busting a terrorist network etc. are too predictable and funny. Story moves forward incoherently and it's narrative made me lose interest in the movie within its first half. I could not comprehend what this movie was trying to depict? whatever it was, it just didn't come along. It's been almost 10 years since 9/11, and a lot of really good movies have been made depicting the effects of that horrendous tragedy: MNIK, however, just doesn't stand in their league. Overall, it is can be said that MNIK is one of Shahrukh's worst movies till date. It is disappointing in every aspect of movie making, one of the worst movie experiences of my life.P.S.: 1000 euros in Berlin would have been better utilized feeding Hungry Muslims in Sudan (that's in Africa)",

Karan(Johar) should have picked on theme and stuck with it, instead of trying the solve the issues of 9/11 terrorism, Hurricane Katrina-like events, Racism, Bigotry, Loss, Abandonment, Helplessness and Self-Motivation all in one film. However, I loved Kajol so much in this, she keeps re-inventing herself and I have to say her work with Johar(KKHH, K3G, MNIK & WAF) just continues to present her in a good light. I like the fact that this film was shot according to Hollywood standards. Shahrukh Khan just breaks your heart in this role but by now he's very comfortable acting behind Johar's camera than he almost did not challenge himself for this role unlike his fellow dream-team mate Kajol. The Wilhemina and Mama Jenny storyline was unnecessary as was the dragged out beginning featuring the mother and Khan's childhood. Like I said, the film very episodic, had way too many themes almost to the point that it almost all fell apart towards the end but other than that it was a good watch.",

The singing and dancing(which can be cool sometimes), the melodramas, the unbelievable fights, the exaggerated love relationships, one dimensional heroes and villains, the editing... I can go on and on. Suffice to say, I have not watched an Indian movie in 20 years.Then my brother in law shows up with My name is Khan DVD and convinces me to watch it. Which I do with great reluctance...and I'm glad I did.The film is simply put fantastic. The Bollywood answer to Forrest Gumps. It is inevitable that both films will be compared but still each follows its own distinctive story.The film is about an Indian Muslim in US called Rizwan Khan suffering from Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. He may be a bit off, but he is still brilliant and has a good soul. His life is guided by three concepts; a) There are two kinds of people- the good people and the bad people. 2)He must keep his word. 3)He never lies.His three concepts are put to the test when he embarks on an extraordinary journey to meet the Presisent of US and clear his name. And what a journey.The character was played by somebody Khan (Yep, the star is also called Khan) who I later learnt is one of Bollywood's biggest stars.(Why am I not surprised?) This man can act. Despite being unable to express his feelings because of his condition, you can feel his pain, his loneliness, his joy, his fear, and his sorrows. His salesman scenes especially when he tried his pitch on divorc\u00e9e was a hoot. I could not stop laughing. If this film was mainstream Hollywood, he definitely deserves an Oscar.Khan was aptly supported by the beautiful and talented, Kajol who plays his wife Mahindra and nearly steals his scenes. That woman is beautiful and their on screen chemistry was tender as well as electrifying. Both complemented each other perfectly. I wish I can meet that woman. She was so hot! Both actors were supported by a cast of credible actors. Mahindra's son, Mama Jenny, Khan's mother, brother and sister in law, Sarah and her son, the airport security, all gave credible performances.I hope the filmmakers made their money back and I encourage all of you to watch it.

Gone was the warm, quirky beginning and in its place came something that can only be described as a mix between an After School Special and a CAIR-funded work of propaganda. What's the old joke? \"Muslims fear backlash from tomorrow's terrorist attack\" Acts of retribution on innocents are to be condemned in the strongest terms but this movie falsely depicts an America steeped in bigotry and hate. In fact, Islam has mostly been accorded a special status in America since 9/11. It began that very week with President Bush insisting that Islam is a \"religion of peace\". The scene with the teacher railing against the violence of Islam? It's far more likely in the post 9/11 world that a school would insist its non-Muslim students learn a sanitized version of Muslim history, perhaps even asking them to wear Islamic dress or try a sample fast for Ramadan. This isn't a political board and I don't want to get off topic because the point is that these film makers seem to have only a passing familiarity with the United States, yet they made the country as a whole one of the characters in their film -- and in doing so chose to depict it in a very poor light.A grievous example of this was the fictional town in Georgia that appeared to be a Disneyfied version of an 1880's sharecropper village. One that has remained in the same ossified state well into the 21st century. Yes, some towns are poorer than others but can you find me a single example of an American small town where there are only cow paths and not a single paved road? Where every denizen resides in a ramshackle wooden shed? As embarrassing as this was, the post-hurricane scenes are even more ridiculous. A hurricane that lasts a month? A town completely bereft of modern medical facilities or any modern structure? The only ones bothered enough to offer relief are out-of-towners who come on foot? This may or may not happen in some backwater South Asian town during the monsoon but it bears no resemblance to reality in the United States.And so what was this all building to? The further deification of Barack Obama, it would appear. Was it a love story? A story of justice for young Sameer? A tale of hope and inspiration in the face of adversity? Who knows? After nearly 3 hours, the viewer can't be sure of anything other than it's time for another song.",

It showed the extent of one's love and affection towards others and the most important was the respect towards his words of commitment. A very touching part was the love between Kajol & SRK, and the way they got justice. This is a common scenario around the world that when some terrorists activity occurs in some place, a feeling of hatred spreads towards innocent Muslims too, but this is not true. Even they have good number of people and one should not be blamed or criticized without investigation. A very noticeable thing in the movie was that a man is hungry of love and ones you give it him, he's all yours. So worth watch guys. Love u SRK and keep rocking. Well done all!!",

In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again $RK shows he is the best.This movie should be go to Oscar..",

Karan Johar, please stick to formulaic nonsense. Serious cinema becomes non-serious in your hands.But it is SRK who takes the cake. An institution of horrible acting skills nowadays, the man simply shocks you with his overacting. One wonders whether it was this man who gave us the intense Baazigar, Pardes and Karan Arjun? The man has clearly lost it. Kajol is at her loudest best. Enough said.However, the little boy who plays the kid Khan was very good.

Therefore, I should share my experience with everyone on how it went! SRK plays a role by the name\" Rizwan Khan\" who suffers from autism known as asperger's syndrome and he married to a single mother \"Kajol\". Shahrukh's stepson, who was later killed by some school students, gave him the courage to meet the US President. The movie dealt with effects of racism raised after 9/11. He was the only man to set out to meet the president of the USA and shows brilliantly how the people strongly come over their beliefs. The movie became an all-time classic for SRK fans, even those fans who used to hate SRK. It is certainly one of the most touching & momentous movies which has been set out by Bollywood. This movie is basically a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Kajol. Though, due to the murder event of their son, their relationship is shattered and SRK naively sets out on a journey to clean up his name. He finally made himself clean after he met the President.I would urge you to watch this movie without assuming anything. It's certainly a gr8 movie!!",

            "content": "\"My name is Khan\" was published in 2010 and directed by the famous Bollywood-Director Karan Johar. In this story the main character Rizvan Khan (Shahrukh Khan), who suffers from Aspberger's Syndrome, leaves India after his mother's death and moves to San Francisco, where his brother, who used to be jealous as Rizvan was paid attention to, lives with his wife. He has to handle many new problems there.Due to his disease Rizvan, a Muslim Indian, cannot see anything of yellow colour because it makes him extremely nervous. Once walking along the yellow zebra crossing in San Francisco he all of a sudden stops in the middle of the street and is afraid. A tram horns in order to make him leave the street. But it scares him even more. That is when the Hindu woman Mandira helps him and says that \"it's okay to have fears, but they should not restrain you from reaching your aims.\" Rizvan falls in love with Mandira and makes every effort to win her love. Mandira's son Sameer likes him a lot and sees him as his father. Although it is scandalous in the Indian culture to marry Hindus when being a Muslim, Rizvan and Mandira marry and move into a house next to the Garricks. They become friends with them. Sameer and Reese Garrick are of the same age and go to the same school. After the 9/11 incident more and more Muslims are discriminated against, robbed, fired and insulted. Sameer is bullied at school but his friend Reese protects him at first. Unfortunately Mr. Garrick dies during his mission in Afghanistan. Now even Reese blames Muslims for everything bad that happens and ignores Sameer. When trying to talk to Reese one day on the football field a couple of teenagers join them. They insult Sameer and start to beat him. When they finally stop they realise that they have killed the boy and run away. Mandira suffers a lot. So does Rizvan, but he actually cannot understand what has happened, why Muslims are discriminated against and beaten. Mandira makes every effort to find the culprit. She remains unsuccessful, which is why she goes to the football field ones again in her desperate situation. Rizvan follows her and tries to calm her but in her anger Mandira shouts at him and tells him to go away. He asks her when to come back. So she answers that he can return, when he achieves to go to the president and tell him that he is a Muslim but not a terrorist. What she did not expect is that Rizvan takes it seriously. He packs his bag and heads for George W. Bush. Because he always repeats his famous sentence \"My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist\" he has to face many conflicts and problems. On the one hand he sometimes is not even taken seriously but on the other hand people are scared when hearing the word \"terrorist\". What will happen to him? Will he be able to fulfil his task and talk to the president? Will he see Mandira ever again?\"My name is Khan\" is definitely not a typical Bollywood- film as there are no scenes where everyone is singing and dancing. Yet, it is colourful and includes Indian music, mainly used as film music in this case. I am of the opinion that the actors embodied the characters very powerfully. That is why the film was so heartbreaking. Obviously criticism is levelled against the western society and the way they treat Muslims. I would recommend this to everyone who likes to watch serious films that also include some funny parts and love-story sequences. Having watched this, your attitude towards Muslims will surely change. I personally enjoyed watching this film. I had to cry a lot and empathised with the main characters. The way Kajol acted as Mandira and also Shahrukh Khans acting skills were very natural and realistic, which appealed to me a lot.",

I personally was very sceptical when I first heard of this. However the film changed my vigorous mind completely. I was stunned afterwards. It had nothing to do with the 'great acting' from Shahrukh Khan (a respected Bollywood actor). It had nothing to do with the film being from Bollywood origins. It had absolutely nothing to do with my personal taste in the 'drama' genre. The thing that greatly fascinated me was the (good, awesome, perfect \u0085) way this film showed what people are capable of, emotionally. Not all titles, no matter if they are Hollywood or Bollywood productions, have the ability to show the played emotion that is running through people's veins. Surely some do - think about Titanic for example. But normally it is too difficult for titles, especially the ones sorted into the 'drama' category, to make up THIS kind of phenomena (!).My Name is Khan is the best example of as I would call it 'perfection in emotion'. Although the film is biased (a lot actually), you are allowed to still enjoy the other side of the earth; sneaky, cold - touching down the shores of our humanity.",

But what resulted was a mess especially in the second half where everything seemed discordant. The only reason I gave this a 2/10 is that I really appreciated SRK's acting. He delivered a powerhouse performance which finally made him very credible to me. Last time he acted this well was Dil Se. Kajol was OK, nothing special. But besides that everyone else acted terribly....overacting is not even the right word. The movie exaggerated the reactions against American Muslims in the post 9/11 era and a lot of portrayal was black & white. I did not expect Karan Johar to stoop to this level of simplicity, especially since his last movie Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna addresses its theme so sensitively and masterfully.

Actually, in 2016, after watching FAN, I was very happy that SRK still can win hearts with his heart touching performances. In this case, MY NAME IS KHAN is an even older film, and it's his stellar act and the powerful script that make this film complete. I need not to talk about the story or screenplay; it's just flawless and we'll presented on screen. The technical aspects are excellent as are in every SRK film. Talking about the performances, SRK leads the film with his towering, eye wetting performance just like the one he gave in FAN released years after this film. It's mainly because of him that even that even some dull moments look refreshing. Kajal is good as usual. Other cast is impressive as well.The concept of the film is unique and the film demands you and your attention completely to not just watch, but feel it as well. The music is excellent and melodious. The editing is razor sharp but being a dramatic film, it could have been tighter, only in a few scenes. But that's not a complaint at all.Overall, MY NAME IS KHAN is a well made film that is a gem. Don't miss it any cost. After watching this film, you will definitely acknowledge that SRK is not just a superstar, but a dedicated actor too.",

And now he's back and already the hype is huge. And why shouldn't it be. Shah Rukh Khan is in it, Kajol is in it and this time, Karan has gone for a very touchy subject. Islam and America post 9/11.Personally, I was itching to see this, and not just because of the star cast and the production house, but because the issues the film deals with and to see how Shah Rukh will portray his character, Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism.From the word go we get to see the struggles that young Rizwan Khan goes through and how people do not appreciate what they don't fully understand, one issue being Islam and the other being autism. In true Bollywood fashion, the film is laced with sorrow, joyous moments and comedy and each emotion compliments the other wonderfully.Zarina Wahab, who portrays young Rizwan's mother is absolutely amazing in her small role and provides a wonderful blanket for the opening sequences that include some insightful yet some compelling Hindu-Muslim confrontations. Her wise words and wonderful acting sets the mood for the rest of the film.The jist of the story is that despite having autism, and a not so understanding brother, Rizwan Khan, helped by his wonderful sister-in-law manages to find work in San Fransisco and here he stumbles upon Mandira, a divorced single Hindu parent. It's not all typical Bollywood where sparks fly and the streets come alive with singing and dancing, on the contrary the initial scenes between the two are a joy to watch minus any fantasy type moments.Shah Rukh Khan is superb in every aspect. His acting, his comical timing and his realistic portrayal of this autistic Rizwan should be commended. Yes, he is a good actor but more often than none, Karan Johar has given him the typical lover boy role who steals the show with poetic dialogues. Well both actor and director have worked hard and the results are there for everyone to see.Kajol, though her role has slightly less screen time than one would expect is excellent. She looks wonderful but by staying with the theme of the film, there are no flamboyant romantic dream sequences and we get to see Kajol in a very different light. There are many scenes where she is without make-up and her relationship with her son is fantastic, if a little heartbreaking.I think the film is far too long though, yet strangely it works, for the most part. The intense sequences are edited well, with sharp jerky cuts and an enticing score. The songs are pictured upon the characters and no one actually sings the songs, which Johar should also be congratulated for, as he stays away from traditional Bollywood styles and incorporates a very unique, documentary styled aura.The emotional sequences are very very good and Kajol's attack on Shah Rukh Khan is brilliant to view.There is a sequence where Shah Rukh Khan, now trying to prove he is not a terrorist, travels the whole of America searching for the President, and he stumbles upon a small community in Louisiana. It's a very touching scenario that conveniently makes way for some of the latter portions.Karan Johar has tried to show that despite rage, racism, ethnicity and other issues that would divide individuals in today's world, there are people out there that will help each other no matter what your background, and although this notion is true and what most of us want, this film shows it far too conveniently and therefore it seems a little fake. Not only that, but Shah Rukh's adventure is so unrealistic that if a person with a bank load of money and the means to travel the entire width of America had ventured on this journey, he would have either died or been killed. So questions have to be raised about this portion of the film.But you should be able to overlook this and be intrigued to know whether Rizwan can make his life a better one or will he fail in his missions to prove his status and win back his love.Jimmy Shergill is wasted in my opinion or maybe it's because he is overshadowed by Sonya Jehan, who plays his wife.Almost all of the messages in this film are very positive and very brave but everything in the end seems just too convenient, which is where the film lacks. I may seem harsh because we all want a happy ending but when you watch the film, understand autism and Shah Rukh's mission, you have to sit and wonder, is all this really possible.BEST SCENE: Kajol and Sam's final moment is heart-wrenching stuff. FINAL VERDICT: Karan Johar has improved vastly as a director and his story telling is very bold now, especially with KANK behind his belt. The film has a very good message with some wonderful performances and as per usual, it has emotion, songs and comedy. This however is Johar's weakest entertainer overall, though personally he has no terrible films. The story is very far-fetched at times but it's still an enjoyable experience.",

He marries Kajol belonging to good category not differentiating on basis of religion as she is hindu to fulfill his mothers this wish.

The reason for his innocence and candidness is due to the Asperger's Syndrome. the story is simple but effective.Rijwan who loves mandira(kajol).Kajol is at her usual best and the chemistry between the leading pair is something to die for. but this is not a just a lovestory like DDLG or KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI.. in the first half of this movie,just a typical love story where rijwan falls in lovw with mandra ,divorcee with a child.but but there is something different story,different skill of acting to other movie. and the 2nd half...............what a nice...movieeeee.in this part we love rizwan surely.No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!!The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! for this reason rizwan and mandira lost their child for the last name of rizwan........KHAN. Then Rizwan sets out to see the president of USA to tell that he is khan and he is not a TERRORIST and it shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has!so 2nd half of the movie is center about rizwan how he went to the president of USA. there is another part which help to make a new world of rijwan is the SONG.TERE NAINA, NURJAHA,SAJDA... WHAT A SONG...AND of course my review is not COMPLETED without a YOUNG man who direct this movie...... KARON JOHAR..Moving away from all stereotyped roles,acting,storyline, this movie places its flag of its own.All credits to Karan Johar for telling such a complex subject in such simple words.SO It is undoubtedly one of the most moving & meaningful movies which has been spurned out from Bollywood.Go Watch this Soul-Tearing movie which forces you to re-think about the myths of religion,classes,communities & genders in which the human beings are classified every now & then..

Take any movie that deals with the protagonist having learning disabilities - the first initial reels are devoted to building the character so that the audience can relate and connect. This is where precisely \"My Name Is Name is Khan\" falters. The young Rizwan Khan, his special tutor, the demise of Rizwan's mother is so fast paced that practically it appears that the voice-over of Shahrukh Khan is dragging the audience to play catch-up, and in the process making the audience \"NOT\" connect with with the character of Rizwan Khan and left thinking why Shahrukh Khan is imitating Dev Anand and \"looking London going Tokyo\". Having said that when Rizwan Khan's life is turned upside-down, the same writing and construction is so powerful that you start relating to Rizwan Khan. Sadly by that point the damage is already done. \u2663 SRK:: I would not doubt even an iota that his effort to get into the character was nothing short of sweating cent percent. He indeed has done his homework well. \u2663 Kajol:: The audience would feel cheated if they are expecting sparks with regards to her pairing with SRK. Honestly the plot has no room for such. Yes, she still has a captivating screen presence. Zarina Wahab & Jimmi Shergill role seems edited out to make room for Rizwan Khan. Honestly speaking if the plot was devoid of the track, it would not have made any difference.SRK-Kajol-KJo - I am sure the audience were expecting nothing short of magical journey.

            "content": "how many times I watched this movie I too don't know. Every time with intention to watch some of the cut shots of the movie I just watch it full because I can't resist myself from watching it, only for srk's acting. coming to the plot MY NAME IS KHAN makes two strong statements... The first: B.C. and A.D. are designations used to label years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. There's a third designation now - 9/11. Post September 11, the world stands divided. Terrorist outfits continue to strike in the name of religion and the common man, not even remotely associated with these groups, is bearing the brunt. The world is not a safe place anymore.MY NAME IS KHAN mirrors the era we live in. Not a day goes by when you haven't heard/read/watched news of terror attacks and innocents being killed. We live in turbulent times. Also, the movie states - and states very strongly, without mincing words - Not all Muslims are terrorists. Karan Johar's cinema got more real from KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA onwards. In MY NAME IS KHAN, the storyteller attempts to make a social statement and succeeds completely. At the same time, it takes no sides. If the protagonist says 'My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist', it also exposes those who misadvise the youth with inflammatory and rabble- rousing speeches. Karan's take on the issue deserves the highest praise, since a subject like this is difficult to attempt. Final word? MY NAME IS KHAN is Karan, SRK and Kajol's best outing to date. Do I need to add anything more? Rizvan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) moves to San Francisco and lives with his brother (Jimmy Shergill) and sister-in-law (Sonya Jehan). Rizvan, who has Asperger's syndrome, falls in love with Mandira (Kajol). Despite protests from his brother, they get married and start a small business together. They are happy until September 11, when attitudes towards Muslims undergo a sea-change. When tragedy strikes, Mandira is devastated and they split. Rizvan is confused and upset that the love of his life has left him. To win her back, he embarks on a touching and inspiring journey across America. Let me alert you. The story unfolds feverishly from the very start itself. So if you miss a scene or two, chances are you would've missed some vital links in the story. The fact is, there's too much happening in the first half. Although the narrative tends to get leisurely-paced at times, the wheels continue to move from one episode to another. A number of sequences are endearing. For instance, the romance between SRK and Kajol is subtle, yet charming. But it's SRK's relationship with Kajol and their kid that's one of the best parts of the movie. Your heart bleeds when an accident occurs and their lives are torn apart. Kajol's outburst - first, when her son meets with a catastrophe and second, when she confronts SRK - are truly shattering. MY NAME IS KHAN's strength lies in the fact that you root for Khan all through. At the same time, you are weighed down when he's in a vulnerable situation, especially when he's labelled a terrorist and thrown behind bars. You don't realize it, but the fact is that you, as a spectator, have already got entwined in Rizvan and Mandira's lives. There's a slight hitch in the second hour, when SRK returns to Georgia to save a hurricane-ravaged hamlet. Also, the media exercise tends to add to the length of the film. Nonetheless, it's a minor hiccup that doesn't rob the film of its punch. There's just one word to illustrate Karan's direction - exemplary. One of the finest storytellers of our generation, he deserves brownie points for deviating from 'Karan Johar brand of cinema' and attempting a film that knocks on your heart and stimulates your mind. With MY NAME IS KHAN, Karan takes rapid strides as a storyteller. Shibani Bathija's screenplay is truly arresting. Shibani and Niranjan Iyengar's dialogues are noteworthy and many a times, applaud-worthy. Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography is awe-inspiring. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music gels well with the nature of the film. When a film stars two of the finest talents of the country, you expect nothing but the best. SRK, well, how does one describe his performance? To state that this is his best work so far would be cutting short the praise he truly deserves. In fact, no amount of praise can do sufficient justice to his portrayal of Rizvan Khan, who has Asperger's syndrome. His latest work is several notches above anything he has done before. The only compliment that I can think of is, SRK has a new screen-name now. Raj is passe, Rizvan it is. Kajol is pure dynamite and casting her for this character was the most appropriate decision. No other actress could've matched SRK in histrionics the way Kajol has. In fact, SRK and Kajol compliment each other wonderfully well and this film only proves it yet again. It's a powerhouse performance from this supremely talented actress. On the whole, MY NAME IS KHAN is a fascinating love story, has an angle of religion and a world-shaking incident as a backdrop. It not only entertains, but also mesmerises, enthrals and captivates the viewer in those 2.40 hours. At the same time, a film like MY NAME IS KHAN is sure to have a far-reaching influence due to its noble theme. I strongly advocate, don't miss this one!",

Indeed it was the magic of Kuch, Kuch and the earlier DDLJ that got me watching, and enjoying some Indian cinema. I'd heard that they wanted to make this film more accessible to western audiences, following the success of the British film \"Slumdog Millionaire\". Sadly however, this is a huge miss. And their advisers on storyboarding the film should never be hired again. I feel it could only have gotten worse if they had transposed the \"Georgia Hurricane disaster\" with the more deeply rooted Katrina. In that case I think I would have been laughing at their complete lack of understanding of western culture and simply shaking my head at this poorly scripted story. You need better advisers. I really wanted to like this, I did. The only lift was seeing Kajol in a major role with SK again. She continues to look wonderful on screen. Other than that, this was a terrible reunion. I just hope they get another chance to do something more productive together, and that Fox will give them another go. While this may do well in India, and open initially well the first weekend in the UK. I fully expect the numbers to fall off the cliff.A better choice for the return of this trio would have been a more rooted story of a Hindi-Muslim couple trying to overcome religious and cultural obstacles in their native India. Although I fear that is every bit as unlikely as this film was.",

The performances by Shahrukh Khan and Kajol are stellar and if there is any justice the film should at least receive an Oscar nod as Best Foreign Film.But I want to touch upon the notion that several reviewers have mentioned that the scenes in Georgia were unnecessary. I disagree. Those scenes were there to emphasize that Rizwan completely adhered to the lesson that his mother taught him that there were only two kinds of people in the world; good and bad. To the point of setting his own personal journey aside, he felt to need to help \"good\" people that were in trouble. How could we capture that notion any better than having him come to the aid of another group of people that were be subjected to the discrimination that he was feeling? Is some of it over the top and/or unrealistic? No more than the action film characters that survive exploding cars and jumps from rooftops with little or no harm to their bodies. It's a movie, people.My only complaint would be the one I have with all Hindi movies that portray Americans. I can always tell that they are British actors. There were two actors I immediately recognized from US TV shows; Tonya Lee Williams as the African American newscaster and Christopher B. Duncan as President Obama. But Tonya is actually British too. The actress playing Mama Jenny, Jennifer Echols, has made many appearances on TV; Dexter, ER, The Shield, Nip/Tuck, My Name is Earl, etc. And the kid playing Joel, Adrian Kali Turner, has been on Chuck, Numb3rs, Flashforward and iCarly. So, it looks like they went with American actors for most of the African American characters at least.But to say that Karan Johar should not film in the US again because you disagree with the view of Americans in the film is arrogant and is possibly the reason so many countries view us the way they do. All films paint certain characters with broad strokes to move the story along. Most of those stereotypical characters are based on some exaggeration of the truth. I am an African American woman who like Mama Jenny is a \"little fat\". I was not offended by anything in the movie at all. She was portrayed as a caring and warm person. Again, it is a movie, people.My minor complaint aside, this film is well worth the time spent. Great job by everyone involved. Great message for anyone willing to listen.",

His wife loves him and his adopted son has the best friend/dad he never had before. But then 9/11 happens and muslims are targeted all over America, even Indians who are mistaken for being muslim feel the hate and anger directed towards them, with many changing their lives around in order to create a clear divide so as to not be accidentally thought of as muslim.For Rizvan Khan (SRK) and his family, things go sour when Sameer is killed by some bullies after soccer practice. Mandira (Kajol) blames herself and Rizvan in her anger and anguish, herself for marrying a muslim man and Rizvan for being muslim. She issues him with an ultimatum to leave and never return unless he finds and tells the president of the United States Of America that his name is Khan and his not a terrorist.The movie is blessed with an extremely talented supporting cast and it's leads Shah Ruhk Khan, who does an amazing job playing a character with Aspergers, and the beautiful Kajol. It has a strong, moving and powerful storyline which will have you hooked from beginning to end.It also brings to the forefront the discrimination that us as humans treat one another because of differences in culture and religion. In the words of Rizvan's mother there are only two types of people in the world, those that are good and those that are bad.A brilliant movie that gets a well deserved 10/10 from me!

It is one of the considerable efforts to change the viewpoint of western people about the people with Asian race and backgrounds. One of the initial scenes of the movie on 'Airport security check' was pretty intense and clearly highlighted the dubious attitude of security personnel about the people other than American and European background. After that the film goes in flashback and it has been shown how Rizwan Khan was raised by his mother in a very good manner so that in spite of being suffering from autism he can become a well-natured, responsible citizen.After spending some time in America he comes in touch of an Indian (Hindu) girl there. She is divorced and have a son from her first husband. They both fall in love and get married.Things go smoothly till 9/11.. After that everything changes for Rizwan Khan in negative ways. Thus it starts the fight of an ordinary man for his self-esteem, his family and his religion.Songs are very good. And the performances of SRK and Kajol are excellent. But the direction skills of Karan Johar are not to the mark. This is mainly because with one such subject he could have done wonders but failed a bit to do so. Yes, Karan Johar do have command over family and romantic dramas. But 'My name is Khan' was a different subject and it had been better if Johar had gave the steering to a director who's having command over handling such subjects.Here i am not divulging much things.

Karan Johar is now a victim of the same condition that afflicted Sooraj Barjatya. Anachronism. He's stuck in the mid 90's style of treating movies. I can't believe MNIK was even funded (of course it's a home production) in the times of Kaminey, Oye Lucky Lucky Oye or Dev D. What utter and complete nonsense in the name of creativity and again how on earth did I pay for such absolute crap to be dished out!And what is Karan Johar's obsession with using America as the backdrop for his movies?? It seems to me that he cannot identify his metrosexual self with the straight Indian moviegoer and hence caters to probably a more accommodating NRI audience. As a result Karan has fallen into the deep chasm that exists between perspectives of Indians and the non-resident Indians in the US.It's a shame if MNIK is treated abroad as the Indian film representative of the times. For people interested in the state of the art Indian movies, please pick up any movie that stars Abhay Deol in it. I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed.",

The first half was really entertaining. But the second half was a bit slow and boring. first half:10/10 second half:9/10SO..overall 9.5. if you are making a Bollywood movie then it doesn't mean that the movie should be 2hours or more. you can make small with some good speed,then it will not be boring.

            "content": "\"My name is Khan, but I am not a terrorist\", At the Berlin film festival, Feb. 4, 2010 Following Polanski's \"Ghostwriter\" and Scorcese's \"Shutter Island, the third biggie of the first three days of the fest was the Bollywood entry \"My Name is Khan\" starring Shah Rukh Khan, arguably the most popular actor in the world today (though not necessarily in the West). In the film Shahrukh (known affectionately back home as SRK) plays a Moslem from India who suffers from a form of Autism, (Aspergers syndrome) similar to the role undertaken by Dustin Hoffman in \"Rain Man\" some years back. In the mood of anti-Muslim hysteria following 9/11 the protagonist Rizwan Khan, who has married a Hindu single mother (Kajol) in San Francisco, is taken for a terrorist on two different occasions because of his erratic syndrome induced behavior. Repeating his mantra \"My name is Khan, but I am not a terrorist\" in a salad bowl full of situations where unreasonable anti-Islamic reactions run rampant, Khan eventually undertakes a cross country trek to Washington to see president Obama in person and clear his good Moslem name. The political statements are laid on with a heavy hand by extremely successful Bollywood masala-romance director Karan Johar, and will undoubtedly be taken with a grain of salt by American audiences, although Indian and Middle-eastern auds will surely eat all this up with unbridled relish. In any case, the love story between the stricken Shahrukh and his frequent co-star Kajol is touchingly portrayed. A dramatic climax is reached halfway through when Kajol's teenage son is killed on a soccer field by a mob of enraged anti- Muslim Americans and the Hindu wife (Kajol) holds her Moslem husband responsible for the loss of her non-moslem son. It is at this point that Rizwan sets out on his quest to meet the president and win back her love.Intermission; Part II...Johar could use a lesson in US geography because Georgia is not on the way from SF to DC, but, nevertheless Rizwan finds himself befriended by a black American family in rural Georgia, which is then struck by a hurricane of Katrina proportions. Rizwan heroically saves many people from drowning and becomes something of a national figure on TV. When President Obama finally receives him it is both a touching and a comic moment -- oops --I was weeping out of one side of my face and chuckling out the other--at the naive, borderline Saturday Nite Live, staging of this climactic finale. An eye-popper for L.A. locals was the scene where Khan momentarily encounters President George Bush on his visit to California, filmed, of all places, in front of landmark Royce Hall on the UCLA campus. At the press conference following the press screening, most of the talking was done by a supremely confident Shahrukh Khan dressed in a neat black suit and hair more combed back than usual, as director Johar and comely co-star Kajol looked on injecting an occasional comment. SRK was extremely articulate in perfect English and basically had the assemblage in the palm of his hand, despite the fact that the overall press reaction to the film was decidedly negative. He tried to portray the movie as more of a touching love story and a personal battle against a physical handicap than a political statement in defense of the Moslem image, while the press backed off politely, not pressing too hard on perceived defects but obviously curious to see what a relatively unknown Asian mega-star is like in person. I suppose you could day that Shahrukh Khan is quite cool by any standards and doesn't need the adulation of the West to bolster his ego. He gets enough adulation everywhere else, and rightfully so. I don't think that even the most jaded Western film critic would question his acting chops or natural charisma whether they liked the film itself or not. -- Alex Deleon, Berlin Film Festival",

I just thought i should share my experience with all of you so here it goes...First things first it ain't a typical bollywood masala flick! It has India's most famous on-screen couple SRK-Kajol but it is not KKHH or DDLJ.... Directed by the supremely talented Karan Johar this movie is an absolute stunner!! In fact everybody(mostly were British) fell in love with SRK's character Rizwan Khan in the movie! Kajol has given a wonderful performance in the movie! I wont be surprised if this movie is nominated for Oscars! SRK plays Rizwan Khan who suffers from autism or commonly known as asperger's syndrome who is married to a single mother Kajol.. The movie deals with effects of 9/11 which shook the world! One man sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears.. The main highlights of the movie are SRK and the climax! Oh what a climax the movie has! You cant control but smile with lots of tears in eyes seeing the climax!! Once again SRK shows that he is not only here for comments and bad films(as people say)No movie in recent times has given so much of emotional attachment with the characters of the film!! The movie will become a cult classic for SRK fans and even those who hate SRK.. I wont spoil anything about the movie but i would say one thing: Wait for 12th Feb and book the tickets for the movie as soon as you can! And believe me it will change your life completely(and don't forget to thank me later! :)! The movie will break all records and set new trends in film making) For the people in India i feel lucky to have seen the movie before you but don't be disappointed! Better late then never!! I repeat whenever you will watch it your life will change completely!!",

            "content": "It's really unclear to me why this is such a highly rated film. It certainly starts out well, but that's the best that I can say about it. The opening scene in the airport really sets a particular tone, and I thought we were in for a dark look at autism and terrorism, which might have been interesting. The flashback to Khan's childhood and the problems/redemption he experienced was a bit clich\u00e9d in terms of the plot, but reasonably well executed, so I was still pretty much on board. So then we have the move to the USA, and all of a sudden the film takes a major shift in tone, transforming into a romantic comedy between Khan and the love interest. Cheesy for sure, but I thought, 'OK, this is an Indian film, and this is how they roll.' So I'm willing to suspend disbelief given the nature of the story. If you stop watching the film here, it will probably seem OK and worth your while. The second half is such a complete disaster it's difficult to know where to begin. The acting and pacing takes a serious nosedive as the plot elements are multiple so greatly that it's difficult to feel any sense empathy for the characters in any particular situation. This is particularly the case for the characters introduced in this section, who are complete flat. So I have to ask some questions: Why do we need roving reporters as characters? What's up with the inclusion of the Katrina-like event shows a portrayal of black people that could seriously only be filmed outside of North America (not to mention that the town in which they live looks like Sleepy Hollow)?Then there's the tragic scene that sets up the expedition to meet the President is so terribly filmed and acted that it almost comes across as unintentional comedy - this makes the subsequent plot elements involving this feel incredibly shallow. Oh, and on bad acting, check out the resolution to this plot element. Additionally, the confrontation with the cleric that has really dumb consequences later on (I was hoping it was a dream sequence when I first saw it). And for more minor quibbles, why is it that every Indian in the movie speaks with an Indian accent, even though some of them must be 2nd generation (particularly Khan's son)? Do American senators really watch news broadcasts in their office where the dialog is partially in Urdu?So if you want to watch the film, please stop after the first half - you'll save your time and effort for better things.",

The first are those who do good deeds- The good people, and the second are those who do bad deeds- The bad people.\" How many times have we heard this phrase before? Maybe so many times that now it is just another phrase to us. But even after listening to this particular, a very essential phrase we can ever come across, we still tend to hold prejudice to certain sect of people, be it either Muslims, Hindus, Christians or any other.Muslims and Hindus have been fighting against each other for many years now; it has become a part of history and is still prevalent in many parts of the world not just in India. But now there is an even larger war going on- The WORLD vs. The Muslims. And this all started with the 9/11 incident that shook not just America, but also the way Muslims where looked at.My Name Is Khan (MNIK) deals with such an issue. This is the story of Rizwan Khan who sets on a journey not just prove to his wife Mandira that he loves her so much that there is no limit to where his love for her can ever stop, but this is also his journey to tell the world that Muslims are not terrorists.Welcome ladies and gentlemen, to the world of Rizwan Khan. Rizvan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) moves to San Francisco and lives with his brother (Jimmy Shergill) and sister-in-law (Sonya Jehan). Rizvan, who has Asperger's syndrome, falls in love with Mandira (Kajol). Despite protests from his brother, they get married and start a small business together. They are happy until September 11, when attitudes towards Muslims undergo a sea-change. Post 9/11 Rizvan's and his family's life changes for the worse.When tragedy strikes, Mandira is devastated and they split. Rizvan is confused and upset that the love of his life has left him. To win her back, he embarks on a touching and inspiring journey across America.How is MNIK any different from other movies that are related to this very subject such as- New York, Kurbaan? First off let us not try and make any comparisons between MNIK and the others. All of them are different from each other. And if you are expecting something similar, then please leave your expectations back at home, because this is noting similar to the others.MNIK is a journey that Rizvan takes in order to prove to his beloved that for him keeping his promises is more important than getting stars down to earth. It is a journey to change the stereotyping done and assumed towards Muslims.Shah Rukh Khan as Rizawan Khan is just brilliant and is undoubtedly one of his finest performances so far even surpassing that of the strict hockey coach that he characterized for Chak De India! Playing such a character is not an easy job, but as we all know; nothing is impossible for King KHAN.Kajol as Mandira is just a pure delight to watch on screen. Just when we thought she was out of her much loved Bollywood she comes back with a strong performance. SRK and Kajol put together in a film we can only expect nothing less than magic and that is what is created.Karan Johar, one of the finest story tellers India has ever seen, has managed yet again to deliver something that will remain not just in our head but also in our heart for a very long period of time. Karan Johar who is known to make some of the finest love stories has done the same but this time he looks at love in a whole new perspective. Karan Johar deserves nothing less than a standing ovation for his brilliant direction.The screenplay of the movie is spellbinding. Shibani and Niranjan Iyengar's dialogues are at many times applaud worthy. The cinematography done by Ravi K.Chandran is really inspiring. At times you feel you are just staring into a painting and trying to figure out the meaning of it. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music yet again manages to strike a chord and goes hand in hand with the nature of the film.Zarina Wahab, Sonya Jehan, Jimmy Shergill, Arjun Mathur, Parvin Dabas ,Arif Zakaria, Vinay Pathak are all essential characters and do justice to their respective characters.On the whole MNIK is not just a movie, it is an experience. We all could learn a lot from Rizwan Khan as he entertains, mesmerizes, and captivates us through his journey. This is surely a must watch and must not be missed.",

It was irritating until I understood it -- then it was fascinating.I spent the first half of the movie irritated at the ugly stereotypes of Americans as brutishly hostile to both Muslims and people with disabilities. Karan Johar so profoundly mis-understands America that he gets nearly every scenario wrong. For example, if a clearly disoriented person stepped in front of a cable car, a mob wouldn't gather to jeer him -- especially in one of the most liberal and tolerant cities in America.My irritation gave way to fascination when I realized that the extremely mis-portrayed hurricane scene was actually about an Indian village in a monsoon. I went back and watched the movies as a allegory about India and it fits almost perfectly. For example, I've personally witnessed a mob of people in India set-upon a disoriented person, not just jeering him but beating him as well.Especially interesting is the inter-faith dynamics portrayed in the movie. While nothing like America, it's what I remember of India where the people generally get along well until some event triggers nauseating naked aggression, splitting neighborhoods and even families. But, even at the worst times punctuated by remarkable acts compassion.\"My Name is Khan\" is far more about the Babri Mosque demolition than it is about 9/11.Let me be clear -- American Muslims certainly have experienced a hurtful backlash after 9/11. Americans with disabilities certainly do experience prejudice and even hostility. It's just not like this movie.But, when you watch the movie as an allegory of India, it's quite interesting.",

There is this guy in boston legal who has the same illness as Rizwan and you should see his acting.I understand that movies like these have a message but its also supposed to be entertaining and not give the viewers a headache and say \" Go meet the president already ! \" Karan should go to see 3 idiots and learn something from that movie.And a little bit of spoiler here - but in the end of the film when Rizwan finally gives the president the message, oh wait, he doesn't, the president already knows. It felt stupid. And He made a mockery of himself when he said \" oh and John said Howdy ! \" You will know what i mean when you see the film.Kajol was good in her role.

All of you may know the story already or in brief.Lets forget that(its forgettable), 1.The romance part acted by the famous duo is so clumsy and lame,that you may want to see at least one scene where your heart moves with the actors,but NO!its fake,overacted and in-convincing because there is nothing that can make the actors fall in love in the movie,but still they fall because they have to.Forget good cinema,if you are looking for the usual bollywood romantic flick,this one is an attempt to prove itself different but alas falls halfway between both. 2.Aspergers syndrome,hmmm...well its more like a mix of mental retardation + selective aspergers syndrome because the hero combs his hair and gels it to perfection no matter what(even when he comes out from neck high water he doesn't forget to style back his hair),dresses well,overacts and shakes his voice too much,which gives us a feeling that he is mentally retarded or is feeling cold,he is emotionally attached to his wife(aspergers-lack of empathy to people,even when the kid dies he runs to get evidence on the cause of his death)but still does everything for getting back her love because he is hurt,the hero is brilliant in all areas or topics,a genius whereas another typical feature of aspergers is limited areas of interest usually confined to one or two topics and also limited.i am pointing these things because these are the most important factors in the movie.i saw 'ADAM' before seeing this and Hugh Dancy enacting this disorder is so close to reality whereas Shahrukh's is close to a disaster. 3.the Killing-even though the FBI/police has no evidence on the killing,they identify that the killing is communal.how?remains a mystery.the whole provocation for the killing has a far margin to the incidents of the film,and the child's surname is a very lame reason for the happenings!!!anyways,story moves... 4.the meeting with the president-one of the big things and i was hoping as something at least to look for in the movie,the highlight of the movie as you may say-is sadly the worst part.Absolutely nothing happens in the meeting,even a possible interesting conversation between the president and this interesting hero turns out to be MUTED and we hear what kajols thoughts about the incidents are??Was the director running away because he knew the script was weak?Come'on this guy travels whole of America and saves an entire flock of people from a flooded city which the American govt.,has given up,becomes the media's VVIP,meets the president and says hello,how are you,i am not a terrorist and president says yes,glad to know!hi to your wife and sorry about your son,TC...i waited till the last thinking the last part would give up something good,but ALAS..phew!!! In short,a terrible movie,the director should be thinking 3 times before publicizing this,of course its hard work but these kind of movies kills movies slowly.If you love good cinema please avoid this one.And last but not least,there are no good songs(if you are looking for one)!!!",

Preview:This movie is about a man named Rizvan who embarks on a journey all across United States of America just to prove his love and that he is not a terrorist. Direction:This movie is directed by Karan Johar who has given masterpieces like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham,Kal Ho Na Ho etc and yet this time nothing less was expected from him.He is very sincere to his work.He directs a movie and takes his time to move on to next movie but his work is nothing but pure class and hard work.He direction is very good in MNIK(My Name Is Khan).Set in America this movie shows his hard work.He has done a great job.He always knows what he wants from his actors and his writers.Acting:This whole movie is driven by non other than Shah Rukh Khan.Ifit wasn't for him maybe this movie wouldn't have gotten this mush praise and hype no matter how great direction was because the character of Rizvan is such a complicated character that nobody could pull this off.He put in a a lot of hard work preparing for this character.His acting is just unbelievably awesome and upto the level of Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson. And then comes Kajol who is evergreen as always. She nails her character very much and gives her best.Story:Writers did a great job because writing something like this is very difficult job but they did really very well. Music :An other great aspect of this movie is its soundtrack and other songs which add even much soul into movie. Overall:At the end its a much watch for everyone cause something like this is out there and you are missing it.So go now grab a DVD and get yourself mesmerized by this masterpiece.",

Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are always a pleasure to see paired together as on-screen lovers, but this is their best together as husband and wife, Rizwan and Mandira. You are there with the characters all the way through this movie, and that's always a great thing with any movie, feeling with the characters, and that's most certainly what you will do with this movie as you watch all the up and downs the main character goes through. From his close relationship with his mother despite his autism, falling in love, finding home and family, watching as he slowly loses all he has gained after the crisis of 9/11, and then how he tries to get it back. This film is extremely moving and touching, I would watch it again anytime!",

            "content": "Being a fan of SRKajol as well as of KJo I was really looking forward to watch this movie but i was quite disappointed. While the actors do an alright job (although i must say i've seen a cut version and a lot of the scenes that i expected to have been nice were just not in the movie...) the story is just not well done. And when German critics tell that Shibani Bathija should NOT be writing screenplays i totally agree with them.While the love story between SRK and Kajol was maybe not too believable but quite charming the rest of the movie was just too much.Let's see what this movie is about: Racism. Autism. Hurricanes. Losing a child. Knowing that you should already lower your expectations because a movie can just not be long enough to handle all these issues appropriately. And indeed it fails.Knowing some stuff about Asperger Syndrome i found the movie offensive towards people who suffer from that disease. Check out only two or three youtube videos on asperger and you will know why. Disabilities are a very sensitive issue and should not be overacted.Next thing: Racism. Being a naturally blonde girl who has a Muslim hairdresser as well as a Muslim best friend i found this movie offensive towards myself because white people are shown to be pure evil. Even the good white guys just give birth to the worst boy ever. I think racism is an important topic that needs to be handled all over the world but please do it with care, not black and white. There has been a backlash in the US after 9/11 and i do think it is a sad issue to handle with care but here it is just too much. So dear Bollywood: If you want to reach out on the Western Market please chose another way. Please! Then the death of Mandiras only son: a collateral damage that is just necessary to keep the story going.Then the Hurricane: most of these scenes were cut out of the version i have seen but what i have seen did not make sense at all and was not credible either.Then the end: totally cheesy. And also a little confusing because the timeline of the movie does not work. 9/11 was in 2001. Barack Obama was elected 2008. Somehow the story doesn't seem to last 7 years.Let me just add i do not agree with the sentence \"There are only good or bad people.\" Wrong! There is no person that has never done something that is not good and surely there is no person that has never done something that is good either. Reducing a person to just \"bad\" or \"good\" is totally simplifying the human race. Just don't do it if you don't want a black and white movie.All in all i dare say i left the cinema rather disappointed and I really hope Karan will either stick on to some more romance (he is WAY better at that) or just do some research before trying to make a movie on serious issues.",

Whenever it's supposed to be serious it comes off as childish and it's gob-smackingly obvious that the director is as green as they come. The main actress aroused interest, she seems to hold her end, playing quite nicely a kooky, perky, free-spirited young woman and a desperate, angry, depressed wreck, so her acting arsenal is quite well stocked. The protagonist was ok, don't know much about Asperger's, so I can't pronounce myself, although the movie does mention at the start that they take some artistic license with the condition.If it wasn't obvious from the score, I don't recommend it! There are great indian films out there, but this one approaches Bollywood quality too much, and that's undesirable.",

But also his worst performances like HNY,Dilwale and probably badshaah but this was out of my expectation.Shahrukh can act to such a level was a treat,there was a moment I actually controlling myself tearing eyes when he gave a speech for his kid which died because of his last name-KHAN,in the church on the occasion of martyr's memorial,that was outstanding,the moment he saves his mamma jenny in flooded America's town where she along with his kid and community members stay was joyous and believe me as PAUL COELHO(THE Oscar WINNING WRITER) said \"khan could win an Oscar for the movie\",the movie was worth it.It will lit you ask questions-whether the Muslim community to be blamed for 9/11 or the evil soul?Movie is full of performances but It has a good message too!!",

The plot of this film takes the viewer on an emotional roller coaster through the life of Rizwan Khan. Khan's Asperger's syndrome is a key element that helps him create meaningful connections with many different people. His syndrome prohibits him from preserving others emotional needs, but it helps him take into action the literal definitions of love and goodness.A crucial element to the theme of this film is the scene in the beginning of the movie when Khan's mother tells him \"There are only two kinds of people in this world. Good people who do good deeds. And bad people who do bad. That's the only difference in human beings. There's no other difference.\" This scene alone boils down the main characters world view. The good vs. bad theme plays into most of the grouping of the film. Khan and his brother are a good example, Khan demonstrates tolerance, love, and kindness the opposite attributes his brother holds. Another grouping of good and bad would be the female Indian FBI agent and the white male FBI agent. There are also many religious examples of Hindus and Muslims. The primary example would be Khan and Mandira, but there is also Mandira and her sister in-law, the Hindu hotel owner and Khan, finally Khan and the Doctor from the temple. A large majority of the \"bad\" people in this movie are white Americans, while the people who help Khan the most tend to be Indian or American racial minorities. This induction shows that oppressed groups can help themselves. Love is immortal",

SRK was overacting(may be too thrilled with the topic of movie?) at his worst and Kajol was always on high decibel for no reason. Mr. Karan Johar can only tell how Khan landed up in Wilmington. Story has so many flaws.It often gave impression there are two climaxes running at the same time. One is Kajol searching for murderers and other is SRK looking for Mr. President and both climaxes negate each other. When this was not enough, Mr Johar introduces us a Mama Jenny and extend the story to just give a feeling of patches in a story. This is not the movie i could watch in one sitting,it's just so boring and SRK's acting was obnoxious.Don't waste your time and money to regret later!

I felt the message shallow, half of the movie is wasted in typical love story which early on keeps one not missing the feeling of what is the point. Amir Khan would agree that some punch was missing, may be due to American setting. I am not seeing it selling in US well or going for any Oscar. The Americans for whom this movie was made don't watch movies much and those who watch their thoughts are not influenced by one movie. Effort is commendable and no one in industry can do better than SRK such a theme ( except Amir Khan). with Autism, SRK has handicapped his power, he got stuck with two themes, thinking he will carry one over the shoulder of other but in my opinion it did not work. Amitabh in PAA was carrying only one theme and a story.",

He always cries and rip his lips the same acting all the time. Its so boring.This story from 9/11 is the world common story. 100% Indians whether living in U.S. itself know it. They faced it. So the story is not new. More than 10 movies already been made on this topic. So Please For God Sake use your mind before you write anythingDO NOT WRITE GREAT STORY.I give this rating 1/10",

            "content": "A friend from another country suggested that I watch this movie because she loved it. However, she didn't grow up and still doesn't live in the United States. I have a feeling that a lot of these 10/10 ratings come from outsiders as well.First things first - I found this portrayal of \"high-functioning Asperger's syndrome\" to be unlike any other any person I've met with \"high-functioning Asperger's syndrome.\" I thought it was really odd and overdramatic.Second, I find it very hard to believe that this gorgeous woman with a thriving career, perfect personality, and generous heart would marry this man because he showed her a sight she hadn't seen before. Sure, he was nice and kind hearted, but come on! Is this a rom-com where any man, regardless of quirks, can marry the perfect woman with little to no effort?Third, I'll repeat my question. Was this a rom-com? I'm not sure what genre this movie falls under. I thought it was about a Muslim man with a Hindu family who all suffered after 9/11 due to hate. But for the first hour, it was a rom-com, then it became a drama, then a thriller/mystery, then almost a minstrel show, then some sort of preachy after-school-special? To be honest, I don't even know what that was, but Forrest Gump did it better.Fourth, there were some weird undertones in the way this movie tried to garner compassion and empathy points. For instance, the main character's Asperger's syndrome. This wasn't based on a true story, to my understanding, so why was this in the movie? I'm all for diversity, but with all of the stories that could be told of Anti-Muslim violence after 9/11, did we need the main character to have a condition in order to empathize with him? And then, there were barely any black characters in the film. But when the black community was shown, they were characterized as poor, fat, and dusty. Bonus points for the mammy character and funny hair kid whose hair wasn't funny in any way. I don't even know why Georgia was in the movie at all, except for pity points. I'm not even going to get into the \"We Shall Overcome\" song.Fifth, overall, this was not a horrible movie, it was just a really weird telling of a post 9/11 story. Maybe I'm just biased as a person from New York and DC, where the attacks actually took place.",

I found it disturbing and for the entire viewing except for the last 10 minutes, I kept trying to figure out where it was going. This was the complete opposite of how I felt watching My Name is Khan.I was hooked from the start. An added granule for me is that I have a granddaughter with Asperger's Syndrome. Her physicality is not affected. But she is very literal and very smart. The young actor who played the child Rizwan and his Mom stole my my heart.I started the movie late in the day and should have headed for bed after about 90 minutes. I could not stop the movie. It was mesmerizing.The story and the acting were both superb. And the cruel treatment by \"normals\" of differences (religious, cultural, and developmental challenges) was painful and had me weeping.I worked at a national association in downtown DC on 9/11. Around 11ish a senior manager advised us all to go home. We left the building and the streets were packed with pedestrians. Cars jammed the streets and there were no subways. We had no idea how to get home and feared that buildings near us would soon be attacked. Providing this as background because after a few weeks, some of our Muslim co-workers had discussions with us to let us know their experiences. The place where I worked had good hearted people. But there were many stories in the news that were not illustrative of good hearted.My soul aches for the people in MNIK, especially Khan and his family. And some scenes caused me to sob. A neighbor's death in Afghanistan could breach the loving bonds of friendship between two boys. A woman's hijab causes others to berate her (still happens today 12 years later). An innocent man is arrested and confined 15 days primarily because of his name. And through it all Rizwan Kahn kindly sticks to his mission, taking a break when needed to help others along the way.Shah Rukh Khan was amazing in this role. At no time did he lose the role, not even when dancing, which was rare as it should have been. Kajol was perfect, and as a Mom I cannot even image the loss of one of my kids...but she did, and we all felt for her. I loved the content with Mama Jenny and the boy.I applaud Karan Johar for making this film happen and for superb directing. I will watch it again, and probably again, etc. This for me was a 10+",

The movie is heavily inspired by other Hollywood movies like 'Forrest Gump' and 'Rain Man', but lacks *any* kind of entertainment value. The story-telling is erratic with information being thrown at you which adds no value to the plot, and is neither interesting in and of itself. (e.g. Mr Khan not liking yellow color, or being extraordinarily brilliant at solving word puzzles, what was up with all that? It just came and went). Also characters come in with some promise and then disappear for long stretches.On top of all that the movie reaches heights of preachiness by trying to teach all Americans how ignorant they are, and how the Good Indians can show them respect for their fellow citizens. I am sure there are about a billion Indians can make good use of such a lesson themselves. And I will not mention the preposterous ending lest IMDb put me in the black-list.Watch this movie to make fun of it (Mystery Science theater style) or stay away.",

            "content": "I felt from long time bollywood's innocence is missing. here you have the answer, MY NAME IS KHAN...Starting with an impressive note, Shah Rukh khan won you over and over from the initial scene. Then flash back to his childhood, directly grabbed your attention, because it's so deviate from Karan johar style. The scenes rocked, impressive. Then start the romance angle which come across as a very mature romance still with sweetness and innocence. What we can expect when SRK-KAJOL are together, it lights you up.. Shah Rukh khan doesn't directly look at Kajol, OR DIDN'T TAKE her hand and staring at her like he did in KKHH or K3G or DDLJ, which led him to be the greatest super star across the globe and won billion hearts, specially of ladies, but he was able to win them more and more with his unique romantic style. Rizwan own you, again and again and more and more.SRK is playing Rizwan WITH such ease and shows what a great actor he is...The Indian treasure who is gifted with super charming personality+ skills, it shows why he was treated as the global known actor and why people are such close to him. The most important part is, people feel Rizwan's pain as theirs. SRK scored a century with that, cause the pain, the expression, the sadness which he give without a tear, he puts his heart out and absolutely giving the best acting in his career.I always believed, karan is not taking a full advantage of the capability of SRK's skills, because in I thought he is too emotional and don't guide SRK's takes when he doesn't give the best shot.But here he proves you wrong. SRK is in a such a balanced act and I believe that's the greatest act by a main stream actor in cinema, at least one of the....kajol, surely charming lady and she proved who she is..such a shame for bikini wear heroine wannabes who is just there to fill the screen and show skin. Bollywood is really missing her, she stood up with every scene and gives the ease performance.after the intermission, I felt I am watching the greatest movie of my life time. The first half is full with emotional, heart is at right place and I believe it's flawless.Everything is perfect, just brilliant, outstanding. bit let down comes in the second part with few over the top scenes, but lead pair fill it up,but i wish it could have been 15 minute less.camera, music is awesome and screen play is great, but wish it was more tight in second half.All other supporting actors are doing an awesome job, actually the lady who played Rizwan's wife was great.favorite scenes. 1. church one- the power of srk's acti9ng WOW 2. Intercourse for Dumbo's..LMAOO all laughed like crazy and \"can I have sex\" 3. Introduction scene 4. all SRK-kajol SCENES. 5.the funeral of Rizwan's mother 6.the way Rizwan's mother taught him to identify the good/bad people..What catchy was, there are many entertainment parts were there which I didn't expect. The awesome film which could have been much better in the second half, i surely hope they will edit it when it goes for non bollywood audience in MAY.I will go again and again, and I watched it with Nadee yesterday. Thank you NADEE for great help in ticket bookings, otherwise it will be difficult for me to watch it on first day, if not you help me.The film scores big time because it's heart is at the right place. perfect first half and good second half and OUTSTANDING Performance, SRK and kjo and kajol have a big winner. It may be less funny and mass oriented than OSO, but I hope it will get it's due in BO big way.Finally , I would like to tell, western world may have BC and AD for define world, eastern world have another definitions..but when it comes to Rizwan's act of SRK, HE SHOWED the definitions of him are not enough to define the skills of this actor. you go SRK, you rock..MNIK, watch it. The lead pair's performance and perfect first half was enough to give it 10 on 10.My favorite till was swades, I think now it's MNIK. But may be changed later, cause I already watched SWADES like 25 times and more I watch it, more I loved, hopefully MNIK will be same for me when I repeatedly watch it.",

            "review_title": "Karan Johar's most accomplished film",
            "content": "My Name Is Khan is Karan Johar's most accomplished film to date. Despite Johar not being known for his directing skills, he has clearly learned from feedback from his previous films, as evidenced by the powerful, moving, and captivating nature of this film. The film is also written by Shibani Bathija, who proves her writing talent in this film. It is thoroughly entertaining, with Johar paying close attention to even the smallest details, which makes the film stand out. Although the film gets sentimental in some places, it never goes overboard and remains authentic, making the emotional impact on the viewer much stronger.The film is primarily a love story, but it also conveys a relevant message about innocence and guilt, kindness and inhumanity, truth and untruth, justice and injustice, and love and hate. The film revolves around the lives of innocent civilians who are accused of being terrorists after the 9/11 attacks. This part of the film is difficult to watch, even though it is one-sided and not entirely credible.The film features Rizwan Khan, a hero who has Asperger's Syndrome, and is different from others. Despite his naivety, he is intelligent and talented, and he perceives life as taught by his beloved mother: the world is divided into good and bad people. Rizwan's relationship with the love of his life, Mandira, a single mother who works as a hairdresser, is charming and touching.The narrative style is excellent, with serious proceedings flavored by humor, romance, and wonderful songs by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. The songs play over montage sequences, without giving the actors a chance to lip-sync, which is appreciated but at times missed by some viewers who enjoy more glamorous and colorful numbers in mainstream films.The film works better in the first half, which is lighter and more enjoyable. The latter half introduces the post-9/11 America, with its disturbing images of discrimination, mindless attacks, and murder. Johar's depiction of this phase is flawed, but the film still works. On one side, we have Rizwan who goes to prove his innocence, and on the other side, we see his wife Mandira who seeks justice after a tragic incident. Sadly, most American characters are portrayed as stereotypes, especially teenagers, which is forgivable within the context of the film.Rizwan's journey in the US is enjoyable, as he meets different people along the way, each of them caricaturish in their own way. The most memorable episode is that of Mama Jenny and her son Joel from rural Wilhemina, Georgia, which is heart-touching despite being stereotypical. The gospel choir in the church singing \"We Shall Overcome\" is one of the most memorable scenes in the film.The acting in the film is outstanding, with Shahrukh Khan delivering a challenging and convincing performance as Rizwan Khan. He transforms from the biggest star in the world into a simple autistic man and does it with conviction. Kajol also gives a powerful performance as Mandira, bringing authenticity, maturity, and strength to the role. The supporting cast, including Zarina Wahab, Jimmy Shergill, and Sonya Jehan, all perform well, no matter how brief their characters are. Overall, My Name Is Khan is a powerful, moving, and captivating film, and it is without a doubt Karan Johar's most accomplished work to date.",

His syndrome prohibits him from preserving others emotional needs, but it helps him take into action the literal definitions of love and goodness.A crucial element to the theme of this film is the scene in the beginning of the movie when Khan's mother tells him \"There are only two kinds of people in this world. Good people who do good deeds. And bad people who do bad. That's the only difference in human beings. There's no other difference.\" This scene alone boils down the main characters world view. Sam, Mandira's son, is the glue that holds Khan and Madira's love together. Sam is a combination of both the Muslim and Hindi culture as well as a nice mix between both of his parents' personalities, despite that he is not maternally Khan's son. Sam tries to overlook the prejudice he faces after 9/11, mainly to take the pressure off of his mother, but his disregard for the severity of the issue ends up being the death of him. After his murder he continues to be the driving force of both of his parents; his mother seeking justice for his death and Khan's mission to meet the President and declare the inadequacy of the Muslim stereotype. The viewer's inner prejudges come out at the beginning of the film, before they know of Khan's Asperger's Syndrome, when Khan is taken in by airport security. The viewer watches anxiously as a Muslim man, with suspicious behavior go through security at a terminal. The directors does a great job at not reviling Khan's real nature until the end of the screen. The audience watches Khan be unethically treated, physically and verbally, by the CTA officers. The fact that this film even exists opened my eyes to the severity of this Nations treatment of its Muslin citizen's post 9/11. The song We Shall Over Come was a signature melody that incorporated the nature of Khan generosity and the persistence he showed throughout the film. This song played when; the Muslim community showed up to rebuild The Church of the Rock, Mandira finally got a job after 9/11, The Church of the Rock is finally rebuilt, Mandira hold the \"Justice for Sam\" sign on the soccer field, and song by Khan and Mandira as they look out onto San Francisco.This film has a great mix of many different aspects of genres I enjoy; suspense, drama, comedy and romance. The director does a great job at making the audience view Khan as a terrorist in the beginning of the film, and spends the rest of the film proving how wrong and deadly assumptions can be. The past to present filming technique confused me at first, but once I was into the movie I realized the pattern the director was taking and I appreciated it. I really liked that Khan and Mandira mainly spoke there native langue in each other, mainly because it made their relationship and culture seem authentic and genuine. My main critic is the films length, from my experience in India they take a mid-movie intermission, which makes the movies length seem reasonable. However, barely any Hollywood movies run almost three hours, so perhaps my critic is ethnocentric.The good vs. bad theme plays into most of the grouping of the film. Khan and his brother are a good example, Khan demonstrates tolerance, love, and kindness the opposite attributes his brother holds. Another grouping of good and bad would be the female Indian FBI agent and the white male FBI agent. There are also many religious examples of Hindus and Muslims. The primary example would be Khan and Mandira, but there is also Mandira and her sister in-law, the Hindu hotel owner and Khan, finally Khan and the Doctor from the temple. A large majority of the \"bad\" people in this movie are white Americans, while the people who help Khan the most tend to be Indian or American racial minorities. This induction shows that oppressed groups can help themselves.Most films that have handy capable leading characters are uplifting and empowering; My Name Is Khan is therefore uplifting and empowering. This filmed broadened my perspective of individuals who are handy capable, I never though in depth about how a person with Asperger's could constructively function in socially. This films message of acceptance and love will soon not be forgotten by its viewer.",

A terrorist is someone threatening your life and your safety. How many Muslim did you know tried to pull a knife in your face? it has nothing to do with religion.

He couldn't(my cousin is the victim) go in a normally school. The only way he could be normally as others was to go in Italy where he got a normally treatement.

Topic of 9/11 and discrimination against Muslims has been tackled in couple of movies previously and is now pretty hackneyed. Story line, screen play and direction fail to grab your attention and keep you fixated in your seat for three hours. Some songs are good but not memorable. I think New York was much better movie compared to MINK.Sharukhs portrayal of person suffering from Asperger's syndrome is OK at best. Kajol has a limited role but did execute it well. Both are good actors but some how they don't click in this movie. Whole move revolves around hero wanting to meet president and that gets too much after a while to watch.Portrayal of discrimination against Muslims seemed far fetched. Having lived here and seen that phase, discrimination was not as bad as this movie makes you believe. Sets used for a town in Georgia look cheap; they should have spent little more money to do on site filming. Another thing that makes me squirm is the Whole idea of only an Indian journalist would help a person wrongly accused of terrorism in US. It is pure identity politics and does not do justice to so many Whites, Blacks and Hispanics who fight for the justice of Muslims wrongly accused and for human rights here is US.",

The special effects were awesome for a Bollywood movie. You can see that they went for the Transformers-esque effect when Ra. One transforms. One more brilliant addition to the movie was the use of guest stars of the hero saving the day and getting the girl. The scenes with Obama were every one of them were awesome! What little screen presence My Name is Kahn had, he was a force to be reckoned with.And what can I say about the music and songs - they are PERFECT! Loved all the songs in the movie.

The message from the movie is not very clear. Got a bit bored with the movie. It really looked a bit unrealistic. No doubt Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol have acted brilliantly but a lot more was expected from the script. However Kajol had minimal screen presence and SRK's act got us confused if the movie was running in flashback or current or flashback again. A mix of all was a bit to much to take. It looks like a squeal to the movie New York. Karan is expected to make a lot more deeper and a strong movie. But if he has tried to give multiple messages with 1 flick i am sure many will fail to gain them all. Some may have liked it but i am sure there will be many more who will agree with me that it was a waste of time. SRK's acting could bag him a Critics award but surely not a Best actor Male category award.",

            "content": "I watched My Name is Khan First day night show on 12th Feb. 2010. I had a friend with me who hated SRK's guts but he came along because I urged him to. I still remember when the movie ended, and we came out of the hall, my friend removed his glasses and wiped his eyes from which a tear was dripping down and yet there was a smile on his face.That sums up MNIK. It is a movie with a soul. It is a movie which has been made from goodness and a pure heart. There are a lot of scenes which will make you laugh and smile. For eg. my favourite was 'intercourse for dummies scene and the scene where Mandira proposes to Rizwan and his reaction to that(brilliant acting!!). At the same time there r scenes which will make you cry no matter if you r a dude or a chic. The church scene where Rizwan recalls his memories with Sam had me literally reaching for a hanky and i found a lump, the size of an apple, in my throat. Or the scene where Mandira is crying over her son's body fills you with sadness and you imagine yourself as her.Sure there are some over the top moments in the second half and I also didn't like the way Mama Jenny was portrayed and the whole saving the town scene could have been cut short by 10 min but these little flaws are very tiny compared to the whole brilliance of the movie.I loved it when the president came back specially in the end to meet Rizwan. I know it is stupid but hey, its a movie and movies can make anything happen and as long as they make you feel good, I say go for it.It's very easy for an actor to pick up a movie with a challenging role so that he gets awards later in the year but that role will fall flat if the actor himself doesn't believe in the character and the theme of the movie. Shahrukh Khan has done a mind blowing job as an autistic person. I have met autistic people and i even have a friend with asperger's and though srk has taken different types of autistic conditions and put them into one, the basic portrayal of the autistic character like not like being touched, scared of a particular colour, obsessed with a single object(stones in this case), repeating words etc. is done with utmost care and brilliance. Kajol was also very very good but I would like her to make her voice a little less shrill when shouting or maybe a little lower pitched..everyone was covering their ears when she was shouting at Khan. Otherwise, she has played the strong and independent mother's role perfectly. The supporting cast are all brilliant and it was good to see actual American actors playing American roles and not some white extras looking for money. As a result, the scenes don't feel uncomfortable when there is a foreigner speaking in it. Finally, Karan Johar has made a masterpiece of a movie..he showed us he was capable of more with KANK but with MNIK, he has sent a clear message that he can do anything. I am half expecting a gangster movie from him now.The music is good. Noor e khuda and sajda are the picks among 2 others and they stay with you after u have left the hall. Watch MNIK for its message, its goodness, and brilliant performances. Watch MNIK to rediscover your human side which you may have buried while living life in this cruel twisted world. Watch MNIK to just escape to a world of Rizwan Khan where goodness and simplicity still exists.",

But overall this movie was awesome, I recommended to all, especially to anyone who lives in the States or is a Muslim.

As his travels continue, Khan inspires optimism and joy in the hearts of the people he encounters by spreading messages of goodwill wherever he roams but he get in a lot of trouble.",

While it may seem simplistic on the surface, it's really his simple humanity that endears him to the viewer. (It also doesn't hurt that his co-star is beautiful). Then there's the journey we're taken on along with the main characters, which is reminiscent of both movies. Love, fear, tragedy, triumph, prejudice, and tolerance, it has it all. This is yet another Indian flavored film that (after Slum Dog) makes me yearning for more. I'll say no more. OK, I lied, one more thing ... the music is sublime. Enjoy!",

Till this day (13th April 2014), I have watched this film at least 20 times.My Name is Khan is a film made with sincerity and sweat, ambition and conviction. It grapples with the most urgent and fraught issue facing humanity: religion. It features a striking performance by Shah Rukh Khan. It has some scenes that will bruise you. Khan is the story of Rizwan Khan, played by Shah Rukh, who has Asperger's syndrome. This milder form of autism impairs Rizwan's social communication skills and gives him some decidedly odd behavior patterns \u2013 he can't stand loud sounds or the colour yellow. My Name is Khan is on firm footing as long as director Karan Johar stays with emotional drama. He opens the film skillfully with airport security searching Rizwan and then moves into flashback. Overall, this is an awesome movie. It scores 10/10 in all aspects - story, direction, performances, music and even screenplay.",

Lets begin with the script-Very good idea an Indian Muslim with an A syndrome on his way to meet the President of America. A sweet romance blossoms into a a great relationship all turned upside down by a racist attack. The irony here Shah Rukh and Karan should have simply hired Aamir or Hrithik to do this role naturally because they are better actors. Secondly and the most important flaw-any natural disaster in America can never be isolate from State run Disaster Relief department. If there was a hurricane in Wilhelmina that Khan saw on Television all routes to that area would be cut off and he ended up reaching much before relief arrived which would happen only in bollywood masalas the hero saves the day again. A terror suspect would never be released after a fortnight in incarceration. If he was a terror suspect, how come the federal authorities never got in touch with his wife through out the entire movie. Kajol was the only saving grace of this movie.

            "content": "MY NAME IS KHAN is a rather long journey of a film - almost as long the journey depicted in the movie. At three hours in length it may lose some viewers, but for those who stay until the end, the message is larger than life and very important. Especially now, as the world grapples with multiple wars based on differences of beliefs under the flag of 'religion'. As written by Shibani Bathija and Nirajan Iyengar this is a tale of growing to understand and embrace tolerance on many levels. The main character, Khan, in many ways represents Everyman - a human being, imperfect in the eyes of the world because he has Asperger's Syndrome, who discovers the meaning of love and the importance of tolerance so necessary if this world is to stay intact.We first meet Rizwan Khan, an outsider because of his variations from normal due to his Asperger's Syndrome, living with his Muslim mother Razia (Zarina Wahab) and younger brother Zakir: Zakir is gifted and at age 18 leaves Mumbai to move to San Francisco for a new beginning. When Razia dies she makes Khan promise her that he will make a good life - that there are no differences in people except good and bad. Khan (Shahrukh Khan) moves to San Francisco, coping with his disabilities as best he can, finds work with in a cosmetic firm selling lotions and potions for his brother Zakir (Jimmy Shergill). One of the reasons Khan is successful as a salesman is his utter honesty, and this trait finds an admirer in cosmetologist Mendira (Kajol) who eventually, through a courtship that is as special as any ever filmed, agrees to marry Khan. Zakir condemns the marriage (Mendira is Hindu, Khan Muslim) and will not accept the couple in his and his wife Hasina's (Sonya Jehan) home. Mendira has a young son from a former marriage and that son finds friendship that eventually betrays him: the world of the Bay Area is sick with the aftermath of 9/11 and all Muslims are suspect and disrespected. When Mendira's son is brutally beaten to death, the Hindu Mendira blames herself for marrying a Muslim Khan, and tells his to leave, that the only way she will ever see him again is after he has met with the President of the US to say 'My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist.'Mendira stays in her home struggling with the fact that her son's murderers cannot be found. Khan sets out to travel across the country, attempting to meet the President and deliver his message so that Mendira will take him back. His journey is an examination of human kindness - he is supported by an African American Georgia family Mama Jenny (Jennifer Echols) when he helps her son, and in turn when a hurricane destroys Mama Jenny's home, Khan returns to help her rebuild, an act that is televised and encourages many Muslims (including Zakir and Hasina) to offer help in the catastrophe. There are many other sidebar stories that occur during Khan's mission to greet the President, each an example of how important communication and equality is life we are to dwell on one planet. Yes, the ending is somewhat saccharine, but the eyes won't likely remain dry as the credits roll.Sharukh Khan is extraordinary as Khan and the supporting cast is very strong, especially the beautiful and talented Kajol. Though there are flaws present, the overriding effect of the story diminishes them to the point of being inconsequential. This is a very beautiful film, one that do well being viewed by every one on the earth!",

Please give it a try guys, you will love it.This movie's storyline, album everything is just one of the finest and how can we not talk about SRK's acting in it?

The movie has nice photography and the director has done a good job, but since it was a co-production with a bollywood firm it had to have all those nonsense interludes and excessive drama in order to be long and happy ended enough to satisfy the regular bollywood viewers.

It was entertaining, hilarious I should say. Rarely you get a priviledge to point out so many ridiculousnesses and plot inconsistensies. Khan\nis released from the prison and people are cheering at him outside. He hears that his wife has been there, but went out the backdoor. He runs after her and sees her taking a cab. Where the hell is she going?! Did she get tired or what?! And no, no no no, he doesn't run after her. He just looks at her and let's her take off. And this sure was not the only \"surprise\" of the movie. There was nothing BUT \"surprises\". I think they tried to fit every \"thing\" in the world to this thing. Now he's walking in the desert, then he's driving in a bus along sea shore. Then something sad happens, but we're playing up beat Indian music (I think they just forgot to turn off the music track because it went on and on). Then he goes to help hurricane victims. Then we're having a party and suddenly his wife is there. But he gets stabbed. At this point I was laughing my ass off. It would've been funny if at the hospital, when he asks his wife to hug him, she would've said \"no\" and the movie had gone on for another hour and a half. Did they even have a plot when they started making the movie or did they just make it up as they filmed?Acting was mediocre at best, mostly terrible. Especially annoying was Kajol fumbling around as Mandira. Her job was, I'm guessing, to tone down Shah Rukh Khan's over acting.The fact that this movie is getting 8 points average from the other reviewers is killing me. I believe that these are mostly Bollywood enthusiasts. This is just one of the very few Bollywood movies that I've seen and I'm aware that the film culture is different. If you're a Bollywood fan, give it a go. I'm not and looks like I'll never be.",

I understand that this is the way of bollywood movies: over dramatized, sugar coated to the maximum and as clich\u00e9 as it can possibly get. Something that would make this movie more bearable to watch without skipping to the end would be if the guy had infertile autism, which would make it a more accurate representation of the actual diagnosis. Please spend your time elsewhere if it's asperger's syndrome you want to learn about. The wikipedia page is more reliable than this piece of stale cinema.

The way it portrays American response to 9/11 if very distorted and exaggerated in my opinion, and I took some offense to it.

In the second half it starts creating suspense and you will be more eager to what happen the next? After 9/11 attack by a Muslim community, all Americans starts doubting Muslims and misbehaving with Muslims. One man(Rizwan Khan) sets out to see the president of USA and shows wonderfully how the people should be strong to chuck away their fears. This is the best movie directed by Karan Johar. It beautiful message: \"Don't differentiate people by their religion,color and regional basis.\" Dialogues are also heart touching. Songs are also awesome.

But in life, too, we face this more than once. People love each other, and never let your loved one go so far. Great movie, just super! I've never seen such an Indian movie before!\n\nSuper acting game of the main character Shah Rukh Khan, as well as all the other actors. He surpassed himself in this film. This role could only be played by HIM, the acknowledged King of bollywood! In General, the actors in this film are incomparable. Kajol is just a Goddess. There are no words to describe her character. I simply adore you!!! The musical arrangement was generally great and I really liked the film itself.\n\nThe film is amazing, leaves behind an aftertaste. I love such films, if only for the fact that you learn about the problems of people with such characteristics, you begin to understand their inner world. Often in life, when we meet such people, we avoid them, because we do not know how to communicate with them, how to react to them. They're like aliens, so we're afraid of them.\n\nThis film can help people understand something important. Namely, it does not matter what nationality a person is or what faith, but it is important whether he is a Person. I really liked the phrase that my mother said to Khan:' There are only two types of people: the good and the bad.' It doesn't matter what your nationality is, what your skin color is, what your faith is, whether you are a person or not. If you look at it, every nation has apostates, atheists, and enemies. But still, there are so many beautiful people around.\n\nThis is a film about what makes us human, Love, Empathy and Faith. And even if we are all of different faiths, but before GOD we are all equal, no matter what it is called, it is the Same for all religions.\n\nWhen I watched the movie, I wondered if the movie won an Oscar...but...he wasn't even nominated! This surprised me very much, as well as many others. I'm sure the movie would have won him over. You need to talk about this film, know it, and advise everyone, because it teaches us not only to be more tolerant of each other, but also to be able to forgive.\n\nOnly the highest score for the film.",

The story begins with us following Rizvan, who is trying to make it to Washington DC in order to meet the president. The very first opening seen allows us to see the difficulty with which Rizvan perceives the world around him and on top of that how he immediately gets racially profiled in the airport. The story beautifully weaves in Rizvan's childhood and adulthood in order for us to understand why he is on this great journey to meet the president. And of course, in classic Bollywood style, it is to rite the moral universe. It is to get the love of his life Mandira back. The movie brings forth difficult topics such as racism, prejudice, and nationalism into question. It plays with the idea of what makes a person bad and what makes a person good, and if religion or the way we look has anything to do with that. But more importantly it shows that love surpasses everything. The power of family and faith is very apparent in this film, and it plays with the idea that when families are divided, by any means, it is the same as when the nation is divided (Gopal), like after 9/11. Karan Johar does a terrific job conveying the struggle of Rizvan and those around him using strategic techniques such as close ups, camera pans, and montages to convey the immense emotional and mental anguish that he has to go through, when all he wants to say that he is no a terrorist. The movie is characteristic and falls in line with some of the themes that Yash Chopra displays in his movie Veer-Zaara. Both movies display the immense struggle of loving someone, when everyone around you is saying the complete and utter opposite. This movie is a touching tribute to the lives lost and affected by 9/11 and pays homage to the growth America had to go through. It is a must see to anyone who wants to feel empowered, sad, and happy all at the same time, and who loves a romance that can overcome anything thrown at it.",

The music plays a vital role in making the audience feel empathetic for Rizwan in his quest to prove himself as both a Muslim and a healthy individual. An amazing performance by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol that will be greatly appreciated by big Bollywood fans. \n\n\tThe way the film transitions from happiness to sadness overtime reminds me very much of how the film Veer Zaara transitions from happiness to sadness very quickly due to a historical event and mistake. In that film, the movie transitions from a time when both Veer and Zaara are happy in their lives, to Veer being forced to be a branded as a spy and imprisoned for years. Similarly, in both films, the 2 lovers are rejoiced at the end of the film after the suffering a tragedy that almost tore them apart. Karan Johar does an amazing job brining many stereotypes to light rather than hiding them from the film. One\u00e2(TM)s that revolve around mentally and physically disabled individuals as well as the idea of \u00e2islamophobia\u00e2?.

In addition to being Muslim, Khan also has Asperger's Syndrome and some of his mannerisms put him in difficult situations throughout the movie. \n\nRizwan Khan touches many lives in the film just as I feel like My Name is Khan has touched my own. I have learned so much more about what life was like for Muslims in America to deal with the aftermath of 9/11. In school I always heard the stories of people who were killed in the actual event but never any about how the event changed what it was like to be a Muslim in the United States. This movie also taught me new things about people with Autism/Asperger's Syndrome. I might never have known about how people with the disorder tend to dislike \"loud\" colors like yellow if not for the film. Overall I finished the movie feeling like I have a better understanding of post-9/11 life for Muslims as well as those who live with Austism/Asperger's. I personally didn't find actor Christopher B. Duncan to look or sound like President Barack Obama but that is such a small and trivial detail that really doesn't detract my enjoyment of the movie. \n\nBecause My Name Is Khan stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, it's impossible not to think of other movies that they have starred in together. I immediately think of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, also directed by Karan Johar, where Kajol plays Anjali, a fun and expressive woman who I find similar to Mandira in this movie. Both movies have Kajol playing a loving mother but Mandira is a lot more angry than Anjali. Mandira grows angry at Rizwan for being so overtly Muslim and pushes her identity away while Anjali is committed to preserving her \"Indianness\" even though she lives far away from her country. Mandira is exactly the type of mother that Rosie Thomas describes in \"Melodrama and the Negotiation of Morality.\" Mandira, \"in her zeal for self-sacrifice...effectively abandons her family,\" who in this case is Rizwan (166). Her pushing Rizwan to the side is what sparks his journey. Though viewers may temporarily dislike Mandira for abandoning her husband who depends on her for help, \"filmmakers fervently believe that one cannot make a film in which a central mother character is truly villainous\" which is obvious as Rizwan and Mandira reunite at the end of the movie (166).",

It aims to appeal to Western viewers, with the usual show-stopping Bollywood song numbers tucked away into montages that keep the story going. However, the film still has plenty of heart-tugging Bollywood-style melodrama to fill up this admittedly overlong movie. Despite any weaknesses caused by relying on simplistic drama and stereotypes (especially in the Wilhelmina, Georgia parts), and the last-minute attack on Rizwan near the end of the film that barely serves the narrative and just seems to be there to push the drama to the Nth degree, the film still manages to hold itself together and take everything to a satisfying conclusion. Even the overuse of 'We Shall Overcome' is not very noisome. Shahrukh Khan gives an excellent and nuanced, if exaggerated, performance [it's a hard task to portray autism on screen without dialing it up to the max, so as to make it easier for the viewer to understand what sets him apart from others, and how he experiences the world around him]. Kajol also deserves credit for giving a very believable performance, even when her character does something unbelievable (i.e. pushing Rizwan away so harshly as she does - although this is just a sped-up, exaggerated way of showing how the sudden death of a child can easily tear a marriage to shreds). 4 stars all around, a very worthy effort and a favorite to return to.",

            "content": "Sharukh Khan Stars in yet Another Bollywood Film\n     My Name is Khan stands out against the typical Indian movie. It does not focus solely on a budding romance or a testosterone filled fight fest. My Name is Khan beautifully meshes many movie genres. It contains romance, drama, action, and a deeper message; which allows the movie to appeal to a wider audience. The movie tells a thrilling story of the plight of a Muslim and his family after 9/11 and opens the world's eye to the injustice and need for peace. Peace not just between Muslims and the world but peace between all races and all religions.\n     Sharukh Khan, usually premiering in feel-good romantic comedies or high intensity action films, takes on a heavier role to which he seems to have no trouble adjusting.  Sharukh Khan plays a man with devout faith and autism who is both laughed at and feared by society. He captures the emotions of every viewer and compels their undying support throughout his unjustifiably difficult life. Throughout the movie, he journeys to clear his name and transcend religious tensions after 9/11 drives a wedge in his family as well as the world. Khan says in the movie that \"there are two types of people in this world: good people and bad people.\" Sharukh Khan's character refuses to distinguish between Hindus and Muslims and whites and blacks. He looks past a person's appearance and religious background and sees their character. My Name is Khan works to knock down the walls that the world has built up and to encourage world unity throughout race and religion.\n     Karan Johar, famous Bollywood director, did a great job as always but his work in this film was quite different. The characters do not break out into songs every five minutes and show off the dance moves they probably spent weeks learning. This Karan Johar film does not possess the same pizzazz as some of his other movies such as Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani or Hasse to Phasse. While there was some sing song romance at the beginning, the movie was primarily done with a more serious tone than most Bollywood hits.\n        This movie will leave the audience glued to their seat waiting for more. It's heart-tugging and heart-warming but most of all, it allows the viewer to see the world through a different scope. Through the harsh reality of the plot and the constant adversities thrown at Khan, the film leaves no stone unturned and opens the viewer's eye to the hidden effects of 9/11 and the importance of worldwide unity. By attacking this serious issue, My Name is Khan strays from the Bollywood cliche and stands out as a unique movie of its industry.",

My name is Khan is a strong reflection about the anti-Muslim movement that propagated all along America after September 11 2001 massacre. You should know that I am not a Muslim and more than that I am an atheist. I hold no religious agenda. My name is Khan is set around an incident or a massacre very similar to the September 11 incident, in fact it is terrorism and it is about an attack on a building as large as the World Trade Center. \r\n\r\n   A man( Shah Rukh Khan) who is slightly mentally disabled because of some sort of syndrome looses every thing in life because of the anti-Muslim events that occurred in USA after the above mentioned incident and he sets out himself on a mission to meet the American president and tell him 'My Name is Khan and I am not a Terrorist'. One of the best things about this film is that it shows no religion or no sect of people as evil and stays un-biased through out the length of the film by showing good and bad sides of all religions involved and thereby maintaining a clear balance throughout. This is a striking story about revolution, will of human mind and a different look at mental illness. \r\n\r\nSome plot twists may seem too tragic and harsh and they tend to waver so much, but it can all be forgiven, forgotten because of a masterly performance from Shah Rukh Khan. This film also tackles a lot of the social issues and natural calamities, like the storms and continuous floods in Florida for an example. This is a must watch for all the people who love Indian films and Shah Rukh Khan.",

He was born in India and he had parents and a younger brother. He is an autism person and he happens to live in the period of Muslim - Indian disorders. The people living around him are divided into two groups. The Muslims hate the Indians and the Indians hate the Muslims. One day Khan repeats his mother a phrase that he has just heard in the street.

In reply his mother draws a picture for him and says: \"Have a look, Rizwan, this is you and this is another man, he has a stick in his hand and going to hit you.

Can you, Rizwan, tell which of the two men is a Muslim and which is an Indian?\" Since that day Khan believes there are no bad nations or religions, there are people who do the right things and people who do the wrong things.
