            "content": "Okay, it is quite horrible. Yet, despite the overall harsh criticisms found on here, it is nothing at all near being one of the worst movies I have ever seen - in my lifetime, this year, or even this month. Bad? Yes indeedy! But God Awful? Not quite(though perhaps closer than I am letting on to). Steve Howey plays Stan Helsing who works at a video store. Halloween night is here and Stan meets up with two incredibly hot girls and his buddy Kenan Thompson(you figure out which one is unlikely to be in that quartet in reality). Thankfully Kenan is there, because he has a few of the few laughs that are in this film(the others belonging to octogenarian and living legend Leslie Nielsen dressed as a hideous barmaid). It seems Stan is destined to live up to his ancestry and slay monsters - what monsters you may ask? Well, ridiculously and inept looking ones NOT from classic horror but from modern \"classics\"(I shudder even putting THAT in parentheses!) We get Pleatherface with a leaf blower and a line when he no longer has it, \"It looks like no one will get blown tonight.\" Stop your sides from aching now with laughter. We get Chucky looking like a guy with painted x's and o's on his face. A Pinhead double from Hellraiser. Anf let's no forget the Michael Myers, Jason, and Fweddy doubles as well. All of these look so stupid and like someone from a fifth grade art class got to work on their wardrobe and costumes. There are other horror references and a story that defies logic - and explanation here for lack of need. Really, Stan Helsing is like Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, and Date Movie. It has a few laughs but not enough to even keep this lame crap afloat long at all. The humor is mostly adolescent and sophomoric with at least four references to bathrooms and all that great humor that comes from noises and the other fertile comedic ground that is inherent in feces and urine. Does the movie have any saving graces? Well, Kenan Thompson and good ole Leslie Nielsen are good some of the time. There are a few jokes that land roughly but in place. Then there are the female cast members who for the most part are very, very pleasant to look at like the three gals playing vampire strippers and Diora Baird and Desi Lydic as the two female leads. Neither can really act though Lydic has comedic potential. Baird has some fine assets to keep abreast of nonetheless. If you are looking for clever or witty humor, you must look elsewhere. If you have an IQ near that of a quasi-literate teen - you might think it is totally rad or some such feeling. Phewwww!",

They all feature extremely crude humor, bad writing and make your brain dumber as a result of watching them. \"Disaster Movie, \"Epic Movie\", \"Meet the Spartans\", \"Date Movie\" and \"The Starving Games\" are just a few of these incredibly bad movies that made the list...as well as \"Stan Helsing\". However, after watching \"Stan Helsing\" I was surprised. I was a bad film....crude, stupid and generally unfunny...but NOT to the level of awfulness of these other films. In fact, I'd have a hard time putting this on a bottom 1000 list...let alone bottom 100. Unlike many of these films, there actually is a bit more plot and cohesion than the other movies. Not much...but more...though NOT enough that I'd recommend it to anyone I like!The film is the story of four idiots who get lost on a Halloween night and end up stumbling into a cursed town of the dead. Various psychotic murders like Jason, Freddy Kruger and Pinhead wander through the place...looking to kill these four idiots. And, apparently, Stan is their only help...though he certainly doesn't realize he's the hero of the film.Crude, stupid and annoying....but a few of the jokes actually made me smile and the film was only about 94% terrible!",

            "content": "Stan Helsing, a video clerk for a certain video chain store, is ready for a Halloween party with three of his closest friends. But before the party, he has been asked to deliver a bag full of movies to the store's manager, who lives in a gated community. What lies beyond the gate: karaoke, monsters and gay porn studios. This is going to be a long night.Let me be blunt, when you tell me a film is coming from the same people, or the same sort of people who brought us \"Scary Movie\", \"Date Movie\", \"Disaster Movie\" and so on... I'm inclined to believe this is one more film that was a waste of time for the actors, a waste of money to make, and a waste of brain cells for anyone who watches it. Mysteriously, despite this bias, I enjoyed \"Stan Helsing\".Sure, the humor is juvenile, revolving almost entirely around hookers, strippers, porn and the same gratuitous sex that we've come to expect since at least \"American Pie\" (you can say such humor dates back at least to \"Porky's\", but don't tell me that the new wave of it has any wit behind the smut). Somehow, with my mind turned off and my stomach full of Corby's brand whiskey, I found this film humorous and enjoyable from the first five minutes.It has some disappointments. The monsters are such a minor part of the plot, sadly, and even Leslie Neilson has a role that isn't as funny as it should be. But such simple jokes as the porn title spoofs got me laughing (\"Glad He Ate Her\"? Classic) and I don't mind a few gorgeous women on my screen from time to time.But as I say, if you're looking for a clever monster spoof, it's not here. The monsters sing a karaoke song, but their origins are not explained and they have maybe ten to fifteen minutes of screen time, contrary to what it would appear by the cover. But if you like dumb humor, like \"Dude, Where's My Car?\", this would be worth your time... especially with a friend and a bottle of Feckin Irish whiskey.",

They did do that with the monsters by making them look like morons and give them really dumb names but beside that they do have some funny scenes and dialog. And they do try to make the a bit like the people they are base off of. Like when they use their weakness is like what fans made fun of the real people they copied. To defeat Freddy get rid of his glove. Pinhead push the nails in. The mask think with Jason and Myers is not their weakness but it showed how similar they are and that Jason was a ripoff of Myers. Leatherface wait till his chainsaw runs out of gas. And Chucky he is a doll. If you missed that then you have no business making fun of this movie. And the other main characters I thought was a good casting choice and they were really funny. Finally they didn't a a truck load of over the top reality breaking jokes. They have those but its more down played. I'm just saying rethink this one.",

The movie starts out 'ok' like a decent rip off of Scary Movie; however, it quickly descends into a downward whirlpool of bad acting, poor direction and a plot that makes little sense.Basically this movie is a spoof on horror movies. There were a few parts where I laughed- near the beginning, but after that it seems as though the film budget ran out of money or something because after the halfway point it completely looses direction. I kept expecting a story to develop or some kind of back history on 'Van Helsing' to appear. It didn't. The characters are poorly written...and even with the comedic assistance of Leslie Neilson it still flops hardcore.Leslie Neilson must be really hard up for acting spots to have taken a spot in this stinker. My recommendation is that you don't watch this one....in fact don't even rent it. Its really that bad.",

I can't blame the cast since they obviously try their best to make this work. But you can see the desperation in the main character's eyes when he has to do another pointless dialog. Shutting your mind of isn't an option either since there is no slapstick comedy to be enjoyed. Well there are some redeeming elements or maybe even the only reason to watch this. The two girls. One with very nice boobs (Diora Baird) and the other one extremely hot blonde (Desi Lydic). Sadly this just isn't enough to be tortured through the whole movie.

And the other three leads showed comic potential too. I admit there were some genuinely funny moments that made me laugh, like the Karaoke scenes and some of the lines by the blond character (Desi Lydic). Unfortunately what comes between these few funny scenes, and makes up the majority of the film, was terrible. The over all film almost made me forget any of it had made me laugh. The bathroom humor, for instance, was just plain stupid.And Leslie Neilson, what were you thinking doing this bomb?

At some parts I was kind of like \"WTF?\" but still they made me laugh. It was funny how they always called him \"Van Helsing\" and he would say \" why does everyone call me that!\" . Pinhead with the dartboard head was pretty funny. And I liked how Michael Myerss' characters mask changed, the leatherface spoof was pretty comical with the leaf blower.etc...Point being, this wasn't supposed to be a big award winning film, and I do believe that the makers of the film knew it as well. It's just supposed to be a fun movie that you watch with a bunch of friends and laugh at. Don't be so hard on it, if you really took the time and understood the humor and just sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed it, then it wouldn't be half as bad. :)",

            "content": "There are some comedies that just try too hard, and Stan Helsing falls into this category. Written and directed by Bo Zenga who has more producing credits and making his directorial debut, Stan Helsing stars a cast of relative unknowns hobbled together to forcefully create laugh-a-minute sequences that don't always hit their marks, but instead fall quite short in not being silly for silliness sake.One thing's for sure though, is that Zenga dug deep to throw plenty of movie references from the horror genre into his comedy, especially when the villains turn out to be cheap knockoffs of their real cult counterparts, with Fweddy (Freddy from A Nightmare from Elm Street), Mason (Jason from Friday the 13th), Needlehead (Pinhead from Hellraiser), Pleatherface (Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Lucky (Chucky from Child's Play) and Michael Crier (Michael Myers from Halloween), and not including minor ones such as the Hitcher, and a giant cockroach. But ultimately there's nothing here to make this film anywhere near being horrific, except that the end product is quite horrific in itself.On the other corner of the ring of good, we follow the adventures of a foursome consisting of the slacker Schlockbuster video clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) whom everyone mistakes from Van Helsing the monster exterminator, who has been tasked to drop off some videos en route to his Halloween party with hottie ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird), his best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson) and an exotic dancer cum massage therapist (interpret this as you will!) Mia (Desi Lydic), on a road trip filled with last minute detours leading from point to point and incident filled. The entire journey unravels with inexplicable coincidences relying on clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 to bring on some cheap laughs, which when proved inadequate there's always the odd toilet joke to stink bomb everything.Dialogue is full of sexual double meanings, with Mia being the group idiot to fall for, or become the butt of the jokes. Nothing in the narrative ever makes much good sense other than to react or create a hilarious situation for our foursome to get into, and filmmakers perhaps need to stop and take stock of the comedy genre now that spoofing pop culture, or pop icons, are no longer a quick and easy way to surprise and satisfy an audience, and not when the impersonations was far from their mark.Don't get me wrong that I've lost my funny bone, but this relatively cheap production didn't have much to laugh at. What's more painful is that it starred the late Leslie Nielsen in drag and makeup as a bar waitress, and seemed more like a desperate role meant for paying the bills. Filled with jokes with some being naughty while others nonsensical and silly, probably the scenes set within the video store bookending the film with patrons providing sight gags and trash talking became the main highlights.",

            "content": "As of late, the parody movies genre is pretty bad. With film franchises like the Scary Movie, and National Lampoons, the parody movie has been getting dumber and dumber. Makes you miss for the days of Naked Gun, Mel Brooks, and Monty Python, all pretty dumb movies, but at less had some smart humor. Even with rock-bottom expectations, I was disappointed by this film. Stan Helsing barely had anything laughable. The film is about video store clerk Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) whom with his friends must make a routine video delivery on Halloween night. Steve Howey doesn't really stand out in this role. I mistake him for Josh Duhamel for the longest time. His friends are some of the most annoying, dumb, stereotype characters, I have ever saw. There is the comic relief sidekick, Teddy (Kenan Thompson) who plays one of the blandest side character guy ever. You would thought for a guy that use to be in ALL That and Saturday Night Live skits, that they would use him as a character actor in this movie, but no. There were a lot of background or side characters that could had use his odd sense of humor. Then there is the love- interest, ex-girlfriend Nadine (Dioare Baird) who really doesn't do much, but act sexy. Then last is the dumb blonde slutty girl, Mia (Desi Lydrics) who changes costumes several time throughout the movie. Instead of a normal drive, Stan and the gang find themselves in Stormy Night Estates facing a group of form of parodies of movie monster icons. It's not even the monster monsters that the normal Van Helsing would had face anyways such as Frankenstein or Dracula. The film has nothing to do with Van Helsing at all. The movie itself, isn't much of a parody of anything. It had barley any plot-line. Even the movie return plot-line kinda drop off the face off the world, half way in. Throughout the film we are not sure what the film is parodying. It even parody things outside of Halloween themes. It's just tries too hard to fill in as much dumb pop culture 1980's and 1990's slasher films parodies targets. You know, for a movie made in the late 2000's, you would think this movie would have some more modern pop culture humor. Well, the others were pretty dumb like dark jokes like killing women and dogs, overt sexual jokes that goes flat, frat boy toilet humor that was a bit mean-spirited. It usually made at the expense of the female characters. The group keep doing stupid things that become very irritating than funny. Even the pun writing is pretty bad. The knockoffs of famous franchise horror villains are named Lucky, Mason, Michael Criers, Pleatherface, Fweddy and Needlehead. Seriously, was this the best, the writer/directed Bo Zenda could come up with? It's weird in a way that Stan Helsing is Rated R, but there's nothing in this film that would earn it anything above a PG-13. There isn't that much gore. The language was that harsh. Most of the nudity, was left on the cutting room floor. Those extended sequences are included in the bonus features if you want to see them. I have a pretty high tolerance for intentionally stupid comedies, and have more fondness for potty humor than most other people would probably admit to. But even by those standards, this movie is dull, boring, and worst of all, unfunny. The only things going for this self-proclaimed horror film parody are decent production values and attractive actresses. Not even, parody king Leslie Nielsen can save this movie with his mediocre small cameo as a cross-dresser waitress. I think if they had some better talented actors, and a witty storyline, maybe this film could had work. 2011's Cabin in the Woods was a pretty good satire simply because it was made by people who knew the genre and lovingly made fun of its flaws. This was made to capitalize on way more popular horror movies that, the writers barely knew anything about. For 90 minutes, this movie gave a sad attempt of parody that is better used for internet shorts. There is small smarter Halloween type parodies on Youtube better than this film that people have produce with less money. It just prove that these movies are more cash-in shlocks than real movies. If you really feel the need to watch this flick, rent it. I warn you.",

Somebody ought to tell the people in Hollywood production studios that we really don't need any more spoofs; seriously. Stan Helsing, a video store clerk and direct descendant of Van Helsing \u2013 although he's the only one in his surrounding who doesn't realize that - , and his friends are on their way to attend a Halloween party, but first they have to make a detour to the \"bad part of town\" to deliver some rental tapes. On the road, they encounter all sort of situations that look strangely familiar \u0085 like they're coming straight out of horror movie blockbuster. The premise is fairly original, but the script relies too much on unoriginal gags and clich\u00e9d situations. There are, for example, way too many blond bimbo jokes and similar derivative stereotypes. Simply put: for every decent and remotely funny joke, there are about a dozen and a half embarrassing and horrid ones. I laughed quite hysterically at the sight of our hero mistaken a grade school hockey goalie for Jason Voorhees and beating the crap out of him, for example, but then later you have to struggle through a painfully disastrous cameo appearance of Leslie Nielsen as a transvestite barman in a redneck karaoke bar. The climax is atrocious, with a horror movie monster karaoke showdown! Yeah, that really is as retarded as it sounds. It's Chucky, Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger performing their version of the Village People's \"YMCA\". Oh well, I guess that at least it's a positive thing that the writers remained faithful to the more classic horror films and legendary villains of the 70's and 80's. To compensate partially for the overall bad quality level of the jokes, at least they hired some really pretty actresses, like Diora Baird (who walks around the entire film in a revealing Indian squaw outfit) and Desi Lydic.",

(\"Bram\", incidentally, is a diminutive of \"Abraham\".)(2) By vote of knowledgeable fans at the 2003 World Science Fiction Convention, the 3rd best SF film of the 20th Century was Forbidden Planet. It was released in 1956. It starred Leslie Nielsen as the heroic spaceship captain.I have listed this film as a comedy, since that's what it purports to be. Certainly it's full of formulaic horror-movie stereotypes, which you would expect from a self-proclaimed parody. And I laffed out loud a couple of times, which means it can't sink to the absolute rock bottom of my ratingometer. That's about it for the singing of praises, tho.The protagonist is the slacker video clerk Stan Helsing (family name simply Helsing, not Van Helsing), who keeps getting mistaken for his ancestor by people who are particularly well informed on this issue while otherwise showing a remarkable tendency to drown while gazing upward open-mouthed during a rainstorm.Stan (Steve Howey) and 3 friends set out for a Halloween party. One of the group, Nadine (Diora Baird) is Stan's ex-girlfriend, she's pretty emphatic about the \"ex\" part, and we see in flashback why she feels that way, as Stan is one of the most insensitive lunkheads on the planet. This raises the question \"Why the hell is Nadine going to a party with this schmuck?\"No attempt is made to answer that or explain the many other improbabilities. The viewer is left to infer that the various horror-movie creatures wandering around wreaking havoc are going unnoticed because everyone else thinks they're just costumed for Halloween.Poor Nielsen plays Kay, an overworked waitress, in lipstick and drag. This was just painful to watch.Among many random occurrences thrown into the plot in no particular order are gratuitous panty and boob shots; a monsters vs. heroes karaoke contest; Freddie, Jason, and a little kid in a hockey mask who gets seriously whacked in a case of mistaken identity; and a hard-to- miss giant cockroach that the lesbians in the next toilet stall nonetheless managed to miss.Somebody evidently thot this would be funny.

It's hard to describe how bad this was, but I will try: It would be more fun to watch paint dry, listen to keys stuck in a running garbage disposal for an hour or bungee jump without the bungee cord. It's equally hard to describe the plot. Again, I will try: boy-wonder, Stan, commonly mistaken for the original \"Van Helsing\" (Ha, ha, ha, that is so funny \u2013 no seriously, it was so funny, you will hear that joke 2 dozen times) and his gang are off to a Halloween party, but get detoured when Stan has to drop off videos. On this comical (sorry, I cannot lie, make that sobering) journey they meet the Garbage Pail Kid's versions of Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, Chucky and Jason.

It couldn't be the sad Leslie Nielsen cameo. It couldn't be the producers even though people remembered who \"Van Helsing\" was \u2013 this is like spoofing '13th Warrior' now in 2009.

Just so everyone gets the picture, the humour in this and the overall quality is on par with the disastrous collection from Seltzer and Friedberg (Epic, date Movie etc.) There are so many problems with this film that it borders on insanity. There is virtually NO plot, structure or pacing and we never get any explanation of whats going on or why. Even all the villain spoofs (which is what the point of the movie is supposed to be) are so paper thin and mind-bogglingly-stupid. Why is Freddy supposed to be all gangsta? or why is Mike Myers Jewish? The villains get minimal screen time and their all just kind of there...for no particular reason.The film is full of toilet humour and gross out/sex gags (as i said, Friedberg/Seltzer) and while I did chuckle once or twice, I wouldn't say it was funny.While watching I was hoping that there would be some wicked fight at the end to redeem it to some degree. But the ending is just as disappointingly awful as the rest of the film.The idea of a great descendant of Van Helsing fighting off all of the big time movie monsters of contemporary film is actually a great idea and It could have worked as a zany spoof or a Jack Brooks style over the top horror-comedy, but it is so poorly executed that it defies logic. It doesn't work as a comedy. It doesn't' work as a horror. But most importantly, it doesn't work as a MOVIE. There is no film here.

One of the most successful art forms in terms of getting great belly laughs, taking pot shots at serious, well known films, that was worked to great effect by geniuses like Jerry Zucker and Pat Proft, is now being destroyed by the useless likes of Aaron Seltzer. And the latest addition, this ultra low budget (and looking every bit of it) monstrosity, written and directed by Bo Zenga, is a further scary nail in the coffin. The props, costumes and production values through out give the impression of being cobbled together by people who either didn't know what they were doing or just wanted a rush job and with such poor acting, writing and story telling, it's quite a boring chore to sit through too. As for any laughs, it's more notable for it's surrealness, such as seeing Leslie Nielsen in a waitress outfit and even more so Freddy Kruegger, Pinhead, Chucky, Leatherface, Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees doing their distinctive karaoke take on The Village People's YMCA. The whole thing leaves you with a yearning to watch the whole Scary Movie series back to back where this idea was done so much better, such a shame as the Wayans brothers could probably have made this promising idea work better. To think how long I was looking forward to seeing it...*",

I look at this movie and other movies such as Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. and wonder what happened to spoof comedy. There are fewer types of movies out there that are worse than unfunny comedies, and this 'comedy' got ZERO laughs out of me. Who finds this stuff funny? Oh look, its Leslie Nielson in drag, that's HILARIOUS! Oh, and all of these iconic movie slashers such as Michael Myers and Freddy Kreuger are doing the YMCA dance.(I'm completely serious.) That is not funny, its a farce. I don't know what is worse, the writing or the fact that there seems to be some sort of market for a movie like this. What makes this movie even worse is that while some terrible movies get the thrashing they deserve, (such as The Happening, Troll 2, and Battlefield Earth) they are memorable. Those movies are entertaining, although not in the way the director intended. This movie is not memorable in how bad it is. It. Just. Sucks. I have rated over 800 movies on this website, and have only given out eight 1/10 ratings. This movie earns and deserves that distinction, because it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",

            "content": "\"Stan Helsing\" is a dreadfully dull comedy that is poorly written, poorly paced, and not very well thought out. It's a shame, too, because the movie's title made me laugh.If you've seen the DVD cover of this movie, it tells you that the movie is made \"by the executive producer of 'Scary Movie' (2000)\". It makes me wonder why \"Scary Movie\" worked as a comedy and as a spoof, yet those who collaborated upon it have failed miserably when making their own spoof movies in a similar vein.Of course, I'm talking mainly about Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, two out of the six writers of \"Scary Movie\" who went on to make abominably unfunny parody films like \"Date Movie\" (2006) and \"Meet The Spartans\" (2008). In fact, the reason I wanted to see \"Stan Helsing\" in the first place was because Friedberg and Seltzer had absolutely nothing to do with it. However, while \"Stan Helsing\" is slightly more deserving of a theatrical release than anything by Friedberg and Seltzer, it shouldn't be commended simply because it sucks a little less than \"Date Movie\".In fact, you can tell just how desperate this movie is when the opening credits read \"Stan Helsing: A Parody\". Whenever a comedy tells an audience in writing what sub-genre it is, you may want the next hour and a half of your life back already.Stan Helsing (Ashton Kutcher lookalike Steve Howey) is a clerk at Schlockbuster Video (Yep, that's the name of the place). In one of the worst set-ups to any story, he is ordered by his manager to deliver a set of videos to the boss's mom. The problem is that it's Halloween, and his friends are picking him up in their van to go to a party.His best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson) is dressed as Superman (reminding me immediately of Thompson's recurring character Superdude from his days on Nickelodeon's \"All That\" (1995)), and has two gorgeous ladies in the van with him. Stan's ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird) is allegedly dressed as an Indian, but is scantily clad enough to make any man in the audience not care. Teddy's squeeze is ditsy stripper Mia (Desi Lydic), who changes costume in a relatively clever running gag.Reluctantly, Teddy drives Stan to deliver the videos first, but of course they get lost. Stan keeps hearing that his ancestor is Van Helsing, who is described in this film as a monster killer. Of course, anyone with the slightest familiarity with vampire movies (not necessarily novels) will know Van Helsing as the man who hunts down Dracula in the Bram Stoker novel of the same name.I guess some people's minds have been poisoned by the Hugh Jackman vehicle, \"Van Helsing\" (2004). In that film, Jackman, as Helsing, attempts to kill not only Dracula, but Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man. The movie bombed, and came out six years before this one, thereby making it not very ripe for parody.Anyway, rather than Stan Helsing taking on the classic Universal monsters, he finds he has to kill more modern horror movie villains: Freddy Krueger (\"Nightmare on Elm Street\"), Michael Myers (\"Halloween\"), Pinhead (\"Hellraiser\"), Leatherface (\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"), Jason Voorhees (\"Friday the 13th\"), and Chuckie (\"Child's Play\"). The people playing these monsters not only look nothing like the originals, but they are also each equipped with cheap gags. Freddy Krueger wears a large watch around his neck a la Flava Flav, Pinhead has darts protruding from his head, Leatherface carries a leaf blower instead of a chainsaw, and Michael Myers wears a yarmulke.Yes, you read that right: Michael Myers wears a yarmulke. Why? Well, that character wears a white-washed Captain Kirk mask, and Captain Kirk was played by William Shatner, who is Jewish, I guess. The point is, these props don't make you laugh for very long, and mostly remained unexplained.In an even more wasted role, the late Leslie Nielsen just plays a guy in drag. Yeah, that's it. If someone had tried to call him Shirley, it may have been funny, but he just shows up, is in women's clothing, and that's really about it.There's also a tired Michael Jackson/pedophile joke that goes nowhere. Given that the film came out in 2009, the year Jackson died, the timing of the gag couldn't have been worse. The main cast isn't funny, the story makes absolutely no sense and goes nowhere, and there's an even dumber climax involving a karaoke contest. It doesn't even seem worth it to commend this film for not making outdated pop culture references.If you find yourself falling asleep during this film, just hope that Freddy Krueger appears in your dream and slashes this film reel to bits. At least that way, your dream will be more entertaining than this movie.",

So to the people saying this is a rip off of the scary movies, this is actually a spin off. Well scripted and very funny, the main character run from unscary \"scary\" movie characters that have been haunting peoples dreams for ages now. The comedy comes from the stupidness of all the characters, it is not supposed to serious at the slightest bit. The people who can not laugh at this movie have no actual humor. The characters have so much bad timing in this movie that it leaves the whole movie action packed and chopped with humor. The fact that every time they were in danger and easily escaped is the funniest of all. All the misrepresentations, sexual innuendos, \"close encounters\", and funny friend scenes is what makes this an all around funny movie.

Which he succeeds in some parts.This is not strong though as a real film, the title \"Stan Helsing\" has to be the worst title next to \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" or \"Friday After Next.\" If you guessed it, it's a parody of \"Van Helsing\" and other pop culture, cult classic horror movies.It focuses on Hellraiser, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Last House on the Left, and Friday the 13th. All parodied carelessly and very low class. They have to use lines like \"We have to go on to 428 Elm Street. It's the last house on the left.\" To emphasize it's a parody.The plot, if there is one, involves a group of teenagers (Kenan Thompson, Steve Howey, Diora Baird, and Desi Lydic) trying to get to a costume party. When Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) needs to drop off some movies, he convinces Teddy (Kenan Thompson) to drive out of his way to do that.They encounter many foolish and stupid acts in the movie, the two girls, portrayed almost like dropouts, Nadine and Mia (Diora Baird and Desi Lydic) are traveling with the slackers, and surprisingly going along with there pranks. Mainly Mia, who is the stupidest character next to Ed from Good Burger.There is not much good about this movie. I have to say though, since it is very similar to the nostalgia the Scary Movie Franchise. It's not horrible, but still not very good. I enjoyed The Scary Movie Franchise, but didn't like the fourth one much.Kenan Thompson is the highlight of this movie, but he can't do much when in between a rock and a hard place with this un-inspired script.Director, Bo Zenga, who has helped write the script for \"Soul Plane\", will definitely have one long career if he relies on stupid parody movies to hold himself down.Starring: Kenan Thompson, Steve Howey, Diora Baird, and Desi Lydic.

And that is to scary. I am not an easy person to scary. But this on did it for me. 3.6 is not a good rating. But still 3.6 is overrating this movie. It is badly written. It is also a lot of the actors in this movie are awful. The is pooh pooh. There is scene were Freddy Krueger is taking a pooh pooh. And there is a another scene with a man dressed as Frankenstein taking a pooh pooh. This is the proof that it is not funny. It is just pooh pooh. I do not want to see Frankenstein taking a pooh pooh. And I do not want see Freddy Krueger taking a pooh pooh. And I do not want to see Leslie Nielisen dressed like a woman.",

So it was fine! To sum up a short review, the movie was great in my eyes, cool, had horror in it, the acting was funny and good, cool music and effects. I wouldn't listen to someone saying all this dumb stuff about a movie saying its not funny or the acting sucks, just watch it for yourself and you will see the true beauty.",

They actually did have some funny moments, some clever jokes... again stuff that has been missing from all other parody films.Overall the film it isn't as bad, maybe if it came a few years back it would have been much better received but since this area has been done and redone so many times... it is just another one of those films:) Watch it if you have nothing better to do, not really worth the cinema price but good if you can borrow it.Because of the women and sexual nature, hoink hoink:) the film is probably suitable for a male audience... so get your mates around have some beers and enjoy it.",

            "content": "Its rare that I actually bother to review a movie but after seeing how bogus the reviews are for this movie I had to dust my IMDb account off, recover the password, and write this review to give you a truthful opinion about Stan Helsing that cares for 1 thing...did it make me laugh? The simple answer to that is heck ya it did, a lot throughout the movie. It's going to have you laughing too as long as you're not a PC warrior who needs your safe spaces and can only take jokes that are PR friendly. Now before you say I am coming down too hard on the other reviewers for this movie...if you don't believe me when I say this movie is funny and these people claiming otherwise are just whiny little female dogs just watch it. The movie starts out 'ok' like a decent rip off of numerous other comedies making fun of the horror genre; however, it quickly descends into a downward whirlpool of funny one liners, multiple character directions, and a plot that makes sense with or without a horror movie background.Basically this movie is a spoof of horror movies + other movies. There were plenty of parts where I laughed- near the beginning, middle, and end. After all, it seems as though the film crew wasn't afraid to poke fun at white America, black America, rednecks, gays, women, horror clich\u00e9s, president Obama, etc and they did so frequently causing many \"chuckle\" moments. I kept expecting the story to drop off or the jokes to run out. It didn't. The characters are cleverly written...and the only area that could of been expanded was the comedic assistance of Leslie Neilson...being a big fan of him I would've liked for him to be more involved in the story, though him being a tranny was pretty funny! The ending scene was one of the strongest comedic scenes I've seen in a movie, and they ended it \"off into the sun- set\" style with more comedic punchlines thrown in that will have you watching the ending credits to get that last little laugh in.My recommendation is that you watch this one...in fact rent it right now. Its really that good. That is of course assuming you're not too thin skinned. If you're too thin skinned to take a joke, then you can refer to the other reviews that spout nonsense about how the movie wasn't funny while retreating to your safe space and down-voting this review!",

Remember Scary Movie and its sequels? well, it's that if they were made by those internet personalities that are famous for some reason.Now I liked Scary Movie 3. I loved Scary Movie 5. But there is no joy, no passion, no fun in this movie. Sure, it's goofy, but it is tediously long drawn out with a stupid plot that just coasts too long on how it has bad facsimiles of iconic slasher villains. It thinks that that is a joke. The plot goes nowhere, the whole thing is poorly thought through and it's just the same kind of thing over and over.Just another mixed parody that was made just because they thought it would be easy to do so.",

You get 'Stan Helsing'. It has no real plot, the characters aren't very interesting, you hardly laugh at the crude and sexual humor that I normally laugh at, and the acting is beyond atrocious.The acting is even worse than the acting in 'Jennifer's Body'. Now I have truly witnessed what may be one of the worst movies of 2009.My friend is the one who introduced this movie to me.He told me that it was funny and he gave it an 8 out of 10.So he let me borrow the movie in exchange of letting him borrow 'Saw IV'.I don't necessarily blame him for liking it.I just can't believe how he can even stand it.There's just no getting around it.It's nothing more than a cheap rip off of much better horror movies like 'Halloween', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', 'Friday The 13th', 'Jeepers Creepers', and 'Child's Play'.It also rips off of 'Hellraiser', but I haven't seen that movie yet.There's not even an explanation to why the killers are in the movie.Did they rise up from the grave or what? I thought that Rob Zombie's extremely underrated 'Halloween 2' was WAY better than this piece of trash.'Halloween 2' rules. 'Stan Helsing' sucks.",

There aren't too many comedies, especially spoofs that I haven't at least CHUCKLED at. Stan Helsing did not even make me smile. It was so bad it actually made me angry for having wasted my time watching it. Absolutely NOTHING in this movie is funny. Not even remotely. The ONLY and I mean ONLY remotely 'interesting' element of this movie were the hot actresses. I honestly don't understand how anyone could rate this movie more than one star. I'd give it zero stars if it were possible. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this movie - even if you can watch it for free. It's not worth your time, let alone your money.",

I am a very big fan of both the horror and comedy genres, however I quickly realized that some things should never be combined. Even though this movie did have a moment or two that could be considered funny, I found the hardest thing about watching this movie was trying to sit through the final 15-20 minutes, that took a lot of will and discipline on my part.Parodies in general are difficult to pull off, but when this film included some of my favorite serial killers such as Jason, Freddy, Chucky, and Leatherface I thought it had some material to work with, and had potential to be decent. However, almost every joke attempt came off as lame, immature, and just not funny. Like I said, there were a couple of jokes here and there that managed to get a smirk, but most of them, even the funny ones, missed the mark. The best thing about this movie, and the sole reason I gave it a whole star was because of the terrific performances (umm..okay outfits actually) of Diora Baird and Desi Lydic. Both of these women were dressed in revealing Halloween costumes throughout the entire movie.....well played.If you like parodies, than you may get a kick out of Stan Helsing. Everyone else should avoid this movie like the black plague.",

It's like the director had no idea what comedy was, so he just through some comedic elements such as random transvestites, stupid parodies, sex jokes and really disgusting stuff on screen hoping it would come out a comedy. And you can tell this sucks, because I'm a kid who basically finds everything funny, and yet this movie never once had me laughing. It's not even a horror parody, it just takes a random culmination of horror movie villains, makes them look stupid in a way that barely makes sense as a parody and throws them in. They don't make fun of anything about the characters, it just has them in the movie. This movie sucks on so many levels, I can't even count them all of the top of my head.",
