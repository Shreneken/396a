            "content": "After a bloody invasion of the BOPE in the High-Security Penitentiary Bangu 1 in Rio de Janeiro to control a rebellion of interns, the Lieutenant-Colonel Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) and the second in command Captain Andr\u00e9 Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) are accused by the Human Right Aids member Diogo Fraga (Irandhir Santos) of execution of prisoners. Matias is transferred to the corrupted Military Police and Nascimento is exonerated from the BOPE by the Governor. However, due to the increasing popularity of Nascimento, the Governor invites him to team-up with the intelligence area of the Secretary of Security. Along the years, Fraga, who is married with Nascimento's former wife, is elected State Representative and Nascimento's son Rafael has issues with his biological father. Meanwhile Nascimento and the BOPE expel the drug dealers from several slums but another enemy arises: the militia led by Major Rocha (Sandro Rocha) and supported by the Governor, the Secretary of Security and politicians interested in votes. Nascimento is manipulated to help this group, vanquishing the criminals in the slums and poor communities; then the corrupt group of police officers is free to exploit the poor population.\"Tropa de Elite 2\" is a fictional and hopeless story based on true events and characters of Rio de Janeiro and the greatest box office of Brazilian cinema ever. The director and writer Jos\u00e9 Padilha did not make a sequel of the successful \"Tropa de Elite\", but used important characters to make a different and very realistic approach, scarier than the first one, about the masterminds of the organized crime in Rio de Janeiro. Further, he proves that is a courageous man, nudging the Powers that Be with this great film. The performances are impressive and sometimes this film seems to be a documentary. \"Tropa de Elite 2\" is certainly the best Brazilian film of 2010 but the Brazilian Commission has not selected this movie to dispute a nomination to the Oscar in the Best Foreign Language category. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Tropa de Elite 2: O Inimigo Agora \u00e9 Outro\" (\"Elite Squad 2: Now it is Another Enemy\")",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Elite Squad 2",
            "content": "I was hoping that Elite Squad 2 would get a commercial screening in Singapore, but if not then it made a welcome appearance during this year's SIFF, and while it can be watched as a standalone film, you'll appreciate the challenges faced by the principal characters a lot more if you've watched the original, where BOPE leader Nascimento (Wagner Moura) and his squad got introduced with the primary plot revolving around his tough training of two up and coming prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in the squad which had powers to eliminate enemies of the drug trade with deadly force. It became one of my favourite shows that year and of its genre, and I'm glad that the sequel went one up without repeating itself, tackling problems in Rio De Janeiro that are of a wider scale, exploring just how deep the rabbit hole of corruption in the city goes.Starting with a cliffhanger where Nascimento, now Lt Colonel with added years to his age with a hint of grey at the sides of his head, got caught up between a rock and a hard place, we then journey some months back which writer-director Jose Padilha, returning for this film, outdid himself with tightly choreographed, intensely shot action sequences within a high security prison where inmates took over with force and are out to eradicate enemies within the prison where enclaves sprung up. You'll notice that the shaky cam cinematography in its predecessor got toned down a lot in this follow up film, which is nice. From that botched attempt of now Captain Andre Matias (Andre Ramiro) disobeying orders from the top but with public sentiments on a high for the no-nonsense approach by the BOPE, Nascimento got moved out of the Skulls and into politics, becoming under-secretary of Intelligence in charge of all wire-tapping activities by the authorities, while Andre himself got moved back to becoming a lowly beat cop.It's a very major departure from the premise of the first film, if you've come with expectations that you'll get to see action sequence after action sequence punctuated by violence, because this installment is a more cerebral take on the problems plaguing the city, and a more macro-level approach as well involving crooked politicians and their support system beneath them that fuels a very symbiotic relationship between the corrupt leaders and their underlings, moving away from drug cartels, to wider and ruthlessly effective organized crime involving what some say are the largest gangsters around, the police force, in far more lucrative illegal trade fueled by the slums they're supposed to protect. And these problems go to show that if a system is corrupt it'll take some humongous effort to clean it up, if one can find a foothold to begin from that is, which is what Elite Squad 2 is mostly about, the few and rare good men who are willing to step out and stand up to be counted, even though they're battling on different fronts and may not share the same belief system.Jose Padilha balanced political intrigue, crime and action without forgetting the emotional core that had also level-set the first film. Nascimento's son is all grown up now but remains estranged from his dad because he cannot comprehend why Nascimento had to kill in his line of duty. And as if that's not enough, his wife is now romantically linked with his professional nemesis Fraga (Irandir Santos), who with his non-government organization championing human rights, becomes the thorn in his side for frequently undermining BOPE's tactics and strategy that you would have seen from the first film, and in a way something like how director Padilha seeks to address detractors of that film. Things also get patchy between mentor and mentee especially when Andre sees Nascimento being unable to reinstate his position back in BOFE, but others working through a network of connections are able to, which sort of brings forth a moral dilemma of being beholden to someone, especially when links to the mob comes into play.Wagner Moura keeps up his charismatic performance as the one man tour de force with a riveting performance as a leader anyone will want to follow, with courage and sometimes obsessed conviction in being married to his job and taking it upon himself as the city's saviour and scourge of the city's criminals, even if they happen to be white collared and in positions of power. Granted you'll miss watching him in action leading his men on raids as he becomes assigned to a desk job, but there's no lack of intensity in his newly minted career path, seeing it as opportunity to resource load his old unit to do a lot more than he imagined, though indirectly responsible for slicing off the head of a hydra he had yet to fully understand.While action sequences are limited, there is no lack of excitement and edge of your seat moments where everything kicks into high gear, best played out in a hall with a properly tuned sound system that puts you in the thick of all the action. One can only hope for a follow up film if there's another strong story to be told given that loose ends still exist, the problems in the real world never actually going away and the system is one big monster that is constantly evolving and evading eradication, which will probably take generations to effect real change, but for action junkies and fans of police films, having Nascimento back for another film will indeed be a welcome treat. I can actually listen to an audio book narrated by Wagner Moura and not get bored at all, since it is his narration that fills in the blanks in this film and moves it forward. Highly recommended!",

I saw it in a packed theater at the Sundance film festival and I've never heard louder applause from an audience. I would recommend watching the first film, just because its also very good and introduces all the characters. However, this film stands on its own. The director sought to make this stand out from the first film and he succeeded. This has fantastic action, great dialogue, and some hilarious dark humor. But most of all, its intelligent, its extremely well made, it's not plagued with any awkward or out of place moments. For some viewers, this film might actually be a learning experience. If you want to see an action film that isn't 90% action and 10% plot. If you want something that's hardcore, fearless, and has a message, this is it. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",

            "review_title": "A Smarter Sequel",
            "content": "More than eleven million viewers paid tickets to watch Elite Squad 2 at the theatres, surpassing the record established by Avatar as the most successful movie in the history of Brazil and showing that a good screenplay, a good cast, good production values and thought-provoking topics still matter more than all the progresses in special effects. The first movie was a cultural phenomenon in Brazil, expectations were high and sequels usually disappoint. But this sequel not only lives up to the first movie \u2013 it transcends it. What we have here is a smarter movie that exchanges the favelas, the drug traffic-ridden slums, for luxurious public offices. The enemy is someone else this time: not the petty street dealers, but the whole corrupt system that extends itself to cops, politicians and the media. Those expecting an exciting action movie like the first one will get less, but nonetheless excellent, action sequences of the BOPE in action, but more story dealing with the social-political reality of Brazil.The movie starts thirteen years after the events of the first movie. During a prison riot, the BOPE is called in to intervene. Although they secure the prison, the strike team causes a public relations incident when Captain Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) cold-bloodedly shoots an inmate ready to surrender in front of Fraga ((Irandhir Santos), a human rights activist negotiating peace with the inmates. The first choice of a patsy is Colonel Nascimento (Wagner Moura), but public opinion loves him and instead of falling down, as he puts it, he falls up. He's sent to the Public Safety Department, basically the secret services. In his new role he makes the BOPE more efficient and modern. He launches a war on drug lords, thinking that, with profits shrinking, the criminals will just disappear. Instead he creates a new type of criminal. Corrupt cops, involved in the drug money, eliminate the middlemen and set up a racketeering system, forcing the slum dwellers to pay for protection. These militias, apparently working for the common good, become a powerful force since they can buy votes and influence elections. Politicians and militias tighten their relationships behind Nascimento's back, who continues to think his methods are working.Elite Squad 2 works because it grows from the first one. The first movie introduced BOPE to the world and had to spend time explaining its methods, philosophy, code of honour and recruitment process. The sequel doesn't suffer from the burden of exposition, and instead of rehashing the plot of the first \u2013 the bane of most sequels \u2013 it lets the characters' personalities lead the story.Many old faces come back: from major ones like Matias and Nascimento, to smaller ones like Lieutenant-Colonel F\u00e1bio (Milhem Cortaz), the corrupt recruit who failed to join the BOPE in the first movie, and Major Rocha (Sandro Rocha) a mere face in the first but here the villain who masterminds the racketeering program to take control of the favelas. Matias and Nascimento's relationship becomes strained after Matias is kicked out of the BOPE following the prison incident. From the new characters, mostly politicians, the most important is the left-wing activist Fraga, who uses the prison incident to run for Deputy.Brazilian cinema has been very good since City of God exploded in the world like a hand grenade. Because of it Brazilian cinema has become synonymous with crime movies, even if that's a gross generalization. A subgenre of crime movies defined by graphic violence, social criticism and inventive camera work has prospered in its wake: My Name Ain't Johnny, The Man Who Copied, City of Men, Bus 174, and the Elite Squad movies. At the heart of this Renaissance is the movie's screenwriter, Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani. For better or for worse all these movies take inspiration from the style he established in City of God. Directors and actors come and go, but everyone still copies the dark humour, the political irreverence, the non-linear narratives, and the clever voice-over that earned Mantovani an Oscar nomination almost a decade ago.Editor Daniel Rezende, who also worked in City of God, puts the movie together with the force of a tornado. Complementing director of photography Lula Carvalho's documentary-like style, the fast editing and the dizzying camera work go as far as cinema outside of 3D can go in immersing the viewer in the middle of the action.Most people who watch Wagner Moura here probably don't know that in Brazil he's primarily known for playing romantic lead roles in soap operas. In the first movie Moura revealed a surprising talent for fierceness and cold-bloodedness; in the new movie his transformation continues. In the first movie the actor underwent physical training; in the second his change is emotional. In the first movie Nascimento was looking for a replacement; in the second he starts questioning his role in the system. Moura portrays a more vulnerable character and his performance has grown richer in subtlety.Of those from the original cast, Andr\u00e9 Ramiro has the shortest screen time. The first movie showed his slow transformation into a noble policeman into a ruthless killing machine, ending with his bloody rite of initiation. The plot in the sequel goes in a direction that doesn't give him much to do, which is a pity, because Ramiro's character was the most interesting after Moura's. But he has the privilege of stealing the few scenes he's in with his angry performance.Elite Squad 2 is an upsetting movie. The first movie offered the easy solutions of a police state whereas the second shows their ineffectiveness unless change occurs in the whole system, from top to bottom, and not just in the favelas. The first movie was a fun action ride that ended on a satisfying note, with justice served. In the second the viewer will come out feeling as indignant as if unjustly battered by a police truncheon, unable to forget it for a long time.",

            "content": "This is a completely different movie from Tropa de Elite 1. That movie was about a few guys and their personal stories as they deal with crooked cops. They were a hindrance to good police work but not really a menace, more an annoyance. This movie is all about real deep- seated corruption in Brazil. The bad guys here are actually evil and ruthless, and as a result the stakes are higher for the protagonists.The good: just as memorable action scenes, although there were less of them. The story had several twists and turns and it was fascinating overall The bad: Character development seemed to have taken a back seat here to the grand narrative. The distinct personalities of the first movie are kind of reduced. Andre Matias is the biggest example of this, and I was disappointed with what they did with him. Cpt. Nascimento's wasn't nearly as bad-ass or imposing as in TdE1.I recommend this to anyone who likes a good crime movie with a message. I'm not Brazilian but this movie still made me think.9/10",

            "review_title": "I wanted to hide under my desk when watching this",
            "content": "I think that the main difference between this film and its predecessor is the message you're left with. The 1st film allows you to believe that there is hope in spite of all the chaos surrounding us, beauty behind destruction, as it was. The 2nd one unceremoniously rips that away with a disconcerting violence. It leaves us bereft\u0085 At least that's how I felt throughout a great part of it, especially towards the middle to end. The chaos is left to act of its own accord, and it's a downward spiral toward a cage from which there is no possible escape. Conform to the rules of the system or be killed rebelling against it. Our knowledge of others is usually one of rehearsed insipidness and persiflage. Immersion into the surface turns out to be much more revealing than could ever have been predicted. Truly, the poor are the mass, they hold the collective political power, and yet do not (cannot) hold this power with an iron fist because they are too weak and ignorant to understand it, a position forced upon them by the unremitting circumstances society holds them in (I remember visiting portions of a slum in which the people there never had their births registered, they essentially did not exist, apart from having no idea at all about caring for basic needs, like brushing their teeth). Thus, their deplorable condition of living in misery and desperately wanting to be hauled out of the darkness is exploited by the police and politicians. In this ever-expanding social pyramid, in which the rich are fattening themselves up at the top, the poor at its base begin to sink further into the mud until there is no breathing room. The director and screenwriters offer up a devastating view of social reality, leaving the adage that \"you can't trust anyone\" as the only unquestionable truth. The absolute irony behind this sequel is that Capt. Nascimento, toted as a nefarious fascist villain in the 1st movie, turns into the antithesis of evil here\u0085 suddenly his past history of leading death squads and torture festivals is swept under the rug and he is redeemed, reborn. He is the only one the audience can cling to in the midst of the despair being portrayed. He is symbolically \"relied upon\" to keep us safe in this world in which the laws we've become dependent on to live our lives in a safe way have started to disintegrate right before our eyes, leaving us groundless and vulnerable. How to respond to a feeling of vulnerability? Primary process world, aka aggression and sex\u0085 The 2nd isn't much of an option, since we're channeling this by proxy. What's left to do is murder the destabilizing forces and reestablish a sense of order (as tenuous and illusory as it may be). The sequence in the final third of the film makes one thing clear: the reality became too much for the makers of this film to handle, they needed to eventually shy away from the sewage they were focusing on\u0085 it can become overwhelming to not shine a nightlight of hope into the void, and that is what is done when Nascimento takes on this superhero role and vanquishes evil\u0085 even though his efforts are then swallowed up by the amorphous blob of chaos so the latter could continue with its carnage, this little storyline shows the director felt we all needed a reprieve, him and us. It would've been much more raw and realistic for there to have been a different outcome for Nascimento, but I can only imagine the gaping wound this would have left in its viewers, for at that point I was already filled with despair, but was \"granted\" the chance to remount my defenses to a more comfortable degree. I loved this film, it's right up there with the first, and I have to say that the main character is on the fast track to becoming a Brazilian cultural icon (more so than he already was), the ruthlessly destructive force that people have been left with no choice but to mirror themselves on.",

Capit\u00e3o Nascimento has become the alter ego of every Brazilian, seeking a secure place to live. I think the film will find an echo in neighboring Latin American countries. Compared to Tropa de Elite 1, the second delivery is a much more mature picture, a deeper look into the issues that plague every Latin American major city- citizen's security, human rights, and political responsibility.Since City of God, I have not seen such a round and impactful film about the social reality in Brazil. Remarkable work of Jos\u00e9 Padilha, Braulio Mantovani with a seamless screenplay.

He then tells us how he got to that point. At the end we return to that point and find out what happens during the shootout and its aftermath.We learn of a raid to a prison that houses all the major drug dealers who continue their dealings inside jail. There is an orchestrated mutiny and most drug dealers are killed. A human rights advocate and professor rushes to the jail to mediate. But there's little he can do. The massacre causes a political uproar. And politicians seek to distance themselves from the violent elite squad BOPE. That is until they realize how popular a tough stance against crime is with the people. So Nascimento gets a political promotion, he's now placed in charge of intelligence. A smart move by the politicians. They promote him while getting him out of the picture.With the main drug dealers out of the way, someone has to fill the power vacuum in the slums and keep order. Corrupt policemen realize how much money there is to be made in that position. Basically, they get their share of every deal that is done on the streets, whether it's a drug deal or a pirate cable TV installation. Then they assault a precinct to steal all the weapons. The corrupt governor who is running for re-election, an associate, and a TV commentator plan then to organize a massive attack on the slums, to recover the weapons, which according their media campaign were stolen by regular criminals and hidden in the slums.Nascimento's intelligence knows very well that the drug dealers don't have any weapons. He tries to argue against the operation, but the politicians won't hear any of it. The operation fails to find weapons. This should sound familiar. Nascimento quips that it should have been called \"Operation Iraq.\" When his friend Matias becomes a victim of the machine, Nascimento decides to confront the corruption head on. He gets the unwilling help of a reporter working with the human rights activist who is now a senator. He's also married to Nascimento ex-wife. Nascimento's son lives with them.With all that we return to the shootout in the present day.The success of this movie is the smart mixture of political intrigue and corruption with high octane action. For some reason, I was hoping for more action, as this director really excels at shooting those scenes. The portrayal of the political mafia as a bunch of vain fools is accurate and funny. The middle portion of this movie is somewhat flat, I didn't connect with it, but that could have been because of the subtitles that race across the screen and don't allow you to focus on the movie itself.The bigger problem are all the forced coincidences that are so convenient for the writers to include. The ex-wife happens to marry the human rights senator. He son happens to hear when the reporter tells the senator that she thinks the police stole the weapons, and so on.Despite some minor flaws this series is still outstanding and almost epic.",

Its a deeper voyage into Nascimento's feelings and also into the inner workings of the CRIME machine. Its a more mature and better developed movie which will make you think.

It didn't make me angry for the reasons you think.You see, a lot of people tend to think America is a great place (and for some people it is); others tend to think America is full of \"stupid Americans\" (and there are some). Then there are those who are disillusioned to the propaganda of America; they don't see the land of the free and the home of the brave, they see just another country with a bunch of crooked thieves holding office and subjugating anyone who isn't in the upper-class to social and economic oppression.Elite Squad 2 makes me angry because it's real. It's not a fantasy recreation of the political system or the enforcement institutions controlled by them. The corruption in Brazil is a mirror of the same kind of political corruption in America; our electoral college is a joke; our candidate propaganda machine is a joke; our Congress is a joke and our Senate is a joke.Recent uprisings from the average Joe and Jane (assuming they make it to the news outside of the U.S.,) is indication enough that not everything is strawberries and lilies in the land of the U. S., of A. And seeing a movie like Elite Squad 2 helps put that into perspective: this isn't just my nation that's like this, it's a lot of nations that are like this.So yeah, this movie made me angry because it makes you feel helpless and small and insignificant with its powder kegs of truth. You see how violence can suffocate change and cronyism can hamper the democratic process. This movie outlines that even when you think the \"good guys\" can win, they don't. It's a harsh dose of reality served up in the most intense two hours you'll experience from a movie for a long time to come.Despite the feeling of helplessness and anger toward the reality of our corrupt and pathetic political system(s), more than anything this movie makes you want to stand up and say, \"enough is enough!\"",

            "review_title": "Violent and realistic motion picture based on real facts , about a high ranking officer fighting total corruption",
            "content": "Exciting and thrilling picture dealing with former-Captain Nascimento , now a Brazil high authority . After a prison riot, today Nascimento (Wagner Moura , this character was based on screenwriter Rodrigo Pimentel) is a high ranking security officer in Rio De Janeiro , he is swept into a bloody political dispute that involves government officials , politicians and paramilitary groups . Excellent and nail-beating film based on real events , in fact , the role of Diogo Fraga (Irandhir Santos) is based on the real life Rio de Janeiro State Representative Marcelo Freixo . Nowadays , high commander Nascimento has to find out a lot of problems while trying to take down inmates from a prison riot , drug dealers , criminals and a corrupt police called Rocha who commands a dangerous militia . On the streets of Rio only the elite survive . The movie also deals about BOPE , a Special Operations Squad similar to American SWAT and their fight against factions in Favelas Rio Janeiro . Meanwhile , Matias (Andre Ramiro , this role was based on screenwriter Andr\u00e9 Batista , former members of the BOPE squad) is moved to the corrupted Military Police .This stirring film has breathless , brutal scenes , a gut punch of an action film . It concerns on an upright man , his fight against policy corruption , taking on the daily challenges of dealing with pressure at home and fighting an unnamed war on Rio Janeiro slums . Interesting and brooding screenplay from the Academy Award nominated writer of City of God . Many critics have considered as a tremendous movie , on the level of some of the Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola pictures . A must see, a cross between the Departed , The Wire and City of God . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of a few decent people , an Elite Squad , about police corruption , and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro , plenty of drug-lords , burglars and assassins . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and for that reason isn't boring but it's entertaining . The picture grossed at box office , it had a total public of 2.4 million paying viewers while playing in theaters in Brazil , in addition to the estimated 11 million who watched the bootleg copies and got a final version slightly different from the pirated one . It made the most seen movie in Brazilian cinema history. It also became the highest-grossing film of all time in Brazil, beating Avatar (2009)'s record . In fact , this film was already a best-seller almost three months before its official release . Illegal copies of what the director called the \"3rd cut\" flooded the streets of all major capitals in Brazil, for the equivalent of five dollars a piece . The characters are based on actual people , as Andre Matias was a member of BOPE and was a honest man who finds himself torn between his life as a BOPE member and his life long dreams of being a lawyer . Exciting as well as moving musical score . Composer Pedro Bromfman is the man behind Padilha's critically acclaimed sensation \"Elite Squad\" and the smash hit sequel and he's re-teamed with the filmmaker for \"RoboCop\" .Direction by Jose Padilha is awesome , stylish , and overuse Steadycam ; this is an award-winning Brazilian picture ; it was Brazil's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the 84th Academy Awards 2012 . Filmmaker Jose directed first \u00a8Elite Squad\u00a8 about a Special Police Battalion , called BOPE , an unit of urban combat attempting to take down drug dealers and killers in Rio De Janeiro before the Pope comes to Rio , and this sequel , the smash hit followup , \u00a8Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\u00a8 both of them have been monster hits in his native Brazil and beyond . Director Jos\u00e9 Padilha claimed that this movie ends his trilogy about urban violence in major Brazilian cities . The first one, \u00d4nibus 174 (2002), was a documentary meant to explain how the state's indifference towards poor people can lead to the formation of violent criminals . The second, Elite Squad (2007), meant to explain how the state's indifference towards law enforcement agencies will often result in police brutality and corrupt officers . And finally, the last movie deals with the reasons behind the state's choice to ignore the poor and the police . These films had a lot of box office , about 11.1 million paying viewers made it the most seen movies in Brazilian cinema history . The first feature film in English for this director resulted to be RoboCop , making his Hollywood debut , and inventively breaks down ,reconfigures and soups up the core half-man, half-machine cop-hero conceit.",

There is no character development like in the first installment, however the story is more complicated and it takes more effort to explain it.The First movie, concentrates on a BOPE squad, and the drug dealers it fights. Elite Squad 2 shows a bigger picture. It shows the politicians and Defense system mechanism that operates the squad, and the purposes it is used for. Instead of police corruption we see here murderers in uniform.There are some flaws in the plot, and it slightly falls in comparison with the first one, however, overall it's very impressive.I would recommend seeing The first installment before.",

And you also have heard that there are exceptions (Aliens and Godfather 2 to name a few). And while you might think I am exaggerating by naming those classic movies, I don't think I am. I stand by that and I am telling you, the sequel is at least as good as the original.The good thing is of course, that is different and it is actually a sequel. So while the story continues (and it makes sense to have watched Tropa de Elite before watching this), it also gives you a different viewing experience. While the first movie might have been a little bit difficult (to digest that is), this is one is pretty straight on. The acting, the story, the framing, the editing. Everything is up there. I really am surprised that this did not get the same recognition the first one got (first one won at the Berlin International Film Festival, which I think is and was a big deal).I cannot praise this enough and I hope that they will do the movies justice and release a decent (disc) release somewhere, so I can buy those movies. This is one of the best thrilling movies that have been made the last decade, even though (or maybe because) it is so close to real life (as I have been told by friends of mine, but as also is apparent by watching the movies)!!!",

And this is thanks to director Jose Padilha, who had the guts (and a lot of talent) to throw open the problem of violence in Rio de Janeiro, and the system created by subversive criminal organizations of low and high rank. Thus building a film extremely realistic and relevant, neither the American cinema got to do, because when it comes to \"put the dust under the carpet, Hollywood and Brazil are very similar.With a top cast in superb performances and a plot full of twists and clever, the viewer will not soon forget the great action, violence, misery and personal drama played by the great Brazilian anti-hero of the decade: Colonel/Captain Nascimento.",

He eventually loses his wife to Fraga. His son hates him. As the gangs are driven out of the slums, the corrupt police takes over. They form militias which produces votes for corrupted politicians. Soon Nascimento is surrounded by his enemies in his own office.This is a vast epic sprawling movie. That's the source of its main problem. This would make a great TV serial. Instead of 2 hours, this story could use 10-20 hours. This reminded me a lot of 'The Wire'. As a 2 hr movie, this needs to be boiled down to concentrate on Nascimento. This needs to be his story, not the epic story of corruption in Rio. I was also a little annoyed by the voice over narrations. With such a vast story, a narration to explain things was probably needed. The action is all there. The violence and the edgy story is well done.

The movie is very intense in that all the scenes are very well- connected and well balanced between narration and action. There is much less action and violence than the first one, but it is compensated by the well written script, which keeps audience on the edge of the seat as the whole storyline unfolds.I felt like I have grown with the protagonist from the first movie. As his fight has gone from tactical to strategical, the perspective of the movie has graduated to higher, more holistic level. Though fictional, the movie tells a story that many different countries share- a society hijacked by systematic corruption, social inequality, and gang violence. As credit rolls, I found myself sitting in silence pondering my role in this ecology, how we have come to this, and more importantly, how we can extricate ourselves from this situation. I believe this is precisely what the director wanted us to think.The acting and soundtracks are up to the standards in my opinion, and the action scenes are much closer to reality than most Hollywood movies. Unfortunately, no movie is perfect; in my opinion, the characters are not very well developed. It is a movie dedicated to a political message, and I respect the decision of the director to make it so. However, that means lengthy narration outlining the structure of the corrupted system took priority over develop connection between the audience and the characters. I personally would prefer using more acting, interactions, and development of the plot itself as oppose to plain verbal narration.Nonetheless, it is a great movie and I would definitely recommend it to those who are interested in political and social topics.",

It doesn't matter, there is no loss of continuity once you get a feel for the principal characters and see what direction they're going in. This is both a crime and political thriller that puts a single honest bureaucrat in the middle of a system that includes a thieving military, drug cartel gang-bangers and highly placed politicians all taking their cut from a disadvantaged citizenry. The story demonstrates just how flexible outlaws can be. When the drug trade in a poverty stricken province is eliminated, the dirty cop money dries up along with it, so the enterprising militia police simply turn to extorting people living in the slums for even greater benefit. It's all very depressing and seemingly insurmountable for a single individual to make headway under the conditions presented, though Lt. Colonel Nascimento (Wagner Moura) eventually makes some progress at the expense of personal trauma of his own. If your only experience of action films has been American made movies, this Brazilian picture will inspire you to seek out more foreign films for the professionalism they reveal in screen writing and cinematography.

It is the only one of all reviews here, and I've read them, which has accurate information in a well-written form. There's little to add to what Cl\u00e1udio already said, but if you're still not convinced, there are some extra stuff going on in and around this movie to incite your curiosity.First, the context, time and social appraisal this movie has received on the box-office weekend is even more complicated than we once thought. I'd just like to say I'm not a sucker for ratings or box-office earnings, but the fact that it toppled any other movie in Brazilian theaters, national or not, is obviously noteworthy.One month or so after the movie premiered, the actual BOPE was critical, alongside Brazil's Army and Rio State civil and military police, not to mention the huge political circus involved therein - on what's been infamously called The Invasion of the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, a huge gathering of equally enormous favela \"clusters\".It was the start of a new era on the fight against corruption, organized crime and political inaction. Or so we're led to believe. It turns out not only the anti-hero Captain Nascimento is next to irrelevant on the fight against the Powers that Be, but so is pretty much everyone else.Some people - myself included - have speculated that politicians used the upside-down popularity of the movie to go ahead with the invasion in the Alem\u00e3o. I don't know where Padilha stands on this, but I think I have a quite good idea on where he stands, as far as idolizing the police, BOPE, Nascimento or violent acts of any sort go. But who would have thought? We're THIS stupid. Fortunately, the Invasion was bloodless. Yes, fortunately and extremely weird.Anythewho... Add to that another unexpected impact of the movie on police crackdown on illegal DVD sales. While the first one notoriously skyrocketed pirate DVD purchases, which contributed to its fast insertion on public culture - the second one was remarkably unseen, or with good quality, in the streets with the camel\u00f4s.Overall, I'd classify this movie as a masterpiece on its own. I took 2 points out of it for being a sequel, but I'm torn and seriously considering changing to 10/10. \"City of God\" didn't have a sequel, and it's good just like that. In the other hand, if we didn't have this sequel, we wouldn't have such a powerful and strong movie, one that speaks deep - or should - to our innermost misconceptions about poverty and the mind-numbing War on Drugs.Unfortunately, the Steven Seagal-esque Brazil took a stand and it wasn't the one I like the most. People in power or not have and will keep misconstruing Padiha's work because we're just like that, we love to choose the moron way.",

As the public, his narrative drives us into learning the 'system', how it works and who manipulates it.If then we had drug dealers and users as the real enemies, as well as corrupt cops, now the enemies are far worse, such as politicians, TV hosts and voters (why not?), assisted by the same corrupt cops.It seems to me that this story holds a strong concept of a bridge, not a final, in a way that there could plausibly be a third movie, greater in size and in range, crossing the borders of Rio de Janeiro. Why not? Despite the fact that it is shown a lot less action, it's still a war movie, and it still repeats some of the success formula of the previous one.A must see.

            "content": "\"Despite possible coincidences with the reality, this movie is a work of fiction.\" This is a disclaimer at the beginning of \"Tropa de Elite 2 - O Inimigo Agora \u00c9 Outro\" (\"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\"), a sequel to the fantastic \"Tropa de Elite\". It also constitutes the first difference between the movies. While most of the crew stayed the same, including director Padilha, screenwriter Mantovani and former BOPE member Pimentel, they didn't film real life inspired events like in the first movie. Although, one can easily assume what the sequel depicts isn't far from the reality. The other difference is that in \"Tropa de Elite 2\" the focus moves from the BOPE unit to the politics.Roberto Nascimento returns as a narrator of the story, which is this time more centered on him, only now he has a different rank. He became Lt. Colonel and got in charge of whole of BOPE. But that doesn't last for long. Soon he's made Deputy Secretary of Intelligence in the state of Rio de Janeiro and changes BOPE uniform for a suit and tie. Nascimento decides to use his new position to make BOPE stronger and eradicate drug trafficking from the favelas. It takes him some time to realize it isn't him who's using the system but the other way around. Several other characters reappear, such as Andr\u00e9 Matias who became a Captain, F\u00e1bio, a dirty police Captain who got to the position of Lt. Colonel, or Rocha, another dirty cop who's taken over favelas. There are also some new characters representing the world of politics such as Governor of the state Gelino, Secretary of Intelligence Guaracy and Diogo Fraga, left-oriented State Representative who's married to Nascimento's ex-wife. The problem is that this time all of the characters are simplified. Each one has its views and no one revisits them except Nascimento. That's why he's such a great character. Going through different situations he learns and evolves, and he's ready to change his opinions in light of new information.Moving the focus of the story to politics, the movie got more diverse but also lost its punch. While Padilha combines various office meetings and street murders the best he can, the combination of the two just can't repeat the impact of the first movie. What doesn't help is that he already showed us the police is corrupt, and corruption of the politicians is a thing, I believe, well known amongst the people all over the world because it's present in probably every country. Maybe it's not as extreme as shown here, but it doesn't surprise to see some of them are willing to go one step further.So the movie shows us things we already know, but does it in a very good way. Most of the elements like Padilha's direction, Lula Carvalho's cinematography, Daniel Rezende's editing, and especially the acting by Wagner Moura, Irandhir Santos, Sandro Rocha and others, are as good as in the previous film. One thing that I found a little underwhelming is screenplay. Not that it's bad, but some of the characters seem inconsistent and everything is a bit over-explained.That is also the main problem of this movie. Everything that was subtextual in the first one is now explicitly shown, and, while in the first one you had to think and make your own conclusions, here it's mostly done for you. \"Tropa de Elite 2\" plays on emotions more than reason and does it skillfully. It just doesn't benefit from its detailed account as much as the first one did from its rawness.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Elite Squad 2: arrives not only addressing issues related to urban violence, corruption within the police and the suffering of innocents, thrown into the mire of suspects and profiteers ... or caught by a stray bullet. Making the subtitle count, the tape places the big institutions, the state, politicians and, in part, the media, as partners and financiers of actions and ideas that, in the long run, make things worse for everyone.After almost 15 years of the first time we followed him up the hill, he now no longer commands the action on the field, putting his face to hit - or, in this case, to be shot. He is now Lieutenant-Colonel Nascimento, remains at BOPE and leads the Caveiras, but who is on the street is Captain Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro), who long ago ceased to be the naive aspirate from behind. The scenario is critical: Bangu 1 has been taken and only the Elite Squad can resolve the situation. Maintaining his position that a good bandit is a dead bandit, Nascimento wants more than that they end up with each other in there. But on his way is Fraga (Iradhir Santos), a human rights activist, who sees the \"unconventional\" methods of the Caveiras with a critical eye - and he has the support of the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro, who does not want to repeat Carandiru and thus diminish your chances in election year.Nascimento became undersecretary of security in Rio de Janeiro, the person most responsible for the intelligence of the place, commanding wiretaps and investigations. It was the highest place that a Caveira had ever arrived, but he knows he only got there because in times of political election, no one wants to be against the people ... and the people are on his side. With this power in his hands, he manages to deal with the traffic in the capital of Rio de Janeiro, but that does not mean that the banditry is over. People soon discover other ways to earn money and thus the militias emerge, even more profitable than the \"allowance\" that used to come from drug dealers and as a bonus they also serve as an electoral cord, after all, who doesn't want their drug-free home?The construction of the script follows the same standards as the first Troop. There is Nascimento's cynical, engaged and emotional narration, the non-obvious and extremely well-worked flashback feature in the plot, taking a high point in the plot as a trigger for what led the character to that situation; and the moral, ethical and political message on the subject matter. What makes this a better film, however, is the much more organic use of narration - which practically doesn't bother you anymore and doesn't seem forced in critical situations -, the cyclical treatment given to the theme, which makes common criminals, police and corrupt politicians and the honest few of the work gain deserved prominence and have their individual arches well finished. Although it is concluded in a partially lazy way, after Nascimento's testimony in the Plenary, with the simple passage through the \"biggest burning of archives in the History of Rio de Janeiro \", the work is still sustaining itself in high. And despite the errors, their theme and development deserve applause.It is interesting to note that Padilha takes all the beliefs and certainties that Nascimento had in the first film and deconstructs them brilliantly here. At one point, Nascimento imagines the consequences of his plan for public security, only to later the audience understand, with the help of the character himself, that nothing that had been planned actually happened. In this way, the continuation works not only as a mere unfolding of the themes proposed in the first tape, but as an evolution of that feature, showing that the merely coercive answer to the problem of violence works as well as a small bandage for a gangrenous leg.But there are too many enemies to face. The protagonist hesitates before them and describes this network in so many details that it even sounds didactic. They are repeated - to applause from the audience - slaps, torture, shots and executions, but it is at the point of inflection of the character, when he aligns himself with the discourse of defending human rights and finds that the war machine oiled with such zeal for him fed political endeavors beyond his control, which is the big question of the film.Nascimento now shows himself to be melancholy, at times impotent and feeling the weight of the responsibilities of a father and a public figure exposed to interests that he no longer controls. In a way, he capitulates to the ideas that he has always condemned. What Jos\u00e9 Padilha does when building the saga of the character is first-rate cinema, including emphasizing the slowing down of his posture, freeing him from a tedious linear existence, which in the case of Captain Nascimento was punctuated by bumps. So much talent, vibrant on the screen, is almost lost by the indignant political reflection that although it serves our times well, it becomes shallow as an advertising flyby over the National Congress, while the voice of the narrator accuses the top of the pyramid of such \"system\".It is in Fraga (Irandhir Santos in a consecrating performance), a boring speech activist, that Nascimento finds support to mortally strike \"the system\".The film also ceases to be the story of Matias, to be that of Nascimento. Before the narrator, the character is now also the protagonist and a lot will happen in the almost two hours of duration. And Wagner Moura is there again to show the human side of the character, to give texture and depth to the tough character who goes out into the streets to fight crime and returns home with his shoulders falling more and more, as if he were carrying all problems that exist in the world. Colonel Nascimento reveals at every moment his frustration with his real enemy. Now, Nascimento is a man who was born to fight, so much so that the moments of tenderness and dialogue that he has with his son are on a jiu-jitsu mat. Placing him in the enemy's territory completely outside his field of action was crucial to show us a more fragile side of that man and make him revise his beliefs. But Moura does not shine alone. If the characters of Andr\u00e9 Ramiro, Andr\u00e9 Mattos (Fortunato) and Sandro Rocha (Russo) add drama and canastrice to the plot, it is up to F\u00e1bio interpreted by Millhen Cortaz some of the phrases already candidates for new catchphrases. This maturity that we see in the script and in the construction of the characters is what gives Troop 2 a different face, unfortunately even closer to us Brazilians.But the moments of comic relief only work so well because the rest of the film is full of action and tension. Rhythm marking, through editing, finds in this film a series of locational advantages. The contrast between the \"good\" and the \"bad\" city on the screen helps, by itself, to give a different atmosphere to the film, social and environmental contrasts that photographer Lula Carvalho handles with precision and in a much more elegant way than in the previous film, achieving not only great shots and some great plans in continuation, but rawer environments, more consistent with the plot. Padilha's still restless camera finishes the job, bringing an urgency rhythm and suggesting something documentary, as is its characteristic, working the environments in front of a simple soundtrack and with striking songs; precious use of sound editing and mixing and production design that does not distract the viewer.Directed safely by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, from the incursion into the favela of Rio accompanied by a BOPE helicopter, until when he exhibits the allegory of the end of the traffic in two different scenes - one as Nascimento imagined it was going to happen and the other that is the reflection of in reality, the editing also stands out, making the narrative agile and dynamic, as in the attack at the beginning of the projection. Daniel Rezende's editing - nominated for an Oscar for City of God - takes you by the hand to where you want it and drops you there, with your heart beating hard and fast like bullets coming out of machine guns. And don't be fooled into imagining that the bullets there are as blind as those in Hollywood films. Like BOPE, Padilha does not spare his characters and whoever has to die to give realism to the plot, will not last on the screen.Closing the narrative with a panoramic view of Brasilia that ends up pointing to several culprits that exist in politics, Elite Squad 2 dares more than just being a continuation of a product. The evolution shown in the themes and technique of the first film for this one does not detract from the original feature in any way, which gains even more strength with the personal growth of Nascimento in the sequence. More than a succession of shots and catch phrases, \"Elite Squad 2 -\" is a dense and fearless work, which does not shy away from exposing the problems of a sick society and a dying political system.",

            "content": "There is something so beautiful in the craft that cannot be shown without violence but above that puts you in the position that at the end, the violence was definitely unnecessary. The beauty was in the organization, the justice. The creators of these films (City of God, Elite Squad 1 and 2) keep investing gold not only to themselves, to Brazil, but the entirety of this planet. When I learned that Elite Squad had a sequel, I was intensely scared to be disappointed by the sequel and decided to think before watching this because the first film was too beautiful to be destroyed by a continuity. Inshallah, apart from the first and second installment of Godfather, this is definitely the only sequel to a movie that I think is even better than the original one. No longer do I think that the first or this one was fragile. The consistency-or in this case, improvement, is solid in any scale. When the film mentioned, no wonder there are slums - I questioned myself spontaneously, \"the people are resilient but resilient against what?\" People should really choose what they become resilient against because we are the people and we live with what we become resilient to. Are they worth it or worth changing? Sometimes lifetimes pass with nothing changed. Sometimes, lifetimes pass with at least a dent in the universe-or a community to say the least, and sometimes, the most. In Europe they say, \"Be good, and if you can't be good, be careful.\" That echoes the character development of officer Nascimento in this film and it paid off because he identified his enemies on time and on that time, he was ready (God, this part made me smile so big, I think I even whispered 'fyes' strongly haha). I cannot limit to words my appreciation and admiration for the creators and the entire cast (every single actor in this film, no matter the screen time). This is more than a film. This casted a spell of knowledge, a fuel for change. \nFor more like this apart from City of God and Elite Squad: The Godfather, Buybust, ML, Liway, Heneral Luna, and Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral.",

            "content": "That a sequel was made by the same director and with the same cast of the original is pretty much always a good sign, or at least you can't immediately get p*ssed off and think it will suck (being that the common feeling for an unexpected, at least for me it was, sequel). TROPA DE ELITE 2 is an example of a sequel that, to begin with, doesn't wants to be a copy of the original. If another director would have worked here the result could have possibly be the very same TROPA DE ELITE (2007) but with new, younger characters, or perhaps it would have been a straight action picture. Jos\u00e9 Padilha is fortunately here to explore more of his characters and ultimately change the whole setting. We move from the streets of Rio de Janeiro, and the insides of the BOPE, to the political sector of that same Brazilian city; much like in the series THE WIRE, where the first season was mainly set in the streets of Baltimore, US and as time went by we got to see the syndicates, the political sector and even a complete Baltimore election. Is a natural transition for any story dealing with crime, I mean, it's always just a matter of tie to get where the real money and drug traffic flows. One would think once we enter into politics and stuff the violence will be considerably less than in the favelas but TROPA DE ELITE 2 sure is much more dark and depressing than the original; which was about the how \u2013 we learned about BOPE, its essence and tactics to deal with crime in Rio. It was, still with all of the real, hard issues of Rio presented, a sort-of satisfying movie. But now is all about the why \u2013 main character Nascimento cannot offer the same security and even he will doubt during the whole thing. The very satisfying ending of the first movie, in which Nascimento finally finds some peace after the most stressful time anyone could experience, goes to hell right from the beginning of this sequel. Actor Wagner Moura is fantastic; you see him one second and immediately buy that 10 or so years has passed since the events of the original. Like I said, this is a character exploration, especially with Nascimento. Yes, in the original we got to see the personal life of this character but still you'll find rather odd some issues here \u2013 for instance, he is now a divorced man, with a not-very-good relation with his son, and the new partner of his ex-wife is not really a nobody in the whole story dealing with politics. Too much drama? Well, maybe, but eventually nothing feels out of place. And it's very effective \u2013 you get to think in, for example, that wonderful, soulful moment (from the original) when Nascimento tells his pals that his son is about to born; or in everything about the character Andr\u00e9. Now there's no joy remaining. Jos\u00e9 Padilha is removing almost every single piece of satisfying material (forget about BOPE as a sort-of heroic, not judged by anybody, unit) to give his story a conclusion in the vein of the one of CIDADE DE DEUS and THE WIRE (if that makes sense to you).",

This second has been an unbelievable cinema success in home country Brazil, and I really understand why both have been commercial successes, both in cinemas and later on with DVD, VOD and so on.I thought the first was great, but this is even better. Many has given good words about this film, but I'd like to express that I think this sublime film making in any way. And after the appraisals of th firs, it's very difficult to make th second live up to the first, and even exceed the huge expectations.This film goes to the core of the main problems of one of the countries which have had the best economical development as well as getting more people out of poverty. Corruption is the main theme of this film, more than drug trafficking. No true story, but acted out so that you really believe it is.Corruption is without doubt the most sincere problem the world faces today. Not only to stop narc-problems and trafficking, but also all the other reasons for attracting money and power, as cutting down rain forest or all kinds of trade. A huge problem, spreading like no other decease.Rarely a narrative voice does I go me, however, in this film it's most appropriate. If you want to see an exciting film with no Hollywood nonsense, which lingers in your mind afterwards, the this is one to watch. You can see this without seeing the first \"Trope de Elite\", but if you got the chance to see the other first, then do, in promise that the second is even better than the first.",

And even if you have not watched the first one, you will enjoy the new \"adventures\" of Lt. Colonel Nascimento.The movie starts with Nascimento having some problems at the job. But instead of being kicked out of the BOPE, he gets a promotion. And then is when things start to get complicated, when a man used to be with the direct violence in Brazil's everyday life, gets to 'enjoy' sharing his time with the structural and cultural violence that comes from the system, the rich and the politicians.And the movie does a great job in keeping everything interesting, even if the action is tone down compared with the first movie. You get nice plot developments, interesting characters' arcs and a lot of food for thought. Nothing is particularly original (power corrupts is not something that you have never heard before), but the message and its delivery is strong.It helps that the use of locations is great, that the acting (with Moura again doing a great job as Nascimento) is top notch, and that the direction keeps the pace fast and fresh, the almost two hours of movie finished in a breeze.

            "content": "Sure, the action in \"Elite Squad:The Enemy WIthin\" is furious, just as good as anything Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, or Jane Doe has ever offered out of Hollywood. But, what really sets this film apart is it's dark, seedy layers.The main character, Nascimento, is a torn man. He's torn between work and home, torn between personal gain and political responsibility.. I can't remember an action film where the conflict of the main character was explored more thoroughly than this.Visually, the film is just stunning. The hue's all seem like the west coast at dusk. Orange and Blue's all over the place. You can almost feel the Brazilian heat coming off the screen.Admittedly, I haven't seen the first film, but I didn't get the feeling that there was really anything that I missed. This film stands perfectly on it's own. I will definitely check out the first film after this experience.This is a really good movie. It's not just for action junkies - the story is complex, and so are the characters.This is probably in my top 25-30 foreign films of all-time(approx 300 viewed/probably in that 20-30 range). To put the ranking in perspective, I liked this more than Joint Security Area(Korean), and more than Battle Royale too, but not quite as much as Kontroll. Kontroll isn't as deep, or maybe even as good technically, but the one thing that made Kontroll great that Elite Squad kinda lacks is fantastic music within the movie itself. Some great music slipped into the middle of this film could have literally set this over-the-top in the pantheon of perfect 10's. That's my only, minimal gripe.This film is kinda-like the hardcore action and violence of \"Black Hawk Down\" meets the political undertones and drama of \"The Dancer Upstairs\" from John Malkovich.I guess I was expecting a mindless action flick on a shoestring budget(see Dredd 7/10), and not so much the powerhouse of a cinematic experience that came out of the netflix sleeve.Highly Recommended! 84/100 You'll like this if you liked:The Three Burials of Melquies Estrada(not as good), The Dancer Upstairs(about even), Joint Security Area(slightly below), Kontroll(about even or slightly above this), and City of God(about even).",

He looks outside. A late-night world shielded from me by thick double-glazing. \"Yeah, it must be okay,\" he says, \"The buses are running again, so I guess the shooting has stopped.\" I make my way gingerly back to my apartment. Past dubious drinking companions, their backs pressed against the wall, beer in hand, and frivolous smirks lighting up their faces. No way was a simple gun battle going to spoil their evening's revelry! From the safety of my 13th floor apartment, I watch the streets for a while, high tech armaments barking deadly colours through the night, like an obscene light show, on the nearby hill. Earlier, stray bullets had wandered from the high-up slums into the town below. The Net caf\u00e9 manager and other residents take such things in their stride.Gun battles erupt in Rio de Janeiro from time to time as the three drug cartels fight over territory. A clean-up operation was the subject of the first Elite Squad movie, a fictional account that was too close to fact for comfort. Years after my brush with live ammo, and four years after that movie, comes a major update. The special police force, BOPE or 'elite squad' is still riddled with corruption. Drugs (long seen as an 'American' problem anyway, as the US provides the main demand) are no longer quite as profitable. But extortion, by police and politicians, is running wild.Generically, Elite Squad II is a good-cop / bad-cop movie. But what marks it out is painstaking realism and accuracy in relation to actual events, with script contributions, as in the first movie, by a former BOPE captain. It struck such a chord in Brazil last year that it quickly became the biggest selling movie of all time.But it is not the 'story that no-one dares to say' that makes Elite Squad II so powerful. Nor the 80 real cops drafted in as extras. Nor even the hair-raising battles, the bloody prison riot, nor the consistently fine acting. It is the way the action reveals a division of opinion over what to do about Rio slum-violence. There are intellectuals, human rights groups, 'reformists' (as well as a lot of international pressure groups) who press for clemency, education, and the reform of criminals. Then there are many non- slum-dwelling citizens, from intellectuals to caf\u00e9 owners, who just want any of the hoodlums dead at any cost. And at the bottom line is votes. Votes, votes, votes. The public will not support any soft-line politician. Letting two gangs kill each other during a prison riot seems temptingly politically expedient. Corrupt BOPE officers, creaming off extortion money from every type of business in the slums, can guarantee votes. This is Brazil. A country that fights to enshrine a modern, accountable political system \u2013 but in the face of pressures it can barely control. BOPE, designed to eradicate corruption, has become corruption's main source. And Lt. Colonel Nascimento, who created the monster, has been promoted to a 'safe' desk job. There, he realises that his superiors right up the political ladder are on the gravy train.The dichotomy between peaceniks and blood-bathers is represented by (the now more mature) Nascimento and his trained officers on one hand, and Diogo Fraga, a left wing Congressman on the other. As Nascimento puts his own life in danger to uphold integrity within BOPE, rabble-rousers urge more bloodshed. Nascimento's son turns against him, his wife leaves him to marry Fraga. The differences in approach are thrashed out not just with guns and armour-plated vans. They are thrashed out in the more emotional battlefield of a family torn apart by their beliefs. And a problem to which there is no easy answer.The first Elite Squad movie became so influential that it is frequently cited by scholars and authorities whenever violence breaks out in Rio. Elite Squad II seems likely to follow suit. But will Western audiences find it so interesting when they could instead be watching a (far more fictional) cop drama such as Scorsese's The Departed? Subtitled movies tend to appeal to an art-house crowd \u2013 and, of those, the ones with little or no interest in a country that is barely mentioned on the Western news (even if Brazil is the size of the USA) may not feel inclined to immerse themselves in two hours of tightly woven plot full of blood, guts and heartache. For what? To better understand a system that seems to have little or no relevance to life in the 'West.' And this is a shame.",

            "content": "Plot: An elite police force destroy the gangs, only for the corrupt cops and politicians to take overElite Squad 2 could easily have been a familiar re-tread of the first film, in which BOPE, a super-SWAT team, take on gangsters in the Brazilian slums with military efficiency. Instead, it goes deeper and darker. BOPE are given the room (having been hindered by human rights types) to destroy the gangsters, which they do, thinking that if they get rid of the gangs then crime will end. But it doesn't work. Corrupt cops and politicians step in and take over. They only created a void, which was instantly filled. BOPE's leader, in despair, allies with the human rights types and exposes the corrupt, trying to take down the system (which it won't). The conservative has become a revolutionary. The problem is society. The only non-corrupt element is BOPE, forged in battle and loyal to itself and the idea of the nation.Right-wingers can enjoy the magnificently choreographed SWAT sequences (best watched in cinema) and the way in which BOPE, freed of restrictions, take out the criminals. Lefties can enjoy the way in which, whilst disagreeing on the details, this film shows that the problems are societal and that killing criminals changes almost nothing. This is a tremendously enjoyable film, with its paramilitary fetishism, pumping soundtrack and explosive gunfights. There is also plenty of intellectual meat to dig your teeth into - you could nod to Pontecorvo and re-title this \"The Battle of the Favelas\" easily. Well worth a watch, as entertainment and a glimpse of Europe's future.",

Elite Squad 2 is superb, entertaining, slick and interesting colliding BOPE into a circle of political corruption and complication (Mafia and the militia).BOPE (the Elite Squad) is now a beefed up operation, led by main character Nasicmento, an admirable crime fighting genius. It gets involved in taking down the campaign team for an election candidate, including the police, media and politicians. The film has drugs, guns, power and greed, creating a knuckle clenching drama ride.Yes it is a bit hectic, macho and confusing but the action, drama and settings make this another Brazilian work of art, depicting corruption and the fight for justice.

People die, especially in Rio de Janerio.This movie brings up the evil that exists in our society. There is always someone ready to walk over corpses so that themselves can move up in the world. It's easier if you don't see yourself as a bad guy. You rationalize it or let someone else get the \"job done\".

Expect to be sitting on needles throughout the movie only to register your mind is blown once it's over. \"This is f\u00fccked up\" I heard myself saying. The credits starts rolling. I pause and ponder.This is the situation most over the world! Politicians and business giants loosing track of their ideals to get more money, more power. Why? Maybe being of significance, not being another dust speck in a desert is why. But you knew about greedy men before Tropa de Elite 2, so why did this movie touch you the way other media did not? I'd say this movie showed us more layers, more perspective than before. I wished a character who was \"normal\" with it's opinions and thoughts about life in Rio was missed. Guess I can always go there and ask someone myself.This movie is officially my new favorite drug/slum movie, knocking down \"City of God\" to a second place and I doubt it will ever be placed third.I want to ask you a question.

Building on the success of 2007's \"Elite Squad,\" Lt. Colonel Nascimento is back to take the fight to the drug cartels as well as the corruption within Rio's law enforcement and political system, exposing the true depths of the city's social problems. Breathless, brutal, and thrilling. It's a gut punch of an action movie with political undertones.Police Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Nascimento (Wagner Moura) has devoted his entire life to taking down Rio de Janeiro's most notorious criminals. He leads a special ops group (NOPE) known for its uncompromising effectiveness, but his efforts haven't received a lot of support from the corrupt authorities. When Nascimento's attempts to defuse a prison riot, it turns into a blood bath, and the media creates a public frenzy. The government is eager to use the incident as an excuse to fire Nascimento, but the level of public support for the Colonel's actions is overwhelmingly positive. As such, Nascimento is promoted to a high-ranking security position. Initially, it seems that this new power will grant him the ability to fight crime even more effectively. Alas, it doesn't take long before he realizes that the corruption runs even deeper than he could have suspected. The system has no center, Nascimento tells us, and it always wins.The corruption of the Brazilian political system serves as a backdrop to the unrestrained violence and tension that permeates throughout the film. The action sequences are swift, violent, and sharply crafted. \"The Enemy Within\" presents the question -- which is worse: the amoral politicians who run the city, or the violent cartels who oversee the slums? Padilha's film offers no easy answers, but the title is a tip-off as to where at least his sympathies lie.The film, with its slick production and on-point narration by Moura as Nascimento is an edgy, action-drenched thriller dipped in blood and dirty politics. Still, even during its slickest Hollywood-style action sequences, it's hard to ignore the unyielding, socially conscious anger which fuels the movie. While \"The Enemy Within\" is not as punchy as its trigger-happy predecessor \"Elite Squad,\" is an intriguing slice of drama with the advantage of a much more balanced standpoint. Previous crime dramas such as \"City of God\" (2002), \"Carandiru\" (2003) and Padhila's own 2002 debut \"Bus 174\" have helped make Brazilian cinema an international critically acclaimed medium. Thankfully, \"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\" successfully continues with this trajectory.",

In the first movie, they show how hard it is to get in Bope and how well prepared they are to face corruption on the military police, and Matias, the new Bope's captain, dies dumbly.All that the new dudes in Bope learned to do in the previous film didn't have a deepening now. I was expecting to see Bope fighting against corruption and the drugs traffic way more than they did in this movie. It seems they suffered the heck out of their pants to get in the corporation and now they look useless and powerless. That's what frustrated me.Still a must see movie which will be remembered for years, and I hope not only in its country.Edit 2011: Dudes pay attention... we have the reviews and taglines like \"best movie ever\", \"brazilian's masterpiece\", and \"awesome.\" But then, if you look at the profiles of the reviewers, 90% of them have reviewed only this movie and loved it from the heart.

Watching ELITE SQUAD THE ENEMY WITHIN the sequel to the 2007 film ELITE SQUAD you're left with the distinct impression writer director Jose Padilha is claiming his original film wasn't a manifesto for fascism . However you can't help feeling the message of this film is flawed and totally confusing Like the first film the story jumps back in time to a riot in a Brazilian jail . We've all seen these news reports of gang wars inside Latin American jails , you know the ones that kill several dozen people and get about twenty seconds on the world headlines . The protagonist/narrator Roberto Nascimento is now a Lt Colin in BOPE while his understudy Matias is now a captain . From the outset it's clear Nascimentos nemesis is bleeding heart academic Diogo Fraga who tries to stop the prison violence via negotiation . Things don't go as planned because the prison ringleader is shot dead and Fraga doesn't like this because .... well even convicted criminals have rights so goes out of his way to get BOPE closed down This is a far more complex film than the original but despite the film's assurances that it isn't condoning fascism one can't help feeling that there's something latently fascist about the subtext . The villains of the movie are military police but they're not necessarily the villains because they murder people but because they're corrupt . Again you get the impression that Nascimento and Matias are the good guys because they're incorruptible rather than upholders of the law . Good guys don't take bribes and kill criminals and that makes them good guys , bad guys take bribe sand mainly kill criminals and it's only when they rape and kill a female journalist they become bad ? Have I got that right ? You could literally go insane trying to work out the moral message of this movie THE ENEMY WITHIN does deserve some credit for blurring the lines between good and evil and perhaps it would have worked even better if the military police unit hadn't been so overdone as bad guys . That said it still remains a fascinating portrayal of the dark side of Latin American culture where democracy is slightly different from what we;re used to in Wite Anglo Saxon Protestant tradition . It's also interesting that Padilha is working on a remake of ROBOCOP one of my favourite films from the 1980s . Despite my criticisms of THE ENEMY WITHIN it remains a very compelling drama and I hope he brings his dubious morality to Hollywood . Dare I say we're watching a Sam Peckinpah for the 21st Century on the horizon ?",

Honestly, the story isn't as complicated as inception but it shows the high complexity when you have a corrupt government and police. You have gang wars, government-police wars, gang-police wars and wars. This sequel includes additional character that speaks about human rights which is so in contradiction with wars and killing people. The story when more complex than the first movie.Not only wars, this movie also has drama in it. You can see it when Nascimiento got divorced, conflict between Nascimiento and Mathias, and more. I don't like too much drama in an action movie and this movie just perfectly fit it.These movies may tells us story about wars in Rio and a life of a BOPE commander, but it also tells us that wars may never ends happy.

Never have we seen blood, gore or true violence caused by crime, never have we felt true fear cause of it nor did we ever felt threatened by its existence. It was always somewhere around us, subtle and contained. A few gunshots here and there, few times a year..But, my country Croatia did survive a bloody civil war during the nineties. And I was shocked to see that the Brazilians who are living in \"favelas\" are experiencing the same on a daily basis. All those youngsters walking around with automatic rifles, it's very sad. A few months ago I've read a newspaper article about Brazilians getting ready for the upcoming Football World Cup in June 2014. It had a lot to do with \"militarizing favelas\". Now I know what that means!Yesterday I've watched the first part on TV and immediately looked it up on IMDb. I've found out that the second part was made and after seeing it, I was amazed. This IS a high quality movie with a natural story sequence - quality intro followed by a really good narration that in short explains everything there is to know concerning the subject. Then the story builds up in orderly fashion while presenting some new characters and upgrading ones from the first part. The interesting thing here is that physical interpretation/appearance of characters is right on target. A genuine, hard boiled bullseye. Politicians are made to look like sleaze bags, bad guys are tough and good guys are balanced, as they make mistakes too. And yeah, ladies and gentleman, I proudly present the return of The Climax. When you are watching this movie, you'll actually feel the point when poop hits the fan and you'll actually squeeze your fists while demanding justice. In the end you'll get what you expect. It really lifts you up fast. Then it kinda gently puts you back on your feet. As justice is served the final message slaps you in the face. Want to know what it is? Go ahead, watch the movie. It is truly time well spent.Quality dialog, great characters, nice story, good action - this movie has it all. Job well done. The problem that this movie is successfully tackling is publicly probably the most overseen detail of the preparations for the upcoming Football World Cup 2014 in Brazil.

            "review_title": "better and even more intriguing than the first Elite Squad",
            "content": "It had been a while since I had seen Elite Squad part 1, and though the sort of hero of the story, Colonel Nascimento (Moura) is the same and some of the characters return for this story (such as Andre Matias, from the actor Andre Romero), one of the best things about it is that it can mostly be watched on its own terms. You can go straight into Elite Squad: The Enemy Within, and I'm not sure what you would miss from the first entry in the story. The difference I think here is that the focus is on the system at large, how the criminals in the gangs are just a small part of the picture of corruption that is drawn, and it involves representatives, the governor, so many people who make things tick the wrong ways.I think in my previous review of part 1 I said there was a run of \"nihilistic nastiness\", and also that there was no real enemy to the story. Maybe Padillha knew that as a storyteller and saw to make having some sort of person or people of conflict crucial to his film. In this story, which starts at one point and goes back four years to show how Nascimento goes from being the head of his BOP squad group to being promoted into the system - the surveillance and head of all the major officers in the city (he's not the only one in charge, and how he gets promoted comes from some controversy following a prison shoot-out which opens the movie) - we see how the system works and fails the people of the slums. A question is even asked near the end: why are there slums in the first place? Exploitation of the poor, sapping them of every dime possible more than anything. The film shows in its very harsh point of view that if you take out the drug dealers, it leaves fresh room for the corrupt cops.How corrupt? Well, they basically operate like another mafia (I love the little moment where the massive TV host cum representative questions how it can be a 'mafia' since that's Italy and people eat rice and beans in Brazil, as if the comparison makes sense), and what's fascinating and what I respect about the storytelling is how Padillha makes his hero always understanding of the world he's in, but until the third act he's a step or two behind. He gives the audience - he calls it as 'my friend' as if we are just one person at his long monologue - insight into what corrupt cops will do to a place like the sums of Rio (there's two, one of which sort of takes Nascimento's place in the BOP, and they're both genre character-types you've seen before, but in an entertaining way). Oh, and there's a person who is in the sort of gray area, Diogo Fraga (probably my favorite performance of the lot, Irandihir Santos), who is steadfastly for human rights and exposing the truth and is somehow now married to Nascimento's ex-wife, and what if he is one of these too-soft liberals that mucks up Nascimento's strategies to wipe out the gangs? I like the characters and the story itself so much, how the filmmakers really dig deep into how systematic the corruption gets but to that point where people almost don't notice it at times or care, or they get indignant when things like the truth comes up (sort of like The Wire but in Brazil, in a way), but I wish that some of the storytelling choices were better. Like the first movie, and of course by its main antecedent City of God, it's loaded with wall-to-wall narration from the protagonist. Some of it is useful to know, but a lot of it isn't, and there are times (I'd say the split is 30% useful and 70% not) when the filmmakers dropped the voice-over so that we (or I) could get involved in the action more, or something as simple as a character walking into a building or a place. It sinks the movie down to points that are not helpful to the narrative, even as this is the sort of 'best' man, our guide through this world.There's also a sub-plot with the Nascimento's son and ex-wife, and some melodrama there, which is fine but not as strong as the main story lines. But ultimately what helps make Elite Squad 2 memorable the most is the momentum it builds in the final 30 minutes, when s*** really starts to hit the fan for all the characters and people start to make their power plays - will it simply involve guns and wiping people out (to the point where, as with one character, it's where a person gets charred down to the skeleton with teeth pulled out), or more cleverly, sticking it out in the public for all to see. It's an intense wrap-up to what is an otherwise good if not great crime saga.",

He is reassigned to working with state security. Now he has to deal with the worst types of criminals - politicians.The first Elite Squad movie was great, and this is just as good. Interesting, compelling and gritty. Good action and drama, and it all happens at a cracking pace. However, the ending is a bit rushed and contrived.Good performances all round, especially from Wagner Moura in the lead role.",

            "content": "Correcting every single element that bothered me in the first film, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within marks a definite improvement over its predecessor for it discards the experimental approach of the previous chapter to opt for a more traditional procedure, and while it may lack the raw power of the original, it more than makes up for it with its sturdy storytelling.The sequel to Elite Squad, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within continues the semi-fictional tale of BOPE, Rio de Janerio's Special Police Operations Squad, and follows the journey of its former leader who is promoted to a high-ranking security officer following a prison riot but soon finds himself standing against a new enemy that has the ruling government's support.Co-written & directed by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, The Enemy Within brings significant upgrades in all filmmaking departments for its plot progresses in a streamlined manner while its non-linear narration exhibits a better balance than before. Padilha's direction shows more confidence and unlike the last picture, the screenplay converges its subplots towards the same route instead of branching out in all directions.Production design team chips in with more refined sets, Cinematography encapsulates the picture with the nearly-same gritty layer but this time the drama also benefits from its fluid camera-work. Editing does a complete turn around for the events unfold in a smoother way while the pace is absolutely relentless. And as far as performances go, the reprising cast is top-notch while the new additions have a thing or two to say as well.On an overall scale, Elite Squad: The Enemy Within is a brilliantly directed, smartly written, skilfully photographed, tightly edited, ferociously paced & strongly performed crime drama that corrects the errors of the original to conclude its saga on a satisfying note. The better film of the two, this brutal, unflinching & violent ride into the Brazilian underbelly is a better structured, better balanced & better executed sequel that comes throughly recommended.",

            "content": "\"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\" is a crime movie in which we watch a man who is a high ranking security officer in Rio de Janeirois is swept into a political dispute in which they want to make him confess about some things that he did not do. Before that position he was a Captain of a special team called BOPE.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which I found simply magnificent. The direction of this movie which made by Jos\u00e9 Padilha was equally good and in many moments you could not understand if it was a movie or a real life events. I also liked the interpretation of Wagner Moura who played as Lt. Colonel Nascimento and he was simply outstanding on his part. Another interpretations that I want to mention are Irandhir Santos' who played as Diogo Fraga, Andr\u00e9 Ramiro who played as Captain Andr\u00e9 Matias and Andr\u00e9 Mattos who played as Fortunato.Finally I have to say that \"Elite Squad: The Enemy Within\" is a great movie to watch because it shows many truths about Brazil and about corruption in general. The only movie with which I can compare is \"City of God\" which I believe is just a masterpiece. I strongly recommend both of them.",

The head of the police force (I think) has to deal with a corrupt special unit who is pushing out and murdering drug gangs in order to profit from the citizens in many ways. Anyone to cross their path, bad or good better watch out. Once the protagonist learns what is happening he attempts to zero in and eradicate the immoral corruptors. Will he be successful or will he be another casualty in their bloodbath? The film is gritty and has many characters to sort out. This being a foreign film, I felt I was constantly reading subtitles and wasn't able to watch enough of the action as even when the characters weren't talking there was narration. Not a problem, just the way it is. Good acting, editing, pacing and it was good dialog so I was engaged throughout. Solid and bloody.",

Elite Squad is by far one of the most powerful and exciting flicks made in this decade, to say the least. This movie, Elite Squad 2, grew with a high hype and a name to live for, and to be honest I didn't want to watch it until tons of good comments came from different forums pinched my curiosity.As the tag says, ES2 has this time a different enemy. A bigger and even more dangerous one. The sequel really changed it focus, action and violence were in the background as politics and dialogs were the mainstream. The result was a movie that make you think, take sides and enjoy. This is the kind of movies that is better to see with some friends to discuss it after.So, Elite Squad 2 is still powerful and violent, but do not expect a movie like the first one... as we always do with sequels. Still, this movie is enjoyable and has a variety of new stuff that is nice to analyze.",

And it is the only \"flaw\" I can see on it, since lots went to the movie expecting the same action as the first movie.Elite Squad 2 is more for Brazilian public, and try to make some correlations between the drug traffic and Brazilian politicians in several aspects.. and does it well.

            "content": "\"Tropa de elite 2\" is a timeless film for Brazil, its dramas, anguish and denunciations persist more and more in our scenario, Jos\u00e9 Padilha evolves his speech and manages to improve a film that was already great, making it reach another level.With a much more mature script, elite troop 2 talks about the basis of corruption that causes all the evils it fought, until it understands that one of the evils, trafficking, will never end, as it is subsidized by the system, which is corrupt and flawed, admitting poverty and hunger and allowing the unbridled creation of crime, which must be voraciously combated but which is only the tip of the iceberg.With fewer catchphrases, keeping great characters and excelling at maturing, the film goes up the slum less and shows the real bandits, the politicians.The direction is still refined and raw, with few moments of smoothness but a spectacular pace, a simpler but present track and great ambiences.The performances are great, all the actors, even the corrupt ones reported are charismatic in their ways, with emphasis on Wagner Moura who also shows a greater maturity in his acting, more serene and thoughtful, the actors mix very well between drama and humor .\"Tropa de elite 2\" is better than its predecessor - although the first is still my favorite - more consistent in all its artistic and technical parameters and remains a film that talks a lot with the Brazilian reality.

It seems there is not a single steady shot in this movie. If the intention was to convey some subtle impression of permanent action the target was missed, because all it managed to do was make me dizzy and hope the movie will end faster. Even the starting credits were a pain to watch because of the sudden flashes of bright light in between black screens. There are lots and lots of talking, some Hollywood inspired action with a slight Brazilian flavor, a pretty common script and a horrifying description of the way things work in Rio. I certainly hope the movie grossly exaggerates the situation. It may be the best box office Brazilian hit, but certainly it isn't the best Brazilian movie.",

I don't have big negative points for this film, I practically don't have them, maybe I wish it was longer because it was one of the best action movies I've ever seen. Enjoyable, violent, hard and tangible, a portrait of the harshness of living in a violent and corrupt country and the constant fight between two forces that use the same means to exercise power: violence.",
