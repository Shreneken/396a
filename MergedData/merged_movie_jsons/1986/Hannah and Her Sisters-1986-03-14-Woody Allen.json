            "content": "\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a comedy/drama (though mostly drama) about a dozen characters and their stories, all connecting back to three sisters: Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest).  Hannah is the favorite, talented and kind, Lee is almost equally favored, but Holly is the outcast, with a past of drugs and always asking for money.  Other characters include Hannah's hypochondriac ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), her current husband Elliot (Michael Caine), Lee's boyfriend Frederic (Max von Sydow) and Holly's friend April (Carrie Fisher).Like I said before, this is not so much a comedy as it is a drama.  The comedy that's in it fits, and is good, but the drama is better.  Elliot's secret love for Lee is handled in a romantic way, but their infidelity is still seen as wrong, and you feel their guilt and inner turmoil.  Mickey thinks he has a brain tumor, he finds out he doesn't and then he feels worse, and starts desperately searching for a purpose to live.  All the other stories are equally dramatic, with comedy fittingly sprinkled in places too.The acting is quite good, everyone playing their part perfectly, whether it's big or small.  The film's best performances come from Allen (in what's no doubt his best performance) and Dianne Wiest as the extremely under-confident youngest sister.  Allen and Wiest don't necessarily carry the film, as there's no need to, but their segments were certainly the best, for me at least.  The rest of the cast put forward too, especially Max von Sydow and Michael Caine in his first (and so far his only deserving) Oscar win.Woody Allen's direction is at the top of its form here too, much like \"Annie Hall\" and his other greats.  The camera work and use of voice overs are excellent.  For instance, there is an intensely dramatic scene where the three sisters have lunch together and for the entire scene the camera rotates around the table, the speaker not always in the frame.  His script is great too, it knows when to be dramatic and when to be funny and when to be both.One of Allen's very best, 8/10.",

            "content": "Arguably Woody Allen's best production with the exception of \"Annie Hall\". The film follows three sisters (Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey and Oscar-winner Dianne Wiest) through their careers and their relationships. Farrow is the backbone that keeps everything together. However, husband Michael Caine (Oscar-winning) has his eye of Hershey and something might come of his crush. Max Von Sydow is seeing Hershey, but he may not be enough to curve her lust. Wiest seems to be the odd one out as she struggles with everything, thinking of herself as second-rate to sister Farrow. You know she might fit in well with Farrow's ex-husband (the priceless Allen). A wild film of vivid characters that entertains to the paramount. Allen received an Oscar for his screenplay and was nominated yet again for his dead-on direction. Not a perfect film, but Allen's amazing story-telling and his superb creation of memorable characters and sequences make \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" one of the better films of the 1980s. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

Michael Caine is the most touching, Mia Farrow, as always, close to heartbreaking. I think it's her voice that does it. Nice scenes with her and her real-life mother, Maureen O'Sullivan.Like Manhattan, this picture looks beautiful; NY in all its many breath- taking colors. The relationships of everyone on the screen are perfectly woven, and Woody has the best sight gag of the film when he takes a bible and a crucifix out of a paper bag (to find religion), and follows them up with some Wonder Bread and mayonaisse. Hilarious!Deserving of its writing and supporting actor Oscars, it's too bad everyone in the movie couldn't have won. They're all believable and enjoyable to watch. My favorite: Max Von Sydow as the very cynical, older Frederick. He should have had more moments. Imagine him at one of the Thanksgiving dinners...",

Great shots of New York (specifically the city's architecture), great situations, great parties and great musicAmong the Manhattan-dwelling characters is Michael Caine, who is married to Hannah (Mia Farrow) but lusts after her sister (Barbara Hershey) who lives with a tormented artist (Max Von Sydow.) Hannah's ex-husband (Woody Allen) starts dating her other sister (Diane Weist) who wants to date Sam Waterston, even though he'd rather date her friend (Carrie Fisher).In addition to the cameo by Julia Louise Dreyfuss, the film features two supporting performances by old school actors, Lloyd Nolan and Mia Farrow's real life mom, the original Jane in the Tarzan movies, Maureen O'Sullivan.If that's not enough, Allen throws in plenty of his trademark hypochondria hysteria, questioning the meaning of the universe and whether God exists.",

            "content": "Woody Allen makes movies that will sometimes be partial duds with great lines and characters, and then he'll make an all around great movie like Manhattan, Sleeper or Deconstructing Harry. In the 80's, he had a period where most of his films were generally great (Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy might be the exception). But this is one of the gems in that period, a comedy with great acting matched with a finely tuned screenplay. Though not without an ending that leaves everything a little too neat (however upon pressure from the studio, not Allen's original intentions of course), this is another relationship-centric picture, with the side-bar of Woody's character being chronically afraid of death and what comes after it. Deservedly his last big award winner, it's a possibility for my favorite Woody 80s movie (even if the experience in the theater sucked- the downside to seeing an Allen movie is the large amount of old people, and the occasional old man who sits very close with a constantly shifting candy wrapper, smacking lips, and a penchant for a horrible sinus conditon...just think who the fans of Woody movies will be then they croak).",

            "review_title": "Woody's more mature rumination on Manhattan life & love with an impeccable ensemble cast",
            "content": "While I am a Woody Allen fanatic, I'm not sure if I agree with the minority of Woody fans who claim this is his best film, instead of \"Annie Hall\". Sure, I would be quick to elect \"Annie\" as Woody's best, but then I regard \"Manhattan\", \"Stardust Memories\", \"Crimes & Misdemeanors\", as well as \"Hannah And Her Sisters\", and I become unsure.  This is certainly one of Woody's most mature films, and I would freely place it in my top five of Woody's works.  It nicely balances comedy with drama, and it also began a new era of high accomplishment for Woody.  Functioning as an ensemble drama loosely organized around three sisters, \"Hannah\" chronicles several stories at once.  The film has an incredibly warm, intimate feeling about it, as people talk in their earth-toned apartments over J.S. Bach or stroll through the city's crisp autumn air.  What rings most true about this film is that it doesn't end quite the way you thought it would (the words \"too tidy\" and \"unpunished\" get unfairly used a lot), yet it ends as it should. \nIronically, Hannah (played by Mia Farrow) doesn't fare too deeply in the film.  The eldest of three, she's the family matriarch soothing her aging parents, a showbiz couple reluctantly settling into old age and blaming each other for it.  Her husband Elliot (Michael Caine expertly stuttering & flushing) is consumed with guilt over his heavy crush on Hannah's sensuous, down-to-earth sister, Lee.  Lee is slowly pulling away from her failing relationship with Frederick (the always excellent Max Von Sydow), a horribly misanthropic curmudgeon whose reliance on her as his last link to humanity becomes suffocating.  The youngest sister, Holly (Dianne Wiest - kicking ass as usual), is a nervous, impatient actress whose insecurity and lack of success lead to competing with her best friend April over work and men. Meanwhile, Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody), a severe hypochondriac, is trying desperately to accept his eventual mortality and still find some meaning in life, which it what it seems all the other characters are trying to do.  I won't say where the stories are going or where they all end up, but I will say the ensemble cast is all-around great, Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest are definitely the stand-outs here (their Oscars were well-deserved), but Max Von Sydow and Barbara Hershey do quite fine as well. As for Woody - Mickey is the kind of character that fans were probably waiting for him to play for years, and he pulls it off with his classic ticks & twitches.  Woody's evident genius is shown here by juggling the separate stories back & forth so fluidly.  Most attention seems to be focused on Elliot and Lee during the first half (both conflicted & confused), while the second half slightly centers around Mickey and Holly (both nervous & unsure).  Mickey operates mostly as an outsider and the strength of his story doesn't pertain too much to \"the sisters\" (although there are two hysterical flashbacks sequences, one involving Hannah and the other detailing a disastrous date with Holly).  Another masterstroke on Woody's part are the internal voice-overs.  Woody is too smart to know that there are certain thoughts a person has that will exist only in their head, and extracting these feelings into some kind of dialogue with another person would seem forced.  It's casual pacing, novelistic endeavors, vivid characters, cozy settings, heartfelt music and sharp, candid dialogue are what makes this film hold up beautifully for me after dozens of viewings.  It's an absolute Woody Allen film.",

            "content": "I 'd say it was because it's one of the most joyous, life-affirming films I've ever seen. It just makes me feel so good.All the characters are engaging and funny. Woody is hilarious as the neurotic hypochondriac television producer who gets the idea he's got a brain tumor, and is almost as upset when he finds out he doesn't have one as he'd be if he did (have a brain tumor, that is.) He realizes that even if he is not going to die in the near future, he is going to die sometime, as are we all. He becomes obsessed with this idea, that death waits for us all, and if there's no God, no afterlife, what's the point of it all? So he embarks upon a quest to find Religion, a religion, any religion, that will satisfy him that there's something beyond human mortality.Of course there's no answer to this, but Woody's desperate odyssey to find some meaning to a life that inevitably ends in death, some kind of certainty, is both something we can all relate to (maybe without the desperation) and extremely funny.We don't find out till nearly the end of the movie how he resolves this. But there's no magic answer, no guru telling him some cosmic secret. Woody's epiphany is much more simple than that; it's that he discovers that life is sweet, and even if we only go around once and it all comes to an end, let's savor it while we're here. There's so much to savor. I can't express this the way Woody's character does in the film, it's best if you just watch the movie and vicariously experience his joy in this revelation.There are lots of other delights in this film to enjoy along the way. All the actors are first-rate. Max von Sydow is especially moving as the rejected lover of Lee, one of the three sisters the movie follows over a period of two years. Lee is charmingly played by Barbara Hershey, while Mia Farrow as the \"settled\" sister, captures the two sides of Hannah, as someone who's both almost annoyingly perfect (at least as perceived by others) yet is actually as needy and vulnerable as everyone else.But the most engaging character in Hannah and Her Sisters has got to be Holly, the quirky \"off-beat\" slightly edgy sister. Dianne Wiest won a well-deserved Oscar for this role. She makes Holly funny, touching, and sympathetic.",

The strongest scene in this film features the lovely poem by e e cummings entitled \u0091somewhere i have never traveled', which Caine sends to Herschey as a token of his regard for her.

It is a fascinating film: carefully directed and aided by some meticulously perfect use of non-original music. The film is split in chapters, and such a style makes the film flow very well. Despite being a drama, it is still manages to meld in some of Woody Allen's delightful wit, creating a film with laughs, pains, joys and sorrows. And then there is the quality of the acting, which is stunning to say the least. Mia Farrow is sensational in the best performance of her career, just brilliant as the providing, sustaining sister of the family, and Caine, Allen, Hershey, Kavner and even Max Von Sydow are all at their careers' best.

            "content": "In \"Hannah and her Sisters,\" Woody Allen has created a funny, poignant, and sweet film about three very different sisters. The focus is Hannah (Mia Farrow), a successful actress currently married to Elliot (Michael Caine) and divorced from Mickey (Woody Allen). She's more of a mother figure to her sisters, Holly and Lee (Dianne Wiest and Barbara Hershey) than their own mother (Farrow's real-life mother, Maureen O'Sullivan) an alcoholic performer who likes to flirt with younger men, to the fury of her husband. Hannah handles her mother, puts up with Holly constantly borrowing money and then picking fights with her in that mother/daughter fashion, but she doesn't know that her sister Lee is having an affair with Elliot. And so it goes, as Thanksgivings pass and the women attempt to straighten out their lives.This is one of Woody Allen's best films - I won't say best, because I love Match Point and Crimes and Misdemeanors more. The humorous parts of the films are provided by Wiest and Allen, and some of the lines and situations are hilarious: Holly and Mickey's disastrous date (\"I had a great time. It was just like the Nurenberg trials\"), Mickey's contemplation of suicide, and Mickey's fear of a brain tumor. Allen is brilliant as a man who believes he's living in a godless world but wants to believe. Though Jewish, he decides to become Catholic, bringing home religious info with his mayonnaise and Wonder Bread; when that doesn't work out, he talks to the Hari Krishna in the park. Wiest is as adorable as she is fantastic as a manic-depressive who goes from acting (including auditioning for a musical when she can't sing), catering (until her partner, played by Carrie Fisher, steals the man she thinks is her boyfriend), and finally writing.The rest of the cast is magnificent and tackle some of the more serious moments of the movie: Michael Caine as Hannah's husband, looking for love in all the wrong places; Max von Sydow, Lee's tortured artist boyfriend; and Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O'Sullivan as the sisters' parents, in an imperfect marriage filled with love, booze, and jealousy. Hershey is lovely as a confused woman who adores her sister but looks to Caine for a way out of her relationship with a controlling boyfriend.The film, of course, is filled with New York sights and sounds, including Bobby Short (\"You don't deserve Cole Porter,\" Mickey screams at Holly. \"You should stick with those rock musicians who look like they murdered their parents\"), the opera, Central Park, etc., that give Allen's films their special atmosphere (until \"Match Point,\" that is, which has a special atmosphere all its own).A great film with Allen asking again about the meaning of life and, again, coming up with some good answers.",

            "content": "Woody Allen is not a personal favourite director of mine and he is admittedly not everybody's cup of tea. While his filmography is not consistent(are there any directors that have) the best of his work is truly exceptional, as seen with Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanours and Husbands and Wives(just a few examples). Hannah and Her Sisters joins those exceptional films, along with Crimes and Misdemeanours it is one of his best films from the 80s. What is especially good is the acting and the screenplay. Michael Caine is just wonderful and thoroughly deserved his Oscar, Woody Allen himself has rarely been funnier and Max Von Sydow in perhaps a nod to Ingmar Bergman gives a poignant performance too. Barbara Herschey and Mia Farrow also do a great job, Farrow as one of Hannah and Her Sisters' most relatable characters. Likewise with Carrie Fisher and Sam Waterson. But special mention has to go to Dianne Wiest, whose performance is among the best of any Woody Allen film, a list that includes Martin Landau in Crimes and Misdemeanours for example. The script is one of the best, tightest and most multi-layered of any Woody Allen film(his best is still Annie Hall in my view, one of the best and most quotable screenplays of all time), it is very funny especially with Allen, has sharp observations told with forcefulness and truth in distinctive Allen style and is touching too. The story is not the tightest structurally, but it is still perhaps the most heartfelt and relatable of his films and is one of Allen's most successful efforts combining comedy and drama(Crimes and Misdemeanours and Annie Hall also). Hannah and Her Sisters is beautifully filmed, one of his most visually striking pictures along with Manhattan, and Allen directs faultlessly as he mostly did. In conclusion, Allen's second best film of the 80s and also one of his best films, exceptional on all counts. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Ever since reading about Allen's contempt for the process of writing comedy (which he feels is infantile and beneath him), I find his blithe relationship-comedies less and less amusing. Only a few of the mixed-up, lovestruck, hapless or helpless characters in \"Hannah\" are really interesting. Hannah (Mia Farrow) tries to rally everyone with her sanity but she has no sense of humor; Lee (Barbara Hershey) is beautiful and contemplative, but listless; Holly (Dianne Wiest) is a goosey bauble one minute, a deflated cynic the next; Frederick (Max Von Sydow), Lee's older lover, seems straight out of an Ingmar Bergman drama; Mickey (Woody Allen), Hannah's ex, seems taken straight from \"Manhattan\". The picture meanders cheerfully, with side-plots stopping and starting like sketches. It's quite handsome, but there's no real engine at work, just a few pointed observations, lots of (heavy) nostalgia, and Allen's patented comic paranoia. Michael Caine as Hannah's husband (who harbors a mad crush on Lee) and Wiest both won Supporting Oscars; Allen won for his original screenplay. *** from ****",

You see, everyone else in her extended family depends on her. Sister Lee (Barbara Hershey) is in a longterm relationship with a talented artist (Max Von Sydow), who would rather sell his work to a small circle of fans instead of \"going commercial\". Thus, Lee is contemplating going back to school so she can earn money, too. The artist is also very reclusive so, at family gatherings, she often arrives alone. Plus, she has a secret admirer in Hannah's husband. Third sister Holly (Diane Wiest) is on shakier ground than Lee. She is a struggling actress/caterer who borrows money from Hannah LOTS. Her catering partner (Carrie Fisher), also a wannebe actress, ends up going after the same men and roles that Holly has her eye on. As a side note, Holly once had a dreadful date with Hannah's ex, after the divorce. Then, too, Hannah's parents, retired, famous thespians, drink too much and, even after 50 years, have big fights. Can Hannah keep solving all of their problems without saving enough time for herself and her marriage? This terrific Allen movie was made more than twenty five years ago but it is still fresh, relevant, and funny. The cast, yes, is wonderful, with many of the players up for major awards. Allen, especially, is very funny as the hypochondriac who tries many religions in a search for serenity. His script, of course, is clever, intelligent stuff while his direction is quite wonderful.

And I just saw Manhattan again, for the first time in years, and I found it nearly pitch perfect. Everything flows. Well, it's understandable that this level of achievement would embolden Allen to go deeper into Auteurism and Personal Cinema. But scenes like the Three Sister Luncheon in this film set the bar really high. Really high. Too high. It's not like all the characters sound like little Woody Allens. That would come later. But their dialogue is such empty Upper New York chit - chat that reveals so little about inner life. I admit it is an amazing gift, the ability to reveal and expose the inner life of superficial characters. Few filmmakers have been able to do it - I'm thinking of Renoir and The Rules of the Game. But if you're gonna go there, you'd better be READY to go there! And...well, this film is fatally infected with Toxic Middlebrow - ism, and so you can't really tell whether Woody thinks their conversations are deep and revealing or pseudo - deep and pseudo - revealing. He's good, but not good enough to make a thing like that clear.There's one scene I love: the one where Woody and Diane Wiest go on a date. She takes him to a Punk show. He retorts with Bobby Short. Bobby Short at the Carlyle equaling \"Good Music\" or \"Real Music\" tells me all I need to know about why I respect and appreciate this movie, but will never love it.

Well-acted, well-written, but Allen covers no new ground here (except him trying on other religions).  He's examined these characters and situations before.  What makes the movie watchable is excellent acting, Farrow excepted (she's shallow and her acting is REAL bad!).  Hershey is brilliant as a woman who gains strength and courage over the course of the movie and Weiss is very good as a woman who starts out not knowing what to do with her life, and ends up getting everything in order.  Everything is nicely resolved, no depressing endings (OK--that IS original for Allen), but nothing we haven't seen from him before.  Worth seeing, but not up to \"Annie Hall\" or \"Manhattan\".",

            "content": "Allen fans - and I am not among them - usually rate Annie Hall and this film as his best. It most certainly is the most indicative of Allen's shortcomings as a director/writer/actor that put off his detractors.Hannah is Mia Farrow and her sisters are played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest. The film depicts the various melodrama and relationship issues that plague the three and their extended family. With possibly the exception of Farrow, every character in this dirge is selfish, unsympathetic and whiny. When they are not yammering incessantly at each other, then Allen allows us to overhear their inner thoughts - which basically consists of further yammering - only they don't move their lips. Everyone is either oblivious to obvious events around them or are busy trying to cheat on someone else in the film.Farrow's husband is played by Michael Caine, who barely seems aware of Farrow's existence because he is too busy pursuing a romantic liaison with Hershey, who is in a relationship with an older artist played by Max Von Sydow. Wiest is a habitual drug addict on the hunt for Mr. Right, but consistently seems to lose them to her more attractive friend Carrie Fisher. Their parents, Maureen O'Sullivan and Lloyd Nolan, are eccentrics in their own right. And lingering through all of this is Allen as Farrow's hypochondriac ex-husband.If the film seems unfocused, it's because it is. The story is all over the map and we have no rooting interest in anyone. If Caine takes Farrow for granted, so does the film. The film may be called Hannah and Her Sisters, but Hannah has no big moments and virtually nothing to do for its running time. Yet Allen - whose character has the most tenuous tie with the family at best - is given a lion's share of screen time to incessantly ramble on and on and on about his search for meaning in life.A good deal of the supporting cast is wasted. Von Sydow, Fisher, O'Sullivan, Nolan, and Sam Waterston, among others, have nothing to do and just float in and out by writer's fiat. The fact that Allen fails to provide a strong role for Farrow as the proverbial lead is inexcusable. Caine and Hershey are awfully energetic, but it is impossible to be caught up in their story as he is basically a philandering cretin and she a dishrag pushover pressured into betraying her sister. Wiest is good, but again her character is not especially likable. In fact, none of these characters are especially likable with the exception of Farrow - and that may only be because she is the cipher at the center of the whole mess without many discernible personality traits.Fans of Allen adore this, but anyone else would be wisely urged to steer clear of it.",

Alternately entertaining (as a comedy) and penetrating (as a drama), this film has many wonderful moments, and is filled with superb dialogue. All the actors deliver first-rate performances; Michael Cain in genuinely touching when he is trying to decide his next moves in his life, Hershey is warm and radiant and Allen himself is delightful in his role. The script is perceptive throughout (look for the scenes when Caine shares his thoughts and plans with us) and the main characters do have depth.The only flaw here (and, I think, a crucial one) is the too-tidy ending. I wouldn't have preferred a thoroughly depressing conclusion, but the way everything gets \"settled\" in the end was just too neat. Still, I read somewhere that the \"upbeat\" tone of the ending was \"required\" partly by the studio who made the film, so I guess this flaw is forgivable. Nevertheless, it doesn't allow this movie to become a masterpiece.",

But in the mid 1980s, he made a number of wholly serious films, which generally were not. 'Hannah and Her Sisters', a romantic comedy dating from 1987, was thus hailed as a \"return to form\", a label frequently re-applied to subsequent Allen movies, as his later career is widely considered patchy at best.In fact, I like some of Allen's later movies, but not this one. To me, Allen is best when zaniest; in his more realistic films, the tokenistic acting starts to grate, as do the self-interested, affluent New Yorkers who populate his films. The most notable thing about this movie is the presence of British actor Michael Caine, not a figure who regularly features in Allen's work; but as usual when an actor from outside Allen's usual cast-list joins the show, he fits right in and does very little to add variety compared with Allen's other movies. There are some good jokes in here, but not enough to justify a complete film. Watch 'Sleeper' instead for a guaranteed laugh.",

Hannah And Her Sisters is one of the most pessimistic films I've ever viewed. It has the message that nothing in life lasts forever especially relationships.The title character is the then Mrs. Woody Allen Mia Farrow. She is one of three sisters the other two being Barbara Hershey and Dianne Weist. All three of them have man trouble and some with the same men. They get that from their show business parents Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O'Sullivan who have stayed together and tolerated their mutual infidelities because they're both used to each other and for that time old clich\u00e9 for the sake of the children. This was Nolan's farewell performance.The men and some of them aren't any great shakes and some of them they have in common are worse than the women. Michael Caine who won his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar moves from woman to woman always with complete rationalization. Kind of like an intellectual Alfie. Woody Allen is his usual schlep character probably worse than usual, a man who definitely thinks way too much.It's a credit to Woody Allen that he was able to write a film for which he got an Oscar for an Original Screenplay and this is original that had women as the primary characters and the stronger ones. Even Dianne Weist who is the weakest of the sisters is better than the men around her and she won a Best Supporting Actress Award.Life does imitate art, truly it does. Woody Allen got himself involved with his adopted stepdaughter Soon-Yi Previn and her mother got shed of Woody with the speed of one of the characters in this film. Allen always went deep into analyzing his characters, maybe in Hannah And Her Sisters he went a little too deep.Hannah And Her Sisters is unusual and good, but not probably to everyone's taste.",

Barbara Hershey (always talented since LAST SUMMER) has the perfect role at her age, at that stage of her career, to play Lee (one of the sisters), and Mia Farrow was born to play Hannah (the all-too-together control freak).

Woody Allen is capable of bringing so many emotions out of me, and I think this is him undoubtedly at the peak of his craft. The fullness that he brings to these characters is so extraordinary, in less than two hours he brings more complexity to a wide array than even most television shows are capable of doing in entire seasons. Each person feels like they are a living, fully realized person and there's so many of them, each with their own full interactions and relationships. It's powerful stuff.I think at his best Allen's ability to create genuine characters is almost unparalleled, and this is the best example of him doing just that. Of course that doesn't come alone and he's aided by one of my favorite ensemble casts ever. Every single one of them takes his words from the page and brings those characters to life in such powerful ways, transcending character and becoming entire human beings. I honestly can't think of a film that so effortlessly, fluidly brings together comedy and drama, the way that naturally occurs in life. Perhaps that's the best word for the film and it's ensemble cast; natural. Whether it's Barbara Hershey bringing me to tears, Max Von Sydow putting me in stitches of laughter or Michael Caine doing both at the same time, each member of the cast excels in every single scene. It brings me to such highs and lows, from the joy of Caine and Hershey in the bookstore to the devastation of the breakup scene.The use of voice-over is marvelous, bringing us further into these character's heads, again aided by the appropriately expressive cast. It's always intuitive without ever being overly reliant. Throw in some heavy themes revolving around life, death, love, religion and everything that comes along with them, which Allen weaves in seamlessly without allowing them to overshadow the characters, and Hannah and Her Sisters is one of America's finest filmmakers at his absolute pinnacle.",

What a gem!\" I don't know what to do with you.Mia Farrow is Hannah. She's married to Michael Caine, but he's got a crush on her sister Barbara Hershey, who's involved with the brilliant introvert Max von Sydow. Mia's other sister, Dianne Wiest is a recovering drug addict with a floundering career and love life. Mia's ex-husband is Woody Allen, and in-between visits to see their children and emergencies at his Saturday Night Live-esque television program, he worries about his health. While the subject matter of this Woody Allen film is decidedly heavy, the characters are so delightful you won't be able to contain your giggles.As often happens in Woody Allen movies, the supporting actors won Oscars, and while you might have been rooting for someone from Platoon that year, you'll have to admit Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest were totally adorable in Hannah and Her Sisters. Both are given ample \"Oscar clips\" in the film, and both have tearful scenes that will no doubt put a lump in your throat. Personally, I have no problem with the Academy's choices that year, but I might be a little biased. I absolutely love Michael Caine, and one of his lines, \"I'm walking on air!\" has become a household phrase of mine.The familiar themes of many Woody Allen films are alive and well in Hannah and Her Sisters, and if you've never seen one of his movies, this is a great one to start with. Among the laughter, there are moral dilemmas, infidelity, pondering the universe, depression, and family tensions. There's also a pretty big cast, so be on the lookout for Maureen O'Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Sam Waterston, Carrie Fisher, Daniel Stern, Julie Kavner, John Turturro, a very young Richard Jenkins, and an even younger Lewis Black.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

Many people have been saying this movie is even better than Annie Hall, which I find hard to believe. I thought it was pretty good, but the storyline wasn't as interesting to me, even if they do have many similarities. I'll try not to focus all my criticism on the fact that Diane Keaton is not in it. The movie's story is somewhat confusing and told in a nonlinear fashion, which is definitely noticeable while watching. It's not that it's told out of order, it just switches between the perspectives of different characters a lot. Basically, some time after a Thanksgiving dinner, a guy named Elliot (Michael Caine) falls in love with the title character's sister, Lee. Previously, Lee lived with a shut in named Frederick, who she is much younger than. Lee leaves Frederick after he finds out one day she is dating Elliot instead. Concurrently, Mickey (Woody Allen), who used to be married to Hannah herself (Mia Farrow), undergoes a crisis because he seems to have some kind of hearing loss. Thinking he has brain cancer, he goes for various tests and scans, only to find nothing is wrong with him. Still, the reason his marriage ended in the first place is because he is sterile. He starts to overthink life and comes to the conclusion that nothing matters, which leads to him trying to convert to different religions. He tries shooting himself, but is too nervous and goes to watch a Marx Brothers movie instead. He finally realizes that life is too short and the point of it is to enjoy yourself while you're here. Finally, Hannah's other sister Holly is the subject of the last third of the plot. It's shown that she's a coke addict during a date with Mickey, and she makes no effort to find work. She starts siphoning money from Hannah in order to fund her roles in musical plays, and once that fails, to fund writing. Holly writes a script containing intimate details about Elliot's marriage to Hannah, even though Elliot swears he doesn't tell her anything. In reality, Holly was able to get these details because Elliot has been using Lee as a go-between. Doing this almost uncovers Elliot's relationship to her. In the end, it's some years later, and Lee is now married to someone she met at college in Columbia, New York, and Mickey is married to Holly. Confusing indeed. While this film is full of the ridiculous and often dirty humor Woody's movies are known and loved for, I was hoping to see him in a bit of a more prominent role. The events shown happening to Woody's character in the movie are mostly not related to the main story, such as when he decides to try out different religions. Woody is the funniest thing about these films, and most of the scenes simply aren't about or related to him in any way. Still, the moments he does appear in never fail to be amusing, such as when Holly is doing cocaine right in front of him on their date, which leads to him commenting the whole event is akin to the Nuremberg Trials. My favorite scene hands down is instance where Woody tries to find the meaning of life by becoming a Catholic, which leads to his parents being deeply upset and disturbed because he was born Jewish. Overall, I feel that Hannah and Her Sisters is a good example of what Woody can do when given a competent script, but I'll probably never understand people who think it's in the same tier as Annie Hall.",

            "content": "Normally renowned for his obsessions with death and the ephemerality of the human condition, Woody Allen uses a lighter, more positive approach for 'Hannah and her Sisters', one of his most popular films. Whilst the Allen wit is always welcome, it comes as a relief that for one thing, there is only one potentially suicidal character in this film.This seemingly trivial point illustrates how 'Hannah and her Sisters' eschews Allen's most obvious profundities. Instead, it wears its a deep affection for the foibles of its characters on its sleeve, in a way that reminds us of how serious other Allen 'comedies' can be. As much as I admire his work, I could never help noticing a touch of sourness in Allen's attitudes about people, which happily is not so evident here; it seems he has conceded that a sense of joy is possible amidst the sturm and drang of our weary lives.'Hannah and her Sisters' concerns Woody's involvement with three sisters: one he was once married to (Mia Farrow as Hannah), another he is going to be married to (Dianne Wiest as Holly) and another sister (Barbara Hershey as Lee) who is having an affair with her sister Mia's current husband (Michael Caine as Elliott). (Get that so far?) The sisters' parents, played by Maureen O'Sullivan and Lloyd Nolan are dysfunctional curmudgeons, neglectful of their daughters but ironically also concerned and loving parents. From one Thanksgiving dinner to the next people's lives are changed in regards to their aspirations and shifting relationships within the family unit. As with most Woody Allen films these characters live the so-called ideal upper middle class life of rich Manhattanites. They know where to go to find the right bookstores; they have artistic aspirations and mingle with other artists and writers and sit around worrying about how guilty they should be feeling at the embarrassment of the riches in their lives. Or conversely, whether they should be feeling guilty at all.There are a number of affecting scenes where the sisters reveal their sibling rivalries and disappointments, and find the opportunity to confront Hannah (Mia Farrow) for trying to control their lives. Farrow is renowned for her fawn like quality but this is a fawn who won't be pushed around, and knows how to get her own way. Lee is the loveliest sister, she is living with 'furious depressive' Frederick (Max von Sydow), a writer with writer's block, and is being vigorously pursued by Elliott, Hannah's current husband. They both cool down eventually and Elliott returns to Hannah. Holly is the most interesting sister, the youngest who writes a little bit, and sings a little bit, but just can't seem to get a handle on her life, and seems crowded out of the picture by the more ambitious egos in the family. Of the three sisters, I found her the most accessible and appealing.Hannah suspects, but never does discover for certain that her husband is having an affair, least of all with one of her sisters. She knows that Elliott is dissatisfied with their marriage but doesn't know what to do about it. Lee is living with one man but attracted to another and doesn't know what to do about that either. Holly flits from one thing to another, insecure because she is the black sheep of the family, but also may actually be the most talented. And Woody Allen as comedy writer Mickey enters and exists out of the sister's lives like a hypochondriac chorus out of ancient Greek drama. Carrie Fisher and Sam Waterston both offer solid support as friends of the family, and John Turturro has a blink or you'll miss it part as a writer.I like this very much, it's fun, with a few profound Woody moments such as the poetry book that Elliott buys for Lee which is endearing and a good template to judge the film by. In 'Hannah and her Sisters' Allen goes easy on the smart talk, and instead concentrates on people and their relationships, and as a result, this film has a warmth and likability that will draw you in and keep you interested and involved for its entire running time.",

Her sisters are Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest), who are both rather aimless in life. Writer-director Woody Allen plays Mickey, Hannah's ex-husband who writes for a TV comedy show and experiences a crisis of faith after he frets through a potential health crisis. And Sir Michael Caine is Hannah's husband Elliot, who decides to act upon his crush on Lee.\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is indeed one of Allens' very best, a wise, warm, and witty film that is more a drama with a good sense of humor at times than a true drama-comedy. Allen is in good form as he provides the humor; it's just too funny when he considers Catholicism and then briefly entertains the notion of becoming a Hare Krishna!The whole film is brimming with personable characters with whom it is well worth spending time. Caine especially is endearing in an Oscar-winning portrayal; Wiest, too, was an Oscar-winner for her bravura performance as a woman whose behavior can be reckless and self-destructive. A steady parade of familiar faces in roles both big and small adds to the entertainment; you can see actors and actresses who subsequently went on to great fame like John Turturro, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Richard Jenkins, and J. T. Walsh. Standout moments belong to Caine, Allen, the great Max von Sydow as his artist character opines on the state of the world today, and Wiest. Farrow gets to have a great scene with her real-life mom, Maureen O'Sullivan.All of this is handled realistically and in a relatable manner. Elliot and Lee do have a number of clandestine meetings, but do feel the right amount of guilt because they still know the affair is wrong, and because Hannah does indeed deserve better. Allen begins all of his various segments with appropriate chapter headings, and his use of soundtrack music is quite eclectic. Allens' script gives some of the cast voice-over narration so we can experience the thoughts that they are having, and always know where they're coming from.This viewer may have been quite late to the party, but he can see why Woodyphiles do rate this one high among his filmography. After the downbeat ending of his previous film, \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", the resolution here is much more cheery and pleasant for the characters.Eight out of 10.",

Then after this the story breaks up to follow each individual in stories of affairs, break-ups, awkward dates and much more. Allen is funny as the neurotic and hypochondriac TV producer Mickey Sachs, and he does a good job directing. But one of the main reasons I wanted to see the film was for the performance by Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Michael Caine, as Elliot, he plays a terrific bumbling man in love with Hannah's sister, Lee. Wiest is also very good as the sister with quite a few problems getting to places she wants to. Also starring Carrie Fisher as April, Max Von Sydow as Frederick, Lloyd Nolan as Evan, Maureen O'Sullivan as Norma, Daniel Stern as Dusty, Sam Waterston as David, Tony Roberts as Norman - Mickey's Expartner, Julie Kavner as Gail, Bobby Short, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Mary and Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh as Ed Smythe. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Woody Allen was number 71, and Sir Michael Caine number 44 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Allen was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Caine was number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",

            "content": "It's not exactly new territory for Woody Allen, but \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" plays out in a much more compelling manner than his other films about quasi-pretentious intellectual 30- somethings living in New York City. For one thing, Allen takes himself a little bit more out of the picture than in the past. Once again he plays a neurotic hypochondriac working in show business, but his character is not central like it has been. There are a few story lines that are each compelling in their own way with no character at the center. Even the titular character Hannah (Mia Farrow) isn't central -- Allen's chosen her name for a much more compelling reason.The film centers on a family of show business talent. Hannah (Farrow) is the successful one despite her failed first marriage to Mickey (Allen) and the fact that unbeknownst to her, her current husband Elliot (Caine) is madly in love with her sister Lee (Hershey) who lives with a grumpy artist named Frederic. Then there's the third sister, Holly (Wiest), who can't seem to find success in love or her career. The interconnectedness of everything, the family element of seeing where everyone is at each year at the family Thanksgiving party makes \"Hannah\" one of Allen's better successes.It's not that it's new -- Allen continues to take shots at how over-dramatic his characters make their love lives when they're lucky that all they have to care about is art, opera, architecture, ee cummings' poetry and classical music. Still, it's so identifiable with the middle class because it's real. Allen's dialog is great and his cast really doesn't disappoint him at all in this film. There's also some dramatic storytelling. Having characters voice over their thoughts and contradict them with their actions really connects with everyone that wrestles with thoughts and emotions and their consequent actions. Allen doesn't have to get up close to the actors' facial expressions -- he can let the scene set itself nicely. To be truthful, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" would make a great play.What's also nice about the film is it's not negatively spirited. Set to classical music and light jazz piano that typically plays the famous showtune \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,\" the film has a very down-to-earth feel -- never over-dramatic with characters making drastic choices. That is for Allen's future work. This one sort of relishes in the ironies and paradoxes of life and love, how people change (and are allowed to) and can fight or cheat and still manage to find happiness and make it work without something outrageous.So it may not be Allen breaking new ground, but the narrative techniques make the message come across a bit stronger, make the relationships a bit more real and compelling. It's not \"Annie Hall,\" but it's his next best thing.",

This is Allen when he's at his best -- he assembles a sharp team of actors, puts them in situations he knows like the back of his hand (i.e. intellectual New York society), and, most importantly, directs the film like it's a Woody Allen movie, not a Fellini or Bergman ripoff. \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" blends comedy and drama in a way that is unique to Allen, and which he doesn't pull off very often (\"Annie Hall\" and \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" are two other examples that immediately spring to mind).Though Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest were singled out with Academy Awards, Barbara Hershey, Mia Farrow and Max von Sydow also do strong work. And fortunately Allen finds a role for himself as....what else?....a neurotic hypochondriac.Grade: A",

            "content": "Along with Annie Hall, Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters ranks among the writer-director's best films. The movie manages to be complex and nuanced without going overboard. It is not a comedy, but there are big laughs within the family dynamics. In a sense, you could also view the film as a near-tragedy. The film is viewed through the eyes of Woody Allen's character, Mickey. Mickey is one of those characters who is hypochondriac or a person who believes he has some unchecked major disease and is about to die. He wants a sense of belonging within the web of characters. That alone makes the film have tragic moments. The film on a whole works because of Allen's sprawling, but tight (if that makes sense) narrative that interweaves dozens of characters within one another. It's funny, sad, poignant, and emotional.Woody Allen originally imagined the film to be a simple one about a husband falling in love with his wife's sister. Then he started getting ideas to make his film more complex. His lover at the time, Mia Farrow actually criticized his script and suggested changes. She felt the characters, especially the sisters, were too indulgent and narcistic. With the film already in pre-production, there was little that Allen could do. In the end, the script is seen as one of Allen's best. Although, it could be problematic hinting at his later years and the drama it came with it. Allen, being a New Yorker himself, gets the idea of the characteristics of a typical New Yorker; always busy, bustling, and moving fast. There is no such thing as slowing down and thinking ahead. That idea is portrayed very well in his script and from the performances.The film has a zillion characters it seems and that means a large cast. Usually a large cast has the propensity to dull a film, but Allen managed his cast very well. Hannah (Mia Farrow), Holly (Dianne Wiest), and Lee (Barbara Hershey) are sisters from a family that runs in the show business. Their mother, Norma (Maureen O'Sullivan) is married to Evan (Lloyd Nolan), a constant cheater. Hannah is the glue that holds the family together and is married to an accountant, Elliot (Michael Caine). Her first marriage was to Mickey (Woody Allen), a TV executive who believes he will die. She keeps him around the family, however. Holly is the insecure sister who starts a catering business with her friend, April (Carrie Fisher). She is the typical Manhattanite. Lee is the more emotional sister. She lives with an older artist, Frederick (Max von Sydow) who is out of touch with reality. If this does not sound complicated already, hold on to your seat! Elliot figures out he has feelings for Lee, who may not being romantically satisfied enough herself with Frederick.As the plot description outlines, there is a big cast! In addition to the aforementioned actors, there are cameos/small performances from Sam Waterston, Julia Louis-Drefyus, John Turturro, J.T Walsh, Daniel Stern, Julie Kavner, Richard Jenkins, and the list goes on. Yeah, told you so! The best performance comes from Michael Caine. His performance is more subtle compared to other roles, but it works very well. Dianne Wiest is hilarious and ultimately very human. These two won the Academy Awards for their supporting performances which is the right move considering how awesome they are. Woody Allen's character is a headcase, a neurotic guy who does not believe in the afterlife and figures he will die soon and wants redemption. Funny and touching performance. Farrow was solid and Hershey's role was just right for her. This is an actor-driven film that highlights a plethora of excellent performances. You can say Allen told this story in a series of vignettes that highlight individual characters.Hannah and Her Sisters is Woody Allen at his finest. It allows him to mix his style of filmmaking without going overly complicated or sentimental. His characters are humanized and are involved in situations that could be relatable to most of us. I enjoyed the style in which the dialogue is used. Despite a sophisticated complex of characters, the story is simple to follow. Allen definitely grew as a filmmaker and it is not a surprise this film is one of his finest. My only concerns are about very brief situations in which tied Allen up with his later personal life. That said, the film is a definite recommend.My Grade: A-",

Which gets you wondering what heck their talking about. It's Thanksgiving and Elliot sets the tone of the movie by telling the viewer how he is madly in love with his wife's sister. Thus, starts the love triangle. He had been secretly in love with her for quite a while until one day while bringing a friend to view some of Lee's boyfriend's paintings he breaks down and kisses her. They confess their love for each other and they continue to have an affair behind Hannah's back. Hannah starts to suspect something is going on but doesn't assume anything. Lee ends up leaving Frederick for Elliot but he fails to follow through with breaking up the marriage with Hannah. Meanwhile Holly runs a catering business with her best friend April (Carrie Fisher) and auditions on the side for various Broadway shows but doesn't succeed to make it in any of them. Her luck gets a little better when she starts writing her own stuff and one day runs into Hannah's ex-husband Mickey Sachs who is played by Woody Allen at the record store. He falls in love with her writing as well as her in the process. Elliot and Lee's love end up falling short of a success. Elliot realizes how much he really loves Hannah, and Lee doesn't want to play games anymore, everything turning out for the best.I thought the movie was entertaining overall. It tended to jump around a lot from one point in time to the next, which was pretty irritating. The acting was excellent from Michael Caine, and Woody Allen playing a typical Woody Allen part. The movie really had no apparent point to prove or problem to solve. I give it 6 out of 10 stars because the acting, quality of the movie was good. It lacked pieces of the story that were missing, and whatever happened to April, Holly's friend. Although it was entertaining.",

Hannah's ex-husband is occasionally on the scene despite his busy work schedule and constant worrying about his health. Over the course of several family Thanksgiving get-togethers, the nature of all their relationships change due to the pressures caused by secret infidelity and betrayal.I didn't want to write too specific a plot summary for this film because I enjoy it as quite the ensemble piece that the title describes. Our focal point is Hannah but not necessarily in a narrative sense because she doesn't have significantly more time than some of the other characters, just that she is the central hub around which they all revolve. To me this approach works really well as each story works well within its own context and Allen has pulled them together well. Of course if you are not a Woody Allen fan then this film will not appeal to you, mainly because it will represent everything you dislike about it. Of course to most fans the opposite will be true as all the stuff we expect is there. The film has laughs but it also has engaging musings on love, life, death and so on. They may exist within rather neurotic, liberal New Yorker lives that will be unrecognisable to most of us but again this is a strength of the delivery, that this lack of relevance to me didn't really matter that much.The script is smart and the only downside of the material is that where Annie Hall (for example) had fizz and energy, Hannah tends to be a little more folded in on itself and serious \u0096 perhaps a reflection on how Allen himself had changed in the period between these films. Direction-wise, he works really well within quite limited domestic settings and delivers some very impressive sequences as well as getting good performances from his cast. Caine is solid and manages to avoid the Allen mannerisms that could so easily have come from his character and dialogue. Farrow is OK but I never felt a lot for her character so much as I had interest for Hershey, who I thought was better. Wiest and Fisher are good but with limited time while von Sydow provides good work in a small character. Allen himself is typical Allen, which I always enjoy while also having to acknowledge that it isn't shockingly different from many other of his performances.Overall though this is a mature and interesting film from Allen that also delivers laughs in the usual style. The drama is all a bit folded in on itself and serious and I can imagine that some viewers will struggle to care for this group of self-centred New Yorkers, but lets be honest and say that this aspect is something you should not be surprised by here. Not his strongest work in my opinion but mature, thoughtful and funny despite it often being downbeat.",

            "content": "It's undeniable that Woody Allen makes funny movies, taking absurdity and neurotic behavior to it's ultimate extreme. I've only seen a handful myself, but with the benefit of much hindsight, it's more than apparent that Allen was telegraphing the salacious and immodest behavior that would intrude on his own personal life in the years to come. It happened in a scene from \"Bananas\" when his character is observed at a magazine stand looking at girlie mags; he said he was doing a study on perversion and child molesting. In this one, the producer of one of his plays pulls the plug by stating that \"Child molestation is a touchy subject\", to which Allen's character Mickey blows it off by stating that half the country is doing it. As a writer, Allen may be tops, but as a human being he's not exactly a great role model.So with that aside out of the way, I thought the story here demonstrated Allen's screen writing ability in all it's neurotic best. Not only were the principal characters angst driven, but Mickey himself was a veritable treasure trove of insecurity and defeatist behavior. He's even a failure at suicide, though I never got the feeling he ever really wanted to off himself. The errant rifle blasts only added to the idea that he was a misguided fool who couldn't carry a project through to it's ultimate conclusion.One thing for certain, the movie has a stellar principal cast and a fine lineup of supporting players who were up and comers at the time like Lewis Black, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Daniel Stern amid the proceedings. At one point, Woody Allen is seen walking down a city street with a Hitchcock marquee in the background for \"The Secret Agent\", and I had to wonder if Allen intended some subliminal message there for his audience. In terms of message, I thought Allen got to the heart of the matter near the end of the story shortly after the suicide scene went bust. In reflecting on the afterlife and Man's position in the universe, the best he could come up with was \"Maybe there's something. Nobody really knows.\" Perhaps one day he'll find out.One last observation - if you take a good look at Michael Caine in his role as Elliot, doesn't he resemble a more refined and mature version of Woody Allen?",

MIA FARROW is an actress who loves to surround herself with family and friends at the dinner table rather than concentrate solely on an acting career as a stage actress. Not a big stretch for her--with art imitating life.It's the kind of Allen film that has Woody and his technique written all over it. If that's your kind of thing, you'll like it, regardless of the fact that it's, at heart, very light stuff and rather insignificant. The flaws are well hidden by lots of good music on the soundtrack and occasional flashes of humor in Woody's doctor visits resulting in his interior dialogs wrestling with his latest X-rays. \"Don't panic. Don't panic,\" he tells himself before resorting to--you guessed it--panic. His quest for religious faith is also good for a few chuckles.It goes on and on in a rather disjointed manner--again, typical Allen style--but fans of his films should find this one a bit more likable than most of those he did in the '80s--and the cast is pleasant enough to watch despite the familiarity of it all, with MIA FARROW essentially playing herself. DIANNE WIEST is the daffy sister struggling to express her talent either in the theater or in her writing and has some amusing scenes with Woody as he comes to appreciate her.But, in the end, none of it really makes much of an impression so it's hard to justify the awards and nominations.

            "content": "The lives, loves and frustrations of the New York professional classes is not something that I would automatically associate with great cinema, but if anyone can pull it off it is Woody Allen. Mostly because, as a comedian, he knows how to sugar the drama pill with laughs and situation comedy.Here, however, he has not  quite got it right. All the ingredients of the cake have been lovingly applied - but it just doesn't rise and bake. At times it plays out as little more than an upmarket soap opera, with sexual frankness thrown in for good measure.While light and watchable, there is too much me-me-me to care whether the characters fall in love or under a bus. Michael Caine even won an Oscar for his performance as a overheated adulterer - I am not sure how comedic this is supposed to be, but some people obviously saw it as funny!Let's not knock cinema for being about nothing or having characters you are glad are not in your life - because you could say that about so many good films: But do we really want to spend time with people such as Dianne Wiest (another undeserved Oscar!) who cannot decide what to do with her life - and even if she did is too much of a scatty disaster to make a success of it.Allen comes on to play his neurotic character (sorry - I have lost count of how many times this is!), almost as a comic side-show that  the film could live without. Naturally he gives himself some the best one-liners - even though most of the jokes are on him.The reason why Allen can make film such as this, and even gain awards for them, is because he has no competition. If you took a script like this to a major studio they would laugh you out of the building. Even if you won the lottery and financed it yourself - most acting talent wouldn't go near you: Too many small unflattering parts. I wasn't moved by this movie (as I have been in the past with WA films), but it is not hard to see why Oscar voters saw more in it than I did.

New York is the scenery again and the story involves themes of love, relations, families, depression, religion and tumulted moments in people's lives that only Allen can make them look as a funny and intelligent comedy.Comedy and drama are perfectly balanced in the film; everything was measured precisely and effectively and the final result is a memorable and delightful picture. The only other film that I can think of that resembles the same balance between genre and it is a ever lasting film is \"(500) Days of Summer\" (by the way the first scene of Michael Caine's voice over telling the things he loves on Barbara Hershey reminds of that famous scene where Joseph Gordon-Levitt describes Summer in little details). In \"Hannah and her Sisters\" Allen gives us a call to life, to enjoy it in its good and bad moments, we must be part of the great experience of living, and that is huge deal for a pessimistic person like Allen to say those things in the most beautiful moment of the film where he tells to Dianne Wiest's character a almost tragical event of his life that end up being his wake up call to life, and it was seeing a film by Brothers Marx, then the ideas floated to his head. He says something like \"Life is meaningless but don't you wanna be part of it?\". He makes skeptical believe in something more than just what we can see, it makes things possible for some odd and funny reason.Besides the super stellar casting already mentioned there's great performances from Max von Sydow (his scenes are among the best, including the last one, a discussion with Barbara Hershey that even moved Allen's crew while filming), Larry Nolan, Maureen O'Sullivan, Daniel Stern, and short appearances by J.T.Walsh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Lewis Black, Richard Jenkins, Sam Waterston, John Turturro, Carrie Fisher and others.It is a very reflexive film, beautifully made and delivers great messages without being moralistic or corny.

Elliot is caught in between trying to divorce Hannah and having an affair with one of her sisters in Lee. Max would come to find out indirectly about Lee's secret affair with Elliot and it left him devastated when she decided to move out. By the time of the second Thanksgiving gathering, Lee broke off with Elliot as she was tired of him trying to commit and she started dating someone else, apart from taking classes at Columbia University.The second story revolves around Mickey Sachs (Woody Allen) and his former marriage with Hannah, the struggle with infertility for the two and becoming a surrogate father to Hannah's children, his first date with another of Hannah's sisters in Holly (Dianne West). But in between all that, he is also dealing with hypochondria, his struggles working in the television industry, trying to find his spiritual self trying to covert to Catholicism from Judaism and being interested in Hare Krishnas before finding it in watching Marx Brothers' 'Duck Soup' at the cinema after an unsuccessful suicide attempt which the film he had first watched in his childhood gives him a new sense of meaning in life. It would lead to him and his second date with Holly, whose life forms the third major story.Holly is a struggling actress herself, unsuccessfully going through Broadway auditions. The former cocaine addict starts a catering business with a friend and fellow actress April (Carrie Fisher), but would find her acting ambition being coming into conflict with April as both find themselves rivals at the same Broadway audition as well as the attraction to the same architect David (Sam Waterson). Holly would turn to writing after the audition and her relationship with David failed, working on a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot. The plot would come to cause great discomfort to Hannah when she found out that it suggested personal details of her marriage with Elliot, and wanted to know how did Holly know about it. It threatened to expose Elliot's secret affair with Lee and Holly would work on a different script inspired by her own life which Mickey likes it greatly, giving Holly confidence over her own work.Then there is also the minor story of the parents of the three sisters in Evan (Lloyd Nolan) and Norma (Maureen O'Sullivan), and the struggles in their own marriage due to Norma's alcoholism and her alleged affairs. But it does not show at the Thanksgiving gatherings with Evan playing the piano along with the flirtatious anecdotes of his wife.Family gatherings might have seen as the last option for the people among your relatives you do not like to meet, but as the film shows, it can also bring about complicated relationships between the people one is related to in one way or another with unexpected results. It can be tense at times watching it on screen apart from the seemingly fast-moving pace of the film in the early stages, but it does leave some form of satisfaction when the conflicts were sorted out and resolved.",

This is killing time between great ideas...If it's possible to tap too deeply into your feminine side Woody does it here, as he writes for his favorite female actresses (Hershey, Farrow & Weist) instead of well-crafted story... this is Woody as Oscar-Angel. Ironic, then, that none of the ladies won. Michael Caine (befuddled turd in bad glasses) must have bribed Academy judges because he actually won an Oscar for this nothing of a performance. (He was exactly the same in JAWS 4.) The only sign of life here is Woody's character's spiritual quest, handled previously and more successfully in \"Stardust Memories.\" After being diagnosed with a terminal illness Woody abandons Judaism and converts to Catholicism by bringing home a Bible, a rosary, and a loaf of Wonder Bread.Careful, Mr. Konigsberg...After finding out he doesn't believe in ANY religion he finally finds some reason to keep living in the film's only highlight. The rest of this is watching actors- often more obnoxious than endearing- pursue romance with varying degrees of success. Hardly anything to get off the sofa for... great title, though.GRADE: C-",

Is it the film of maturity? Yes. Is it his masterpiece? Yes, probably. What can I say more? Is it inventive? Yes. Funny? Yes. Tender and romantic? Yes. Realistic? Ten thousand times, yes. This review is going nowhere, how can I write something creative about one of the most original comic-dramatic script ever written \u0085 thanks God, it's the weekend!\"REVIEWER'S DILEMMA ... ON A GREY AFTERNOON ...\"Sure I can use some Bergman's references to show how clever I am, and that I'm aware of Allen's influences and then I would say that the film is Allen's most successfully Bergmanian film because it succeeded in keeping the Allen touch, while his previous \"Interiors\" was a deliberate take on the Bergman's spirit \u0085 nah \u0085 it wouldn't work \u0085 too intellectual and the movie doesn't deserve that \u0085 I don't know. Let's think about it \u0085 the sky is so gray, I can hear the wind blowing and whistling like an agonizing bull \u0085 speaking of bull, I'm getting a nasty feeling about my current writing, maybe I should delay it for later \u0085\"RAINY MORNING, SAD, SAD, SAD \u0085\"We had many plans for today, so many things to do, to buy, many things starting with C interestingly : corn-flakes, coffee, condoms \u0085 and as soon as we got on the car, it started raining as it's never done before \u0085 I couldn't even see the road, and the chaotic atmosphere made the whole setting extremely nightmarish. Why does God allow that? Whenever you plan to do something according to elaborate schedules, you find yourself stuck in an odd and unexpected situation, why can't everything happen the way you expect it to? Life would be boring? Gee, I don't know \u0085 I don't mean that there's an inner happiness in routine but sometimes, it doesn't hurt \u0085\"IN THE OFFICE ... AGAIN \u0085\"Funny, now that I'm already stuck in a boring position, filling dull tables and columns, and waiting for the deliverance, I have a strong nostalgia for yesterday, when it started raining \u0085 what was I thinking? Why should everything be so damn predictable, why should we try to give a sort of meaning to the meaninglessness of life? Because we're adults, because we have obligations, kids, dreams, responsibilities \u0085 damn I'm confused again. And I read the first part of the reviews, what was I thinking when I spoke about Bergman? What's so Bergmanian about 'Hannah and her Sisters'. It's only a film with a bunch of adults living their lives according to their feelings, their hearts, their dreams, their fears, their obsessions, their strengths and weaknesses. There are no central characters, each one is the center of his or her own universe and tries to make the system work around his existence, but sometimes, well, it just 'starts raining \u0085'*PHILOSOPHY AT 80 MPH \u0085\"This cappuccino tastes good, very smooth and creamy \u0085 I guess I needed something sweet. I've always loved trains, I don't get the whole 'safety reputation' of planes, I will never feel as safe as I do now when the only risk would be to spill the coffee on the laptop. I'll see my father in two hours, I missed him, I miss my family \u0085 I miss my love who will spend a night alone. Life is made of very simple things I guess \u0085 a taste, a feeling, a music, right now, I'm listening to ABBA 'Winner takes it All' in my MP3 \u0085 I used to fill my head with very dark thoughts when I listened to this \u0085 I don't want to remember it, let's skip it. Some rock and roll. It's perfect for my actual mood. I'm wondering what's more pretentious, the whole Bergman comment or writing this stuff on a review of \"Hannah and Her Sisters\". I don't know, maybe this is part of this unpredictability of life, maybe this is deliberate, or genuine \u0085 but I feel like I'm getting somewhere \u0085 mmm another taste of that delicious cappuccino\u0085.\"SWEET DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS \u0085\"I'm getting to bed, and I realize how cyclical life is \u0085 it's all about day and night, sleeping and waking up, loving and hating \u0085 and this is how it turns. It's all cyclical, like the characters' arcs in \"Hannah and her Sisters\", it's a slice of their lives with the dreams built from the past, the present, and the ones that will inspire many other dreams for the future \u0085\"LIFE AS A SERIES OF NEW BEGINNINGS \u0085\"Dreams from the past, and for the future \u0085 I guess I can also replace 'dreams' by 'questions' and I will get closer to the point, which is virtually inexistent, since the whole film is about finding answers to existential questions \u0085 what's the meaning of \"Hannah and her Sisters\", I guess I should remember that beautiful part, with this extraordinarily catchy jazz music, when Elliott after having declared his love to Lee (Barbara Hershey), understood from her reaction that she liked him. Elliott got his answer \u0085 all the characters will end up getting their answers, that whatever fills your daily thoughts : sex, cancer, architecture, Nazis, theater or suicide \u0085 rains, trains, columns or cappuccino \u0085 it all ends up being about love, love as the true meaning of life \u0085 as the driver, the essence or the consolation for its eternal unpredictability \u0085\"",

            "content": "Obligatory \"Woody Allen opens a film like no one else is capable of, always in an amazing engaging way\" sentence. Seriously though, I say this every time because it's always true. By this point, I would be shocked if a Woody Allen film had a poor opening. The 1986 feature of Woody Allen's found him starring as a hypochondriac ex-husband of Hannah (Mia Farrow) and examined the lives of she and her sisters and their various life trials over the span of two years at Thanksgiving. Hannah and Her Sisters was another of Allen's film to have a largely serious tone as the issues of infidelity and the meaning of life was explored. Through Hannah and Her Sisters, Woody Allen achieved, again, the depth of raw human emotions and the power they can have over someone.Sisters Hannah (Mia Farrow), Holly (Dianne Wiest), and Lee (Barbara Hershey) had their share of upheaval raised by showbiz parents. Their mother believes she is still in her prime and able to woo any man which usually means she is neglectful towards the girls' father. With a family full of people who were ill-equipped to take care of themselves, Hannah stepped up and acted as the chief adult of the family, tending to everyone's needs and pushing her own aside. This aspect of Hannah's life has extended into her marriage. Hannah's husband Elliot (Michael Caine) has grown bored of his marriage to the saint that he thinks Hannah is and has moved his attention toward her sister, Lee. Lee is a vulnerable alcoholic seemingly awaiting someone to take her on as a project and make her into a functioning adult. Lee has lived with Frederick (Max Von Sydow) for years as he teaches her about art and life and gives him some connection to the outside world, as he detests everyone except Lee. Holly is struggling with her calling in life as she goes to countless auditions trying to make it as an artist and also run the catering business with her friend as her other pet project. Holly, especially, goes to Hannah for everything including money to survive. Hannah is the only one who has a good handle on her life. She believes she has a good marriage, she has a good relationship with her ex-husband, Mickey (Woody Allen) whom she shares two children with. Hannah wants so badly for everyone in her life to be happy that she even set up Mickey with her sister Holly after her divorce. Sometimes, though, being the one who always fixes every problem they come across can make those closest to them feel unneeded, feelings Elliot blames for pursuing an affair with Hannah's sister. When he contemplates telling Hannah he is in love with Lee, the perfect life Hannah has tried so diligently to manage may crash under the weight of her husband;'s unfulfillment.Hannah and Her Sisters is largely told as two independent stories only occasionally intersecting and that format works for me anyway, but especially with the brilliant writing and directing of Woody Allen. Acting and the relatability of the characters usually have little influence over how I view a film. Hannah and Her Sisters, however, had a character so relatable to me, I felt like I was watching myself on screen. Always the philosopher, I struggle with the concept of life and its meaning and the purpose of a finite existence. Because I am so uneasy about a number of questions I struggle with about life and their persistence in my mind, the character of Mickey was one that hit especially close to my heart. Many a night have found me waking up in a cold sweat with the sudden realization that we are spinning on a ball in space that will someday cease to exist, driven to a dread that I can't shake without talking myself down. I'm basically a female version of Woody Allen which probably explains why I've held a soft spot in my heart all these years for his films. It's either that or the fact that I never want to visit New York as much as I do after watching one of his films, either or, probably.",

This is a comedy, a clever one as always, this is one of his earlier ones. Most of his films, if not all, deal with the same subject but thats good to me, it shows how much it means to Woody.

Keep an eye out for John Turturro, Lewis Black, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus too. In the film, Allen plumbs the depths of existential angst, love and marriage, and finding one's path as an artist when facing so much rejection. The interleaving stories, multiple characters allowed interior dialogue, and action often centered on family gatherings worked very well. I loved the shots of the architectural sites and shops of New York, and as always the humor. The writing is top-notch, as Allen asks big questions about our lives but does so in ways that are cleverly funny and with sprinkles of erudite references. While 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' from a few years later has many of the same things and is ultimately pessimistic, 'Hannah and Her Sisters' has a mature optimism to it, despite our flaws, anxieties, and transience. The scene in the movie theater watching the Marx Brothers in 'Duck Soup' is sweet, and one of several that are memorable.",

It's centred on the lives of three sisters from Manhattan. The plot-line is too full of detail to be usefully described here, it's best to simply watch it for yourself to discover its nuances. But suffice to say, the film is structured in such a way that the comedic and dramatic threads are separated a little, with the story involving Allen's character and his neurosis's being the one with most of the obvious laughs, while the other parts centred more directly on the sisters being more dramatic.The cast is outstanding with standout turns from almost everybody. Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest picked up deserved Oscars but really you could name half a dozen top level performances from this movie. Also, it's really clear here again that Allen is one of the best screenwriters when it comes to creating female characters. The women drive the film and they are all extremely believable. This is partly down to brilliant acting but also terrific writing and direction. And it would be remiss not to add that in amongst the top drawer acting and dramatics is a lot of great comedy too. There are several terrific one liners and many other more subtle comic observations. And Allen himself is really funny once again. After Annie Hall, it's just possible that Hannah and Her Sisters is the most accomplished movie Woody Allen ever directed.",

Allen is, again, excellent as the neurotic ex-husband Mickey and Mia Farrow plays the unsuspecting, loyal wife of Michael Caine as if she's been in that situation before. The chemistry between Caine and Barbara Hershey is outstanding (hours of dialogue are spoken in the few moments of silence they have with each other and the way they physically interact), and Dianne Wiest is perfect as the eccentric (struggling) actress who always thinks she's a burden to the family. The family unit is stretched and tested, but does not break, the tests serving only as a glue to make the family stronger, and more flexible, than they already were. Watch it on cable, rent it, or catch it at a midnight showing somewhere, but get out and watch this, you will not be disappointed. Rating: 34/40",

HANNAH AND MY SISTERS is probably my favorite Woody Allen film...the prototypical Woody Allen film revolving around several neurotic New Yorkers and how their lives intersect bound together by the thread of three sisters (Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey, Dianne Wiest)and the various people and events that invade their lives. Allen appears as a writer (surprise) who actually marries two of the sisters at various points in the story. Michael Caine won an Oscar for his charming performance as Mia's current husband, who has been secretly lusting after sister Hershey for years. Caine has rarely appeared more vulnerable and endearing on screen. Dianne Wiest also won an Oscar for her powerhouse performance as the proverbial black sheep of the family, the sister who never seems to be able to get her life together or figure out what she wants to do with it. Most of the performances are on target; only Max Von Sydow misses the boat in a creepy performance as Hershey's current roommate/hermit. Mia's real-life mom, Maureen O'Sullivan, turns in a scene-stealing performance as the sisters' Mom and the late Lloyd Nolan made his final film appearance as their dad. To say much more would give too much away, but if you love Woody Allen, this film is a must. A charming story with a lovely ending, all set to some beautiful music.",

Hannah is now married to Elliot (Michael Caine) who lately has been yearning to strike up a side romance with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey). Since Lee herself is shacked up with a closeted and unadventurous older artist (Max Von Sydow) she finds herself susceptible to her brother-in-law's advances.Meanwhile, the paranoid Mickey discovers he may have a dangerous brain tumor during one of his routine pilgrimages to his doctor, and starts having second thoughts on life and death, seeking to change from his own Jewish religion to Catholicism, or possibly even an Eastern faith. He has had a bad history of dating Holly (Dianne Wiest) who is another of Hannah's sisters, but has her own past drug history to contend with, as well as a constant struggle to be accepted as a serious performer or writer.There is a lot going on in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but it's mostly interesting and perhaps self-revealing for the viewer. That meaning there may be one or more characters who are experiencing something any of us might be able to identify with. It's an enjoyable blend of romance, self-awareness, passion, confronting one's own mortality, and ultimately trying just to enjoy life.

I'm slightly deaf myself (about 1/5.) So I know exactly how he felt when he freaked out about losing his hearing. I even woke up in the bed screaming, as he did, contemplating bargaining with a higher power that nothing else is wrong with me.Allen shows us that life may be meaningless, but it does not mean that we cannot enjoy every part of it, unlike perhaps a Franz Kafka story. Sometimes when we get unnerved, we just need to take it all in, relax and enjoy before it's over.It's also worth mention that this film carries the \"stylized intellectuals\" that Woody has in his other films.

You talk about the Last Supper, I talk about Annie Hall and Hannah and her Sisters. Woody Allen's perennial love affair with Ingmar Bergman once again manifests itself in one of his films; Hannah and her Sister can draw great parallels with Bergman's seminal Fanny and Alexander, both films provide a turbulent decent into the lives of a dysfunctional family over the course of couple of years bookend by family gatherings, here in the shape of Thanksgiving while in Fanny and Alexander it is Christmas. In Hannah and her Sister we focus primary on the characters of three sisters Hannah, Holly and Lee, all connected by blood but in terms of personalities and success in life they are all diametrically opposed. Hannah (Mia Farrow) is the oldest, most successful and strong willed; while Holly (Dianne Wiest) on the other hand is in constant flux in life, never begin able to find her true calling, while Lee (Barbara Hershey) the youngest is an ex-alcoholic, student who always wears her heart on her sleeve. The film opens up during Thanksgiving dinner, on the surface everything seems upbeat and festive, however Elliot (Michael Caine) the husband too Hannah finds himself deeply infatuated with her sister Lee \"God she is Beautiful\" are very first words spoken in the film, however even when we do find out that Lee harbors similar desires towards him in return and thus begins a secret love affair. It is never made abundantly clear where her feelings are true or if she is merely using Elliot as a stop gap for the whole left in her life during the decaying of her own relationship to Fredrick a self absorbed painter. But it isn't only Lee whose life is experiencing upheaval. Holly who never seems to be able to quite find herself, has lived in the shadow of her much more successful older sister Hannah, causing major underlining tension between the two characters. This tension eventually boils to the surface in probably the most distinct scene in the film where all three sisters sit down in a restaurant; with the main topic of discussion being Holly's need money from Hannah for what seems like the 100th time to fund her latest career path. Despite Hannah obligingly agreeing to do so, Holly still finds an excuse to play the victim stating that her sister only ever saw her as a \"Loser\". What I love the most about this scene, is that it deviates greatly from Allen's traditional technical approach to filmmaking, which is always subvert and naturalistic and rarely drawing attention to itself, however in this scene the camera slowly rotates around all three sisters as if circling the event horizon in a black hole before being engulfed by the dark abyss that is these sisters relationship. Unfortunately the only ever time Allen display this type of flare is in Annie Hall as we have the pleasure of seeing split screens, subtitles of the subtext of scenes and even breaking the fourth wall, which uses all these components so effectively and innovatively something regularly lacking in his work. The last major plot element of the film features Woody Allen making his usual appearance in his own productions, playing here Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a hypochondriac TV producer who finds himself in an existential life crises concerning the point and meaning of life, during his latest health scare. Unfortunately whilst his usual appearances are effective such as is Manhattan and in Play it Again Sam, which he delivers wonderful performances which are integral for each particular films, yet in Hannah and her Sisters I found his narrative arc to being rather to preachy, self-righteous and ultimately unnecessary because it would have served better to have delved even deeper into the sister dynamics, and we need to see a lot more from Hannah who appeared to be more of a boot sale ornament in each scene rather than an actual character. When you consider Hannah and her Sister was attributed with two three of the big Oscars; both supporting Oscars a fete only equated by The fighter and Julia, whilst also receiving the Oscar for best original screenplay, it really defines Wood Allen as a director and writer, he's a fantastic actor's director who can illicit some of the most wonderful performances from his actors, and working with him is always a career highlight, just ask Penelope Cruz and Mariel Hemingway. Then you just have to look at the fact that he has been nominated 14 times for best screenplay to show adept he is at writing dialogue, however while Hannah and her Sister demonstrates his fantastic acting directing and sensational writing, for me the film doesn't break into my all time five best Allen pictures. This is mainly due to his inclusion into the story, which played to Allen's usual hypochondriac role that we have seen him playing way to many times before. I also felt his story also greatly subtracted from the time we should have been spending with the three main actresses, and despite drawing the film out to a mind numbing 2 hours +, I never felt we were ever able to see enough of them Hannah and her Sister ironically.",

Focusing on several women's relationships in New York, it's got everything that we expect in a Woody Allen movie, including the line about how Allen's character ruined himself. I don't think that I would call this his best movie ever, but it's certainly better than the movies where he got disgustingly obsessed with neurotic rich New Yorkers. Worth seeing.

            "content": "Life is the main theme of Hannah and Her Sisters; life that is filled with relationships, affairs, arguments, jobs, fears, desires and simply existing. The backdrop is Allen's beloved New York and it has never looked more realistic or stunning on camera. The way Allen is able to use the ugly back alleys as well as beautiful downtown architecture really is a stunning achievement. All this and I haven't even touched on the real treasure of this immaculate film: the performances and the writing.What a cast Allen put together for this project; it is both ambitious and artistically successful. Dianne Weist and Michael Caine each won Oscars for their roles who in many ways are very similar. Weist's Holly is the youngest of the three sisters and is also the most unfortunate and free-spirited; she means well but finds it more difficult to do so. Caine is absolutely brilliant as Elliot, successful accountant married to Hannah but finding himself hopelessly attracted to the middle sister Lee. In every scene, each finds just the right note to show exactly how two smart, innovative yet complicated people would act and react in situations that befall all of us from time to time. Additionally, Mia Farrow holds the center of the story together as Hannah, so perfect and meticulous in her own right but finding not everyone appreciates this. And Barbra Hershey may give the film's best performance as Lee, married to the stuffy and condescending Fredrick (the legendary Max von Sydow) but wanting so much more out of life than what he has to offer.Yet for me, the real treat of this whole film belongs to the true and unique stamp put on this by the writer and co-star himself, Woody Allen. Playing once again a variation of his stand-up persona as Mickey, the ex-husband of Hannah, Allen gives himself and the film something more to say through this character who is not only a hypochondriac but also terrified of death itself. His dialogue is so insightful, so clever and so outstanding that it struck quite a chord with me and has indeed given me new insight on how to live. The scene when Mickey explains how he got over his fear of death and how the Marx Brothers had something to do with it is one of the most perfect sequences in cinema history.Indeed, the whole script is perhaps the most perfect piece Allen has ever written, paced and spread out so evenly that as he cuts back and forth between the various stories in the film, we never feel cheated or confused. Allen has such a knack for using various plot threads in order to explain a bigger story arc and here it is done to perfection; there is not one dull or uninteresting moment in the whole film. Each story has specific situations and characters that in the end come together only as a family can; this is in many ways a portrait of a family and their problems and lives. I can't imagine a more perfect way to do so than the Woody Allen way.",

Elliot muses in the opening narration about his attraction to Lee, and how he should stifle it, but cannot. Father Evan and mother Norma, two veteran entertainers, entertain at piano and song.Mickey (Hannah's ex) is a hypochondriac who produces an edgy television show that is frequently in conflict with the censors. Gail tries to keep Mickey on track as he bounces from memory to memory of his past marriage and his past partnership with Norman. Perhaps worst of all, Mickey becomes convinced that he has a brain tumor.Delineation of conflicts: Mickey has to fight his hypochondria, and his slowly waning binding to Hannah.

That's not to say that it's not a entertaining drama which covers real life matters, but I was expecting more. It could have done without Woody Allen's character but his storyline ended sweet. Personally, I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more if it was just a drama without any comedy, but it is a Woody Allen film which always has it's Jewish jokes. After watching a few of Woody Allen's movies, this has to be some of his best work which is relevant for nowadays. Watchable!\u00a0Round-Up: Michael Caine put in a great performance in this movie, along with Diane West who seems slightly out of her sweet and innocent comfort zone. Mia Farrow and Barbara Hershey act the same in most of there movies so there performances weren't that surprising. Basically, it's just another one of those Woody Allen movies that deal with troubled relationships so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome.Budget: $6.4million Worldwide Gross: $59millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about troubled relationships and religion. 4/10",

The movie also contained title screens that were completely unnecessary.In movies, title screens are generally used to add to the effectiveness of a certain part of the movie.  In this case, they did nothing for the movie. These title screens generally said what someone would say later.  Because they did not add anything to the movie, they were simply a waste of film.The story line of this movie was especially terrible.  It was completely immoral at times, and nothing that really stood out as fantastic.  Of the two leading men of this movie, Elliot, played by Michael Caine, was the worst.  He is a married man, who has an affair with his wife's sister.  Not only is having the affair wrong, but he really crossed the line because it was her sister.  The only good part of this movie was the concept.  The way that the director, also Woody Allen, set up the film was a great idea.  Throughout the movie, there are times that you can hear what the characters are thinking.  This is especially effective because that thinking could not have been show in any other way.  The first thoughts of this movie come from Elliot.  His thoughts on how much he likes his wife's sister set the mood for the movie.Overall, this movie is not one that this reviewer would ever recommend.

            "content": "Tireless jazz piano and trumpet guide the audience through middle age love, infidelity and neuroses in what is essentially the unofficial sequel to Annie Hall. Though universally loved in 1986, I'm not sure it holds water today the way some may remember, in fact despite it's Bergman sourced aspirations, it feels more like cold cup of coffee than a warm glass of wine. Hannah and Her Sisters is one of those films that resonates with a particular audience in the way the Big Chill had a few years earlier with it's own demographic. Though it must be said, Allen's film is a much deeper and convincing affair in comparison. On the other hand, Hannah and Her Sisters too posses a soundtrack that often dominates and often upstages the characters and the story. Your mileage may vary.So Michael Caine is married to Mia Farrow who used to be married to Woody Allen but they divorced after Allen was found to be sterile. Caine lusts after Farrow's bohemian younger sister played by Barbara Hershey. Caine eventually begins a discrete affair with Hershey, unbeknownst to Farrow. In the meantime, Farrow's other sister played by Diane Wiest is passingly setup with Allen by his ex Farrow for what turns out to be the date from hell for them both. The sisters are all under two former show performers who fight and drink while holding grudges over decades of mutual infidelities. The family Thanksgiving parties serve as structure for this soap opera of sorts. It's complex stuff on the surface and the triangular theatrics make it feel as if it Allen wrote this as a play. Most exchanges and set pieces have the ring of the stage and, had it not been for the boomy jazz muzak and occasional New York exteriors, I would have thought that's where I was sitting as the story unfolded. Top it all off with Allen's trademark confessional narration and that's Hannah and Her Sisters. Universally loved. But I don't buy it. First off, I didn't believe for one second Michael Caine and Barbara Hershey would ever get together. Offload their motivation as immaturity on Hershey or marital monotony on Caine, but I still don't buy it. To top that off, Hershey is the weakling actor among giants on the Playbill and she also gives a lifeless and forgettable performance. Hershey is not only unconvincing, her dialog is just plain poor. There's a reason for that. Of all the Sisters in Hannah, she's essentially the plot pivot and no more. While Wiest and Farrow's characters are chock full of texture and motivations, Hershey has nothing in the way of actual character development. She just exists to put Michael Caine's storyline into motion. That's all well and good, but that lack of chemistry or believability between the two in story or on screen doomed it from the start for me. The acting is good, but the whole thing felt like pandering. Hypochondriac Allen makes a return for some comedy relief, but it doesn't add up to much other than the forced final irony before the fade to black, which I felt was a bit too neat and tidy. Everybody in Hannah and Her Sisters gets to go home happy. The Bergman joke in the way Max von Sydow popping in for two scenes is a good symbol for the movie overall. It sounds clever when you explain it to somebody, but not all that interesting when you actually see it.C-",

Farrow is good in the scenes with her mother (played by her real life mother) but worthless and boring everywhere else.  Max Von Sydow and Barbara Hersey are making some kind of S&M farce totally out of step with the rest of the film, but Sam Waterston and Carrie Fisher are brilliant in a brief but strong bit.

            "content": "I do have this to say for all Woody Allen movies: they may not all be great, but they try to be. They have aspirations and dreams of something greater. Often, it falls short of those dreams. But it always aims high. Like him or not, old Woody (and at 79, he is quite old now) is an auteur in the purest sense of the word. He does not make movies for awards ceremonies or critics or the general audience. He makes them for himself and about what he finds most interesting, and it shows. As an artist, I have to give him credit for that. As a critic, I do have to give credit to the fact that it produces originality. And, occasionally, greatness.I have seen three great Woody Allen movies. Annie Hall, which is one of the greatest movies ever made and of which I will likely do a review sometime. Manhattan, the truest sort of love letter to NYC and probably one of the most wistful and depressing yet thought-provoking and insightful movies I've ever seen. And this, a film that, while it may not be as fresh or sharp as the other two, is still an insightful, poignant flick that is spectacularly acted and scored and is not afraid to explore every part of the emotional landscape.It's a fascinating film. Every 'mini-act' starts with white writing on black, a quote during the part. It's an interesting choice and one that I appreciate. It helps the film flow. And I do believe that Woody is at his best when he's expiericing at least a bit. That's a reason why Annie Hall is better than Manhattan. The fourth-wall breaking, the scene where they contrast what's being thought with what's being said, the whole self-aware atmosphere, and so much more... it's fantastic. And it always serves a tonal purpose.I would also argue that's it's partially necessary in Allen movies to stop them from collapsing in on their own intellectualism, but I digress. What's important is that this film has a few of these moments spattered through it, like one memorable scene that I won't spoil but where the doctor tells Woody Allen's character two different things: one in real life, one in his paranoid, neurotic dreams. Allen's character is rather humorously referred to as a hypochondriac, and the build-up pays off in this scene.Speaking of Allen's character, though, he does not show up a lot in this film. For the first ten or fifteen minutes of the film, I was not even sure if he was in the movie as an actor. There is a debate about whether or not he makes his films better or worse when he's acting. I think that it can flip both ways; when the film takes advantage of his neuroses and uses them to its advantage, piercing to the soul of reality, as happens in Annie Hall and Manhattan, it enhances the film. But in some other films, it drags them down and makes me want to kick Woody back behind the camera.And then there are films like this, where it just exists. It is not bad, and it does not drag down anything down or throw gunk in any operations. It's just kinda unnecessary. If you took Woody Allen's character out of the film, you would not feel like anything's missing. The film does gain something with it, but said gains are mostly aesthetic and stylistic and his character does intrude into the film a bit too much for my tastes. Yes, while this film does deserve five stars, it is my no means flawless. But, hey, if a little self-indulgence is the price we need to pay for one of the most emotionally-packed movies in history, so be it.The using of several story lines gives ample opportunity for exploration, and this film takes advantage. You get to see many different stages of relationships play out with many different types of people. From the perspectives of Hannah and her sisters, Lee and Holly, you get to see the repercussions of opportunities taken versus those not taken. This film has a happy ending, but it is only one part thrilling opposed to three parts contentment. And above all, it feels earned.(P.S. Michael Caine is especially terrific. He deserves that Oscar. It was shocking (for a younger viewer like me) to see him as a young(er) man and just as shocking to see him put on that kind of performance. Legends are legends for a reason.)",

Allen's preoccupation with the artsy-fartsy uptown milieu of Manhattan is by now becoming all too familiar: the extramarital affairs, the urban neuroses, the earnest, almost theatrical dialogue, and (as always) the meditations on life, love, and death have all been recycled from earlier Allen comedies. In this case the obvious (and, as it turns out, most convenient) plot comparisons would be with his 'Manhattan' and 'A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy', with (thankfully) the strengths of the former outweighing the weaknesses of the latter.

Apparently, the jurors in the drama division for Pulitzer prize were so impressed that they suggested Woody's screenplay for the prize for drama, and submitted the question to the Pulitzer board of whether there shouldn't be some way to honor film scripts.This is the story of the three sisters Hannah, Holly and Lee, their parents Evan and Norma, and their husbands, lovers and ex-lovers. The parents are alcoholic debauchees, and the toll it's taken on their children even as adults is apparent.Hannah's the responsible matronly member of the family, always doing the right thing, helping her sister Holly financially, and by giving her \"honest, constructive advise\". She's the one her parents call when they need help, and she \"gives a very deep feeling of being part of something\" even to her cheating husband. However, everyone around her still seem to resent her. She fears that her husband finds her \"too competent, too disgustingly perfect\" and she may be right.Holly, a recovering drug addict, is a bundle of nerves. She's hypersensitive, desperately needs validation and resents any judgment especially from her sister Hannah.Lee has her own confidence issues. She's a former alcoholic, with a boyfriend much older than her, and you suspect that she's with him just because she wants to be his student and learn from him. Then there's Hannah's husband Elliot who lusts after Holly and her ex- husband Mickey, a hypochondriac who's on a mission to understand the meaning of life.Every character is well-rounded, and fully formed. The pacing is perfect. The direction, especially the choice of music in many scenes is such that you feel like you're supposed to laugh at the characters and situations, but the performances are so raw and sincere, and the dialogue so realistic that you deeply empathize with the characters. Woody directs with great assurance, but never brings attention to his direction. Carlo Di Palma's cinematography is impressive. A few scenes like the library scene with Elliot and Lee, and the restaurant scene with the three sisters are extraordinary in the way they've been shot.The film improves a lot on some reflection and repeat viewings, and I've an inkling this is what Woody must've been aiming for in some of his earlier efforts like Annie Hall and Manhattan.

Meanwhile, hypochondriac Mickey is going through an existential crisis as he contemplates an eternity of nothingness. Of course, Allen specializes in squeezing chuckles out of such fretful material, as he does here.The principal cast performs superbly as Oscar winners (Caine and Wiest) show. I really like how the production doesn't glamorize the girls, pretty as they are. That way guys follow persons rather than heightened allure. Great also to see old timers like Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O'Sullivan picking up paydays that also amount to a shrewd casting move on somebody's part. But what's going on with von Sydow as the imperiously nasty Frederick. I gather Allen admires the actor, but his role here is clunky and sour. And why top bill Carrie Fisher when she gets little screen time. Too bad. Overall, the movie's many individual threads combine pretty well. In fact West's Holly manages considerable poignancy without getting weepy, while Allen's rather dramatic role still has its comedic moments.

Basically it's a confusing plot line that is almost impossible to explain to another person and quite frankly, after seeing the movie who would want to relive it? \t        The music should be noted, however, it totally captures the New York feeling, at least for someone who's never been there.  The acting is the only other positive aspect of this movie.  With a plot that seems totally ridiculous it's totally believable and the scenes staring Mickey the hypochondriac are kind of funny.  Surprisingly, Woody plays one of the more innocent characters, which given his history doesn't seem to suit his personality. \t        Which brings this reviewer to one last point: the scandal that occurs between Lee and Elliot is almost like a foreshadowing of what happens in Woody's real life.  (His love affair with a certain Korean `daughter' that is now his wife.)  This is the only other interesting point of this story considering that Woody Allen wrote it. \t        In conclusion, this movie is not worth wasting 103 minutes of precious time that could be spent watching Plan 9 From Outer Space.",

Every line is beautifully crafted by Woody Allen and his direction is spot-on.Great performances by an all-star cast. Michael Caine is great and well-deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar (though I thought he was in a lead role - maybe the movie's title convinced the Academy otherwise). His performance is superb, especially as the character he plays is very dissimilar to most Michael Caine roles - reserved, awkward and nerdy. Not the usual Caine confident leading man role.Woody Allen is his usual wonderfully neurotic and hilariously funny self. Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest are perfectly cast as the three sisters. (Wiest got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her efforts). Good support from Carrie Fisher and Max van Sydow. Also interesting to note that Lewis Black, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and John Turturro have minor, early-career, roles in the movie.

            "content": "A flood of adjectives come to mind when asked to describe in any way Hannah and her sisters. Yet one of those adjectives could be a ' dry-humored flick'. \tWoody Allen portrays a comical, crazed man afraid of death. Woody's character is the best part of this film, which still doesn't speak much of it. Hannah and her sisters' plot line is centered around a man's lustful desire for his wife's sister and goes on to narrate the consequences of that lust. \tIt lacked any sort of spunk on the filming technique, or any hint of moral awareness. Though its representation of what is to some considered a typical family was captured, it completely demeans the concept of loyalty, family values, love, and even intelligence, ( from the writers and director's part).  \tAs far as the casting of this flick Mia Farrow, (Hannah), does a great job of demonstrating the characteristic of woman who gets used a doormat, by all around her, especially the ones who claim to love her. The two other sisters Lee, (Barbara Hershey), who is the cause of her brother- in- law's lust, and Holly (Dianne Weist) are able to capture the character's feelings to the audience. Now Michael Caine (Elliot Hannah's husband) is like a sore thumb sticking out of the cast. \tThroughout the flick this twisted family is gathered and reunited to celebrate Thanksgiving. If it weren't for the turkey and the decorations that concept would not have been captured by the audience, because the guests of the celebration might as well have been perfect strangers, and even the family's way of relating to one another is completely foreign. \tNothing much is left to say, if one is familiar with Woody Allen and enjoys to waste 103 minutes of one's life on immorality and twisted events then this flick is for that one.",

            "content": "Hannah, Lee, and Holly are three sisters from a theatrical family, struggling to find themselves artistically and romantically. Hannah (Mia Farrow) is in her second marriage, to a financial adviser (Eliot, played by Michael Caine), raising her brood and acting part-time. She lends Holly money and sets her up with blind dates, mediates blow-ups between her temperamental parents when her mother falls off the wagon, hosts Thanksgiving dinner and generally functions as mother hen to the entire clan. Holly (Dianne Wiest) is a struggling would-be actress and ex-cocaine user who abortively starts a catering business with her friend April (Carrie Fisher) and then drops that idea to become a playwright. Aimless Lee (Barbara Hershey) lives with brooding painter Frederick (Max Von Sydow), who is her Svengali.Hannah's first husband Mickey, played by Woody Allen, is a TV writer having a crisis of life and faith precipitated by a cancer scare. His comic struggles as he deals with his medical odyssey and subsequent religious quest interweave throughout the three sisters' romantic and creative adventures.The other driving force in the film is Eliot's conviction that he is in love with Lee and cannot live without her. His bumbling attempts to seduce Lee while wrestling with his inability to leave Hannah provide the dramatic fulcrum for most of the film and won Michael Caine an Oscar. Dianne Wiest also won a Supporting Actress Oscar, and the screenplay won Woody his third Oscar.Hannah And Her Sisters marks Woody Allen's return to the contemporary ensemble comedy-drama eight years after the stunning one-two punch of Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1978) announced to the film world that here was not just a wonderful gagster and clown but a film auteur of formidable genius. He creates wonderfully drawn characters inhabited by top-notch performances and uses them to riff on his beloved themes of life, death, love, sex, and spirituality. Like the best Woody Allen movies, it's a joy just to listen to, for its rich dialogue, its literate observations, Allen's unmatched wit--sometimes sly, sometimes uproarious, and its thoughtful musings on the meanings of life and love, death and God, passion and loyalty.Only Woody Allen can mix the sublime and ridiculous with such adroit skill: \"Millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and in the end none of them knows anything more about the big questions of life than I do. Jesus, I read Socrates. This guy used to knock off little Greek boys. What the hell's he got to teach me? And Nietzsche, with his theory of eternal recurrence. He said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity. Great. That means I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again. It's not worth it. And Freud, another great pessimist. I was in analysis for years. Nothing happened. My poor analyst got so frustrated, the guy finally put in a salad bar.\"Allen's use of mise-en-scene is frequently masterful and occasionally daring. In one scene in their artist's loft apartment, Lee talks to the emotionally distant Frederick through a curtain of semi-transparent Visqueen draped over some scaffolding. In another, we see Hannah framed in the doorway of her kitchen as she argues with Eliot over his withdrawal from her; with Eliot hidden from the camera inside the kitchen, Hannah is visually and figuratively talking to the wall.The rewards of Hannah And Her Sisters are so numerous, it's hard to list them all: we get treated with a soundtrack full of great old standards and some Bach chamber music thrown in for good measure, an architectural tour of New York City, great cameos by Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Lewis Black, J.T. Walsh, and John Turturro, e.e.cummings poetry, and Bobby Short at the Carlyle belting out Cole Porter.Allen's unique approach in this film, with title cards in white type on black before each scene, and the liberal use of interior monologues, lets him enrich and move the story along efficiently but powerfully. Superstar screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers, A League Of Their Own) cite Hannah And Her Sisters as inspiration for the interweaving narrative structure they employed in their movie Parenthood. What's more, when Hannah And Her Sisters came out, it created such a stir among theater critics that there was talk of lobbying the Pulitzer committee to make Woody Allen's screenplays eligible for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. My quarrels with Hannah And Her Sisters are trivial indeed. Allen uses the song \"Bewitched\" too much. One time hearing Lloyd Nolan and Maureen O'Hara croak out the song is plenty. Inexplicably, when it comes back several times in the background as an instrumental, it sounds like it's being played on an out-of-tune spinet piano by an amateur playing an easy piano arrangement, as though it was source music when it is clearly not. And yet, in one tantalizing uncredited instance, we get 12 bars of a very beautiful solo piano rendition.The DVD, like all Woody Allen movies, has no extras to speak of except the theatrical trailer, and the soundtrack is in mono. Of minor interest is the fact that one of the scenes in the trailer is not in the final cut of the movie.If you are new to Woody Allen, I recommend starting with Annie Hall and Manhattan, and then watching Hannah and Her Sisters. The first two will give you a taste of what's characteristically Woody at its best. In Hannah, he puts himself and his characteristic style a little more in the background, achieving a perfect balance between drama and comic relief.",

            "content": "The ages of Hannah and her sisters are never once stated in this film, but it is a testament to Allen's craft to be able to make it so easily identifiable even as they live apart through the years. When I first watched this, I mistakenly attributed Carrie Fisher's April as a fourth sister and now find that it makes the sibling dynamics that much more interesting. After all, it is her and the youngest sister Holly who fight over a architect like little sisters would fight over a Barbie doll. Allen sets off this little conflict so perfectly and subtly. Their catering business is blooming in its first gig (but not without some financial assistance from big sister Hannah), but the focus is the kitchen where David has wandered in. Watch as they both initially flirt and vie for his affections, before the camera settles on April and David's conversation, and Holly nervously flits in and out of the frame, desperately attending to the food while trying to stay in the competition. Later there is a wonderful verbal joust - and the dialogue is wonderfully pleasant, but alludes subtly to who will win this round. The resulting voice-over (from the back seat no less!) is the final blow. Michael Caine plays Elliot, who has become undone because of his wife's steadfast emotional strength that gives so much, yet needs so little. Hannah herself gets only one voice-over in the film, and it is not even about her, but about worrying over the state of her parent's waning relationship in their old age. We construct a jigsaw of the model big sister from each of the secondary character's reactions to her. Elliot feels inadequate and chases after her younger sister Lee, but cannot bear to break up such a wonderful marriage. Lee, upon being confronted by him, initially has doubts, not because of her boyfriend Frederick, but because she does not want to drag Hannah's marriage out onto the street (in particular, see how quickly she leaps to her big sister's defense against Lee, citing the hard times she is going through, feeling guilty about the affair). It is clear that she is already beginning to feel suffocated by Frederick, who feigns a misanthropic outlook but hangs so dearly onto his one vestige of humanity. He has a number of unbearably pretentious rants that only an Allen script could make humorous. The age gap aside, she is less a lover than a student or a child. Surely Elliot and Lee's relationship would have eventuated to this stage once the passion was depleted and his poetry become uninspiring. In a lonely second-hand book store, Di Palma's compositions separate the pair via the bookshelves, and hint at this even before they have pulled the trigger. Then there is Mickey, the usual Allen type. In his best film, Annie Hall, the narrative depends on this sort of character, but here I think it works in spite of it. Mickey is a neurotic television writer who has the ability to turn any minor medical issue into a fatal diseases, and spends his days reaffirming this even at his happiest. It is baffling to say the least how he and Hannah ever married (although as per her nature, she gives a glowing review in recommending him to Holly). He goes through the usual nihilistic period, but it isn't Mickey we are watching fret over death and consult every religion in desperation, it is Allen through and through, and any interview would confirm this. And yet, his response to a struggling screenplay is exceptionally genuine. Hannah and her sisters shine through. There is a scene where the three are sitting at a table, and Allen makes the mundane so cutting, and the sister hierarchy that has been established in childhood so evident. The camera arcs around as to give each time to unveil their current stories, but one person is spilling out. Holly's catering company and romantic life have both evaporated in one feel swoop, and she puffs on her cigarette anxiously as he looks for another loan to pursue her latest venture, screen-writing. Lee is clearly consumed by guilt at the sight of the angelic Hannah, who gives encouraging and constructive advice before dialling back and supporting Holly anyway. She doesn't care whom the camera focuses on.The ending is idyllic and comforting, which is not something that Allen is usually associated with. We have been presented with a mess of an extended family; even the black and white title cards that attempt to compartmentalise and organise their lives do no good. In the midst of it is Hannah, who has taken upon herself to be the anchor. Even as her marriage knowingly breaks down, observe how unaccusatory her speech is, how anxious she is about her husband's unhappiness, but even more so trying no to prod or ignite a quarrel. And people latch onto her because she is entirely selfless (it is a good thing to surround yourself with this type of person, and I am lucky to have done so with a few). And from that perspective with observe each and every tic, each ounce of anxiety, of mid life crisis, of unfulfilling career and marriage, of even death itself. (Mickey, or Allen, finds his purpose in a new relationship and Holly's pregnancy. I'm unsure of what to make of it. Is it another twist in the tale, given Mickey's infertility beforehand?)",

            "review_title": "A Panicky Slice of Life",
            "content": "As one does with a good two thirds of the movies written, not to mention directed, by Woody Allen, I sat watching Hannah and Her Sisters and every fifteen minutes wondered why I felt like I'd seen a movie that had constructed almost the exact same situation before, soon realizing that I was thinking of another Woody Allen film. So I ask you: Just how many times can you make a movie about two people cheating on their spouses and ending up cheating on them with people either affiliated with or in an adulterous relationship with the spouses, who are also cheating? As many as you want, because if you're like Woody Allen and you can somehow make every assembly line update of his last movie hilarious and cerebral and provocative as if it were a fresh, new thing, it doesn't matter I guess. Hannah and Her Sisters portrays many things very closely to the way they are in reality, like a relationship between sisters and three different types of men in their own forms of mid-life crisis.Woody Allen serves as his own comic relief, hilariously punctuating studious scenes of drama and character entanglement with the role you always expect him to play every time without fail. I found Michael Caine to be an interesting choice for Woody and a very pleasant presence on screen as always, no matter what movie he's in or who he's playing. Though his role isn't the most interesting or fleshed out, he still absorbs you in his time on screen and completely becomes his character. Mia Farrow has never been quite as interesting as the other actresses in Allen's films, but as she did in The Purple Rose of Cairo, she moves me with her ability to portray an emotionally and socially ungraceful person. Dianne Wiest and Barbara Hershey, playing her two sisters, are very enjoyably different from each other, Wiest tackling the role as the one whose tastes and needs are always different from those around her and Hershey playing the most receptive and sensitive of the three. Both actresses very clearly communicate their characters. Max von Sydow serves a handful of screen time as a perfect English-speaking carbon copy of any given role he ever played in his days as Ingmar Bergman's leading man, adapting in a down-to-earth Manhattan setting as actually a very realistic self-centered social critic, bringing an interesting ruffle to the movie's cast.Woody's role, as Mickey, a TV writer who fluctuates as part of Hannah's family, could be at the heart of the story. Mickey concludes that because he will one day die, because he's only hanging onto life by a thread, everything is without meaning. This recognition leads him to questions about God's existence, and he soon starts to assimilate meaning in life with the existence or nonexistence of God, more than with his own humanness. It is this realization that there is no pure or evenhanded purpose or relevance installed in the universe as a whole, because everything is transient and evasive, is met with the film's refrain of annual family get-togethers at Thanksgiving, a tradition, a false appearance of continuance, and how even if the surface intentions of the event, the perception of the familial atmosphere, is the same, each Thanksgiving is different in the most random and unexpected ways depending on the directions each character has taken in the past year.Like most of Woody Allen's films, it is very very well-made. His movies always have a simplistic, deadpan use of the camera that works quite well, a lot of the time keeping the camera stationary in the hallway as the characters leave and go from room to room, passing the camera by as it sits, almost as if it were the point of view of the house itself watching its residents go through life. In Hannah and Her Sisters, there are a few great moments where the camera is used to great and unpredicted comical effect. He also uses music very well in this film. The constant, old-fashioned, eclectic soundtrack plays in nearly every scene and when one scene jumps to another, the changing music will contradict the last piece of music from the previous scene.Hannah and Her Sisters is a great film to watch if you love New York, if you love people, if you can identify with life. Woody Allen may be especially particular when it comes to subject matter, save for those rare leaps he makes with films like The Purple Rose of Cairo, Shadows and Fog, Match Point, Scoop, and a few others, but somehow no matter how stale his work seems to get, he always has you leave feeling like you've explored or learned something new.",

            "content": "\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is, I admit, my first Woody Allen movie.  How it compares to his other pictures I cannot say, but it is structured differently than any movie I have ever seen.  Not only does it have a convoluted, branching plot with multiple, completely independent stories, but it is divided up into individual chapters, each preceded by a caption on a black screen with its title, ranging from a single word to an E. E. Cummings line of poetry.  Had I not read another review of the film I would never have noticed its theme of our emotions and desires clouding our plans and decisions.  In fact, it could easily be perceived as simply a sample of random vignettes to the unobservant.The movie spans at least a couple years, primarily following the misadventures of two characters - Mickey (Woody Allen) and Elliot (Michael Caine).  Mickey, portraying Allen's (apparently) familiar personality of an extremely neurotic, paranoid man, embarks on a quest for the meaning of life (I will try to refrain from any Hitchhiker's Guide references) after being tested for a brain tumor and coming face-to-face with death.  In what is easily the most humorous moment in the film,  Mickey tries out various religions as he might samples of sausage or cheese in a grocery store.  His quest is the most engaging and charming part of the movie.The other main story involves Elliot's affair and the relationship between him, his wife Hannah (Mia Farrow), and her sister, Lee (Barbara Hershey). Although Elliot's plight is understandable, I found myself more irritated with him than sympathetic - his character is emotional and irrational, and yet very cold and defensive at times as well.  Although he was well-acted and deep as a character, my distaste for him rather hurt my liking for the movie's style and flow.The characters are all related in one way or another.  I could not entirely even keep up with all of the character and their relationship to each other. Essentially, Frederick is married to Lee, who has an affair with Eliot, whose wife is Hannah, Lee's sister, whose ex-husband is Mickey, who eventually marries Holly, Hannah's sister.  I would not want to be the one who has to draw up a family tree for a special feature somewhere - although, ironically, there are no children mentioned in the film. \nIn the end, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a movie that leaves one with a feeling of respect more than enjoyment - although the skill at work here is obvious, with great dialogue and deep characters, but the movie is clouded by too many characters and subplots, and seemingly random events.  The characters aside from a central four or so (Mickey, Elliot, Lee and Hannah) are shallow and thinly drawn, standing out like typical movie stereotypes in an otherwise very real world.  Also, I must admit I have a bit of a bias against this particular genre.  Thus, the film earns a B-.",

            "content": "The cast in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is very good all around. Woody Allen won an Oscar for his original screenplay, and Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest won acting Oscars.Allen is one of the most successful writers and movie makers about modern life. His forte is his backyard - the big city (usually the Big Apple). So, one expects that the subject will evolve around urban living. In the years of the Great Depression and before WW II, many film settings were urban as well. But those were usually the glamorous, night on the town type of comedies and romances (any mysteries) that entertained people from the cities and the country alike. They could dream about \"the good life\" or how living like that would be so much fun. Of course, this doesn't include the films about excesses in those areas.But the modern versions of the urban life are quite different. Most often they show people in turmoil, often anxious, despondent, conflicted. They often involve multiple marriages, divorce, infidelity, free sex, and searching for the right person. Almost always the main characters are in psychotherapy or have analysts. Seldom are children even included, and when they are they are barely noticed in the film. There doesn't seem to be much happiness or joy among the characters. And usually, not much laughter or smiling.When the focus of these is comedy, they can be quite entertaining. When comedy is a small part or the focus is more on the drama and travails of everyday life in the big city, I suspect the entertainment appeal is diminished. It may very well be that the masses of people living in the big cities still see these as entertaining and enjoy them. But I suspect that there may be many who don't live such lifestyles or in such surroundings, for whom these stories aren't that funny or entertaining.If \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is comedy, it is a comedy of errors. Woody Allen's story covers a wide range of family and personal experiences. We all make mistakes, bad choices, and selfish choices; and we have family and personal problems ranging from personal to health to employment. Most people today have some dysfunction in their families. But dysfunction seldom is funny. Lloyd Nolan's character, Evan, reflects off-screen in one segment of this film, about their children. Norma and he loved having their three daughters, but they didn't care to be with them that much while they were growing up.A good drama from time to time can help us reflect, look at ourselves, and recharge our batteries to go on. But, the comedy in films like this is pretty weak, and not everyone will enjoy this or similar films as entertainment.",

Also, it is good to see more of New York, more than the usual chocolate box Manhattan side streets we are more used to with the director. However, I would have appreciated a little more humour. I smiled twice, once when Max von Sydow compares his lack of understanding of Nazi motivations with his lack of knowing how a can-opener works and the accusation of Allen's reaction to a malign spot that turned out to be on his jumper. But there was not enough of this and generally I do not find jokes about hypochondria very amusing whilst too much emphasis on boring people can be boring rather than amusing. I enjoyed Mia Farrow's performance, even if she really was possibly just playing herself. I though Woody Allen may have been rather too tied up with all his performers on this occasion to put much effort in himself and Michael Caine despite his Oscar, seemed like a fish out of water and thoroughly uncomfortable at times causing me to feel embarrassed for him. Overall this seemed just about okay but surely had the potential to be so much more. The fact that it is liked a lot more than other Allen films suggests to me that many people prefer it when things are not too edgy and that everyone is basically having a jolly good time really.

Elliot and Lee are conducting a passionate affair, of which Hannah remains quite innocent. The other main strand concerns Hannah's former husband,Mickey, who after his divorce once- disastrously- dated Hannah's other sister, the rebellious, drug-taking Holly. Mickey is the archetypal Woody Allen character, the neurotic, artistic, slightly bohemian, middle-class Jewish New Yorker. Mickey is a man whose life is dominated by worries about his health. He convinces himself that he is dying of a brain tumour, and when he is given a clean bill of health by his doctor, abandons hypochondria in favour of existential angst, perpetually worrying about the meaning of life and the existence of God, and taking up, and then dropping, one religion or philosophy after another.The film is generally classified as a comedy, but in fact falls somewhere in between comedy and tragedy. On the one hand, it deals with potentially tragic subject-matter such as adultery and suicidal depression. On the other hand, there is a happy ending for nearly everyone concerned (with one exception), and there is no denying that much of the dialogue is extremely funny, crackling with typical Woody one-liners. My particular favourite is the retort of Mickey's cynical father when his son challenges him on the problem of human evil: \"How the hell do I know why there were Nazis? I don't know how the can opener works!\", but there are plenty more in a similar vein. The film can, in fact, be seen as a tribute to the power of laughter. Mickey is finally persuaded that life is worth living not by arguments in favour of religion or of philosophical optimism but by watching the Marx Brothers comedy \"Duck Soup\". Some have found this scene unconvincing, but given Mickey's distrust of all metaphysical belief systems, the only ideology likely to satisfy him seems to be \"Marxism of the Groucho tendency\" (to adapt a once-famous French graffito).The main reason why this film is so entertaining is the combination of a number of near-perfect acting performances. Woody himself goes over the top at times, but in general he succeeds in making Mickey an amusing figure. We even forget how annoying the Mickeys of this world can be in real life. Most of the other performances are perfectly judged- from Michael Caine as Elliot, torn between his love for Hannah and his desire for Lee, and from Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest as the three sisters. There are also a number of excellent contributions in minor roles. The one that really stands out is from Max von Sydow as Lee's artist boyfriend, the sourly pessimistic Frederick. He is the one exception mentioned above, the man for whom there can never be a happy ending because he actively prefers gloom and despair to happiness.The other factors which contribute to the film's success are the lovingly shot New York locations (like \"Manhattan\", it is a love-letter from its creator to his native city) and the jazz-dominated musical score. Although I did not much care for the film when I first saw it, I have come to love it over the years, and now in my view this rates along with \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan\" as one of Woody's greatest films; certainly his best of the eighties. 9/10",

With Woody Allen directing and starring in the movie, I guess he had to add pieces of his life in the film.  That's what got me laughing most of the time.  It wasn't the actual story line, it was things like the first few opening jokes were about child molestation.  I guess you wouldn't find it funny unless you knew about Woody Allens real life.  `Hanna and her Sisters' stars, Woody Allen (of course!), Barbra Hershey, Carey Fisher, Michael Caine, Julie Louise Drifse and Mia Ferrow. \tThe movie is pretty self explanatory, it's about Hanna (Mia Ferrow) and her sisters April (Carey Fisher) and Lee (Barbra Hershey).  April is the crazy pot head, drunk, that can't seem to keep her head on straight and has the worst luck in men.  Lee, well she can't seem to keep her hands off Hanna's husband, Elliot (Michael Caine).  Hanna was married to the crazy, New Yorker, Mickey (Woody Allen) but is now married to Elliot who loves her dearly, but has an ongoing affair with Lee.  Can you say....'screwed up family'!!!! \tThe movie was dry for the most part and wasn't funny at all.  It drags you along like road kill stuck to the tire of a car, you could possibly fall asleep, if it wasn't for the annoying cast that brought such great appeal to the film.... NOT!!!! \tIt's hard to say any good came out of this film.  All it's about is a family that pretty much has some sort of sexual relationship to one another. Kind of gross, but I guess incest is the sort of thing that appeals to Woody Allen! This reviewer is being very nice by giving `Hanna and her sisters' 4 out of 10!",

Woody Allen has assembled a cast of seasoned actors as well as a few with long-time seasoning in the case of Maureen O'Sullivan,Lloyd Nolan and Max Von Sydow. The usual venues of parties, dating, family get-togethers and meetings give rise to the angst of modern life. The situations are often funny, sometimes bordering on hilarity. Mia Farrow plays Hannah, the sister who is the \"brick\" in the family, the stable one who comforts and counsels and comes to the aid of everyone else, even her parents, played by Nolan and O'Sullivan. In the end she too faces her own personal crisis. In the background is Woody Allen whose fear of impending death never comes to pass. This life crisis leads him towards religion as a way of coping with the inevitable. His short embrace with Catholicism ends in disappointment,as does his subsequent courtship with the Hare Krishna movement. Eventually, he finds closure to calm his restless spirit.",

However, I felt, that Allen's character, though funny, seemed slightly under-developed.Allen knows his Cinema more than anyone else. His work has gone down in History, and it deserves to be!. He directs this story wonderfully. Cinematography by Carlo Di Palma, is picture-perfect. Editing by Susan E. Morse is good.Performance-Wise: Allen is funny, while Barbara Hershey steals the show with a fantastic performance. An under-rated performance! Mia Farrow is her usual self. Michael Caine excels in an Oscar-winning role, same goes for Dianne Wiest, who also won an Oscar for her performance here. Carrie Fisher and Max von Sydow are decent.

Allen's screenplay also won an Oscar, his direction was nominated, and the film received two other nominations as well.The cast is great, and deep, and includes: Barbara Hershey, Carrie Fisher, Mia Farrow, Maureen O'Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, Max von Sydow, Daniel Stern, Julie Kavner (mother Marge on TV's The Simpsons), Joanna Gleason, John Turturro, even Tony Roberts and Sam Waterson, uncredited.Allen plays a hypochondriac TV producer - Kavner's his assistant and Turturro's one of his manic writers - that thinks he's going to die from a brain tumor. He's also the ex-husband of Farrow, who's now married to Caine, who lusts after Farrow's sister Hershey, who lives with eccentric, withdrawn from society artist von Sydow, who's upset that newly rich musician Stern wants a painting to match his puce couch.Wiest plays Hannah's other sister, a former drug addict and \"out of work\" actress who starts a catering business with her friend Fisher, who competes with her for the affections of Waterson. O'Sullivan and Nolan play the sisters' parents: she's a former star actress, he's her \"out of the limelight\" husband that strayed, though they're both still happily together. When Allen's character was married to Farrow's, his low sperm count caused them to ask his business partner Roberts, with wife Gleason, to donate his so that they could have twins.The film's three parts are divided by large family gathering Thanksgiving dinner parties at Caine's and Farrow's (real life) apartment; smaller sections by silent film-like dialogue pages.",

It's a tight, economical piece and it's got a wonderful ensemble. Hannah, (Mia Farrow) and her sisters Lee, (Barbara Hershey) and Holly, (Dianne Wiest) are central to the proceedings but her husband Elliot, (Michael Caine) and ex-husband Mickey, (Allen himself), are integral, too. That Elliot has an affair with one sister and Mickey ends up with the other may seem like stretching it a bit but it never comes across that way. It's so well written and directed and acted, (Caine and Wiest won Oscars but Farrow and Hershey are equally good), that it feels 'real' as if we have been privileged to enter this enclosed and enlarged family unit, (Maureen O'Sullivan and Lloyd Nolan are the theatrical parents, Max Von Sydow the very po-faced, very Swedish artist that Hershey's sister lives with).It's also very funny but this time round the jokes seem less like one-liners and more integrated into the situations. It's certainly up there with \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\", (and yes, \"Manhatten\", \"Interiors\", \"Crimes and Misdemeanours\" and the underrated \"September\"), with the very best of Allen and a key work that one can return to again and again.",

            "content": "In a definite attempt to combine humor and intrigue, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" displays Woody Allen's interest in failed actresses and dysfunctional families.  Funny in some places, the overall feel of the movie is disturbing.  Set around Thanksgiving, the movie portrays the difference between bonded sisters and lonely husbands.  \tMainly telling the tale of the three sisters and their husbands, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" goes on to show no set plot.  Jumping from scene to scene, broken up by foreshadowing quotes, it displays not only random feelings, but also unfinished thoughts. \t\tThe sisters, on one hand, are corrupt from the start.  While there's a definite status between them, they are all decent to each other emotionally and financially.  Short fuses lead to an understanding of their past, having been raised by an alcoholic mother, and a father who had long given up. From that stance, to dishonest marriages, each sister struggles on her own, always coming home to barely confront reality on Thanksgiving. \n\tThe husbands, or boyfriends, on the other hand are shown as passive and confused.  Without paying much attention to needs or familiarities, they try continually to conquer just a part of their fears.  Loneliness plays a big part in their lives while their wives try to reach out with all they know. The movie shows multiple scenarios where the viewer is the only one knowing the troubles of a certain character, therefore emphasizing the miscommunication inside each relationship.  \tOn a scale of one to ten, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" rates a six (ten being the highest), for it's average plot, and subtle, if even present, themes. It is not a movie recommended and could be seen as a potential waste of time.  Very little humor and an unfinished story make for an average movie.",

But this film is the closest thing he's done to a Robert Altman-like comedy/drama, with about ten characters branching away from the central sisters of the film:  Hannah, Lee and Holly.  The film is not really about their relationships with each other, though.  It's about their relationships (or lack thereof) with men, with Hannah married to a successful accountant played by Michael Caine, a man so consumed with love for both Hannah and Lee that he's an absolute wreck.  Another wreck is Mickey, played by Allen, who is a cousin to his Manhattan character, a TV producer whose hypochondria leads to a grim outlook on life.  The film spends less time with Woody, whose character was once married to Hannah, and appropriately so. Because of this, the film was a bigger hit outside New York and L.A. than his other movies.  It's also a lighter version of many of the themes he explored in Interiors, and not just because of the three sisters.  The relationship between Maureen O'Sullivan and Lloyd Nolan (who not surprisingly play the Hannah and her sisters' parents), despite little screen time, is just as moving as the parents were in Interiors. This is also the first film to introduce an all-star cast outside of his usual stock actors--Farrow, Tony Roberts, etc.  Definitely up there with Annie Hall, Manhattan and Purple Rose of Cairo in my book.",

Yes, it's very Woody Allen. Michael Caine, Mia Farrow, Dianne Wiest and Barbara Hershey are terrific. Watch out for Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, John Torturro and Richard Jenkins in noticeable small roles. There are plenty of ickyness and awkwardness but they all contribute to the amusement. Like Allen's other movies, there's also some interesting philosophy thrown into it.

You learn alot about everyone involved so you learn to understand why these people make certain decisions. These characters are also very interesting and likeable so you want to learn more about them. The story is simple enough. It's about a woman named Hannah(played by Mia Farrow), who has taken care of her family(both mentally and financially) through her life as an actress. Her others sisters are still trying to \"find\" themselves. Everyone expects the best from Hannah, even Hannah herself, though sometimes that doesn't always happen. Oddly enough, Woody becomes a side character in this film. He plays Hannah's ex-husband who is a big TV writer and who is trying to understand life, AND death. Barbara Hershey and Dianne Weist play Hannah's sisters and what sisters they are. Hershey is in a relationship with a brilliant artist and teacher who is suffocating her. He is twice her age and likes to stay secluded. He has ended up using her as his link to the outside world. Weist is the drug/booze loving party sister who is getting older but not wanting to face the music. She tries to find her niche in the world and always seems to fall flat. Problem seems she isn't really trying very hard. Her part is the most crazy and exciting in the film, and she runs with it. It's little wonder why she got the Oscar. Michael Caine plays Hannah's husband. He feels shut out because Hannah is trying to help out everyone in her life. Unfortunately she needs to start working on her marriage. He and Hershey, feeling much the same in their relationships, seek comfort in each other. Caine is great in his part. He plays the role in a way that the viewer doesn't become judgmental, but understanding of his character. He also deserved his Oscar.Not only is the storyline fantastic but the cinematography is as well. This film is a treat all round. It should have won the Oscar for Best Picture!

            "content": "\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" brings us the story of three sisters, close, but with very different characters. Hannah is a talented actress, who leaves her career to devote herself to the family. Meanwhile, her husband, Elliot, is having an affair with her youngest sister, Lee, while her ex-husband, a television comedy producer, and heavy hypochondriac, ends up with her other sister, Holly, who leads a bohemian life and is trying to make it as an actress.Woody Allen took real people and real relationships from his own life and dramatized and caricatured them into a film nominated for seven Oscars that everyone can relate to. The backbone of the story is three family Thanksgivings, inspired by Bergman's film \"Fanny and Alexander\". The first gathering takes place before the plot and introduces us to the characters, the second occurs during the climax of the story, and the third after the denouement. The story is somewhat over-the-top, but it is essentially very realistic and life-like and represents an excellent study of various characters, who, if we honestly look at ourselves and the world around us, are not as eccentric and caricatured as they seem at first glance.\"God, she's beautiful. She's got the prettiest eyes. She looks so sexy in that sweater. I just want to be alone with her and hold her and kiss her and tell her how much I love her and take care of her. Stop it, you idiot, she's your wife's sister. But I can't help it. I'm consumed by her. It's been months now. I dream about her, I - I - I think about her at the office. Oh, Lee, what am I gonna do? I hear myself moaning over you and it's disgusting. Before, when she squeezed past me at the doorway and I smelt that perfume on the back of her neck - Jesus, I - I thought I was gonna swoon. Easy! You're a dignified financial advisor. It doesn't look good for you to swoon.\"Mia Farrow plays Hannah, a stable, capable woman who is always there for everyone and asks for nothing in return. She financially and sisterly supports her unstable and vice-prone sister Holly, masterfully played by Dianne Wiest, who deservedly won an Oscar for supporting actress. Michael Caine is Hannah's husband Elliot, a successful financial advisor who is secretly in love with her youngest sister, played by the captivating Barbara Hershey. His character is in the spotlight and the best developed, and his portrayal of moral and emotional turmoil (through which, I believe, every man with a bit of life experience has gone through at least once) won him an Oscar for a supporting male role. Hanna's hypochondriac ex-husband is played by Woody Allen himself. \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" was his most profitable film up to that point and brought him an Oscar for best screenplay and a nomination for directing.The story from the head of Woody Allen, which is brought to life by such a strong first cast, is in my opinion a must-watch for every film buff. Especially when you consider that the top five are supported by names like Carrie Fisher, Maureen O'Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan, John Turturro, and Max Von Sydow.8/10.",

Maybe Farrow isn't that hot in this movie because the script was hitting too close to home? I don't know. (In the movie Hannah (Farrow) gets upset over a script that hits too close to home. Hmm.). Having some of Farrow's real life children pop-up also caused me little discomfort. \"Hannah and His Sisters\" falls into the category of over-praised Woody Allen.

The scene where Micky (Woody's character) ends up in a movie house watching the Marx Brothers and realising the value of life has been an enduring memory of this film for me, although thankfully I do not suffer from the depressions and doubts of the neurotic Micky. His hypochondria (which to some extent I do share) is hilarious.This is a charming, funny, deep and entertaining film.  Do see it.",

            "content": "Hannah And Her Sisters is one of the best things Woody Allen has ever done as a writer-director, even if his own role in it as actor is rather more subsidiary than usual. In a cast of remarkable distinction the outstanding contributions come from Michael Caine, absolutely superb as a man who lusts after his wife's sister, and Diane Weist who is wonderfully convincing as a different sister whose entire life is going nowhere. It is no surprise that both Caine and Weist picked up supporting actor and actress Oscars for their work here. Nor is it a surprise that Allen's poignant script earned him an Oscar too.In Manhattan one Thanksgiving, Hannah (Mia Farrow) throws a party for her family and friends. Hannah's husband, an agent named Elliot (Michael Caine), is particularly flustered during the party because he finds himself in the company of Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey). Elliot has found himself increasingly infatuated with Lee, with her beauty and vivacity, and is very confused about which sister he desires the most. Lee, meanwhile, is in a complicated relationship with a talented but very moody painter called Frederick (Max Von Sydow). A third sister, the neurotic Holly (Diane Weist), aspires to get a career in the performing arts and whilst waiting for her breakthrough keeps herself busy running a catering firm with her friend April (Carrie Fisher). This complicated sexual and emotional tapestry unfolds over the next two years, with each character experiencing various romances, anxieties, successes and failures during that time. Running parallel with their story is the story of TV host Mickey Sachs (Woody Allen), former husband of Hannah, who may or may not have a brain tumour and is fearfully awaiting an official diagnosis of his condition.Hannah And Her Sisters is great fun, in spite of its shapeless nature. It's especially delightful to come across a film in which the comedy is very real and very sophisticated \u0096 no toilet humour here, nor over-the-top set pieces and contrived gags. This is painful, honest comedy \u0096 \"the comedy of true life\", where unpredictable situations and unanticipated emotions can throw up ironic quirks of fate at any given moment. The performances are note-perfect throughout, with Caine and Weist the stand-outs as already mentioned, though everyone deserves their share of praise. Allen achieves a remarkable combination of tones in the film, without ever losing his focus or muddling his intentions. The film flits from melancholy to triumph, from the immediacy of sexual lust to the pain of sexual guilt, from fear of what the unknown future may hold to humorous reflections on ironies of the past. It is unusual for Allen to stretch his story over so wide a canvas (he normally goes for the sharper, more intimate character studies) yet he hits his targets every time, barely putting a foot wrong as his fascinating exploration of these characters unfolds.",

            "review_title": "A Startling Character Study",
            "content": "Life is one giant human comedy, and Woody Allen understands, and portrays, this fact better than any living American director. I prefer him when he's trying to make a comedy comedy (\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\", \"Sleeper\"), but there's no denying just how proficient of a writer, of a director he is when it comes to studying the complex relationships between lovers, friends, family. \"Annie Hall\" remains immortally wise, \"Manhattan\" blindsidingly poignant. He hit his stride during his professional (and personal) relationship with Mia Farrow (lasting in the movies from 1982-1992), \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" acting as the era defining tour-de-force that broadened his horizons as a writer as mischievously observant as his idol, Ingmar Bergman.Told in three stretches over a two-year period, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" begins during Thanksgiving and ends during Thanksgiving, both dinners held at Hannah (Farrow) and her husband, Elliot's (Michael Caine), impressive New York apartment. Acting as a plot device in similar spirit to the Cookie of \"Cookie's Fortune\" or the Alex of \"The Big Chill\", the interweaving stories, in some shape or form, connect to the perpetually frazzled blonde.As the film opens, Hannah, along with her sisters, are facing particularly difficult periods in their lives. Normally happily married, Hannah and Elliot's union begins to hit turbulence when Elliot suddenly finds himself obsessed with his wife's earthy sibling, Lee (Barbara), with whom he begins having an affair. The neurotic Lee, in turn, is currently living with a much older, antisocial artist (Max Von Sydow) she no longer finds physically or mentally arousing. While Lee's guilt thickens, Hannah, in the meantime, is forced to act as the emotional net for her basket case sister Holly (Dianne Wiest), an ex-cocaine addict who jumps from career to career while attempting to also make it as a Broadway actress. Her failed jabs at a normal life eventually settle, however, when she begins dating Mickey (Woody Allen), Hannah's hypochondriac ex-husband.\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" kicks off as warm as any one of Allen's other comedies, but as its observational progression toward character study oblivion becomes more apparent, the film turns voyeuristic \u2014 it's as though we're a fly on the wall, catching glimpses of these imperfect people at their most imperfect times. Notice how the vulnerabilities of the characters never lose their prominence even when they're putting on friendly fa\u00e7ades for strangers, how Allen draws such subtly profound characterizations that it becomes increasingly effortless to understand these people so well it's as though we've known them since they were children. Long after \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" closes does one begin to realize just how masterful of a writer Allen is; he can cover up his genius with his neuroses all he wants, but to make a cast of characters feel so multidimensional in the scope of a single film is an astonishingly difficult task \u2014 for Allen, it's duck soup. He's the perceptive one in the room.It's as if he's known people like these before. Hannah is the kindhearted success story whose need to nurture sometimes hinders her own personal growth; Lee is the intellectual who doesn't quite know where to focus her potential. Holly is the type that fantasizes about what her life could be like rather than trying to make much needed changes; Mickey closes himself off in a bubble of fear because he doesn't want to admit that a mundane life is something okay to live. Perfectly cast, the ensemble feels like one large extension of Allen's consciousness.\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a saga of failed attempts at moviedom happiness, combining comedy and heartfelt drama with startling pathos. The characters here aren't merely characters but people, people with ticks, little confidence, doubts. How Allen so successfully pens them all I can hardly understand \u2014 just let the film do the talking instead of me.",

            "content": "**SPOILERS** (if there is such a thing for a Woody Allen movie) I recently rented Hannah and Her Sisters, not having seen it in ten or so years. And in and of itself the movie is perfectly fine, with some pleasant and amusing moments, and some other interesting insights into relationships. What I felt was missing was Woody's sense of righteous indignation, which for better or worse, tends to frame and define his films. It struck me as inconsistent with his larger body of work that the immoral acts in this film are not punished, but seemingly celebrated. Michael Caine has an affair with his wife's sister and after a moment of self doubt returns to his wife, who never learns of the year long indiscretion. Barbara Hershey is racked with some guilt, but similarly never has to deal with any of the consequences of her actions. Absent is the sense of betrayal or wrongdoing. Rather, both move on and happily find themselves in much better relationships than when the film began. If anything the film seems to be saying its good to go ahead and behave reckless because you come out ahead in the end. The Woody Allen character is an unrepentant television producer who seems to embody many of the offensive characteristics of the various TV producers in his other films . However these producers tend to be either viewed as shallow (Alan Alda in Crimes and Misdemeanors, or Cybil Sheppard in Alice) or regretted their occupation (as does Woody's character in Manhattan). Here Woody is admittedly neurotic and questions the fruits of his labor, but learns that life is too short to really worry about such matters, and probably returns to television to produce his new wife's scripts. And so essentially the point of my rambling is that there does not seem to be any commentary on the actions of the characters in the film.  Everyone emerges okay and better in the end: philosophically, financially, and romantically. Now I'm not saying that all of his films have to be miserable and depressing. But his films since Annie Hall have tended to be either profound, pseudo-comedic studies of contemporary relationships (Manhattan, Crimes & Misdemeanors, Husbands and Wives) or nostalgic, bitter sweet period comedies (Broadway Danny Rose, Radio Days, Sweet and Lowdown). Stylistically, Hannah and Her Sisters fits into the first category, but lacks the depth or the honesty that those films possess. In the end I felt that this was really one of Woody's more shallow films, in spite of its serious, Bergman inspired tone. Not really a bad movie per se, but I guess that I've come to expect more from him.",

            "content": "In my mind, Hannah and Her Sisters will always be Woody Allen's best work, but considering that I have only seen three of his films, it doesn't really matter what I say. The film is far more superior to Allen's claim-to-fame charmer, Annie Hall because of the multiple love triangles and the complicated emotions hidden beneath. While Annie Hall will always be a story about those two hopeless neurotics whose relationship was not meant to be, Hannah and Her Sisters is about fixing relationships and developing new ones that make the world a better place.The film spans two years into the lives of three sisters in New York: Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey), and Holly (Dianne Weist) are sisters. Hannah, the perfect actress sister who keeps the family together as she prepares the Thanksgiving dinner is married to Elliot (Michael Caine) who is hopelessly in love with Lee, who is living with Frederick (Max von Sydow). Hannah was once married to Mickey Sachs (Woody Allen) is a television producer and hypochondriac who go to the doctor almost daily. Holly meets Mickey after difficulties of finding what she wants to do in her life, and despite their differences, they are quite similar.One the things that made this film stand out was Michael Caine's character, Elliot. He is involved with his wife's sister, who is also quite fond of him, but probably doesn't have the same exact feelings as he does for him. Their relationship is unpredictable as Elliot finds out that he actually does admire his perfect wife Hannah very much. He knows he is in much more trouble as Lee decides to leave Frederick.Dianne Weist is really good here as Holly. Despite being quite unlikable, her relationship with Mickey rings true. Their relationship almost reminds me of the relationship between Alvy Singer and Annie Hall \u0096 just that Holly isn't ditzy. I think what draws them together is that they don't know exactly what they want to do in life. As Holly changes professions, Mickey changes religions (one of the highlight moments for me in the film).Overall, Hannah and Her Sisters is a likable and almost feels like a novel, with black screens with quotations and chapter introductions. I liked how Allen makes a film seems different by creating that sort of tidbits. The film ends happily on the last Thanksgiving, as everything begins to sort out and everyone seems to finally find a place in the world.",

The story was stale and the dialogue was painful to listen to.\n\tThe story made leaps and bounds from one unimportant moment to another, and it made no smooth transition between scenes.  An annoying title card was shown before the start of each scene, because the writers couldn't think of a better way to tie the movie together then stopping the movie, showing a black and white text, and then clumsily restarting the movie.

The many comments preceding have covered all aspects, so I would add my thorough enjoyment of it as one of his best.The characters - an impressive, talented ensemble, all are excellent, and the New York locales - exterior and interior - add positively to the story. Woody's total range of neuroses, always witty, incisive and humorous are present, and the emotional interaction among the characters is like a game of relationship-musical chairs.Allen also displays his genius for presenting various dimensions to the characters - and he juxtaposes humor with the more serious/sharper characteristics better than anyone else. And he does this without ever diminishing their reality, or one aspect detracting from the other.Among all the fine performances, I particularly enjoyed Michael Caine, who was superb in this role.All of Woody Allen's films are the type you enjoy seeing anew, and this one is certainly no exception.",

It's a good fan for Woody neophytes to start with, since it has a little bit of everything: Woody's traditional neurosis, laugh-out-loud lines, memorable characters. The intertwining stories are all either hilarious, moving, or both. One of Woody's greatest traits as a filmmaker -- incorporating a terrific and varied ensemble cast -- is evident here. Dianne Wiest fully deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of the whacked-out Holly, Woody is, as always, brilliant as a (what else) neurotic. Max Von Sydow is -- of all things -- hilarious as Hannah's grumpy boyfriend. Sam Waterston, Carrie Fisher, Michael Caine (another Oscar winner here) and well, the whole damn cast are terrific in this warm, funny, typically Woody Allen movie. Highly recommended.",

Allen seems to be celebrating marriage, parenthood and in particular, paying tribute to his then partner Mia Farrow. There is an interesting cameo by Maureen O'Sullivan, Farrow's mother, playing  her dypso-, nympho-, aging actress mother. Max von Sydow plays the gloomy character that has long been his specialty in Bergmann films. In English there seems to be a certain humour in his gloominess. Maybe there is humour in Bergman's films that is not obvious given that they are in Swedish. The only disappointing role is Michael Caine's. Sadly, delivering Woody Allen's lines with a Cockney accent just does not seem to work.",

One of his great talents has always been the ability to take characters who on the face of it we may have nothing in common with, and use them to illustrate universal truths.  As the title suggests this a film that focuses on Hannah, her two sisters and the web of relationships that radiate from them. Woody Allen introduces character after character, each of them deeply confused about something, and invites us to sit back and watch them attempt to make some sense out of their lives. The results, as you might expect, are sometimes hilarious, sometimes moving but always enlightening and believable.The only problem that I have with this film is Michael Caine. I am a huge Caine fan but I found him to be oddly out of place in this film. I found him unbelievable as a financial advisor moving in the upper echelons of Manhattan life and felt that his role could have been better filled by one of Woody Allen's many actor friends. But that is a small criticism, as I said before, if you are a Woody Allen fan, this is one to savor.",

            "content": "This movie that was written, directed, and produced by woody Allen and  was boring to say the least. Though it was interesting the way he pulled all the stories together it still it tended to drag and was quite depressing. This is a movie about tree sisters and their relationships with each other and with other men. In this story there is a lot of betrayal starting with Hannah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband and progressing to Hannah sister and this whole time Hannah is the one being betrayed. In this story Hannah is with out a doubt the victim she is always giving and being taken form.Woody Allen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humor in this movie is a very dry wit and is hard for a younger aged person to under stand. This movie opens at a huge thanksgiving feast with the thoughts of Hannah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband he is thinking about Hannah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister and how wonderful she is and how good she smells this tells the viewer off hand that this movie is going to be presented in third person omniscient. This is an interesting selection for the writer to use that form of story telling but because it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used very often that makes this movie unique. After the thanks giving scene the viewer is introduced to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hemophiliac\u00e2\u0080\u009d he is a weasely looking man with a squeaky voice that gets very annoying he is worried about hearing loss and by this point the audience wishes they had the same problem. The doctor asks him to go to the hospital for more tests and the hemophiliac gets scared and starts to ask questions about why and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong the doctor reassures his patient and the scene ends. The next scene is the hemophiliac at the pay phone calling another doctor asking what his symptoms could be a sign of he is told eventually that it could though unlikely be a brain tumor. This seems to be woody Allen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stab at comedy but he fails miserably as there is not a laugh from anyone in the room.This movie was a complete waist of time. Though I have heard his older stuff id better this movie has not impressed me in the least. I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 because at least the stage hands and lighting crew did a good job.",

And I can confidently say: It will be my last! This is a film that takes place over a three-year period beginning with Thanksgiving, and the ending scene likewise. In the Beginning of this movie we see a man (Hannah's husband) looking, actually starring, at a woman, who come to find out is Hannah's sister. And not to mention Hannah is this mans wife. So yes you guessed it, Hannah's husband is undoubtedly having, and has had for a while now, passionate feelings about his wives sister. For the most part, this whole movie is centered on betrayal. \tWoody Allen, who is Hannah's ex-wife, and is a diagnosed Hypochondriac. He actually seemed like more of an ADD patient to me, seeing as how he was incredibly annoying! His sense of humor was absolutely a dry wit that only 40-year-old men think is funny and humorous to the least bit. He is constantly making child like comments, trying desperately to be funny, however he fails time and time again. Throughout the movie Allen tries to go to different doctors to heal his of being hypochondriac and seeking to discover any signs that could possibly reveal to him if the diagnose for Hypochondriac are accurate. Well, they apparently are because the entire movie all he does is worry about anything and everything. He even tried about 5 different religions and seeks higher powers, because he feels he needs something to search for. \tTowards the end of the film, Woody falls in love with Hannah's little sister, and crazy sister might I add, Lee. The two fall in love, and apparently are happy. \tThis whole movie is about un-content husbands, sister, and friends. Everyone does things and makes their choices in this film based on their own selfishness, and unsatisfaction of life. I don't want to spoil the end of the film for you, but I also don't recommend wasting your time watching it either. This movie is totally rated a 1 (1 being the lowest) for its dry humor, and lack of moral. If you enjoy getting your entertainment from betrayal than by all means watch this film. It will not leave you disappointed!",

The way he probes eternal themes like understanding your heart and seeking elusive happiness despite immense material comforts is hard-won brilliance- and finally, his religious skepticism and questioning with the final \"wonder bread\" prop during his experiments with Christianity is absolutely hysterical.Allen makes a film a year, and largely- lately- it's always hit or miss. But Woody sure hit the ball outta the park with this one. 10/10, Grade A, Don't Miss It! Barbara Hershey should have been dominated for an Oscar. She deserved it much more than Wiest or Caine.",

To me, he's somewhat out of step with the others. He just doesn't wear his neurosis well. All the others do. I fail to see what about him would appeal to his wife's sister. (2) The ending. It feels a bit too warm and fuzzy in light of everything that's gone before. That marriage and parenthood would suddenly smooth two very rough-edged characters seems unlikely. And one of the main story lines concerns the fact that Mickey is unable to father children. Doesn't make sense. Regardless, I still come away from this film totally enchanted.",

It also tells of an eccentric hypochondriac named Mickey (played by director and writer, Woody Allen) and his journey in finding the meaning of life, who is actually a former husband of the oldest sister, Hannah.This film was wonderfully done.  Woody Allen makes the audience believe that they are in the movie, playing along with these characters.  He hired a fantastic cast to portray his characters and put them in a very realistic setting, and everything was able to fit into the Thanksgiving sequences with the sisters' family, which to this reviewer suggested a place of belonging since the love lives of the main characters seem to be in a downfall.It was almost as if the actors were candidly filmed, the film was all shot in New York, and the acting was done so incredibly well that it was almost like real life.

He clearly displays an empathy and an understanding for family drama, neurosis, and despair in this film. His observations on the Upper Crust of NYC are still fresh and wonderful. Besides that, he gets terrific help from his cast of actors, showcasing Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest at their peak of form. However, you can't forget Mia Farrow as Hannah herself and Allen as the typical suicidal hypochondriac New Yorker with a sense of existential dismay over the world. The film is an expansion of Allen's art, encompassing more than just his character, but expanding to include other characters, separating this movie from his previous classics and broadening his film canvas as an artist.",

Hannah is one of his best, seamless continuity; clever flashbacks & great performances. As always, the music separates and binds. It was a device I particularly noticed in \"Casablanca\"- that clever use of music to separate the scenes. The casting is flawless, even Michael Caine, the personification of one dimensionality, here, cleverly (and one wonders whether Caine realised this)used by Allen to portray a crashing bore. Caine is at his best as an East End London thug (brilliant & menacing in Mona Lisa). But Allen uses that dead pan voice, like Harold Steptoe from Steptoe & Son, the British comedy serial,to great effect. The problem, of course, is that his scenes slow down a film that thrives on its clever editing. But there is always the fast-forward button! Max von Sydow, as always turns in a riveting cameo performance. Here is the antithesis of Caine - a multi-faceted actor, who can act. (See him as the menacing, efficient contract hit man in Three days of the Condor & flash back to the idealist knight in The Seventh Seal). The casting of the women is uniformly brilliant, conveying the whole range of anxieties; love; pain; loss etc. There is no one who can portray a hypochondriac like Allen and here is the core of the film; the centre around which the lives of the sisters revolve. And the music. the collaboration between Dick Hyman & Woody Allen is one of the most felicitous on screen. Too often, especially in American films, music is overused, often drowning the dialogue & distorting the story - invariably far too loud. This is wonderful cinema.",

A group of top performers (as usual in Allen's works, and including regulars Farrow and Weist) portray some believable, genuinely alive characters suffering typical Allen problems - lust, infidelity, fecklessness - in a gently funny, intriguing and often truly heart-warming piece that really gets under your skin.

The cheap jokes, the lustful desires of Elliot and the hypochondriac (Woody Allen)made the movie kind of weird, but interesting to watch and entertaining in some ways. The movie is about three women who are sisters trying to have successful love lifes.  Hannah (Mia Farrow) was once married to the infertile Mickey,but then was divorced and Hannah got together with Elliot.  The first scene of the movie shows Elliot lusting after Leigh, Hannah's sister, who is in a relationship with another man.  Leigh and Hannah's sister Holly is a former drug abuser who claims that she has been sober for a while now, although you wonder if that is really the truth.  Elliot and Leigh have an affair and leigh's boyfriend finds out, but somehow Hannah never does.  The affair is ended so Elliot doesn't jeopardize his marrage with Hannah.  Somehow Mickey and Holly are set up on a date where at first they have a horrible time, not connecting in anyway, but later the two get married and Holly becomes pregnant, making you wonder since Mickey was infertile when he was married to Hannah.  Was it because Holly was his true love?  Who knows.  The movie has three Thanksgiving day scenes. It's interesting that the movie only focuses on the Thanksgiving holiday, even though the movie's plot goes through three years.  I think it was supposed to signal that the movie shows how one should be thankful for the relationships they have, although it is never made quite clear.  The best part of the movie was when Mickey thought he had a brain tumor all because he was losing his hearing.  He made a huge deal about it and it turned out to be nothing.  His character was very unique.  Even though with all the twists and turns and multiple stories that this movie contains, it was worth watching it to some extent as in seeing it once is sufficient.",

At the first dinner, there is a lot of tension between the family members. The second dinner is kind of  defining moment for many of the family members as it seems at this movie they realize mistakes that they have made and try to correct them. At the final dinner, everyone is surprisingly happy with outcomes of their lives. It seems like it is a heavy subject and would be a serious movie, but actually the opposite is true. The movie has several hilarious moments that not only make it interesting to watch but also lightens what would otherwise be a more serious story.\nThe story begins with a big Thanksgiving diner at Hannah's House.  The whole family' s there and is having a good time.  Hannah (Mia Farow) has been married to her second husband Eliot (Michael cane) for about 4 years. Elliot Slowly falls in love with Hannah's sister Lee (Barbara Hershey).  Around the same time,  Mickey (Woody Allen), Hannah's ex-husband who is somewhat of a hypochondriac, thinks he is going deaf. He seeks the opinion of specialists and son he has himself convinced that he has a brain tumor and is not expected to live much longer. Previously, Hannah had introduced him to her sister, Holly (Dianne Weist) . Not only did they not hit it off, but it appeared that they almost despised one another as their styles and interests were so different. An interesting twist in the story is that after Mickey and Holly both come to terms with their struggles, they rediscover each other and eventually marry.  Elliott eventually acts on his decision to pursue Lee. They become involved in an affair, however Elliot has a difficult time leaving Hannah and eventually he realizes he really does love her. The family is entered around Mom & Dad, played by Maureen O'Hara and Lloyd Nolan,  They are an older  show-business couple who have spent many years arguing about  his cheating with other women and her drinking too much. While they are not in many scenes, their overall role in the story is important because it shapes and defines the type of person that each of the daughters has turned out to be. Woody Allen plays the part of Mickey so well, that you easily forget that he really is a talented actor. He makes comedy seem easy as it appears that he does not put a whole lot of effort into his depiction of his character. Mia Farrow, Dianne Weist and Barbara Hershey, play such different yet believable sisters. Mia lays the successful, dutiful Hannah, who is probably in her middle ages Dianne plays the insecure always searching for herself Holly and Barbara Hershey plays Lee who starts out the movie in a do-dependent relationship with he boyfriend Frederick. Michael Caine adds a lot to the movie in his role as Elliot, a man who is in love with his wife and in lust with is wife's sister. It is funny to watch him as he justifies his relationship with Lee and sets himself up for `chance' meetings with her.I would definitely give this movie a four out of five star rating for the simple fact that it is funny and is easy to watch. there are no heavy lessons t be interpreted or learned. It is just a movie that entertains the viewer and is easy to understand.",

            "content": "\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is quite possibly Woody's best film, certainly his most accessible, and arguably one of the ten best films of the 1980's. With an ensemble cast and multiple story lines interwoven and interrelated, Allen tells a wonderfully rich, and often times hilarious, human story; several, actually. Though some might make the case for this film being a drama, the true comedic element always finds its way to the surface, even during scenes of great dramatic tension. It's a testament to the talent of Woody and his cast that all the other characters, whose stories are so ostensibly dramatic, have instances where they're as funny as Woody's character, if not more so. The awkward bumbling of Elliot, the immature hostility of Holly and the existential plight of Mickey Sacchs all contribute, within the confines of their solemnity, to some of the funniest moments in any Woody Allen movie. Not to mention the interaction between Dusty and Frederick, which is probably the most jocularly gratifying scene in this or any Allen film. \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" has something for everyone, even those not familiar with or partial to the majority of Woody's work. It's funny, tumultuous and it has a happy ending, which feels less like a contrivance and more like a miracle.",

Who could forget Barbera Hershy and Micheal Cain meeting secretly at the Strand bookstore (was that it?) and Diane Weist snorting coke at the Punk Rock concert? I love also Woody's life - affirming moment at a random showing of \"Duck Soup.\" Classic!    And just one more thing ...when I saw this movie in 1986 the first time Woody Allen ( as the Hypocondriac ) appeared on the screen the audience began to applaud. It was amazing ....and this was a Multiplex in Long Island. Boy have things changed....has anyone even seen \"Anything Else?\" In any case I agree \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" should be on the IMBD top 250, perhaps even the top 100.

How could such a great director produce a bad movie. The Word breaks make it confusing because some of the phrases don't even have anything to do with that section of the movie. Ok, the movie is obviously about Hannah and her sisters, without knowing that (because of the title) it was hard to tell what the movie or who the movie was about. Could it be Hannah (Mia Ferro), Mickey (Allen), it's hard. There was a rather interesting sceen back in the 1960's the clothing in the movie was very dull, nothing bright. Hannah (Ferro) and her sister Holly (Dianne Wiest)walk into a clothing store and all's there was is bright colored clothing. The location for the movie seemed to be rundown and dosen't fit the time period. The music was really weird, it didn't fit the movie. There was no special effects in the movie, maybe if there was some it might have been better. Ok, the movie was interesting other then the fact that it was confusing and a little dull, but i still can't see how it won acadamy awards. Can you?",

The film, which Allen also scripted, is essentially divided into separate stories, all of which relate to each other on dfferent levels. Lee (Barbara Hershey) is the object of desire for Elliot (Michael Caine, who is delicious in his Academy Award-winning role), who is married to Lee's sister Hannah (Mia Farrow), whose ex-husband is Mickey (Allen, who is a riot as a neurotic, over-the-top hypochondriac), who endures a \"date\" with Lee and Hannah's equally neurotic and over-the-top sister, Holly (effulgently played by Dianne Wiest, who also netted an Oscar).  The majority of Allen's films have the same 'formula' of painting seemingly normal New Yorkers with a certain air of uptight intellect, but his characters are all so diverse, that its like seeing something new and original every time (that's presumably why this one also won the Original Screenplay Oscar).  A gem of a movie, with striking adult situations, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a still-life come alive. Co-starring Carrie Fisher, Sam Waterston, Lloyd Nolan, Maureen O'Sullivan and Julie Kavner.

Snobbery in general is a problematic trait, but it is particularly detestable in a writer or a movie director.  If you are in a bar and the person next to you starts going off about the territorial architecture in Cote d'Azur, hors d'oeuvres, and life on the Upper East Side, you can just take your drink and move to another seat -- if he happens to make movies, you pay 9 bucks apiece to see and hear him pontificate.All of Woody Allen's movies take place in Pleasantville, where the Earth is flat, and roads do not travel beyond a couple of Manhattan neighborhoods. His fake, repressed characters fall in love while lecturing each other on fine art and poetry, and never -- I mean never -- venture in that mysterious nether universe that lies below Canal Street.  I'd shoot myself if I lived among them!  Not only that, but you also need a degree in Classics or Art History to appreciate Woody Allen's humor, which is generally flat and at its best, only mildly funny.  A Woody Allen movie is not social commentary -- it is a social statement -- as is being a Woody Allen fan.But what of that?  The author of this comment grew up in Brooklyn and moved to New Jersey.  In Woody Allen's world, it is a Manhattan address (preferably an Upper East Side address) that denotes intellect, sensitivity, depth of the soul, and artistic genius. No person who picks up the phone is possessed of a spirit passionate, energetic, and creative, unless you had to dial \"212\" before the number.  In light of that, I guess the reason I don't like Woody Allen's movies is that I am just too crude.What a difference local geography makes.",

But even though his Manhattan isn't terribly realistic, it in no way takes away from the insight Allen offers into the more selfish side of human behavior.  \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a terrific, well-acted and bittersweet film.  Beautifully shot by Carlo Di Palma, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a perfect blend of both Allen's comedic and dramatic sides.

With the 1986 release of Hannah and Her Sisters, he did.The films plot is focused around three sisters.  Lee (Barbra Hushey)is the oldest, Hannah (Mia Farrow) is in the middle, and Holly (Diane Weist) is the youngest.  Hannah is married to Elliot. (Michael Caine)Elliot is slowly falling in love with Lee, but he does not know how to confront her with out upsetting Hannah.  Holly is trying to write a screenplay and act in plays but she got's shot down at every chance she gets.  Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen) is a hypochondriac looking for an answer to all the questions in life.Some of the most brilliant moments in Hannah and Her Sisters comes from Mickey as he tries to convert to a religion that has some meaning to it. First he tries, for about a month, to become a catholic.  He does everything.  Buys crosses, goes to church, reads the bible.  He really can't get into it so he soons quits being a catholic and tries to become a Harry Krishna, but he quits that after realizing what he would look like bald.The acting is perfect, with the exception of Mia Farrow, which is not bad, just mediocre. I love Michael Caine in this one.  You really believe that he has love for both these women and can't choose between the both of them. You can tell how frustrated he is by the tone of his voice.The script and the direction are top-notch.  It seems that they used zooming rather then dollying, which I'm not to big a fan of, but it definitely worked for this story and these people.Right. Great Movie. See it.",

            "content": "I have always adored Woody Allen's use of New York City in his films and it especially resonates with me today.  One of the best of the currently working directors, his films represent an understanding of relationship conflicts that few have had the courage to explore.  That being said \"Hannah and her Sisters\" is a mixed bag of the very best and worst of Woody. \nSpoilers Possible.The film starts out as his best ever and winds up with no conflict resolution and a most implausible conclusion between the Holly (Dianne West) and Mickey (Allen) characters.  It stands to reason that for all of her insecurities and impulses, Holly would never wind up betraying Hannah and getting away with it.  She would not feel comfortable to embark on a relationship with her sister's ex-husband, what self-respecting woman would? And yet in Woody's little world, this type of behavior is commonplace and almost normal (see tabloids on his real life for details.)  Perhaps it's because his real life is eerily similar to this film that it's almost impossible to separate the turn-off they each represent.That isn't to say that \"Hannah and her Sister's\" wasn't a success and truly one of Woody's most thought-out films.  Every character is memorable and Woody himself does the best work as a neurotic television guy who comes this close to joining the Krishna's and thinks he's dying of a brain tumor.  I loved the way that Woody's character Mickey was the odd-man out looking in on all of the action, despite the fact that he really didn't have the right to be a part of it anymore.  Michael Caine is also very deserving of his Oscar as Elliot and his love for Lee is endearing.  I also liked the way that the film ended without the typical conflict resolution, but this was also the film's downfall.  Not only does Hannah (Mia Farrow) never discover her current husband's affair, but we're left to assume that she's fully accepting of the marriage of Mickey and Holly?  Perhaps just one line of dialogue illustrating Hannah's feelings would have left me feeling less disappointed.  Despite the fact that she is the main character and her name is part of the film's title, Woody seems to leave Hannah out of everything.The film has good intentions but just can't seem to follow through with the ending.  It's aged a bit (how 1980's can Michael Caine's glasses get?), but it's still a great achievement.  An 'A' for effort and a 'B' for results.9/10",

Other actors are worthwhile of course, but lacking something I thought (a better script?).I found I could not become absorbed in the delicate relationship balance or unbalance. The film therefore dragged a little too much for me. The humour provided by Allen was needed, but a little below par for him I thought. but I liked the parents of the sisters probably the most.Not up there for me as a Woody Allen must see, I'm sorry to say.

The idea that the world still needed any convincing back in 1986 might seem ridiculous, but Allen hadn't been able to shake off the image of a clownster. When he attempted hard drama, critics reacted with discomfort across the board.Throughout the 80s, Allen toned it down on the autobiographical and farcical tendencies of his pictures, and more and more built his movies around fleshed out characters and plots that might seem meandering but were incredibly well constructed.By the time he made Hannah, Allen was a different filmmaker than he was in 1976. Allen wasn't the gifted comedy talent any longer, he was now a master filmmaker.Allen's direction here is masterful. There's a scene where the titular sisters are seated in a restaurant. The older sister is her usual strong self, another sister is filled with frustration, the third is keeping a dark secret. Allen records this moment by having the camera 'revolve' around the table, with the camera slightly panning in order to record the conversation.Another scene where Allen courts the sister of his ex-wife by reminding her that they had once gone through the worst date in his life. The entire scene is shot in one long take. Why mix it up when so much is already going on.Though his most traditional work, Allen isn't exactly committed to the rules of the game. His character one moment will be seen walking the streets, depressed. Next, we're watching one of his dates play out in a punk rock caf\u00e9. Allen's date is a coke-abusing punk type. Allen definitely isn't. Moments later we find the environment changed again, we're now witnessing Cole Porter perform. Now it's Allen enjoying himself and his date is the fish out of water. It's a three minute sequence, and he's set up the arch of two characters without us realizing it.These are great moments in a movie filled with great moments. But unlike Annie Hall, which had its own great scenes, Allen is here committed to a narrative and to characters. If Annie Hall was a stand up routine, this is a novel.Hannah is a marvelous movie. Ingeniously scripted, beautifully acted, written and shot. The music and editing are marvelous. It's a great achievement.",

This film, often regarded as one of his best among \"Annie Hall,\" \"Crimes and Misdimeanors\" and \"Manhatten,\" showcases that talent more so I think than any of his other films. It deals with the one of the most dysfunctional families ever portrayed on screen, all of whom have their own trials, tribulations and problems. The film inter-cuts between a few main plot lines involving all of these characters. Elliot (Micheal Caine, in one of the best roles of his career) finds himself in a love triangle with his wife Hannah (Mia Farrow) and her sister Lee (Barbra Hershey), whom he has lusted after for years. Hannah and Lee's sister Holly (Dianne Wiest, in one of her two Oscar winning performances in a Woody Allen film) Deals with life as the odd sister out, the one with less confidence and seemingly bad luck. Mickey (Woody once again entrancing himself into a deep neurotic mess) is Hannah's ex-husband, a hypochondriac who spends the movie trying to find meaning in his life and, in the movies funniest scenes, looking for answers about his own mortality. This is one of Woody's best films for many reasons. It's got excellent pacing, going through each of the family members stories seamlessly. It has deep, articulate characters brought to life by nothing but exceptional performances. But most of all it has a real heart at the center of it, a real deep love for family values (albiet warped family values) and of course the city of New York.

But what else could you expect from a brilliant, humanistic script and the surest direction Allen has provided (he guides the camera through scenes as though he's been studying with Scorsese). Terrific ensemble cast, especially Dianne Wiest, Michael Caine, Barbara Hershey, and even Max Von Sydow. I rate it 10.",

            "content": "\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" was definitely a movie worth watching.  The viewer might start out thinking that the movie was rather weird and was going to be stupid, but will end up enjoying it. In fact, when they think about it later they might realize that it was a great movie.  Rumor has it that Woody Allen has made some not so good movies.  But \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" isn't one of them.  Even the biggest Woody Allen hater would enjoy this movie.  The movie is about Hannah and her sisters, Holly and Lee.  It follows their lives over the period of 3 years.  Each year the whole family gets together for Thanksgiving.  There is love, adultery, humor, sorrow, fear, anger, and the list goes on and on.  \"Hannah and her Sisters\" is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again.Woody Allen is absolutely hilarious!!! He plays Mickey Sachs and is the primary source of entertainment throughout the whole movie.  He is constantly cracking funny lines that the viewer can't help but laugh at. There's a scene where Hannah and Mickey have just found out that Mickey can't have children and they are walking down the street.  Hannah says something like \"Could this be caused by something you've done, like excessive masturbation?\" Mickey then says something like \"Hey, would you quit knocking my hobbies!\" That is so funny! Not only does he crack lines like that, he worries constantly.  If one little thing goes wrong with him, like an earache, he freaks out and thinks the absolute worst!  It seems like his life is messed up.  He quits his job and goes out searching for a religion that he can believe in.  His family is Jewish and they aren't too happy about him looking into other religions.  While watching the movie, it can be expected that any scene with Mickey (Allen) in it will make the viewer laugh.The overall acting in the movie was very believable.  This movie was made in the 1980's, so typically the acting should be on the good side.  Mia Farrow (Hannah), Dianne Wiest (Holly), and Barbara Hershey (Lee) are all spectacular.  Their acting jobs really convince the audience that they are sisters.  They fight with each other, they love each other, and they just really act like sisters.  Hannah is the mature, nice one; Holly is the messed up one who just can't seem to get a man; and Lee is the young, pretty one.  All three of them together provides for some very interesting scenes.Woody Allen did something very different with this movie.  The movie is similar to a chapter book.  Each new scene and sometimes sets of scenes that are all similar, begins with a black screen and one line across the middle of it.  For example, one of the lines is \"Afternoons.\"  The scenes following all have something to do with the afternoons.  Sometimes the line is even said by an actor/actress in the scene.  Those lines act like the title of the chapter, which are the following scenes.  That whole idea makes the movie a lot more unique and it captures the viewer's attention in a very nice way.The music in \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" was a little on the unusual side.  It doesn't exactly have \"background\" music, like in the movies we make now-a-days.  There was a little of it here and there but it was sort of weird music.  Most of the music in the movie was music being made by a radio or a record that someone plays.  Every year at Thanksgiving Hannah, Holly, and Lee's dad plays the piano.  Basically, the music, most of the time, was stuff that was being done by something or somebody in the movie. \tThe clothing worn by the characters was very fitting for the time period. It was the 80's and they wore 80's clothes.  There weren't a lot of special effects.  In fact, there might not have been any at all!  \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" wasn't that kind of movie.  But hey, there doesn't have to be special effects for a movie to be great!\"Hannah and Her Sisters\" was a somewhat old movie that was well made and creatively made. It's no wonder that it won so many academy awards.  It is one of the best 80's movies ever made and it definitely deserves to be seen by many viewers.",

            "content": "Hannah and Her Sisters, started out with thanksgiving, and showing the lives of a certain family. You could tell that Woody Allen had written and produced this film. It was not a normally portrayed film, as Elliott, Hannah's husband was in love with her sister Lee. While Lee was dating Richard, now as the film proceeds on things become a little odder, Marty the hypochondriac that assumes there is always something wrong with him, and throughout the film family issues unravel with some very interesting results. This film was very enjoyable, it involved love, hate, betrayal and of course affairs. This film does not only keep you laughing with Woody Allen and his very entertaining character, but also with the thanksgiving holiday showing its self over and over again. Through the film, you see mainly what most Americans go through throughout the year, frustration, depression, trying to commit suicide. But they over come their problems and try to make the best of their lives knowing that no matter how hard it gets you'll always have your family. Now back to the film, there would be some ways that you may not like this film, that is only if you do not approve people falling for people that are in their own family. Also if they do not like the thought of someone trying to kill themselves. Last reason being the Woody Allen wrote and directed and played a part in this film. But there would be much more reasons why you would enjoy the film. It had humorous areas such as Marty trying to kill himself. He does not succeed just because he was perspiring so much that it slipped off his forehead. There is also more scenes that make you laugh, from comedy and just plan stupid parts. Well, enjoying the movie is just part of it you must think and feel what would happen after the last scene then you would get the finest aspects of the film.",

            "content": "Hannah and her sister is a movie centering around the lives of three women and the obstacles they come face to face with in their romantic relationships, within the time of three Thanksgiving over three years. Never seeing a Woody Allen film, I wasn't sure what to expect.  After watching the film, the results were very favorable. The film stars Michael Caine as Elliot and Mia Ferrow as Hannah  who are husband and wife in the film. The film starts out on Thanksgiving Day with Elliot (Caine) thinking about how beautiful his wife's sister Lee is, played by Barbara Hershey. As the film goes on, Elliot tells Lee how he really feels about her and that he loves her, which causes a huge conflict between Elliot and his wife.\nBeing that this film came out in 1986, its costumes are quite unique and hilarious which adds a touch to the film. The acting was excellent.  Michael Caine is a very good actor and he played his character well. I had never seen any of the other actors and actresses in films but I thought they were also good and played their characters very well especially Holly, one of Hannah's sisters (Dianne Wiest) who played a struggling actress and a coke addict which added a lot of flavor to the film. The movie was filmed in New York City which is typical Woody Allen and adds a lot of great scenery in almost all the scenes. Woody Allen played Hannah's ex-husband who a hypochondriac and also thinks something is wrong with him. When he thinks he's losing his hearing in one ear, he goes to the doctor to find out that he might have brain cancer. He totally freaks out and loses his faith in God. Allen then quits his job and starts searching for a religion. When he tells his parents that he was thinking about being Catholic they freak out because he was raised as a Jew which becomes very funny. This films uniqueness drew me in even more. I had never seen a film that every time it changed a scene it had some sort of comment before it started. Example (at the beginning of the scene where Allen thinks he going to die, the screen shows the word hypochondriac) this technique had me glued to the movie because I would wonder who's the hypochondriac. This film is very unique in a good way and in its own way. Woody Allen is a great Director and actor in the film, as well as all the other stars. The plot and the conflicts keep you on edge and are very realistic, and the wit keeps you laughing. This would be one movie to add to your home video library. I would rate this film a 9 out of 10.",

Certainly it's not a comedy that sets up punchlines; rather, it's amusing, sometimes uncomfortably so, to see people trip over their own feet, as Woody Allen's characters so often do. Others I know hate the high-brow conversations that Woody's characters have; \"No one talks like that!\" they sharply inform me. Maybe not. But those high-brow conversations are always masks for insecurity. In the end, these same characters spouting off about Mahler, Kirkegaard, Karl Marx, and architecture are the very ones cheating on their spouses, abusing drugs, and lying to everyone they care about. In Hannah and Her Sisters, Woody Allen explores this dichotomy and discovers something surprising: these people are redeemable. Dianne Wiest (sorry, I'm bad with character names) kicks her habit and finds her niche; Michael Caine realizes he did something wrong, puts a stop to it, and his family remains whole. Woody Allen learns to stop endlessly searching for meaning and just enjoy life. Redemption is one of life's greatest joys, and this film celebrates that fact.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", which begins as a tale of marital infidelity and general depression, ends on such a high note as this one. Well-acted and well-scripted, this movie has the hallmarks of an 80's-era Woody Allen film all over it (Allen as a neurotic worker in the entertainment business, a setting in New York City, an ensemble cast, etc.). The characters in this movie go through a very convincing plot arch, all concerning their various romantic entanglements.Elliot (Michael Caine) is the one who sets it off. He is married to the movie's titular Hannah, but his affections are directed elsewhere: at one of Hannah's two sisters, Lee (Barbara Hershey). Lee is already involved with another man, a moody artist named Frederick (Max von Sydow), but once Elliot makes his feelings for her known, she leaves Frederick and begins an affair with Elliot.The subplot of \"Hannah\" deals with Mickey Sachs, a hypochondriac TV producer and the ex-husband of Hannah. Mickey's hypochondria and general neurosis provide many of the films laughs, as well as its more emotional moments. Mickey's hypochondria turns out to be well-placed for once when he discovers that some symptoms he's had are indicative of a cancerous brain tumor. After a period of soul-searching, even contemplating suicide, Mickey finally has an epiphany: he's not dead yet. Why should he live like he is?This realization is at the crux of many of the films developments. Mickey's newfound will to live doesn't influence these events, but things all start to turn around at the same point. The affair between Elliot and Lee is growing more painful, and Lee begins to be drawn toward another man. Mickey starts dating Hannah's younger sister, Holly (Dianne West). With so many changes and such dire situations, it's hard to believe that anything will turn out right for anyone.But, incredibly (and more importantly, believably), it does. Mickey's relationship with Holly leads to marriage, and Holly's scriptwriting dreams are reaching fruition. Lee is happily attached to a new man, and Elliot has return to Hannah, realizing his love for her. What began as a fracturing family on a Thanksgiving two years earlier is now a stable one.Many argue that \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is Woody Allen's best film, and one of the best films of the 80's. Having seen it, it's a hard position to dispute. The movie is a tale of believable characters getting into believable bad situations and believably redeeming themselves; believability is at the core of this movie. Strongly reminiscent of a Seinfeld-esque sensibility (as Seinfeld was \"the show about nothing\") so do we delve into the minutiae of character's lives in this movie.Even though the film's happy ending was at the behest of a movie studio looking for a more uplifting movie, it is still powerful and entertaining. If Woody Allen could continue to direct and star in movies of this quality, he would have never reached Hollywood's B-list of performers.In the end, I'd rate this movie a 9 out of 10; great, but not perfect.",

            "content": "Welcome to the machine. The machine of where it has twists and turns. This I call life. In life people do odd things. Like say for example some people are neurotic; others maybe anal-retentive artists. Or possibly could be sleeping with there wife's sister. Not to mention the alcoholic mother. Sprinkle in a little bit of holiday festivities, and you have yourself the average New Yorker. All this and more you should expect from Woody Allen's flick HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.This movie is a semi-complicated film revolving around Hannah (Mia Farrow) and her sisters' life going the wrong direction. Not only them but also Hannah's ex-husband Mickey Sachs (Woody Allen) and husband Elliot (Michael Caine). Though the one thing that they revolve around is Thanksgiving.For a 1986 movie I found it quite interesting. There's nothing too spectacular on special effects (like most movies are focusing on today), and the plot comes rather dull. That's until it starts to unravel itself nicely to the audience some subtle comedic references. For example when Mickey Sachs tries to find a religion to believe in he brings home some items related to Catholicism. He is Jewish, so he brings some items home. Out of those items was a cross with Jesus on it, a Bible, and a picture of Jesus, Wonderbread, and Mayonnaise. The acting was well fit for each character. I never thought one seemed out of place. I especially liked Woody Allen's character of a neurotic New Yorker, which had a small pessimistic side to him. On another note I kind of found interesting was Woody Allen's use of the dialogue on all the characters interesting. Most noticeable was the thought lines, which I haven't seen been used in films for a while.Now people are going to want to know what I felt about the movie. Well, this is for them, but not before I tell them my style of movies. To me a good movie it has to have good storyline, and maybe sprinkle on some weirdness. I'm not one for a boring Hollywood movie. Though some I can stand. If a movie has good psychological quirkiness into the movie, I tend to get more amusement from it. From this movie it takes you on the underbelly of a group of people's lives and cuts them open to dissect. When you finish this film one must take a moment and admire Woody Allen for such an original story. I would recommend this to people that could understand the subtle details Woody Allen is known for. If people like this film they might find this Australian Independent flick LOVE SERENADE (Directed by Shirley Barrett) enjoyable as well.",

He\u00d5sat it again with Hannah and Her Sisters, using his same old tricksand treats. His tried and(somewhat) true tactics are put to useonce again with this outing. This movie is another textbook WoodyAllen piece with a very similar story line and characters. Aninteresting little movie indeed.Regardless of if you like Allen or not, you have to admit his writingis top notch. His characters are so engaging and his dialogueseems to flow out effortlessly. The situations he creates areunique and very entertaining. His comedy however, is very dry andrarely very humorous. I love dry humor as much as the nextperson, but it seems that Allen tries too hard to make \u00d2hilarious\u00d3observations. This movie feels like two different movies though.The only real parts with intended humor involve Allen, the rest ispretty dramatic. So Allen\u00d5s humor doesn\u00d5t really detract from themain flow of the movie.Another aspect of this film is the acting. MIchael Caine is good asa frustrated and confused husband and other cast members givethe film it\u00d5s realism. Although It would have been much better ifAllen was more a apart of the story. He seems to be an outsider tothe plot with his own situation. His comedic writing may be good,but his delivery could use some much needed work.  It\u00d5s nowonder why it won several Academy Awards for it\u00d5s acting andexecution, although Woody Allen is no Joe Piscopo.Woody Allen fans? This is the movie for you. Comedy fans?

The movie spans over a three-year period, beginning and ending with Thanksgiving.  An overall good movie, this is one to be recommended when all you want is a flick to watch. Although there is a moral to this movie, there are no hidden messages to try and figure out, just a straightforward enjoyable movie. \t        During the three-year span of the movie, the viewer meets three sisters, Hannah, Holly, Lee, and their family.  Throughout the movie, the viewer watches as the sisters deal with problems from everyday life; everything from cheating husbands, to unemployment, and even to trying to find a little romance.  To add the comic relief of the movie, not only as the director, but Woody Allan shines as the ex-husband of Hannah.  The viewer is allowed to watch as this hilarious hypochondriac deals with life after what he would perceive as a near death experience.          As a viewer, virgin to any Woody Allan film, I really enjoyed this movie.  In my opinion, there wasn't a bad scene in it.  I really liked how Thanksgiving was a repeated holiday; it was a big part of the movie, maybe even safe to say that it was the moral.  When thinking of Thanksgiving, one thinks of a holiday with the purpose of giving thanks for the things in your life that you have.  In the case of Woody Allan's character, because of the fact that he was a hypochondriac, he was so worried about all the diseases that he could have; he doesn't appreciate the good health he is actually in. This is the same for some of the other characters in the movie as well.  In the case of Michael Caine's character, he has a wonderful wife (Hannah) and a wonderful life in fact, but isn't grateful for what he has and wants more, particularly Hannah\u0091s younger sister Lee. \t        Woody Allan creates a great movie with Hannah and Her Sisters, and the actors in the movie get into their roles and really make the movie believable.  If a comical movie with a great moral were what you're looking for, I would definitely recommend Hannah and Her Sisters for your viewing pleasure.  With it's adult humor and nonstop dilemmas, it is sure to be a hit with any teen to adult aged audience.",

            "content": "Leonardo Da Vinci created awe inspiring paintings, Beethoven composed genius symphonies and Woody Allen writes the best dialogue on the planet, each man is a god in their field, but only one of them can boast 14 Oscar script nominations to his name. You talk about the Last Supper, I talk about Annie Hall and Hannah and her Sisters. Woody Allen's perennial love affair with Ingmar Bergman once again manifests itself in one of his films; Hannah and her Sister can draw great parallels with Bergman's seminal Fanny and Alexander, both films provide a turbulent decent into the lives of a dysfunctional family over the course of couple of years bookend by family gatherings, here in the shape of Thanksgiving while in Fanny and Alexander it is Christmas. In Hannah and her Sister we focus primary on the characters of three sisters Hannah, Holly and Lee, all connected by blood but in terms of personalities and success in life they are all diametrically opposed. Hannah (Mia Farrow) is the oldest, most successful and strong willed; while Holly (Dianne Wiest) on the other hand is in constant flux in life, never begin able to find her true calling, while Lee (Barbara Hershey) the youngest is an ex-alcoholic, student who always wears her heart on her sleeve.The film opens up during Thanksgiving dinner, on the surface everything seems upbeat and festive, however Elliot (Michael Caine) the husband too Hannah finds himself deeply infatuated with her sister Lee \"God she is Beautiful\" are very first words spoken in the film, however even when we do find out that Lee harbors similar desires towards him in return and thus begins a secret love affair. It is never made abundantly clear where her feelings are true or if she is merely using Elliot as a stop gap for the whole left in her life during the decaying of her own relationship to Fredrick a self absorbed painter. But it isn't only Lee whose life is experiencing upheaval. Holly who never seems to be able to quite find herself, has lived in the shadow of her much more successful older sister Hannah, causing major underlining tension between the two characters. This tension eventually boils to the surface in probably the most distinct scene in the film where all three sisters sit down in a restaurant; with the main topic of discussion being Holly's need money from Hannah for what seems like the 100th time to fund her latest career path. Despite Hannah obligingly agreeing to do so, Holly still finds an excuse to play the victim stating that her sister only ever saw her as a \"Loser\". What I love the most about this scene, is that it deviates greatly from Allen's traditional technical approach to filmmaking, which is always subvert and naturalistic and rarely drawing attention to itself, however in this scene the camera slowly rotates around all three sisters as if circling the event horizon in a black hole before being engulfed by the dark abyss that is these sisters relationship. Unfortunately the only ever time Allen display this type of flare is in Annie Hall as we have the pleasure of seeing split screens, subtitles of the subtext of scenes and even breaking the fourth wall, which uses all these components so effectively and innovatively something regularly lacking in his work.The last major plot element of the film features Woody Allen making his usual appearance in his own productions, playing here Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a hypochondriac TV producer who finds himself in an existential life crises concerning the point and meaning of life, during his latest health scare. Unfortunately whilst his usual appearances are effective such as is Manhattan and in Play it Again Sam, which he delivers wonderful performances which are integral for each particular films, yet in Hannah and her Sisters I found his narrative arc to being rather to preachy, self-righteous and ultimately unnecessary because it would have served better to have delved even deeper into the sister dynamics, and we need to see a lot more from Hannah who appeared to be more of a boot sale ornament in each scene rather than an actual character.When you consider Hannah and her Sister was attributed with two three of the big Oscars; both supporting Oscars a fete only equated by The fighter and Julia, whilst also receiving the Oscar for best original screenplay, it really defines Wood Allen as a director and writer, he's a fantastic actor's director who can illicit some of the most wonderful performances from his actors, and working with him is always a career highlight, just ask Penelope Cruz and Mariel Hemingway. Then you just have to look at the fact that he has been nominated 14 times for best screenplay to show adept he is at writing dialogue, however while Hannah and her Sister demonstrates his fantastic acting directing and sensational writing, for me the film doesn't break into my all time five best Allen pictures. This is mainly due to his inclusion into the story, which played to Allen's usual hypochondriac role that we have seen him playing way to many times before. I also felt his story also greatly subtracted from the time we should have been spending with the three main actresses, and despite drawing the film out to a mind numbing 2 hours +, I never felt we were ever able to see enough of them Hannah and her Sister ironically.",

Holly is coming up with plan to start a catering business with her friend April (Carrie Fisher) and of course she wants Hanna to finance because she is a successful actress, and the film takes off after that. The theme being this could be happening in your family right now. The film breaks away to each character and does a very good job of letting you understand their feelings Before long after the attention being shown to Lee by Elliot she succumbs to him, and the guilty come after a few time sleeping with him not right away. Elliot is caught up in should he leave Hanna for her sister or stay because Hanna is a good wife. Lee on the other hand is tired of the old guy anyway trying to be a teacher to her instead of what she needs is a relationship.Mickey (Woody Allen) is Hanna ex-husband who is a hypochondriac who can take the smallest thing and turn in to a very big thing. Mickey really makes the film. He gets a ear infection and now he is dying from a tumor, not really but that what he thinks.Holly is the one who always been in trouble, but the family is waiting for her to make something of herself. She comes up with that plan and that plan of course Hanna is footing the bill. Hanna doesn't know what is going one with anything, she things all is well maybe her and Elliot need to talk to someone and they will be back to normal. The film makes a full circle coming back to Thanksgiving dinner at the end and all the changes that have taken place since the dinner at the beginning of the film.The film musical score is one of the highlights of the film. The music blended mixed right along with the scenes. The camera used close up shot to show the look the reactions of the actor and actress to make the audience feel how they felt.Overall this film is for adults who can see their own family members in the film. Lee cheating with her sister's husband may put some at odds but it does happen all the time. The point being is that all family's have problems maybe not as extreme as the film or maybe more extreme. This is an example of the lives of everyday people.",

            "content": "Woody Allen recreates his Type A persona as a death-fearing hypochondriac (Mickey Sachs) in Hannah and Her Sisters. He is amusing as ever, even going so far as seeking for a religious affiliation (though he realizes it's a stretch to convince himself to believe in any divine being) to avoid his ever present nihilistic life views.As in many of Allen's works, he manages to assemble a collage of interesting, real-life scenarios, which revolve around Hannah (Mia Farrow) as well as her sisters. The portions involving Allen himself comedically showcase his cynicism, having him manically worry over the slightest omens of death that should come his way. And his romantic pursuits are rich too, brimming with inspired dialogue and laughable moments.The affair between Elliot and Lee (Michael Caine and Barbara Hershey) was especially intriguing. Adultery is of course viewed almost universally as an immoral act, but seeing inside each of the character's minds makes one feel for each of them, almost to the point where the cheating is justifiable. The romantic feelings of each are revealed early on as they narrate them to us, so that we learn of the mutual emotions before they do, and this has much realistic value. Giving the viewer that kind of omniscience was a brilliant move on the part of Allen (as the director), since it gives us an appreciation of the mortality that romance can bring to anyone.Hannah's sisters Holly and April (Dianne Wiest and Carrie Fisher) compete for the affections of David to complete the third and final arch of this story. Again, character narrations are splendidly used to connect to realistic opinion (such as when Holly confesses her partial dislike of Holly, this being when she fears she has lost to her in winning David).The bustling streets of New York City serve as the backdrop for the movie, as one would expect with Allen. And what really entertained me personally was Allen's search for the \"right religion\". His open-minded approach to the search was funny in how uncommon it's found among us in society. His deep pondering contrasts with the relative absent-mindedness with which most people seem to connect with their religions, as many are raised on a particular one as a child. It goes to show you that a religious skeptic likely doesn't have the capacity to fit into any sect.",

And that's all shown in the very first scene. These three sister all have very different lives. Hannah is a happily married mother and is very caring and giving. Lee is more artistic and needy. She has a boyfriend that is pretty much a genius. Their relationship is also kind of weird. He's an artist that uses her for information from the outside world or something. Holly is the outsider. She can't decide what to do with her life and is always \"borrowing\" money from Hannah to start up whatever her next plan is. She was also a cocaine addict.          Okay, this movie was just that. But it was the 1980's and it was made by Woody Allen. The story line wasn't all that bad, even though from the very start it seemed like a really weird soap opera. The organization of the movie is interesting. Each scene has a title fitting that scene. The movie was also pretty funny thanks to Woody Allen's character. He played Hannah's ex-husband. The first time we see him in the movie is in the scene called \"The Hypochondriac\". He's probably the best part of this movie. Without his character, it would have been barely watchable.",

It centers on a large family through 2 years revolving around Thanksgiving ( the only time most families come together ) and it examines not only the 3 sisters, but their parents and friends. I will not give away anything because it is such a joy to watch this film without knowing anything about it.

We look at him and know that this is a man who takes pleasure in beating up women. When the prostitute shoots him, we are tempted to cheer. Hollywood has made the fatal error of pigeon-holing English actors into their vision of the stereotype. Casting Bruce Willis as the English reporter (awful) in \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" is typical of their muddled take on a great piece of character writing (by Tom Wolfe). Similarly, Caine's reprise of David Niven's role in \"Bedtime Story\" is another disaster of miscasting. (\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\") We hear of suspension of disbelief, but Michael Caine playing an English upper class gentleman - really, that is a bridge too far.",

Being somebody that enjoys all of all Woody Allen's work, I would still have to say that this film far exceeds the work in his others.  The movie is seamless and the cast, down to every single player is precisely where they should be as performers.  The subject matter is so true to human nature and so funny at the same time, that this film is absolutely universal.  I mean come on folks, just Allen's searching for the meaning of life in his own neurotic is so strikingly true.  I honestly do not know a single person who's seen this film that doesn't adore the s*** out of it.  I'm really quite surprised that movies like the Godfather and Shawshank Redemption rank up there but this one doesn't.  Perhaps Mr. Allen must die first before he is truly recognized for the unique voice he is.

We are thrown into our faces, once again, the ugliness of life, which is full of lies, doubts, remorse, sorrow and unreached goals.\"Hanna and her sisters\" tells the intertwined stories of three sisters from a family of artists, Hanna (Farrow), Lee (Hershey) and Holly (Weist), their relationship with each other, their respective love relationships and the relationship with their parents. On the one hand, Hanna was married to Mickey (Allen), a hypochondriac man that runs a TV show, but now she's married to Elliot (Caine), who is secretly in love with Lee, who lives with a man she no longer loves and who actually finds boring, Frederick, a reclusive artist whose knowledge and wisdom lured her at first. On the other hand, there's Holly, a cocaine-addicted whose life is a complete failure. She can't find a singular regular job, is always asking for money and has no boyfriend. Holly is very different from her sisters.Through this story, Woody Allen shows us again how we spent our lives regretting that we should have done something when we had the chance. We feel miserable and lonely because we lack of determination to finally aim a target and reach it. Life ends up to quickly and we realize that we've done nothing but regret about the past.In this case, Woody presents us his pessimistic but reflective view of life through a much more complex treatment of human relation-ships. Many different characters with their respective personalities appear in \"Hanna and her sisters\". Because of this, I wouldn't say this is his best movie, but I would say that is the most admirable one and, in my opinion, the hardest one to achieve.With some help from a dreamed ensemble, Woody creates this master piece in which he combines images with intelligent and deep dialogues and passionate music.A very solid five-star movie.",

This in itself is highly watchable but Allen threads together for us a surprisingly intricate plot that reveals more of its inner working every time you watch the movie. His use of T.S Elliot's poetry is rather nice, even though the poem used is edited down somewhat. Allen fans seem to be few and far between these days (it's 2005 as I write this), but his movies are always a good investment for moviegoers who enjoy intelligent cinema. Though his abilities as director are a bit lacking at times - the crew and equipment seem to get into shot at some point in all his movies! - there is no doubting that he is excellent at creating a script and doing great things with it.",

After having viewed at least a couple of dozen of his films, it seems to me it's always basically the same thing:  Husband or wife or girlfriend or boyfriend or both has/have an affair and moves on or, possibly, breaks off the affair and repairs the original relationship. It's an interesting enough topic, I suppose, but it's not like there aren't lots of other stories which could be told.\n\nThis one's a classic. I re-watched it again the other night, and I enjoyed it. The Woody Allen character himself is a bit exasperating and, honestly, none of the characters is particularly compelling. Still, I enjoyed watching the story unfold, and the happy endings didn't come across as unlikely or overly cutesy. All in all, it's a nice film.",

I really enjoyed this one tho as far as keeps your interest, good dialogue, nyc setting, acting, nice plot, funny, decent characters and liked how it was uniquely broken up like a book with chapters. What I wasn't crazy about was Elliot's casting (not believable) guy is an ogre no one would do that to their sister for him (sorry not sorry). Also must woody Allen always have some old guy (Frederick) with a young woman (Lee)? Movie did make me nostalgic for that time period. One of those movies that makes u think but doesn't take itself so serious as to not be funny n entertaining-good stuff.",

And then I have an aunt and uncle, y'know it would have been a bloodbath.\"\n\nIt's not mile-a-minute jokes in the way that many of Allen's most prominent films are, but instead leans more heavily toward comedy-drama, in many ways a more challenging discipline. The story is a twisting web of connections that weave together distinctive characters and conflicts (though for most of the film, Allen's Mickey is off doing his own thing while the real plot happens elsewhere, which can be a bit jarring before the threads come together); the film is really best described as a quilt of subplots rather than a direct narrative revolving around the particular development of any one character. The most distinctive element of the film is its writing, with dialogue that flows and feels natural (particularly strong in casual conversation), before transitioning to soul-baring conflict. Supported by strong performances all around, the film feels authentic and convincing; these characters have faults, and that not only alright, it makes them watchable.\n\nIn an ensemble film, one of the most difficult things to do is make each character not only work, but make the audience care about them. Hannah and her Sisters is one of the few films to actually do that well. (4/5)",

This God like person that he carries off himself, in the entire runtime of his films; which is mostly short and crisply edited, is something everyone would envy. And it is the commanding signature vocab of his, that he spreads, injects in each and every character. Now this is sort of insanely risky. You are, as a rule, told to give each character a different voice. And here we are decades and one of the most successful careers of all time later. Allen's gift of witty humor is not a joke.\n\nHe balances the drama and humor like a champ. And this is something that previously and even now, so many have tried to achieve, but only few can get the reactions as anticipated. So how does he do that? And why can't anyone else cross that bridge as effortlessly and frequently as he does? Well, it is simple. At the back of his head, he is always aware of the theme that underlines the entire scenario, the entire film.\n\nAnd now all the jokes or elaborated sketches that are about to come will serve that purpose bits by bits. And this gradual procedure goes unnoticed for you are busy having the time of your life. You can see the grin on his face, when he jam-packs this much content in that aforementioned runtime. The result is a fast paced narration that looks like a hack job and instead is a fully functioning craftsmanship that can only be achieved by someone who is nominated for 24 Oscars. Hannah And Her Sisters might be about them, but just as any other Woody character or film, all I see his hypochondriac face.",

            "content": "Dianne Wiest is such a singular and striking actress that she is capable of stealing an entire film out from under performers as significant as Barbara Hershey and Woody Allen. She is gifted with one of her greatest roles in this film as she plays the former Cocaine addict/aspiring actress turned screenwriter Holly to perfection, earning an Academy Award in the process. There is a delightfulness to watching such a unique figure bring her touch to the material of Woody Allen as she is able to take familiar tropes within his work and make them feel new and refreshing. The film itself is a lovely exploration into the neuroses of various artistic New Yorkers and the nature of existence but it is Wiest's luminous presence that will stay in your mind long after seeing the film.\n\nSisters Hannah, Lee and Holly in addition to the various men in their lives with whom they are romantically involved. The dependable Hannah, Mia Farrow, is being cheated on by her frustrated husband Elliot, Michael Caine, who has developed a quixotic passion for her needy sister Lee, Barbara Hershey. Meanwhile, Hannah's neurotic ex-husband Mickey, Woody Allen, becomes convinced that he has various terminal illnesses and begins to believe that life is meaningless and not worth living because he will eventually die. The third sister in the family, Holly, Dianne Wiest, takes up writing after failing as an actress and rekindles her relationship with Mickey with whom she had gone on a disastrous first date. Over the years the sisters have their lives turned upside down as they are asked to question the roles they play in the lives of their loved ones and pursue new relationships and ambitions.\n\nThe film, as with many others directed by Allen, serves as a love letter to New York from the tour of architectural wonders taken by Holly, her friend and a potential love interest early on in the film to the simples shots of the rivers in Autumn. We feel Allen's affection for this place and the people that inhabit it as we realize that only in a city this big and this cultured could an array of characters so charming and colorful exist. All of the characters are in some way interested in art and we get to spend time with them as they head into trendy record stores or witness the nude portraits that have been painted of them. Part of the excitement of watching a film is having a window into the lives of others and getting to see the glamour of New York is an appealing prospect.\n\nAllen does revisit so many of his favorite tropes here as we see a couple overcome infidelity, an indecisive and flighty woman who finally lands on a career path and a character writing events from their own life into their writing, angering those around them. They feel more lively here than they do in some of his lesser works, such as You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010), with their integration feeling smoother and the delivery of his trademark dialogue having a chutzpah to it. I am glad that he chose to revisit some of this material as I think he still finds new ways to explore it and ways to view the issues that we all face in our lives at some point.\n\nThe most touching storyline in the film is that which concerns the romance between Mickey and Holly who find fulfillment and support in one another after facing rejection from others in their lives. We see both of these tortured souls go through their own trials and tribulations as Holly pursues architect David, Sam Waterston, who dumps her for her friend April, Carrie Fisher, while Mickey goes through an existential crisis. When she gets over her cocaine addiction and finds a career path that could be viable she is ready to be in a real relationship and I hadn't seen a scene as delightful as that in which she and Mickey flirt in a while. His effusive praise of her screenplay and her ecstatic reaction, such a contrast to the expressions of despair she previously held, fully sold me on their bond being strong and something that could truly last. Of course the final scene of the film is one of the best as we see that the two have endured as a couple despite the struggles they might have faced and have bright prospects on the horizon.",

I often have frustration with movies of this style because it is seemingly just a bunch of scenes loosely tied together with no plot. Things just happen, people change, and relationships adapt but there seems to be no point to it all. It accurately reflects how real relationships can sometimes work, and I liked that they showed the juxtaposition of what we think versus what we do. The conversations were authentic, and the acting was sincere, but the story was aimless. I think the movie is intended more as a look at what real life is like, and that's why it was both stressful and boring. There are some scenes that kept me engaged, and I did have enough interest in the characters to wonder where they would end up. I think some people will really enjoy Hannah and Her Sisters, but it's not going to be the general public. Sadly, I tend to have a more simplistic, \"general public\" taste in film. The lack of a cohesive through-line in the script to bind the multitude of subplots together left me cold and uninterested.",

Personally, I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more if it was just a drama without any comedy, but it is a Woody Allen film which always has it's Jewish jokes.

The film's chapters tell intertwined storiesWoody Allen's magnificent Hannah and Her Sisters plays out like a novel on screen, parsed into chapters by white-on-black quotes, or snippets of dialog, that announce the beginning of each scene. The film's chapters tell intertwined stories of an extended family of Manhattanites, centered largely around Hannah (Mia Farrow), the oldest of three sisters, Hannah, Holly (Dianne Wiest), and Lee (Barbara Hershey). The stories link at three family Thanksgivings at Hannah's apartment, shared with her husband Elliot (Michael Caine), at the beginning, middle, and end of the film. Each story is distinguished by its own soundtrack, and sometimes by its own pace, look, and/or location. Hannah and Elliot have marriage troubles. Elliot's infatuated, and starts an affair, with Lee. Holly's aimless, trying and failing to find satisfaction, repeatedly, taking \"solace\" in a self-destructive drug habit. Alongside this mix is Mickey (Allen), who's learned he may have a brain tumor and finds himself on a quest to make meaning of life in the face of death. Each story provides a window into the complex decisions adults make -- whether right or wrong -- when confronted with circumstances they hardly apprehend. Allen treats right and wrong choices with the same degree of tolerance, and ultimately with a blind-but-necessary optimism -- a belief that, next time around, a person might just do better. The film's feats are numerous. Effortless mixing of drama and comedy. Thematic and personal bonds uniting seemingly disparate characters and stories. Crafty direction that juggles the pieces but fits them together. This is perhaps Allen's most richly acted film; it's certainly one of his most richly written. His assured storytelling and directing exhibit a marked maturation of his skills. Hannah and Her Sisters is a great, and now classic, film.",

Focusing on a series ofThe films of Woody Allen manage to brilliantly blend comedy and drama, while examining life and all of the mysteries it holds. Hannah and Her Sisters is one of - if not the - best examples of this in Allen's work. Focusing on a series of characters undergoing crises in their lives, relationships, and careers, Hannah and Her Sisters is both funny and profound in ways that only a film by Woody Allen can aspire to be.As always, the best part of any Woody Allen film is the writing and the characters. Hannah and Her Sisters is no exception. Witty and smart dialogue complements terrifically crafted characters. Hannah (Mia Farrow) craves affection internally, but is off-putting due to her appearance as the \"best\" sister and being far more complete as a person than those around her. This can cause great tension for her and both the writing and Farrow's performance capture this dichotomy terrifically. She is dependent on her husband, Elliott (Michael Caine), but has no idea how to show this devotion. Similarly, Elliott is terrifically written as a man who lusts after Hannah's sister, Lee (Barbara Hershey). As opposed to Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), his internal turmoil is much more internal and subtle, yet still ever present. Unsure of who he wants to be and his own life, Elliott's struggles lead him to stray, even if - deep down - he knows it will not satisfy him. However, one of my favorite characters here is Mickey. A hypochondriac who has an actual brush with death that leaves him lost, searching for meaning in life, and exploring religion, it is through Mickey that Allen really explores the meaning of the film. Hannah and Her Sisters is ultimately a film about life and finding purpose. Mickey, at one point, suggests the only point to life is love and that certainly seems to be the case here.  The characters have no other purpose and are left entirely unfulfilled until they are introduced to the one they are meant to be with, even if it does not click immediately. The only consistent thread throughout the whole film is the search for love. Every character does it and, once they find it, transform into an entirely new person.This is really what makes the writing so strong. For a wide cast of characters, Hannah and Her Sisters slack with none of them and develops each sister, Elliott, and Mickey, with great dimension and craft that makes them wholly resemble a real human being. Each character has very human struggles and the film is unafraid to bring them to the forefront, allowing the film to be incredibly accessible and relatable to anybody searching for their purpose in life.Hannah and Her Sisters continues to impress when considering the acting. As always, Allen's neurotic approach to his own character is charming, hilarious, and smart. He is greatly complemented here by a sturdy performance from Mia Farrow and an uncharacteristically neurotic performance from Michael Caine. Though less funny than Allen, Caine's character is certainly just as erratic and lost, yet Caine's approach is vastly different though still terrific. As Hannah's sisters, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest are also terrific, as both women embark on their own personal journeys of self-discovery through the film. Lost entirely, Hershey greatly captures the way in which Lee is unsatisfied and going back to school in order to find her purpose. A typical path for many lost adults, Lee's story is certainly a highly relatable one and Hershey does a great job playing the role in a very grounded fashion. Finally, Wiest plays the recovering drug addict, acting, and now writing sister very well. By the end, she truly makes the greatest transformation from a paranoid, spastic sister to a stoic and well collected one who beams confidence, rather than insecurity.Hannah and Her Sisters certainly lived up to the hype with terrific characters, writing, and acting. Smart, witty, and insightful, the film does a tremendous job examining midlife crises and the search for who we are and what role we are meant to play in life.",

So Mickey is narrating himself complaining about a spot in his back which includes brain tumor and his hearing loss thinking that he was going to kill himself. Michael Caine plays Elliot who madly in love with Hannah's sister and while he is still married to Hannah. No matter what I think, it's an treat for all of people in the world. Of course, the story is well written so is the directing by Woody Allen. I'm sure that you can't get over that Michael Caine didn't accept an award to star in Jaws: The Revenge.",

Hannah and Her Sisters is hands down one of, if not the most tender, heat-warming, non-indulgent, and hence accessible, and finest Allen film.
