            "content": "Before all the slapstick, before re-writing \"Home Alone\" umpteen times and before selling his soul to \"Disney Pictures Inc.\", John Hughes was believed to be THE scribe for teen angst. He wrote eloquently of it in \"Sixteen Candles\", \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Pretty in Pink\". And with \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller (Broderick)? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris' own sister (Grey, pre-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the \"trouser-snake\". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dystalic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s teendom at its best? Seize this \"Day\"!Ten stars for \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".",

            "content": "My friends knowing that I'm a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time, when it came down to number one, there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of: Ferris Bueller's Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time, Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding, Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club, which is an incredible movie as well, but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood, getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen, you've pulled a Ferris Beuller's day off too, it's like a law here, lol, if you haven't, I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it's outrageous story that everyone wants to live, Matthew Broderick, there was no other choice, he is who everyone wants to be: Ferris Bueller.Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick, even though it is his worst performance of being ill, somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside, takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I'm not kidding fellow Chicagoians, this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though, his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie, who cares more about Ferris's life than her own and just wants to prove that he's faking it.Even though, you have to admit that it's a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is \"dying\" and no one notices that he's singing in the Chicago parade, on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class, getting \"snootie\" with a waiter at Chicago's finest restaurant, and catching the Cub's home run ball at Wrigley Field, you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney, the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn't make a fool of him, but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don't know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit, back and enjoy because \"\u0085life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and take a look around once in a while, you might miss it\"; my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die.10/10",

            "content": "Matthew Broderick looked so brilliant in those days. While this film single handedly made him Ferris Bueller forever, at least this is a film that can be seen all throughout the years without dating too badly. Sure, the music and props will signify a time of discontent and bad hairdos, but the idealistic look of a man simply wanting to ditch school has never been made more daringly and charmingly. Everything about this film was gold, from the postmodern \"conversations\" with the audience to the little back stories which seem to shape the overall canvas of the film. While Alan Ruck was way too old to play in this movie, at least he proved to be a great opposite to the cool and nonchalant Ferris. Gross-out comedies may now be the norm, at least we can look back to this film and enjoy a good, genuine laugh.",

Broderick is perfect, but it is Jeffrey Jones who gives a searing comic potryal of Ed Rooney, a Mr. Weatherbee-like principal wanting to catch Ferris in only act of treachery; holding him back for one more year of high school. John Hughes is at his best here. The dialogue for this film has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them.

With fake computer grade and attendance records, Ferris has it made.The scene where the principal hitches a ride on a school bus after having been \"torn up\" by Doberman watch dogs is worth the ticket price (Oh Yeah!).

            "review_title": "An interesting and stylish take on the years of then-contemporary American teenagers, that carries on finding new audiences due to its study of individualism.",
            "content": "Like Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off seems to hold a pretty firm and entrenched place in whatever 1980s teen cannon that people hold in such high regard. Back to the Future was, perhaps famously, rejected by many-a studios on the basis of 'not being raunchy enough'; something other films of its ilk were at the time. I can imagine something similar happening to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but like Back to the Future, it is the decidedly 'un-raunchy' films of the era that we now revisit the most often and just seem to hold in higher regard.I think what keeps this film resonating with past and current audiences alike is its clear distinction in paying close attention to young people, and their ever-ongoing battle for independence, for recognition and for individuality. The lead is Ferris Bueller (Broderick); a young and very confident, almost borderline sociopathic in his behaviour, male in then-contemporary America. Ferris is the sort of guy who can con his way into an expensive restaurant; hack his way into the school computer mainframe and shows total disregard to his friend's and certain respective situations when trying to haggle the use of a rare and classic car for the day. The film takes special care in introducing him as an individual whom lives in a large, detached house in a rich neighbourhood that comes complete with a white picket fence. He is literate in all the latest gadgets and pieces of technology, be it home computers used to hack or stereo systems to further the notion he is unwell.In direct opposition to Ferris is the principal of Ferris' school, named Ed Rooney (Jones). Rooney isn't just out to capture Bueller as he plays truant, he is out to destroy Bueller's life; this, Rooney outlines as his goal very early on in the piece. This seems to be the essence of what keeps audiences old and new consistently discovering the film; that study of 'old vs. young' as these cocky, smart and quite attractive bunch of confident oddball kids dare stand up to those of a high authority; those that are grey, suit-clad authoritarian figures such as Rooney.But I think Bueller is smarter-still than what he lets on. He talks very early on about how important it is to go to college and learn a trade and live the American Dream, but he does so in a very nonchalant manner, almost as if he is repeating what it is he's told to say, or think, or feel. What follows is a chain of events and total disregard to most things that suggest he isn't of this ideation at all. But the journey does have an ideation; an ideation Bueller himself cooks up to do with being able to notice life and enjoy life as best you can, otherwise it might seem like it's passing you by.But the film isn't preoccupied with just these studies. Its attention to young vs. old or independence vs. routine is similarly played about with through one of Bueller's two friends named Cameron Frye (Ruck), who is given a slight subplot to do with being able to stand up to his father. Ferris and Cameron's third friend is Sloane Peterson (Sara), Ferris' girlfriend. The three complete an unusual triangle of pals; they are one another's' friend as well as foil, forever getting into adventures and situations but hitting the odd wall when it comes to the finer things during the day out. Cameron is forever concerned with the car; Cameron and Sloane are forever worried they might get caught (particularly when Ferris partakes in a large musical number in the street) and Ferris seems forever pre-occupied that the three of them will not get the best out of their day off; a day off Ferris sees as a gift, as something they worked hard towards earning with their scheming, and thus; must embrace it as fully as possible.The film is a love story, a comedy that relies on slapstick, situation and screwball alike; the film is an odd beast of basic convention, surrealist humour and truancy glorification. But does it ever focus too much on one thing? Does it particularly care what you might think of it? I don't think it does, it just throws mostly everything at the screen, stirs it all up and allows it all to play out. It feels like two, or possibly three, different films at once \u2013 but that's fine because there is enough different sorts of content all brewing at once, and focused on at a balanced rate, that we go with it. One might say the film's attitude echoes that of its lead; it's doing things its own way, in its own style and doesn't particularly mind how you react. It's the kind of film that can go from a slow motion shot of two guys driving a sort-of stolen car that was sort-of stolen in the first place to the Star Wars theme; to a series of scenes that rely on a school teacher falling over a few times as a source of humour. The best thing about it all, is that it's all actually rather effective.",

            "content": "I quite enjoy the long and successful run of films that John Hughes had back in the 1980s; PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES has long been one of my very favourite comedies. I'd seen bits and pieces of FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF in the past, but never once had I sat down and watched it all the way through - until now.To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. I should like BUELLER because it has an easy-going charm and plenty of incident packed into the running time, but I ended up hating it, and for one reason alone: Bueller himself. He's the most idiotic, sarcastic, and sheer unlikeable protagonist I've seen in a film in a good long time, and never once could I warm to his supposed humour or character. He's a prime example of hubris, thinking himself better than his friends, his classmates, his parents, and his teachers, and I despised him for it. Even worse, Hughes seems to celebrate this cockiness in the character, never once cutting him down to size. This film is the reason I don't like Matthew Broderick as an actor (well, this and GODZILLA), even though he'd previously been good in WAR GAMES.The film itself adopts a journey narrative and offers a handful of memorable set-pieces, including Charlie Sheen's cameo, the elaborate bedroom set-up, and a great public sing-along to the Beatles song. And, although I'm no fan of the actor, Jeffrey Jones has a great role as the antagonist of the piece. FERRIS BUELLER is light-hearted, brash, and full of humour, so it's just a pity that I didn't identify with the jerk lead in any way, shape or form, rendering this a near-unwatchable movie for me.",

The setting portrayed at the school of the bored students listening to a nasal monotone lecture, while intended to be a caricature of the nature of classroom lessons and children's reactions, was pretty much on target.Ferris Bueller takes the day off and what does he do?  Certainly not what Rooney assumed smart teenagers will do.  He didn't use this time to damage some bedsprings with his girlfriend, or play video games.  No, he viewed fabulous pieces of art, ate at a very classy restaurant, participated in a parade, and taught his friends a few lessons in some interesting ways.As a believer in education as an organic experience, this movie is a real eye opener to anyone wishing to educate their children outside of the public school venue.

He does many seemingly selfish things; lying to his parents, humiliating his principal, and putting his 'best friend' in danger, all so he can have 7 carefree hours off of school. It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3-dimensional character, and we begin to understand him and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While it seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself. We learn\nhis parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spending time with his son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friend's self-esteem, and by the end, he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn't seem to change at all. He helps his friends become better people, but in doing so, he isn't changing at all.",

Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him!2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good.3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8. The most memorable scene was \"Twist and Shout\" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching.9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.10.

Ferris Bueller is a smooth operator who is something of a transgressive figurehead at his high school for his rebellious nature. Throughout \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" he breaks the fourth wall and addresses the viewer, letting them in on his schemes and tricks of the trade. On this day, he shows us how he fools his parents into thinking he is too sick to attend school, making it his nine sick-day this semester. His parents molly-coddle him and then head off to work, leaving him in bed. His miserable-faced sister (Jennifer Grey) sees right through his antics and loathes him for it. Another person who can not stand Ferris is the highly-strung school principal played by Jeffrey Jones (His performance being the only good thing about the film for me). He makes it his mission to find Ferris out and show him for the truant that he is. But Ferris has other ideas for his 'day off off' (They are actually highly unimpressive and uninteresting) and these involve his girlfriend and best friend Cameron. I usually don't mind Matthew Broderick but he creates one of the most irritating characters in movie history here. Bueller is sarcastic and very arrogant, and is not at all funny.

The actors actually try to play their characters, in fact Hughes generally tries to find actors that already are those characters.But he tried something else with Molly Ringwald starting with `Breakfast Club' where he cast her `against type.' Much of that film depended on a notion of acting to be someone else. Here he takes the next step, this time with Broderick. And this time, he gets a seasoned, self-aware actor.This time, the story is not about teen angst associated with self-identity, but about the joy of the con. The pleasures of being someone else (which is all most kids have anyway). Broderick's stage experience before this was all in roles where he winked at the audience: `See what I do.' A couple years later, Bruce Willis would reintroduce this style of acting to the big picture, but here we have it early.The tip-off is those moments when Ferris -- or is it Broderick? -- looks straight at you and tells you about the role he is playing: Broderick playing a role of a kid who is playing a role. We have the `Mr Peterson' bit; the `sausage king' bit; the performance in the parade; the fake-in-the-bed bit (shades of `Home Alone'), the sick six year old bit; and finally the actor telling us to just go home. Its all acting about acting: a teen's life is all about adopting a persona.Today, this seems normal, but in its time, it was pretty revolutionary film for a mainstream product. Its the reason this is remembered so fondly, because for many youngsters -- those who never learn to read intelligently -- it was the first encounter with reflexive art. (The previous generation got their's from the Beatles and Dylan.) I'm not sure what teen film predecessors there could be, but this may be where the whole explosion of non-ironic irony in teen films comes from.That redhead Stephanie Blake character is important.

It's hidden in the facial expressions, gestures and tone of voice. I particularly enjoyed the famous 'staring at a canvas' scene which I found both highly entertaining and profound at the same time.Modern-day film and television industry could take a lot from this one. It shouldn't be all about the bawdy comebacks and toilet jokes. Humour is most effective when it's undetected.But on a more serious note, there are actually important themes that are discussed here whether it's defying your parents, discovering your abilities or keeping your friends close but enemies even closer.With both its lighter and more serious facets I know a comedy when I see one.

Its lazy slapstick brings to mind the worst parts of Police Academy or Home Alone.But the problem is deeper than that. It is philosophical.For here we have 3 affluent kids who have pampered lifestyles (particularly the insufferable Ferris), and our sympathies are supposed to lie with them. Meanwhile the butt of the joke is someone who actually has to work for a living.The cruelty with which he is subjected to humiliation while the kids swan around at others' expense is actually quite sickening. It is like seeing aristocrats gorging themselves and then being invited to laugh at their servants.It is no good saying that he is an authority figure. That would only work if the kids were of a lower standing in society as he is. If they were Chaplinesque hobos who needed to kick a cop up the behind or they were acting out of necessity, you could understand it. But they are entirely selfish.Ferris Bueller is an impossibly perfect youth, good looking, pampered by his parents, with a beautiful girlfriend and an assortment of gadgets which would have cost his adversary, principle Rooney, a year's wages back in the mid 80s. We are constantly told how popular he is in school. Why? I imagine a real life Bueller would annoy the hell out of most people.His friend Cameron has access to at least two cars, one of which is a fabulous Ferrari which his father keeps in a large garage overlooking a specular wooded area.And we are supposed to care that these, and Bueller's girl, go on a joyride? Rather like in the old Road Runner cartoons, which suppose our sympathies should lie with a one-dimensional annoying character rather than the harassed workaholic, I guess many people were hoping that Bueller would get his comeuppance in the end.

Watching it again, heaven knows how. The worst thing I found was that it had dated badly. The first Home Alone say, retains far more features which keep it relevant & able to stand the test of time than this.My main comment is identical to the correspondent below. I too spent the entire film just hoping against hope that Ferris did get his come uppence & that I'd forgotten it. But sadly he didn't & the ending was poor. I never saw the Rooney teacher as the 'baddie' nor found anything that happened to him remotely amusing. Infact I struggled to see where any of the laughs in the film as a whole were. Also, I found Ferris' dad an absolute drip & irritating. Nor was anything they actually did in the day off even slightly exciting. Had I had a choice of a going to a museum, watching baseball or walking alongside a float I'd have chosen school any time. It was hardly worthy of a day off.And at the risk of being labelled a leftie I didn't like to see the stealing of someones car & then have it speeding around the roads with a uninsured & inexperienced teenage driver at the wheel, trivialised & inserted into a film in the hope of a few cheap laughs. Likewise I've always found something a bit sick in people who use family member's deaths as a means of bunking off school or work, and again this was the basis of more humour. Of course that happens and of course it has a place in films.

To him, there are two groups of teenagers, those that are unharmed and those that are harmed. By this, I mean Bueller as the unharmed and every other teenager out there as the harmed. Bueller is perfect in every sense of the word and I do not understand how a filmmaker fixated on the destabilization of the teenager could create a protagonist so devoid of conflict.Ruck's character is Hughes's attempt at realism if only Ruck had played the part a bit better in terms of conflict. Yet Ruck did what he could, the character's emotions come out toward the end and without any warnings, which is Hughes's signature uneven qualities. In the film, kids are great and all adults are morons, which is more nihilism than counterculture.

I have no idea how this movie became so popular and garnered such a cult following. Breakfast Club was bad enough but John Hughes went one step further with this drivel.The character Ferris is one of the most unpalatable central characters I have ever seen in a movie. This guy is an over-confident brat who lives in a mansion with loving parents while receiving a first-rate education yet decides to actively rebel against his so-called oppression. And John Hughes thinks we are going to relate to him somehow? Not only that, he looks like a spoiled rich kid. Matthew Broderick has one of those incredibly smarmy faces that you just want to slap. He also looks 25 years old despite being baby-faced and its very difficult to take him seriously as a schoolkid. It is highly fitting that the final scene of the movie is Ferris smiling at the camera with an unspeakably smug expression on his face.Also, how exactly does Ed Rooney, the school principal, become the bad guy? Is caring about your students' attendance some kind of character flaw? This kind of writing makes the kids look like spoilt brats, not trendy rebels.And as for Cameron, another overgrown man-child, are we really supposed to like this guy as well? A rich kid living in paradise who is happy to smash up his daddy's $100k Ferrari just to iron out some personal insecurities? Does Hughes think this is commendable in some way? Would there be any actual consequences to Cameron's actions like a beating from his Dad or being kicked out of his house? Almost certainly not. These are the most low-risk rebels ever created.The carnival scene where Ferris mimes to Twist and Shout is one of the most excruciatingly cringe-worthy things I have ever seen. This is just pure self-indulgence from John Hughes, who I am pretty sure only makes films to coddle his own warped fantasies about what it would have been like to be the cool kid at high school.The only real positive in this movie is the soundtrack which, like most eighties films, is great. Jennifer Grey is also quite good I suppose, at least in contrast to Broderick and Ruck. Aside from that though, this is just complete trash. Not funny, not meaningful and actually quite offensive.",

Even though Bueller has created a lot of tricks to pull this day off, he still has to avoid his principle (Jeffrey Jones) who has been waiting four years to bust him for skipping school. FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF comes from John Hughes and it's easy to see why so many people really love this picture. There's a certain innocent quality that comes with it that makes it something rather special and especially when you consider what other types of teen comedies were being released around this time. I think what makes the film work so well is that it really captures the spirit of what it's like really skipping school. I'm sure most people have skipped a day or two and just sat at home because they didn't have the courage or the ways to do what Ferris did so I think there's a certain fantasy appeal that people have with the character and film. A lot of credit has to go to Hughes' screenplay, which offers up plenty of great characters, fun situations and of course it just allows for a good time. More credit has to go to the cast members for being able to pull off their roles. This includes Broderick who is extremely good in the lead role. I think a lesser actor or a lesser performance really could have made this character annoying but Broderick hits all the right notes in making Ferris rather charming. Both Ruck and Sara are good in their supporting roles as is Jennifer Grey in her role as the sister. Edie McClurg adds her typical wonderful charm and even a young Charlie Sheen gets a pretty funny role, although it probably works better today knowing who Sheen became. However, it's Jones who really steals the picture as the principle who is constantly getting himself in one bad situation after another. The comic timing of Jones is quite flawless and he really makes the picture what it is.",

The movie's premise is the title - the character of Ferris (played by a young and cute Matthew Broderick) being a liar who convinces other friends, via lies, to spend a day off with him. He fills the day with events, convincing a friend to steal his father's prized Porsch and another to say her grandmother is dead. He bulldozes his sister, his parents, school staff and his friends. I found him obnoxious and dishonest to the extreme of not liking the main character at all - thus I was in trouble in the first ten minutes of the film.To add to this turmoil, there is a caricature of a principal, Mr. Rooney, who endeavours to track down Ferris. Mr. Rooney winds up in extreme slapstick situations, quite unfunny to this viewer and far too frequently I was reminded of that awfulness \"Home Alone\", in fact a lot of the scenes are similar, complicated gadgets rigged up at the last minute to foil the \"bad guy\", in this case the school principal doing an extreme form of his job.Nothing really makes sense. Jennifer Grey does a lot with her role as Ferris' sister as does Ferris' best friend. I guess confronting and beating authority is funny when you're say, twelve, but there's not much of a story for anyone in the other demographics of the movie watching public.3 out of 10, some of the music was really good, some scenes are quite striking, but not enough to carry the whole mess.",

I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23-year-old Matthew Broderick as 17-year-old Ferris Bueller, a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane (who he gets out of school extremely cleverly, and quite hilariously i might add!). It doesn't take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris's skipping, so he tries as hard as he can to catch him, but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron's struggles with his parents and life itself, and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn't been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes, such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade, in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the parade-goers dance to \"Danke Schoen\" by Wayne Newton and \"TWIST AND SHOUT\" of course, by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller, his revenge-seeking sister who can't seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything, and Grace, the absent-minded and honest-to-a-fault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you'll have to watch the movie (you won't regret it!). \"Life moves pretty fast.

That is, until Office Space came along, but that is another review.Ferris Beuller (Matthew Broderick) was the kid in High School who never got caught, had fun doing whatever it was and was popular with everybody. On this particular day in the movie, Ferris decides he is taking the day off. After all, \"How can anyone be expected to handle school on a day like this?\" Ferris calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (a young Alan Ruck), who is always sick, and tells him to pick him up. After all, Ferris does not have a car. He wants to show Cameron a good time before High School is all over and wants him to have something good to remember about it. Also, Cameron is Ferris's phony caller voice. Whenever Ferris needs a call made, such as from a police officer or another parent, Cameron is the man.Eventually, Ferris and Cameron gets Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) excused, by using the dead grandmother excuse. Ferris is always one step ahead of his adversary, Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). Rooney is portrayed as a hard ass principal who does not let anything get by him. He sets off to catch Beuller in the act and put a permanent mark in his record and hold him back another year, so as not to have other Ferris Beuller wannabes for years after Ferris's departure. Jones was perfect for his role as Rooney and I do not think that role will ever be surpassed for him.Most of the movie is spent with Rooney looking for Ferris and, as mentioned earlier, is about one or two steps behind him. He comes very close to catching him but never gets the job done. Rooney is the stooge in the movie that every teen and even the adults enjoy seeing him beaten and outsmarted by his young student. I don't think anyone has expected otherwise.All throughout the movie, it pokes fun at the boring and tedious high school classroom. Ferris will say something like, \"If we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym class\" and then it cuts to an exaggerated look at a gym class, which more resembles a boot camp. Ben Stein will forever be remembered here as the extremely boring economics teacher.There are many more characters to this movie that make it great. There is Grace (Rooney's secretary), Jeanie and the rest of Ferris's family, the parking garage guys, the snooty waiter, Charlie Sheen and others. My friends and I still quote randomly from the movie in our everyday situations. That is how much of an impact this movie has made on many lives.There are so many great parts and quotes from this movie, they are too numerous to list in a review, nor would I want to ruin it for anybody who has not seen it, although I can not fathom why you haven't.

The movie was perfectly funny, and there were some perfect moments with drama hiding behind it. John Hughes has made a movie teaching us to do what we want, be free, have a day off, and get away with it. That sounds like something you can steal from a teenager's diary. And the great cast including Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jennifer Grey, Lyman Ward, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Peckett, and Edie McClurg, were all hilariously brilliant. But besides Broderick, who made a great favorite of a performance, it was Alan Ruck who caught my attention as Cameron, and looking at the character, reminds me so much of how I am as a person. I sometimes can't handle things, and can't get my way out of anything, and that makes me a bit similar to this particular character. Now, who knew John Hughes can come up with an awesome coming-of-age teenage story of the 80s, and put it on film.

In summary, the film is about Ferris and his friends, a female he has a crush on and his geeky male friend. Ferris is determined to get a day off of school, and this day is filled with events and plenty of mistakes and some comedy. Some of it is at the expense of his poor geeky friend, who I felt immensely sorry for because he was forced to follow an over-bearing Ferris and ended up with a big problem on his hands.Despite the comedy geared at the adult authority figures (who do not understand the youth), the film really did not make a lot of sense or provide a good story or conclusion. Right, Ferris gets his way and the principal makes a fool of himself and faces the consequences; this is a typical teen rebellion film.It's a classic comedy, but in terms of a good story, Ferris Bueller falls short. And, you either enjoy this type of comedy or you don't enjoy it. If you don't enjoy it, then you will not enjoy the film. Simple as that. Personally, while I thought that some of the humor was good, I felt that it could not carry the story for me, and I felt more sorry for some of the characters and did not feel sorry for the main character at all.

            "content": "Being a big fan of high school/coming-of-age movies, I had high expectations from this film. Everyone says it's one of the best coming-of-age comedies out there, and it's maintained that title for nearly 3 decades now. The movie starts off very promising, immediately setting itself apart from a sea of derivative titles in the coming-of-age comedy genre, with its rather original protagonist. Most conventional high school films are about an unpopular kid's rise to popularity despite numerous challenges, popular kids bullying and rejecting them, etc. Ferris Bueller, on the other hand, is already popular. He's handsome. He's got a girlfriend. All the things that the protagonist has at the end of most high school movies, Ferris Bueller starts his day off with. However, I now understand why kids like him are usually the villain, because Ferris Bueller is just an unbelievable asshole. He fakes sickness to get out of school, something we've all done and can relate to, but then he drags his actually sick friend, Cameron, out of bed using all kinds of manipulation, not because he enjoys hanging out with him, but because he needs a ride. He then pressures Cameron to steal his dad's Ferrari, drives to school with the henceforth stressed-out Cameron to pick up his girlfriend, effectively turning him into the third wheel for the remainder of the day. In fact, they barely talk to the guy from that point. Oh, and he doesn't return the car after all this, instead he drives recklessly for a while, to yet further worried protest from Cameron that goes ignored, then takes it to a garage and hands the keys to a random guy (who also proceeds to drive recklessly with it). He then spends the rest of day doing the weirdest crap. He could drive around in the Ferrari for example, or go do drugs or smoke or drink like normal kids do when they skip school, or maybe use his popularity and his confidence to get Cameron a girl as well, but instead he uses his day off to dine at a fancy restaurant and go to a museum. What high school kid ditches school to go to museum? Oh, and apparently he is so popular, that he can use his citywide influence to be the star of a whole parade. I'm all for the anti-hero approach to the otherwise over-told high school story, but Ferris Bueller is not a good anti-hero. You can't relate to him and you don't root for him, except only when the school principal develops a strange obsession with exposing Ferris Bueller's whole plan, and only then because the principal is an even bigger asshole. The story is mostly not so believable, and none of the characters are very layered or developed. From the weirdly adult choice of entertainment, to the variety of strange and hardly believable events that unfold, such as the principal's obsession, or Cameron entering a catatonic state at some point, to the parade scene, the film feels like a collection of random events sparsely unfolding between a lot of silence or uninteresting/unfunny dialog. A big portion of the film is just kinda awkward. In my opinion, what makes most teenage movies great, is how relatable they are to all of us, and to our own adolescent experiences. As teenagers they helped us get through our own lives and as adults they make us laugh at who we used to be. In my opinion, Ferris Bueller's Day Off fails in this regard. Maybe if I was myself still a teenager, or kind of an asshole, I would appreciate this film more. To its credit it doesn't look like it's a movie that hasn't aged well, though that would at least explain why such a bad movie is so highly spoken of.",

The actors all do an incredible job and conveying the often over-the top characteristics.It is just an overall great film. Comedies can often fall into the more stupid conventions that, whilst entertaining, doesn't offer much in terms of art. But this film, as could be expexted with Hughes, is just an overall genius and magnificent masterpiece.It's just a cult classic that should be experienced by everyone!",

Turning classroom into restaurant and a desolate town into the bustling city.Released 35 years ago, Ferris Bueller is a high school student who fakes an illness to spend a sunny summers day with his friends in Chicago, rather than at school, the one difficulty, is convincing the principal that the sickness is legit, as well as swaying his parents into any suspicion.Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck are the key names that come to mind when revisiting this movie gem. The humour implemented within is infectious and written cleverly, Ruck and Broderick bounce off one another as on-screen besties both striving to skip the day. We see a unique narrative from Bueller who talks directly to the camera regarding his masterplan. Like all great 80s comedies, Ferris Bueller carries a somewhat exaggerated and unbelievable undertone that adds just the more polish on an already scintillating watch.Amassing over $70 million in the Box-Office, the movie proved a massive hit, rejuvenating the film industry and bringing its value back to the forefront. A fast-paced spectacle with plenty of substance to keep one occupied throughout its 1 hour and 43 minutes, timeless scenes of rushing through back gardens and a memorable eatery phone call, the Hollywood blockbuster is well and truly iconic.A true great, that continues to defy the years.",

Ferris get permission from his parents to stay home from school and rest. Ferris's plan is now to simply cram as much fun and entertainment into his day off as possible. Ferris gets his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and good friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) to take part in his day off.

However Ferris's sister Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey) knows Ferris is not sick and he is conning everyone. She is tied of Ferris's antics and wants to expose him as a fraud. The Dean of Student Ed Rooney is also determined to expose Ferris's sick day off school as nothing but sham.Ferris, Cameron and Sloane have many adventures throughout the day. In amongst the fun and chaos, Ferris gives out little pearls of wisdom about living life to the fullest and enjoying life.This is a fun movie set in the mid1980's, a friendlier and tamer time. There are some cheesy moments but they are outweighed by the overall quality of the movie. The cast is good and gives their character life and meaning. The story and adventures bounce along nicely.",

This confused me because he'd already had 8 days off and he couldn't have another one off. Now correct me if i'm wrong, but doesn't that mean he's already done this EIGHT times? so WHY does he deserve a day off? he doesn't and should be in school. Maybe it's because my mom rocked, but when i didn't feel like going to school because i had a test i didn't study for or something, she let me stay home. however, that's because there was TRUST and i never broke it. This movie spits all over parental/son trust and just everyone in general. I did not find this movie enjoyable in the least. it's the second most overrated movie next to godfather and it's boring and stupid. I felt REALLY bad for the principal and thought Ferris needed to be expelled. then he could have had all the days off he wanted. i saw this for the first time when i was 15 and now i'm 22 and i STILL despise this. The only lesson i gathered is to skip school, wreck a car, and everything will turn out OK. Bull.Ferris Bueller fails the chemistry test, with a 1. out of 10.",

But Matthew Broderick prances through the role as though Ferris were a queen waltzing through Chelsea, so full of himself that it's hard to watch and hard to turn away. Thankfully the supporting roles are actually real people. Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones provide great comedy based in reality, and the sound track is terrific.As Mr. Hughes films progress, either because he had more money to make them or because his taste improved- the music gets better and better.Actually, so does the film making.

            "content": "I didn't like this movie nearly as well as most of my family and acquaintances, when it was originally released. Recently, visiting friends, they had rented it for their teenage daughter, and all watched it one evening. I thought I might enjoy it more, and having lived in Chicago previously, like to see the locales there in any film.However, I liked it even less the second time, and, frankly, have enjoyed looking at information about the film and cast on this site (IMDb) even more than seeing the picture.I found Broderick's character un-funny, annoying, and even obnoxious. It is also interesting and humorous (more than the flick) to see that naughty high-schooler Broderick was 24 when the film was made, and Alan Ruck, his laconic sidekick (also annoying in his droll lethargy) was either 29 (or 30!!). Little sister Jennifer Grey was actually 26 (two years senior to Broderick) - but at least the girlfriend was \"only\" 19. And this assumes none have \"fudged\" a couple of years on age, not uncommon for \"show biz\" personalities Another interesting factoid from this site: the actor and actress portraying the Buehler parents met on this film, and married in real life (but were later divorced at an indeterminate date).Finally, anything as ludicrous as Buehler's boarding the parade float and singing like a nightclub emcee, to the participation and enjoyment of the girls properly on the float, the marching band following, and every onlooker in sight, is not only outrageous, but not in the least bit amusing, also. When this sort of nonsense is put into this type of film, it had better be funny, and this wasn't. Equally outrageous, stupid, and even less humorous (if possible) was Buehler's supposed duping the maitre d' in the swanky restaurant. This wasn't as funny as even the weakest skits, performed every week on SNL or Mad TV - and far more appropriate to one of these.",

The lack of a real story got annoying and the jokes are VERY scattershoot--they come out of nowhere and, more often than not, fall flat. For instance--the two songs during the parade sequence--it is colorful and energetic, but what the hell is it doing in this movie? That's just one example of many.Also, I hated Broderick as Ferris--he comes across as smug, obnoxious and boring. Sara is beautiful and charming but is given nothing to do. Ruck was just whiny.

            "content": "I think you have to be or have been a teacher to feel as though John Hughes' movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is like a student scraping his nails across your blackboard for 90 minutes. When this movie was first released, I happened to see it on a week where a student came tardy to my class, cussed me out when I called him on it, and then had his mother phone and tell me that I was overreacting [for doing what was expected of me] and tell me that she was praying for me. By the time I finished watching the movie, Principal Rooney (ployed by Jeffrey Jones), who was intended as a figure of fun, was a very sympathetic character to me.Anyway, Matthew Broderick plays the title role, an insufferable youngster who appears to have an angel of God at his side. Ferris concocts elaborate schemes for playing hooky from school, yet he manages to endear himself to everyone except Mr. Rooney, who can never quite catch Ferris in the act, and his sister Jennie (Jennifer Grey of \"Dirty Dancing\"), who is justifiably annoyed at Ferris's liberties.One fine spring day, Ferris again fools his parents into thinking he is on Death's doorstep. When they leave for work, Ferris browbeats his downtrodden buddy Cameron (Alan Ruck, later of TV's \"Spin City\") into stealing his father's prized 1961 Ferrari, hijacking Ferris's girlfriend (Mia Sara) from school and going on a joyride.The angel-of-God analogy is particularly apt because the movie seems a latter-day version of deus-ex-machina. And never has a movie seemed so stagy. When Ferris starts talking to the camera (presaging similarly self-conscious '90s movies and TV shows), expounding his theories on life and skipping school, one half-expects to read \"Based on a play by Neil Simon\" in the credits.What a great combination--the self-righteousness of John Hughes and the Broadway smarminess of Matthew Broderick. Two minds without a single thought.And the film in constantly at odds with what it tries to tell us. At one point, Ferris tells us that you'll never get anywhere by kissing people's hindquarters. Yet he can't get anywhere without sucking up to people or manipulating them for his selfish whims.He also complains about his parents being weird. The poor kid--all his parents have ever given him are everything he wants, and more attention than his sister can hope to receive.And how is all of this massive manipulation possible? Because Hughes sets up cardboard characters and emotions. Mr. Rooney is essentially Wile E. Coyote, forever chasing the Road Runner in vain.Ferris's parents are vapid dummies who don't care much about anything. And Ferris is supposedly made lovable by such acts as his hammy performance to get out of school (an old bit when it was used in \"E.T.\") and his lip-syncing to a rock song (which, after Tom Cruise in \"Risky Business\" and Rodney Dangerfield in \"Easy Money,\" was well on its way to become a modern-day movie clich\u00e9).All of the performances are execrable, except for Ruck as Cameron, the put-upon friend. When Cameron vows to take a stand against his dad, the scene almost works, despite its utter gravity, because Cameron has been such a likable dolt up until then. If only we could see a movie about a teenager like *him*, instead of this self-indulgent vehicle about a self-indulgent brat. When John Hughes--a Mel Brooks for high-school geeks--was asked how he prepares his scripts, he said, \"I never start with the jokes. I look at an issue and try to find the story in it...To me, 'Animal House' was a character movie.\" That's funnier than anything in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"",

Convincing his parents that he is too sick to go to school is only the first step of a cunning plan to get his friend Cameron to come over and help him break the beautiful Sloane out of classes. Mission accomplished, they head out to town but Principal Ed Rooney doesn't believe this 'illness' for a second and is determined to catch Bueller out this time.For 75 minutes this film is a slick, enjoyable, silly fantasy that is great fun as it exists in a completely different universe that we all wish we were in. Only in the final 10 minutes does John Hughes suddenly remember that, hey, he's John Hughes and launches into a message ending where endings are made, lessons learned and the 'kids are alright'. Ignoring the inevitable mush this is not a great film anyway \u0096 it is silly, it is total fantasy and it has no logic to it whatsoever; but, damn it, it's a lot of fun! This is why it has stuck in so many people my age minds, because it is pure teenage escapism and, as such, it is silly and a lot of fun to watch. Matching the fun/silly tone of the material the film delivers everything with a knowing wink at the audience the whole way.In doing this it put a lot of weight on Broderick's and Ferris' shoulders. Ferris is not a perfect character but he is good enough to keep the audience with him \u0096 even if now, as an adult, I'd sort of like to wipe that smug smile off his goddamn know-it-all face (sort of)! Anyway, Broderick carries the film's mood very well and he wins the audience with a charismatic 'to-camera' delivery that could easily have been embarrassingly awful. He seems to be having a lot of fun making the film and he manages to put that into his character and it helps the film a lot. A fresh-faced Ruck is also good and it isn't his fault that he is dumped with the hard work of delivering the films last minute lesson and losing the fun. Sara is also given some rubbish to do at the end but basically her role is one of looking pretty and being light on her feet (not like that!). Jones is good fun even if he delivers a fairly genre standard role (although it is an early entry as a fall guy). Small role for Swanson and Sheen make for curiosity value.Overall this is not a great film but it is good fun and works within its own fantasy world setting. The delivery of the stars (especially Broderick) really make sure the material works where it could have been a bit of an embarrassment. Only a typically John Hughes 'what have we learned today?' moment at the end kind of knocks the life out of that \u0096 up till that point it's silly escapism that works if you watch it as such.",

Sorry, but if I had to choose a friend I would choose his buddy, the likable and put upon Cameron, rather than the egotistical jackass that is Ferris. It has good music though which is the only reason it rises above a \"1\" for me.",

            "content": "There's a very easy formula to whether you'll like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or not. And that is whether you find the main character charming or not. Because if you do, this is a nice little comedy about a high school student taking a day off to unwind, to clear his head and to have fun with his friends. And perhaps even help one of those friends stand up to his father.Unfortunately I belong to the latter camp. And to me this is a movie where an entitled little brat decides one day that rules don't apply to him. He blatantly lies to pretty much all the people in his life to get what he wants. He creates dangerous situations, destroys property and doesn't really seem to care about the feelings of others if they're not in alignment with his owns.I really sympathize with Ferris's male friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), here. He's also skipping school on that day, but that's because he's legitimately sick. Nevertheless, he gets dragged out of bed, because Ferris can't possibly have his friend ruining his day by not being there, whether he's sick or not. Plus he needs Cameron's dad's car, because he deserves a sweet ride on this day of days. Sure, the sickness thing is quickly brushed aside and never mentioned again, because the movie can't have you questioning Ferris's decisions, but it's still there. And I remember it.Granted, the movie does have good jokes in it, good scenes. Ferris, played by Matthew Broderick, is a charismatic fellow, explaining why he can get away with all this anarchy.Still, I can't say I'd recommend the film. To me it's filled with bad stereotypes and mixed messages. Some people really like this movie, some people outright worship it. So I guess there's something in it. I just don't see it.",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off is among the most acclaimed and beloved comedy films of its generation. Which is quite startling as this is a very ordinary, frankly disappointing, film. There's not enough fun, not enough laughs. The movie never truly sparks to life. Ferris Bueller had a pretty eventful day. But it doesn't translate. Ferris, the character, probably found his day off to be wildly exciting. Living it is one thing. Watching it is another. For those of us who can only watch it is not particularly exciting at all.It's an absurdly simple story. High school senior Ferris Bueller skips school and, girlfriend and best friend in tow, goes to Chicago and does some stuff. There's a subplot about the school principal who is obsessed with catching Ferris. This subplot falls completely, and rather annoyingly, flat. The principal is an unfunny irritant. Time spent with him is time wasted. We'd rather spend more time with Ferris and his friends. But honestly the time we do spend with them is disappointing as well. Matthew Broderick gives a game performance, infusing Ferris with some personality. But the girlfriend, played by Mia Sara is a dud. A stunningly beautiful dud but a dud nonetheless. And Cameron, the mopey best friend played by Alan Ruck, is a total drag. Ferris tries to get Cameron to loosen up and have a good time. Not happening. And then, in a film which is meant to be escapist fun, things get all too serious as Cameron has to deal with his unseen, overbearing father. The tone here is all wrong. It puts a damper on a film which wasn't even as fun as it is cracked up to be in the first place. The great adventure Ferris went on wasn't so great. It was quite frankly mundane. Laughs are in desperately short supply. The principal is notably annoying and the other supporting characters, including Ferris's sister, add nothing to the proceedings. The device of Ferris breaking the fourth wall and speaking to the camera is overused and wears thin very quickly. All in all this is a very disappointing movie, one which falls far short of the expectations you would have of it given its stellar reputation.",

            "content": "\"Not that I condone fascism, or any -ism for that matter. -Ism's in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself. I quote John Lennon, \"I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me.\" Good point there. After all, he was the walrus.\" \u2013 Ferris Bueller After a short monologue on fascism, wisecracking teenager Ferris Bueller dons the hat of a Marxist revolutionary and sets off on his day of adventure. He's conned his principal into letting him stay home from school, conned his parents into thinking he's sick, and, as the day progresses, will have outsmarted a variety of authoritarian figures.Director John Hughes fills the film with discussions on European socialism, voodoo economics and shots of teachers writing the word \"prison\" on blackboards. The point: life is only worth living if you break free of all imposed structures, diverting your time to friends, art, culture, fine food and knowledge. Bueller thus embodies a kind of unconscious libertarianism, metaphorically opposed to all manners of state intervention. The \"state\" initially taking the form of \"Principal Rooney\", a bumbling careerist who exists to keep Ferris on lock-down. \"The last thing I need is fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples running around these halls!\" Rooney yells. \"He jeopardises my ability to effectively govern this student body!\" But the film is really about Ferris Bueller's best friend, Cameron Frye, and his relationship with his authoritarian father, Morris Frye, an Orwellian character who \"sees everything\" despite never actually being seen. In fact, while Ferris Bueller remains a wisecracking trickster throughout the film, it is Cameron who undergoes the Hero's Journey, undergoing a full transformation and slaying his own personal antagonist at the end.Uptight, unhappy and always unwell, Cameron Frye has spent his entire life bottling up his rage and living in fear of his father. His father's house is itself a spotless tomb, everything encased in glass and plastic, nobody allowed to touch anything. Though invisible, Mr Frye's cold and oppressive means of fatherhood are felt throughout the film, weighing down on Cameron like a lead balloon.Mr Frye's presence is symbolized by his prized possession, a red Ferrari GT. The Ferrari, encased in a glass cage, perfectly polished and never used, is representative of everything Mr Frye adores. Mr Frye wants the whole world in glass, imprisoned and always under scrutiny. Ferris, of course, wants to break the Ferrari out of its cage. He wants Cameron to ride the beast.Intentionally or not, the Ferrari also conjures up images of Enzo Ferrari and fascist Italy, its sleek lines, bright red paint and fetishized machinery reminding us of Mussolini, Nazi chic, the SS and their sexy Hugo Boss designer uniforms etc. Fascism's always been aesthetically pleasing; beauty in total control.Regardless, throughout the film various characters spout the line \"Save Ferris!\" They believe Ferris to be ill and so seek to collect donations to help pay his imaginary hospital bills. The irony, though, is that Ferris organises his entire day off from school precisely because he wishes to \"Save Cameron\" from the illness caused by his father. But only Cameron can save himself. And unless he breaks free, unless he crashes that Ferrari out of its cage, he will always be \"sick\", \"nauseous\" and on the verge of suicide. In other words, the illness is not internal, its external.What's great about the film is the way this \"external illness\" is then \"internalised\" by Ferris' sister, Jeanie. Jeanie, because she isn't able to skip school, do as she pleases and con folk like her brother does, resents Ferris and wishes to see him punished. In Lacanian terms, she is the \"divided subject\", mistakenly believing that some external force is barring her from pleasure. But as Jeanie learns, she is opposed to Ferris' libertarianism for the wrong reasons. She wrongly blames her various familial and social problems on Ferris, instead of facing these problems and attempting to figure out why these conditions exist.So while Cameron's \"internal sickness\" is \"imaginary\" and is really the result of external \"social antagonists\" which he ignores, Jeanie's illness is \"internal\" and the result of an imaginary \"social antagonist\" which she invents. Significantly, these complementary characters (who never meet) are the only two people who change or have story arcs in the film. More importantly, their last act realisations are manifested through action, Cameron and Jeanie only \"alligning themselves\" with Ferris' once they slay Mr Frye and Mr Rooney respectively.This is really just a convoluted way of saying don't blame others (Jeanie) or yourself (Cameron), just identify the real target and kick its ass. If you don't, you'll end up like Cameron (suicidal, blaming one's self) or like Jeanie (bitter, blaming some phantom Other). So be strong, baby, slay your demons and be free like Ferris. Of course this then means that the Mr Rooneys and Mr Fryes of the world become unfortunate scapegoats. Principals, politicians, policemen and parents become the targets for misdirected animosity, a common flaw with all these anti-authoritarian films. In real life, the targets aren't people or figureheads. They're more invisible...elusive.8.5/10 \u2013 Though Ferris has a poster of the obscure band \"Cabaret Voltaire\" on his bedroom wall (the French philosopher Voltaire being a sort of proto-libertarian), the film really embodies a kind of \"ignorant libertarianism\", Ferris really not ready to accept the consequences and challenges of true libertarianism. Hughes seems to know this as well, for while Jeanie and Cameron triumph, we get the sad impression that Ferris will head back to school, marry and have a fairly dull life.",

How can anyone not admire Ferris's (Matthew Broderick) love of life, and then the bad things that befall Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones)? In my opinion, the best scene in the movie is when Ferris sings \"Twist and Shout\". I felt like I wanted to jump into the movie and start dancing to it. Of course, there's also the econ teacher (Ben Stein) drolly reading \"Bueller...Bueller\". Some of the stuff that Jeanie (Jennifer Grey, of \"Dirty Dancing\" fame) did made her one Jeanie to truly dream of.Another really great scene is when Jeanie and Katie (Cindy Pickett) are driving home and Katie is chewing Jeanie out for making a phony phone call and killing a potential business deal, when Ferris runs by and Jeanie stops the car, scattering Katie's papers. Jeanie glares at Ferris, but Katie doesn't even look up. And then Ferris runs away and Jeanie floors the gas pedal, further scattering Katie's papers. How they all kept straight faces I'll never figure out! Anyway, this is truly a comedy classic. It goes to show that John Hughes reached his apex in the mid to late '80s. Why was it that in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads? Also starring Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Edie McClurg, Lyman Ward and Kristy Swanson.In conclusion: OH...YEAH!",

Simply put, it's the story of one young man's struggle to take it easy.The title character is played by Matthew Broderick and, for me, that's where the problems start. I'm not a Broderick fan at the best of times and here it's twice as bad since he's playing a character that I find it very difficult to like. I blame John Hughes's script for giving little or no justification of why Ferris is almost universally liked.Ferris's pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) is a little more engaging but his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) serves no discernible function other than that of eye-candy. Easily the best effort in the acting department comes from Jeffrey Jones who gives an iconic performance as the dean who's out to get Ferris.Considering these characters, the story is unsurprisingly slight. The trio basically drive around town in a Ferrari and supposedly live life to its fullest, though in actuality doing little of consequence. Adding just a smidgen of depth to the proceedings is the introduction of a crisis that will force Cameron to decide if he'll finally start standing up to his father.The direction by John Hughes (who was also the screenwriter) is well handled though not particularly remarkable. The soundtrack is a typical 80's melange, complete with Yello's soon-to-be-clich\u00e9 \"Oh Yeah\". I would say that the production values are solid but they're not going to turn the tide if you can't connect with the characters.If you have fond memories of this film then I doubt that they'll be dashed by seeing it again but if you didn't see it back in the 80's then I wouldn't really recommend seeing it now.",

I was not even 10 when it came out, and it is not until now that I have appreciated it a level beyond the basic comedy. It has comedy for sure, of all kinds. Slapstick, absurdity, farce, comedy-of-errors, comedy-of-manners, puns, shock, swearing, satire, parody, and on and on.But is so much more than an outstanding comedy. It has real philosophy that is not sophomoric (they're seniors and juniors...haha). This comes in Ferris's asides, but also in what the characters say when they are not joking.It has some complete non-sequiturs and montages that really make you ponder the characters and that capture what it is like to be young in a way that you almost never see, e.g., them looking down from the Sears Tower, the scene at the art musuem, etc.Why? Well, real teenagers can almost never make enduring art, so they have a hard time capturing what its like to be young in any way beyond the surface. You have to know what it fleeting about youth to capture it and you only know that once you're not young any more. A 17 year old writing this movie couldn't capture youth because youth are just to callow and to inexperienced with life. But adults, even when they try to write about youth, often infuse that feeling with too much importance that isn't present when you're young. It gets too nostalgic, or treacly, or whatever.But with FBDO, John Hughes just takes your mind back to what it was like to be about to graduate high school.Yes, these are all privileged white kids. Yes, the whole move is extra white and extra privileged. Minorities are relegated to some really insulting stereotypical parts. So in that regard, it has not aged well at all.BUT! This movie still captures late adolescence perfectly. That feeling of knowing your childhood is about to disappear and missing it already, but being excited about your unknown future that seems to stretch out forever ahead of you. And scared at the same time.It just leaves you feeling warm and reminiscent and happy to be an adult, but really glad you were a kid.I also like that Ferris, for all his likability, is a flawed character. He is a narcissist. But he's 17 (maybe 18). He hurts Cameron's feelings over and over in a way that is close to bullying or gaslighting. But protagonists shouldn't be perfect. And Ferris's flaws illustrate those of the other characters in a way that is very illuminating.All these characters have a depth that is so lacking (except maybe the dad). Certainly Sloane and Cameron and Ferris are totally three dimensional. But even his sister, and mom are shown as real people too.But then you have totally INSANE absurd non-sequiturs thrown in. The principal is an absolute cartoon. So is his secretary. The BONKERS way everyone in town is pulling for Ferris. I mean, they paint a WATERTOWER in like an hour?!?! The parking lot joyride. Abe Froman!? The whole parade sequence?! It is just crazy how all that happens and the movie still feels \"real.\"An absolute joy to watch. I haven't seen a comedy this deep in years. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, another John Hughes movie is probably similar in that regard. They do not make them like this much any more. Even 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, for all their dealing with \"big issues\" seem to be inhabited by cardboard cutouts (the stoner, the hectoring girlfriend/wife) compared to this film.Watch it every couple years.

Forget Sixteen Candles and Weird Science, if you cannot handle such constant comparisons, get a life and start thinking.Matthew Broderick has never grown out of the image he created with Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he never will.  His poise is correct for the character, proving that John Hughes can make some proper casting decisions.  His wise-ass comments are not as clever as Judd Nelson's in TBC, but raise Ferris' character level beyond Bender's.Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Jones are the real saving graces of this film. Anthony Michael Hall was smart to turn down the part of Cameron because it would be out of his line and, while Ruck never went onto anything better, he did make his declaration here.  Jeffrey Jones' Rooney is absolutely in line because, perhaps, he is the only one sans Broderick to understand the overwhelming parody of the movie.  I am extremely thankful that Hughes didn't use Molly Ringwald (again) because she is unable to expand on his paper-thin roles.  Mia Sara is no better, but at least she has fewer lines.Hughes is more artistic here (in an MTV fashion) and Broderick knows how to exploit this change to his advantage.  The editing is both efficient and superior to TBC, but here it is merely editing for the sake of comedy and pacing whereas TBC tried developing character.  The script, conventional Hughes as it is (see my Breakfast Club comment), has some key points that both age it and retain its value at the same time.Though Hughes' movies are for teens, their level of credibility ranges from innocent (as in this case) to insulting (Weird Science anyone?), thus I find TBC to be more insightful in the long run.  Ferris Bueller has its moments, but there are no long-standing messages to take away other than Cameron's fits.  Unfortunately, since Ferris' world is so focused on youth, the distant world of adults is falls into the similar problems of TBC except here it is merely for laughs.  There are no brief moments of self-discovery for Ed Rooney.Overall, I give this a tied recommendation level with TBC due to shifts in tone and ideas, but recommended this for anyone between 14-22 years old. 3.5 out of 5 stars.

He's simply going to what he wants on that day.With two chosen companions Mia Sara and Alan Ruck, Broderick goes off and just has his day. Of course he feigns illness so that parents Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward just think Broderick is under the covers suffering.Something about Broderick's flouting all the rules and conventions of the day just gets to certain people. One of them is his sister Jennifer Grey. The other and the Wile E. Coyote of the piece is assistant principal Jeffrey Jones. For whatever reasons that drive this man he has made it his life's ambitions to nail Matthew Broderick in the act of doing something he ought not. Jones really got a career role out of this film. So did to a lesser extent Broderick. I think you would get a more varied response if you were ask people to name the role they associate with his name.You can see why in the years of the Brat Pack this John Hughes film struck such a chord. The kids are cool and hip although in the case of Ruck trying to be. And the adults are symbolized by Jones, just uptight and rather stupid.In fact in a scene at a police station Jennifer Grey meets up with Charlie Sheen who was getting his first notice. If you can imagine an outlaw kid like Sheen plays convincing Grey she ought to embrace her brother's rebellion.One wonders now that Ferris Bueller and Matthew Broderick are not forty somethings how they feel about their kids flouting the rules.",

But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",

            "content": "When you're able to ditch maturity and associate with Ferris Bueller's bright characteristics, you'll experience one hell of a day off. John Hughes certainly knows how to cleverly and victoriously deliver that intention, all by simply just creating quirky characters and stirring them within amusing events. From there and on, every touch and every moment is perfect.Matthew Broderick's Ferris Bueller is energetic, enthusiastic and couldn't be portrayed any brighter, being quirky without becoming overly weird. There's two types of labeled characters in Ferris Bueller's Day Off; the fun ones and the sensible ones. They're identities are exactly what they're titled as, and it's a huge lot of fun to witness them sort of versing to get their way throughout the lively day. You can take agreement and sympathy to either of the perspectives, but there's really only one winner at the end of the day.The fizz of the characters always contributes to the rest of the story. The whole movie is enjoyable fun, all whilst making you actually laugh out loud and bringing you a sense of brightness. Ferris also approaches several moments in which he'll hilariously talk to the audience and lead OUR way through a fantastic day off, whilst being hunted down by his principle. In the sense that there's the threat towards the protagonists inflicted by their responsible principle, this film is sort of like another coming-of-age classic by John Hughes: The Breakfast Club. It's even got some of The Breakfast Club's dramatic conversation and can-relate talks, but in this case, it's mainly when Cameron talks about his father.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

The films message; Take a break from the mundane-take a 'Day off'-escape the banality of everyday life and find adventure. Whats wrong with that you might say? Well privileged little Ferris Bullers life is anything but mundane. He gets to drive around in a ferarri with a supermodel girlfriend in a world where he never has to take responsibility for his own actions, then sits there earnestly telling us about ''life passing him by?'' I wanted to throw things at the screen. Hughes completely misses the point in the same way Ben Stiller did recently with his awful ''Secret Life of Walter Mitty''; these people seeking something more from life already lead perfect lives so its impossible to to relate to them or understand what they have to feel hard done by about. The film is not really a Bildungsroman, it does not really deal with coming of age; its kind of a bastard relative of the baby boomer movies from the 70s but made for the brat pack generation. We are expected to root for a spoiled overachiever who believes the universe revolves around him and, as others have correctly pointed out, seems to demonstrate sociopathic personality traits.

The late John Hughes truly made memorable cinema in here. He's truly missed! What a talented personality he was! Tak Fujimoto's Cinematography also caught my attention, as it was spot-on.Performance-Wise: Matthew Broderick is excellent as Ferris Bueller. Alan Ruck is outstanding. Mia Sara does a good job, while Jeffrey Jones is magnificent as the antagonist and brings in a host of laughs. Jennifer Grey is extreme likable. Charlie Sheen makes a fine appearance. Edie McClurg leaves a mark. Others support well.On the whole, Go for Ferris Bueller! This one's a Classic! Two Thumbs Up!",

The attempt may backfire in more than one ways. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" thankfully stays crisp till the end, a genre-defining film that manages to revive you with a fresh verve on a familiar concept. No, I'm not saying its the best film I've seen on the subject but it's a thoroughly enjoyable fare that wasn't aiming for that anyway. Or was it? Doesn't matter. It manages to charm in many ways, and that's the whole point.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenage miscreant who fakes an illness to skip school on a beautiful summer day. Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), his best friend, decides to join him in his plans to spend a memorable albeit intuitive day. Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) is also picked up by them from school right under the supervision of the dean, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who is out to nail Ferris for his poor attendance record. As the gang spends the day roaming around the city, Rooney repeatedly tries to apprehend Ferris but to no avail. Ferris' sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), jealous of her brother's ability to wriggle out of any tight situation, longs to catch him fooling around. The story revolves around how Ferris and his friends spend an entire day that is both unforgettable and life-changing.\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" starts off on a great note, with a few of the film's funniest scenes playing out in the first-half itself. Broderick sneaks into his character effortlessly, being charming and fascinating from the very beginning and never letting his character be someone you won't like. Apart from the many things that impressed me, I was most inspired by how director John Hughes made it seem all so familiar. I chuckled at how many of the scenes in the movie took me back to certain points in my life when I faced a similar situation, and when you're reminded of something like that in a movie, you know that the director has done his job well. The characters are endearing, likable and that helps when the film starts to slog after a while. Hughes has always been great at creating rascally characters who are affable enough to carry a parodic story to its end. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is no different. It doesn't even seek to try anything else other than delight you with its vigor and observations. And, in parts, it's pretty hilarious.When attempting a coming-of-age film, one should keep his indulgences in check. Though \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" targets the younger generation, I found it a tad too childish. And that's not entirely bad, but after a while, I found it difficult to invest into the characters. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a corpus of the fantasies of an average teenager, which is also the reason why the touch of pragmatism is almost entirely abandoned. Hughes creates a world where nothing can go wrong for his protagonist, where everything is sorted out with absurd ease and a few clever pranks. The character of Ferris Bueller is a synecdoche, just a synecdoche. If you like him, you'll like the movie. But if you don't, you might find it more annoying than amusing. Me, I liked him when he first came on-screen but I found my likeness wearying as the story progressed. But your viewpoint about the him may differ.Broderick, in his most important role to date, infuses Ferris with charm and wit that gives the movie its legs. It's a candid performance and surely Broderick's best. Sara is absolutely gorgeous to look at and she brings a quiet confidence to her role. Ruck is fascinating as Cameron, and when I grew tired of Ferris' antics, I found myself looking forward to watching Ruck's elucidation of his character. He hands in a wonderfully nuanced performance and the best of the lot.\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a watchable film, supremely entertaining, a good-looking film with its heart in the right place. Though I was expecting it to really dig into the genre, and was disappointed when it chose to stay away from being too ambitious and played it safe instead, it's one of those films that delights in everything it does. And a movie like that is hard to come by.",

I thought it was great when I first watched in back in the eighties and having just watching it again think it has lost none of its charm. While some of the technology seen in the film is old the film itself doesn't seem dated at all.Ferris Bueller is a seventeen year old high school student who has decided to feign illness so that he can take the day off and enjoy himself in the city. He is joined on his escapade by his friend Cameron who is off school because he really is sick and his girlfriend Sloane who gets let out of school when Cameron phones in, claiming to be her father, saying her grandmother has died. They head off to the city in Cameron's father's pride and joy; a 1961 Ferrari 250GT California. Once there they see the sights narrowly avoiding being caught a few times along the way; they probably learn much more than they would have had they stayed in school.While Ferris and his friends are out enjoying their day school principal Ed Rooney is sure that Ferris is faking his illness and he is determined to prove it. The only other person who believes Ferris is faking it is his sister Jeanie who is fed up with how he always seems to get away with everything.This is one of the great eighties teen movies created by the master of the genre, the film is full of memorably scenes that contain lots of classic lines.

His other films are in the suburbs, but this one really shows off the skyline in a beautiful fashion. New York and Los Angeles get plenty of attention... it's nice to give the Midwest a little bit of love from time to time.Anyway, if nothing else, the film is full of Ferris Bueller wisdom: \"Life moves pretty fast.

However, after some while, I could guess exactly where this movie was going, and surely knew it wouldn't bring anything new or extraordinary to the genre. Even Charlie Sheen worked in this picture, looking like a vampire from \"Twilight\"; I could barely recognize him being that young-- I'm more used to his age in \"Two and a Half Men\" era. Main character is a sharpie guy that fools everybody and, in the end, gets away with murder. His sister, a correct girl that does everything right, ends up being labeled as the bad guy off the story. These scenes are at least useful to remind us that good people always end up being misunderstood. Obviously this film inspired many of modern teen comedies, such as \"American Pie\", \"Not Another Teen Movie\", \"Road Trip\", among others. I confess that I enjoyed 1988's \"License to Drive\" much more than this one, even thought that movie copied many aspects of this. Also, Marlon Wayans' productions are much better in making you laugh. All in all, it's an interesting movie for the time it was released, but offers nothing different of modern comedies.",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller's Day off is practically a step by step guide to taking a day off from school, although it requires some elaborate equipment and schemes, both of which Ferris has in abundance, to much chagrin from his sister and the school principal whom are not fooled by his schemes.Ferris has decided to take his ninth day off with his best friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloane. With the principal hot on their tails Ferris and Co. drive around town in Cameron's father's Ferrari, go see a baseball match, eat at a fancy restaurant and watches a parade (well Ferris participate in it to some extent).This movie is fun to watch mostly due to the principal and Cameron but also due to the elaborate schemes of Ferris and the way he tricks his parents into believing that he's really sick (the father even 'sees' his son a couple of times but for some reason dosn't recognize him?????) It has some pretty stupid moments (like the above mentioned scenes with the father). But these dos not ruin the movie in any way.The acting is okay, not award winning but satisfactory enough: Matthew Broderick does a okay job at portraying Ferris Bueller; the scheming kid. Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye; the somewhat insecure kid; is probable the actor that does the best work here, especially considering that he at the time was near 30 years (well above the normal age of a high school kid). Mia Sara as Sloane Peterson does an fairly anonymous performance, this can be due to the fact that the character doesn't do that much in the first place. Jeffrey Jones does a splendid job as Edward R. Rooney; the school principal; in fact his performance also candidates to the best alongside Ruck's. Jennifer Grey plays Jeanie Bueller; Ferris's sister; with a pretty stuck up trait, this is probably how she's supposed to play it but in comes out somewhat single minded. In smaller roles we have Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Del Close as English Teacher, both does a fairly boring impression, but this is in most cases how teachers seem; boring and dry (actually this is how Ben Stein plays most of the roles I have seen him in). In cameo roles we have Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley, Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, both does okay especially Sheen.All in all I give this 6 out of 10. If you like either Broderick, Ruck or Jones then see this you won't regret it. If your not that big a Broderick fan then it depends on how small a fan of him you are whether or not you'll like this.",

Matthew Broderick stars as the antithesis of Hughes' usual sad sack heroes, a smarmy, cocksure, insanely popular high school senior with an optimistic, yet realistic, outlook on life who decides to cut school along with his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and best friend (Alan Ruck) and spend the day seeing the sights of Chicago; meanwhile his antagonist, Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), plots his capture. Broderick is genuinely charming and perfectly cast as the sophisticated yet sweetly dorky kid that the director clearly wishes he had been and when Broderick's doing nothing but cajoling and insinuating, he fills the film with a heart that Hughes' other films sorely lack. It's all terrific, inspired fun until the third act when Hughes trudges out his usual collegiate psychobabble aimed squarely at the lesser characters of Ruck and Sara; then the whole thing submerges into the usual deep self-pity that renders his movies unbearable.

            "content": "I've kept coming back to this film over the years and am firmly convinced that besides being John Hughes's finest work, it is THE teen comedy. Hilariously perfect in every respect.Sensibly eschewing the wholesale teenage angst of many of his other pre-adult films, Hughes just focuses wholly on comedy tinged with a liberal dose of gentle satire, which is generally manifested in a continuous Mickey-taking of adult behaviour. In Ferris's world adults don't understand the teenagers in their care, be it Ferris's parents or the high school principal Mr Noonan, who makes it his mission in life to catch Ferris in the act of doing something he shouldn't be doing. His litany of comedic failures contrast markedly with Ferris's success in doing all the things in just one epic day off school, that many of us might not have the nerve to do in a lifetime. He is aided and accompanied in his adventures with girlfriend Sloane and best pal Cameron.The casting is perfect with Matthew Broderick excelling as the exuberant, witty hero in what is undoubtedly his most famous role. Not to be outshone though is Alan Ruck in what is arguably his most beloved role as the also talented, but far less self-confident Cameron. Amazingly, the near 30 year old Ruck convincingly looks the part. Mia Sara is suitably elegant as Sloane, whilst Jeffrey Jones uproariously and inevitably plays the hapless coyote, to Ferris's always superior road runner. One cannot look past Jennifer Grey either, as Ferris's bitter but attractive younger sister, Jeanie. Both Charlie Sheehan's (police station) and Ben Stein's (form teacher) cameos are not to be missed by anyone ... anyone?The Windy City of Chicago plays its extremely functional part in all of its late spring (actually early autumn) glory. Memorable side trips include the observation deck of Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, the Chicago Art Institute and the stand out Von Steuben's Day Parade where the famous lip-sync of Twist and Shout occurs with a good deal of both improvised and choreographed dancing among the crowd.Hughes's decision to have his lead character frequently break the fourth wall was a winner, as were the many striking camera angles used and the music selected for the soundtrack.John Hughes passed away far too early. But in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, he left a lasting legacy full of cross-generational appeal. It's a classic!",

            "content": "Even today, I've wondered why this film is so loved by many people today. I guess it's because it was made during the decade that will never die, the 1980's. I've often felt that the reason people cherish the 80's is because the 1990's and the oughts of 2000 haven't got anything to distinguish them. Even in 2002 or 2003, we seem to be still stuck in the 1990's. Unless this decade has a style that will distinguish it, the 1980's will continue to be beloved. All the excesses of the 1980's are here.The story is pretty simple: Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick), a young man who seems to be in a class by himself, fakes an illness so he and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (the cute Mia Sara) and best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) can traipse through Chicago. While he's out there, his \"enemies\" are out to ruin his afternoon. Jeffrey Jones is Ed Rooney, the Principal of his HS who is trying to bust Ferris for past truancy and is out to look for him. Jennifer Grey (who looked ancient in this film and was dating Broderick at the time) plays his older sister Jeanie, who wants to also ruin the day for him but ends up being the one with the bad day.Yes, the film has decent acting and is a somewhat fun romp, but the film was made to once again show everyone why the 80's was such a storied decade. The excesses are here: the big dance and song routine at the parade, Grey's outfit, the fact that Ferris' mother (Cindy Pickett) has a more hip hairstyle than her daughter, etc. You could never remake this one today, the 2000's haven't earned any distinct image yet. Not a favorite of mine, but I can understand those 80's lovers fawning over this. I guess I prefer to revere the 80's through video games like Grand Theft Auto:Vice City and Activision Anthology and the music (not the videos).",

That's just a brief history of a movie that I think is actually really overrated, frankly. But how come? The story in this is about a teen wise guy named Ferris who pretends to be sick so that he can force his friend to go and lie to get his girlfriend out of school so that the 3 can spend a day in Chicago. The problem with the story is that its just weak. I mean, just a highly sophisticated plan for a day off of school? That's not all. There's no emotional journey for the protagonist, no real drama, and no heartwarming moments. There's also no message. I mean, this film is so lighthearted they lacked all those things. But one thing people might be wondering, is at least funny? Well, the movie actually has some really great humor and plus its a little enjoyable to watch with a great soundtrack. But that still doesn't make up for the pitiful main story. Also, one really bad thing about this movie is that it makes skipping school when there's something important like a test without permission from your parents or teachers so that you can have fun look cool, which is a not a good message at all. I give it a 4.5/10 The characters in this movie. Let me say that they are just one dimensional with no development. First off, our main character, Ferris, is a high school hot shot who's selfish, unlikable when he bully's his Ill friend to go on the trip, and a liar. Like I said, he makes skipping school and being selfish look cool. He is an absolutely terrible role model for kids. His ill friend Cameron, is a character that you can feel bad for because of not wanting to be on the trip to Chicago but he's actually a great guy whose honest, kind, and doesn't find Ferris's selfish acts cool. Ferris's girlfriend Sloane is just a one dimensional girl who agrees to go to Chicago and forgettable. The \"Villain\" Principal Ed Rooney, is actually good because of trying to bust Ferris, but pointlessly bumbles around the suburbs doing so and has no development, but he's a bit funny. Then there's Ferris's sister, Jeanie, who is aware of Ferris's whereabouts. She's very bland and instantly forgettable.So overall, Ferris Beullers day of is funny, has great music and is enjoyable, but it still has a weak story, and lacks any real drama, emotion, and character development. The characters are all one dimensional with a couple of bland ones. So this movie is just a light hearted comedy, and if you want a movie with a valuable message, this is not it.",

Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), the dean of their high school who's out to catch them by any means necessary, and Ferris's younger sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who resents his free-spirited ways and for always getting away with his complex schemes.That alone would be enough to make the movie last for its two hour running time, but John Hughes, that \"adolescent philosopher\" (in the words of the late film critic Roger Ebert) who also made \"Sixteen Candles\" (1984) and \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) and understood the teenage condition better than anyone else in his time, seems to have other things on his mind.In keeping up with one key theme from his two previous features, Hughes examines how the events of a single fateful day can forever change the lives of his teenage protagonists. In \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" Ferris Bueller faking being sick in order to ditch school is actually less about him having a good time in downtown Chicago than it is about helping his high-strung best friend Cameron develop some much-needed self-respect in order to stand up to a bullying and neglectful father. (In short, while the film is ultimately about Matthew Broderick's title character, its true emotional center is Alan Ruck's troubled Cameron Frye and his overcoming a dysfunctional family life.)Of course, this doesn't mean that \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is devoid of the usual teen movie antics. This movie is laugh-out funny; its laughs haven't diminished one bit over the years. I haven't seen \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" in a good long while; the film was a perennial favorite of mine during my early teen years in the late '90s, and I remember watching the film almost to the point of memorization during that time. In watching the film again today for the first time in years, it has yet to lose any of its appeal. Matthew Broderick was perfect for the role of Ferris Bueller, and it remains his most famous film role to date - though, one should not overlook his commanding performance in the Civil War drama \"Glory\" (1989). He's as appealing and charming as he's ever been, or will ever be.Now here, and in closing, we get a little bit personal. In watching this film today, it was a very conscious decision on my part. I realized I myself needed a \"day off\" - by enjoying a movie that's about leisure and taking it easy and forgetting your problems. And just having a good laugh. In getting over the recent failure of a really difficult relationship, I found a sense of peace and catharsis in this film that I didn't realize would be there. It's proof to me, that this movie isn't really dated - though it is very much a product of its era in the mid-'80s.I would recommend that anyone who needs a \"day off\" from the troubles of everyday life, watch \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" I promise you, it'll be the best \"day off\" you'll ever have.10/10P.

His parents don't even get a hint of what he is up to!! The movie is a dark spot for parental/kids relationship. I feel sorry for those who liked such a movie but I would never want my kids to see such a movie. I did not like anybody's acting either! If there was a lower rating than one (1) star for this I would have definitely gone for that.",

I haven't seen him in anything else except the 1998 \"Godzilla\" remake, but for me, this role kind of typifies for me his personality as an actor. I'm kind of surprised by the haters who reviewed this movie negatively because it appeared to be done in good fun and in the spirit of those old time Warner Brothers cartoons in which Wile E. Coyote is consistently outsmarted by the Road Runner. Jeffrey Jones portrays Wile E. of course, experiencing a series of escalating disasters as he tries to 'get the goods' on Ferris on his ninth day off from school. Personally, I would never have come up with the devious measures Ferris concocted to sidetrack his parents and Principal Rooney (Jones) while he tooled around the city with pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara). Highlight of the picture was Ferris commandeering the parade float with his version of 'Danke Schoen' and the Beatles' 'Twist and Shout', both very colorful and well choreographed. The picture might have taken Bueller's popularity to an extreme though, with schoolmates collecting money for a kidney operation, and the big city newspaper touting 'Community Rallies Around Sick Youth'. A little overkill there, but the whole picture was pretty much a parody so best to take it all in stride. Only thing is, as slick and smart as Ferris was, he was wrong about John Lennon. I'm pretty sure everyone knows the walrus was Paul.",

            "content": "From writer (Home Alone) and director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club; Planes, Trains & Automobiles), I remember seeing this once before, but I needed a second viewing to appreciate it even more. Basically street-wise teenager Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) convinces his parents, mother Katie (Cindy Pickett) and father Tom (Lyman Ward), that he has a serious illness forcing him to stay home and miss a school test. In reality he is faking to take the day off, and he has plenty of tricks, gizmos and back-ups to make sure he has little chance of getting caught. To make his nice spring day much more enjoyable he needs his best friend Cameron Frye (Speed's Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) to join him. Knowing how often he has been absent from school, overly suspicious Dean Ed Rooney (Beetle Juice's Jeffrey Jones) knows Ferris well, and he wants to catch him in the act this time. Ferris, Cameron and Mia meanwhile have taken the convertible Ferrari 250 GT California, beloved by Cameron's father, to have a city adventure in Chicago. In the day they take the Ferrari to a garage with two untrustworthy attendants, eat at a fancy restaurant stealing someone else's reservation, watch a ball game, visit an art gallery, and take part in an annual parade. The parents have been fooled by Ferris's contraptions and stuff to thinking he is still at home in bed, but Rooney is going to all lengths to prove he isn't. So he goes to one or two places before going to the Bueller residence to find Ferris himself, and suffering all the humiliations of the house, e.g. mud, the dog. After a long day, Ferris, Cameron and Mia take the Ferrari back, but Cameron decides when it gets damaged, oh, and goes speeds backwards down the hill, to stand up to his father. Also seen in the story by the way is Ferris's sister Jeanie (Dirty Dancing's Jennifer Grey) who is resentful and jealous of Ferris, because he gets away with loads and she doesn't. In the end, Ferris races home to be there at the time his father said he would return, and when it looks like Rooney has busted, Jeanie backs him up and he gets away with it all. Also starring Edie McClurg as Grace, young Charlie Sheen as Boy in Police Station, The Mask's Ben Stein as Economics Teacher and Kristy Swanson as Simone Adamley. I love teen movies like American Pie, and this is considered by many as the ultimate skiving film, and with great performances by Broderick, Ruck and Jones, and early appearances by Grey and Sheen, it is good fun comedy. It was number 26 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",

            "content": "Normally I'm not big on John Hughes's 80s movies, but there are some exceptions that do spring to mind (Breakfast Club is fun to watch when it pops up on TV, his script to Vacation is always very funny, and he had some underrated films with Planes Trains & Automobiles and especially with Uncle Buck). This, however, comes to mind as being a thoroughly enjoyable movie for kids, teens, adults, old people, etc, as it has that universal core- school stinks, enough to have one epic cut day, perhaps. Also at this core are some extremely good performances elevating the material. Matthew Broderick is in one of his most memorable parts as the title character, faking sick so he can a) get his friend Cameron (Alan Ruck, arguably his best role and performance to date), a closet-case, to allocate his father's golden calf in the form of a 61 Ferrari, b) get a friend, Sloane (Mia Sara) out of class, and c) take a tour of Chicago that forms as substantiative on its own and as a kind of fill-in-the-blank for other kids watching the film. What would you do on a day off? Some of the dumber parts of the movie, however still very funny and almost perfectly played depending on the scene, come from Jeffrey Jones as the smarmy, determined principal. And rounding out the cast is Jennifer Grey (pre-new nose) as the suspicious, jealous sister Bueller. All in all, even with sophomoric and diluted moments, it's an overall excellent chance at material that is just a lot of fun, even in its more dramatic moments. Darker issues are dealt with, such as with Cameron (and dealt on the somewhat shallow level of Hughes movies that only really broke with Breakfast Club). But in the end you watch the film for the all-too-memorable lines, kitschy moments, crazy turns at using the camera for comedy (as it pulls out of Cameron's mouth as he screams over the car), and music that is quintessentially catchy 80s. Funniest scene though is the call of Norm Peterson, on par with the funniest scenes in all modern comedy.",

He is perfectly cast, as is Mia Sara, the attractive girlfriend, and Alan Ruck, Ferris' ever paranoid and worrying friend Cameron who supplies the trio with their 'choice' transport, a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. Also great value are Jeffrey Jones as the Dean of Students from hell who is determined to catch Ferris, and Jennifer Grey as the insanely jealous sister with an attitude. Charlie Sheen drops by with a cameo as a drug fiend with some friendly advice.While one of Hughes' best teen comedies, the movie still has his trademark misplaced scenes. Much of the attempts at drama are corny, the serious moments don't work and any moral messages fall flat. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" works best sending itself and other films up. Some very clever comedy is evident and Hughes produces some hilarious scenes including two terrific running gags involving firstly an over the top \"Save Ferris\" campaign and secondly a little tune called \"Auf Wiedersehn\". Broderick talks to the camera through much of the film which proves to be relatively effective.Friday, May 19, 1995 - Video",

            "content": "\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\" Ah, wise words from our new young friend, Ferris Bueller. In John Hughes's 1986 film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, all Ferris wants to do is take a day and have fun. That is the most simplistic theme the movie has. You can go deeper, but the main takeaway is that it is okay to have fun. That is a motto I have taken to heart. I really loved the film. People consider The Breakfast Club to be Hughes's best and most important movie. That's a fine statement to make, but I would personally rank the film number two behind this particular one. The teen characters are instantly relatable, it has a memorable antagonist for the children, and this is basically a thirty-year-old travel guide for Chicago. Just how Woody Allen creates his movies as love letters for New York, this is applicable for John Hughes. A Chicago love letter!Like all of his films, Hughes wrote his own script. Due to possible picketing from the writer's guild, Hughes wrote a basic first draft that had a beginning and an ending. The middle would be made up as production ensued. The first cut of the film was nearly three hours long, so the rest of the screenplay would be completed in the editing room if that made sense. Hughes, always the adolescent philosopher, wrote a very familiar screenplay. Teens that are relatable and one-dimensional adults who do not believe in the word \"fun.\" Somehow, these adult antagonists seem to make the history books as the roles to remember. Just as I remember Paul Gleason's principal role in The Breakfast Club, I certainly remember Jeffrey Jones's dim-witted Ed Rooney here. Hughes takes time to develop his characters which should come as no surprise.I guess if you were going to commit truancy, you would want to follow in the footsteps of our main hero, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick). All he wanted to do was take a day off from school. He enlists his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) to steal his father's red Ferrari. The duo, along with Ferris's girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), head into Chicago for a day to check out the sites; the architectural landmarks, the art museum, the fancy restaurant, Wrigley Field, and an American-German parade where \"Danke Schoen\" and \"Twist and Shout\" might be key songs to remember. Meanwhile, Principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is hellbent in capturing Ferris. He might have an ally in Ferris's moody but really pretty sister Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey).Hughes always wanted Matthew Broderick as Ferris. Broderick possesses a charm that is not seen in many modern actors. After watching the film, you could obviously see why Broderick and only him was cast in the lead role. Broderick had a close friendship with Alan Ruck which led to great chemistry between the actors. Despite being 29, Ruck did make a believable high school student. He was excellent and captured the true feelings of a high school student not wanting to go to school. Mia Sara is beautiful, but she wasn't given much to do. Molly Ringwald wanted to play this role, but Hughes cautioned her for good reason apparently. Yes, Ed Rooney is a one-dimensional, child-hating character but my gosh is Jeffrey Jones ever memorable. I love the scene where the dogs sic him and is forced to ride a bus. Hehe. Jennifer Grey is fantastic! Finally, a shoutout goes to Ben Stein and his monotonous lecture on economics.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a wholesome, incredibly fun film. There is nothing mean-spirited to see. It is all about teens wanting to have a good time. If I were to be truant, this is how I would want my day to go. The other theme is Ferris wanting to lift the spirits of his best friend from his materialistic father. A more subtle theme, but I appreciate it. This is one of those movies that is wholesome, but also incredibly funny. I laughed too many times to count and that is a rarity. Great performances and great fun add up to John Hughes's best film. Yes, I rank it higher than The Breakfast Club.My Grade: A",

Practically every kid that feels stuck in the walls of an institution such as high school is going to get these urges, and for all of those kids, Ferris Bueller is their hero. Matthew Broderick brings a warm, innocent charm to the title role as a young man who has luck on his side. Everything goes his way, from worming his best friend (Alan Ruck) into taking his father's rare Ferrari, to warding off the high school principal (Jeffrey Jones) to getting his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school as well.Writer/director John Hughes takes his love for teenagers and school situations and gives us a story that deals with life outside school and the freedoms and privileges of being a kid. What Ferris does is, as they say, getting away with murder, but it is such a joy to watch him get into predicaments and wonder how can he possibly get out of this one. Broderick is a delight, as are the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Grey as his envious sister. This movie is about luck and what that power can do for you. It is also about enjoying life and the power that can do. It is the ultimate skipping school movie and is one of Hughes' best efforts as a writer and director.

The epitome of '80s cinema and one of the greatest comedies of all time! Save Ferris!",

And on different levels too. There's nice verbal, visual and physical comedy, all directed with class and style by the much missed John Hughes.Ferris should actually be quite an unlikeable character, I mean he breaks rules, he's rude, and he's a liar, but in the hands of Matthew Broderick he becomes the epitome of cool.With a great soundtrack and supporting cast it is very easy to see why this film has become such a huge hit, that people introduce modern teens too.",

            "review_title": "Probably the Best Teen Comedy",
            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a 10/10 in my book and one of my favorite comedies, especially of the teen genre. The only other teen comedy I gave a 9 or 10 to is \"10 Things I hate about you\". In my opinion \"Ferris Bueller\" is not only John Hughes best film, but one of the best comedies in general. The three lead actors are terrific, the supporting cast is also great, and the film moves along nicely, leaving the audience feeling as if they joined Ferris on the day's adventure.The other plus for \"Ferris Bueller\" is that it is funny without needing to be too crude or crass, which most comedies of this genre are. And the film does not feel dated even today; it doesn't have that excessive 1980's feel that say \"Pretty in Pink\" has which was released the same year. Also, the cinematography is top notch, with Chicago and its suburbs providing an excellent setting, almost becoming a character in this film.And who can forget the terrific art museum scene which is one of my favorite scenes in all of cinema. It was filmed beautifully with a great instrumental musical track overlaid. While Ferris and Sloane kiss under the beautiful blue stained-glass, Cameron is searching for himself in the complex pointillist painting of Seurat. This scene exposes the audience to art that they might not have otherwise seen; this is unique in film, for what other big film spends minutes showing an art museum? And this scene is far from boring, rather it is one of the highlights of the film, making the whole film anything but fatuous.I also liked how both Sloane and Ferris are keen on getting married soon, nowadays I don't think this attitude would appear in film. People today seem reluctant to get married, especially at a young age. But I think it is nice to see Sloane and Ferris be honest and vulnerable with their needs and wishes. If you are fortunate enough to find someone to love, who loves you back, then why not tie the knot sooner rather than later?\"Ferris Bueller\" is the film which perhaps best embodies those feelings of being 16-18 years old, unsure of your future, but full of hope and optimism, with a twinge of fear. It shows an age in betwixt childhood and adulthood, where one is old enough to go have a fun adventure independently, but not too old to enjoy it. Youths are not yet jaded by the world, filled with ennui and boredom, just a trip to a city can be an exciting adventure at that age. Whereas older folk often just want to rest, weary from work and life's responsibilities.So, watch this film to relive those youthful days if only for a few hours, days which were full of wonder and magnificent possibilities. Sure Ferris is self-centered, spoiled, and maybe narcissistic, but he is that friend that so many of us need, the guy who can pull us out of our comfort zone and motivate us into doing something fun and memorable while you have the chance, because as he said: \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"",

            "content": "John Hughes will be remembered for many teen comedies, but \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" qualifies as the funniest. Matthew Broderick is at his charismatic best in this outlandish saga about a high school rebel. As the eponymous character, Ferris hates to attend classes. In fact, when the film unfolds, Ferris has reached the maximum number of sick days; he has been sick nine days. High School Administrator Edward Rooney watches as the number of days shrinks from nine to two days on his computer. Ferris is an adequate hacker, but then computers were quite as sophisticated back in 1986. The title tells all in this amusing epic about freeloaders. Ferris, his best friend Cameron, and their girlfriend Sloane Peterson cruise into Chicago in Cameron's father's red sports car, a 1960 Ferrari GT California. The logistics of this comedy is how does Ferris pull the wool over everybody's eyes\u2014his parents and the high school\u2014while his friends and he goof off for a day. The suspense builds when Mr. Rooney\u2014like Wiley E. Coyote\u2014tries to catch Ferris in his lies and masquerades. Sure, there are other people who try to pull a fast one on Ferris, but he is just too nimble. This lightweight, frivolous comedy was made in another era when cell phones and other modern day amenities didn't exist. Aside from Ferris, we also watch his sister Jeanie wind up in police station where she meets a druggie (Charlie Sheen) who gets into a conversation with her. The conflict that emerges involves two garage hucksters who steal Cameron's father's car for the day while Ferris and company are cavorting around Chicago, masquerading as wealthy types to get a seat in an upscale restaurant.",

            "content": "It'd been years since I last watched 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986),' and, as a young adult, I was struck by just how tame Ferris Bueller's day off actually was. In my memory, I'd concocted all sorts of exciting and dangerous escapades. But Ferris (Matthew Broderick), it seems, is quite intent on emulating adulthood, and his choice of destinations is characteristically \"grown up\": the stock market exchange, an upper-class restaurant, a museum. He asks Sloane (Mia Sara) to marry him, lightly but nevertheless earnestly. Even his choice of parade music (\"Danke Schoen\" by Wayne Newton, \"Twist and Shout\" by The Beatles) harks to an older generation. \"Life moves pretty fast,\" Ferris tells us, and yet he seems intent on accelerating the process.Spontaneity comes with youth. At first glance, we might consider Ferris Bueller to be spontaneous. But is he? Abe Froman, touted as \"The Sausage King of Chicago,\" never arrives for his three-person reservation at the restaurant. Could Ferris not himself have made the reservation, and simply feigned spontaneity for the benefit of his friends? We've seen for ourselves the cunning genius with which Ferris creates illusions \u2013 that he is too ill to attend school, that he is sound asleep in bed \u2013 and this is just another deception, only now he's even fooling the viewer. This is perhaps referenced at the film's end, when Sloane suggests \"You knew what you were doing when you woke up this morning, didn't you?\", to which Ferris coyly replies, \"Me? Na.\" (Thanks to Scott Murray of \"Senses of Cinema\" for first planting this idea in my head).I haven't mentioned Cameron (Alan Ruck) yet, but he's the most important character. Whereas Ferris remains his usual glossy self throughout (whoever that may be), the uptight and neglected Cameron learns to stand up for yourself, particularly towards his cold (and appropriately absent) father. There's one particularly striking sequence in the Chicago Museum of Art, in which Cameron studies Georges Seurat's \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,\" fixating so closely on the image of a mother and child that the child's face becomes indistinguishable amid the texture of the canvas. Is this a deconstructionist hint, referencing the artistic medium in the same way that Ferris' fourth-wall breaking does so? Or does it have the opposite intent? The more we look into it, the less truth we see. So just have a fun day, damn it.",

            "content": "I remember this movie when I was in my first year in college, People billed it as a classic and it certainly made Matthew Broderick a star. The problem that I have with this movie is that I have a resentment for smart-alec know it all kids who make adults look like one-dimensional airheads, making the kid out to be some sort of hero for skipping school, slacking off, and pushing people into uncomfortable situations. The audience thinks that the \"Know it all\" is the greatest, coolest, most wonderful person in the whole world. But in reality, Ferris Bueller is a character with an attitude. Give Matthew credit for playing him brilliantly, but if you are like me and a \"character type\" person rubs you the wrong way, you won't think this movie is as great as so many make it out to be.We all know the story: Ferris Bueller is a typical high-school slacker who wants to take the day off, so he cons his RIDICULOUSLY gullible parents into believing that he is sick, calls his best friend Cameron over, talks poor Cameron out of stealing his father's Ferrari out of the garage, picks up his girlfriend Sloane by disguising himself as her father in a phone conversation, conning the Dean of Students Mr. Ed Rooney into believing that her grandmother has passed away so that he can get her out of class disguised as her \"Dad\" driving Cameron's Dad's classic car.He acts like a jerk in a classy restaurant to a Matre'D, pulls a few strings to get an expensive lunch, goes to an art museum, and a baseball game, while always able to elude Mr. Rooney and his parents.It's the typical teen comedy movie where you root for the teen because he's able to get away with crap, while the parents and school administrators can't catch him. It's too bad that the adults are made to look so superficial in this movie, because some do a good job such as the zany school secretary, some funny lines by the Dean of Students Mr. Rooney, and Ben Stein as an economics teacher, (Who's lecture, other than the roll call, was improvised because he had a Master's Degree in economics and John Hughes the director liked the idea.) Maybe it's because I have grown out of the teen years, might be another reason why I can't give this movie a higher review. I think people in their teen-early adult years might like it better.",

            "content": "When it comes to making films about teenagers, John Hughes is really the only writer and director who can get it right. Some of his incarnations can be very thought provoking like The Breakfast Club. In other cases, they can be downright funny. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is such an example, and manages to be quite inspirational too.Set in Chicago (like all of John Hughes' films), the audience is introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick). Ferris is a teenager who realises life can be complicated. That is why you're never too old (or too young!) to have a day off.He fakes an illness to his parents with \"a non-specific symptom\", much to the chagrin of his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) who just knows he is faking it. But still, his parents fall for it, hook, line and sinker. They believe their son is an angel who would never lie to them.Once they're gone, then the audience is properly introduced to Ferris Bueller. A hip, trendy, free-wheeling, philosophical spirit who has now been absent from school for a total of nine times in the past semester.One of the nice touches about this film is the way Ferris addresses the audience. He does seem to like to give sermons about how to enjoy life, and some of his observations about life are quite interesting. This derives from his personal philosophy that I must quote:\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\"It is exactly for this reason he wants to take a day off from the monotony of high school. When we actually see some of his lessons, you understand in an instant why.But a day off is no fun on you're own. It is an experience best shared. Ferris wants his best friend Cameron Frye (The superb Alan Ruck) to join him.Cameron is the exact opposite of Ferris. Ferris doesn't worry about anything, and manages to make the impossible possible. Cameron, on the other hand, is a neurotic, paranoid young man who is not in school that day because he genuinely believes he is sick. He is terrified of life, and how it seems to control him.Ferris hopes this day off will help Cameron to reflect and learn to appreciate life instead of running from it. When Ferris (eventually) convinces Cameron to come over to his house, they still have to add one more person into the mix.Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) has been invited along too. In a scheme concocted by Ferris, Cameron calls the school pretending to be Sloane's father. This is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, because his impersonation is so funny it had me in hysterics. It made me wonder if Sloane's father was really like that.Claiming that Sloane's grandmother has passed away, they manage to get one over on the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). He is certain that Ferris is faking his illness, and would like nothing more than to catch him in the act. His purpose in the film is to expose Ferris and failing in every attempt.Once they've got their hands on Cameron's father's Ferrari, a car his dad loves more than life itself (and sadly more than Cameron), Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are ready to go.Once they're in the city, our trio enjoy the sights and sounds. From checking out the Sears building to a baseball game, dining at a fancy restaurant, enjoying modern art, the audience begins to realise this is all for the benefit of Cameron. He's not really enjoying himself, mostly because he's terrified something will happen to the car.Gradually, he does begin to loosen up. Events such as Ferris singing on a parade float help Cameron to do that. That scene is so funny, because the whole crowd join in on Ferris' enthusiasm. It's quite nice as well to see so many people enjoying themselves at once.Cameron eventually manages to bring his perceptions of life into focus. He knows he can't just stand by and let life control him. For too long, he's allowed that to happen. Because his parents have never given him the love and affection he has wanted, and given it to the Ferrari instead, his first act of rebellion is to destroy the car.He is willing to take the blame, because he now wants to be the agent of his own destiny. This is something Ferris has been trying to teach him. Cameron is the real star of the film, and his courage about standing up to his father for wrecking the car is both inspirational and touching.Matthew Broderick is perfect as Ferris Bueller, bringing the boyish charm he is famous for. With people like Jeanie and Rooney against him, and coming out on top, it is hard to dislike him. Although Jeanie learns something from this day too, and becomes a better person for it, like Cameron.This film has a great deal to teach, about how life's moments must be seized, and reflecting on it to make the way for a better future, not only for yourself, but for other people out there like Cameron. It also has a wonderfully surreal touch, that adds a whimsical feeling to the whole enterprise.This is definitely my favourite of John Hughes' teenage films.",

For me, seeing Mia Sara playing a typical teen after knowing her just for the Tom Cruise movie Legend is one of the few things that made this movie interesting; that and hoping Jeffrey Jones will get him.

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's day off\" is another of the many 1980s teen comedies (many of them John Hughs) set in the Chicago suburbs.\nFerris's famous talking into the camera was one of several things which made this movie iconic, his \"life moves by fast\" philosophy and a Ferrari taking an important role in the film. Alan Ruck's nervous Cameron, the son of the cold uptight Farrari's owner, and his need to loosen up and join the hero on his infamous day off, was the movie's next iconic element. Jeffrey Jones's most famous movie role, Edward Rooney and his \"throw all my other priorities to the side until I deal with my no. 1 priority Ferris Bueller\" principal role was the next iconic landmark. Ferris's fooled parents, his not so fooled and resentful (Dirty dancing to-be-star at the time) sister, and the humorous gimmicks (like the snoring sound effects radio and dummy in the bed tied to a string to the door to make it look like Ferris is turning in bed sleeping whenever someone peeks into the room).Then, the phone calls including Ferris talking to one of his many friends in school (the coughing synthesizer) about his made-up illness, their funny comments (\"Ferris is gonna get me out of summer school, I hope he doesn't die, I'd hate to go to summer school\"), his calling Cameron to get him out of his bed of self pity (and his bed) and over to him, and Ferris somehow fixing the computer in Rooney's office from his own computer (Ferris: \"I asked for a car and I got a computer, how's that for being born under a bad sign?\") which lessened the stated amount of days he's missed while Rooney's on the phone telling Mrs. Bueller (Rooney: \"nine times\"). Then the call from Cameron disguised as Sloan's dad telling Rooney about her alleged grandmother's passing to get Sloan (Ferris's GF) out of school to join them. Then Sloan outside the school doors with Rooney (calling him a beautiful man, lol) waiting for \"her dad\" (Ferris) while we can hear teacher Ben Stein's \"anyone? anyone?\" from a nearby window, a funny follow-up from the famous funny classroom scene with Stiein's \"anyone? anyone?\", \"Bueller. Bueller. Bueller.\", and the student's response \"I heard from my boyfriend's sister's neighbor's girlfriend's best friend's cousin's sister's friend (or something) that they saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night\". That comment, the earlier phonecall scene, people in numerous different places throughout the movie asking about Ferris (including the police station), a \"Save Ferris\" sign on a watertower, and Rooney's secretary's famous comment about his popularity (\"dweebs, geeks, sportos, motorheads, etc., they adore him, they think he's a righteous dude\"), they were all several examples of Ferris's popularity and how almost everybody was fooled by his \"illness\" except his skeptical sister and Rooney, who's treck off school grounds to confront him was another iconic gimmick of the movie (along with Rooney's numerous funny hijinks while seeking him such as getting muddy, and him and the dog that doesn't like him).The above isn't even the half of it yet, there's still all of the famous and hilarious hijinks of Ferris, Cameron, and Sloan in Chicago, the different landmarks they visit; the Sears tower, stock exchange, art gallery (and Cameron's strange fascination with the little girl in the \"Sunday afternoon\" painting), a couple of innings at the Cubs game (with Rooney watching the same game from a pizza parlor (and him asking the owner the score, the owner responding: \"nothing, nothing\", Rooney: \"who's winning?\", Owner: \"the Bears\" lol), and then him mistaking a girl for Ferris and getting her drink spit on him, lol), and then Ferris/Cameron/Sloan eating at a fancy restaurant with a near miss with seeing Mr Bueller (Ferris: \"1000 restaurants in this city and I pick the one my dad goes to\") and the comical confrontation with the weird restaurant owner when trying to get in (Ferris posing as the Sausage king of Chicago) and the owner not buying it until Cameron uses his same funny disguised voice from earlier with Rooney, this time as police officer on the phone, to convince the owner to believe Ferris is the Sausage king of Chicago.There are still numerous funny classic things from this iconic movie I haven't mentioned, because there just isn't enough room here. There's still Cameron's freakout over the sleazy professional (Cameron: \"professional what?\") taking his dad's Ferrari on a joyride throughout the city adding 150 extra miles to the car. But Ferris's biggest motive, besides having his fun filled day, was getting Cameron to learn to not get his self-esteem lowered by and to stop being scared of his super-strict \"I love my car much more than my son\" dad. Because of how this movie went, and because Camerons dad was an unseen but talked about character in this movie, it's probably best that it was left to our imagination on what Cameron's dad's reaction was gonna be to his car not only having 150 extra miles on it, but it now being smashed on the ground after running through the window of Cameron's museum style display room of his house (sort of a connection to a comment earlier by Ferris: \"Cameron's house is like a museum, it's very big, very cold, and you're not allowed to touch anything\").",

            "review_title": "giving it the test of time",
            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is over 25 years old now and so I thought it was about time I gave it a review. Recently I also went back and reviewed Risky Business, NL's Vacation and a few other 80's movies and so I'm kind of going to try and compare it to its contemporaries. Anyway, I'll kick this off by asking a few question: No 1 - Where do you think Ferris wound up in life after he graduated from High School? Another question might go like this: \"If you liked Ferris, how would you compare your life now to that of someone who didn't like Ferris?\". THere is a polarization of attitudes here at IMDb over him, and so these would seem to be relevant questions.And so to begin with, as has often been pointed out over the years, the biggest issue with Ferris for many was that he was made of Teflon - i.e. nothing stuck to him. I think that this was due in part to the fact that he got so much love and attention from his parents that he never considered the possibility that others might not also love him. This in turn made him feel impervious to wrongdoing and caused him to do morally questionable things :) Another issue is that he came from that part of society where parents are powerful enough to bully school administrators whenever they feel like it. Witness Ed Rooney's shivering in his boots when he thinks he's talking to Sloan Peterson's Dad. So, Ferris moral compass is a bit skewed, and if you have any teaching experience, you have probably seen this all before.Now, contrast him to buddy Cam and maybe Joel Goodson of \"Risky Business\". Cam and Joel, in contrast to Ferris, had moral consciences. Where Ferris would just sort of go out and do something whenever he felt like it, Cam and Joel were more restrained and prone to weighing pros and cons. All of these differences to me were related to each character's relationship with his parents. Only Ferris seemed to take his parents (and their love) completely for granted. And where Cam would say \"I don't know what I'm going to do with my life\", it shows you that at least he's thinking about it. Joel Goodson was also on a career path at the time his story takes place. But Ferris? Does Ferris ever talk about what he wants to do with his life? No, not that I can recall. So, I ask myself all of this because I am no longer 18 and am not that successful in life. I also got a kick out of skipping class when I was in high school, and didn't like to talk about what I wanted to do afterwords because I didn't know. And......I always pretty much loved this movie which has perhaps caused me to be blind to its message. And just what was the message?Well, a good movie will take you on a journey, a journey in which the principal characters change. Well, but the problem as I look back on it now is that Ferris DIDN'T change that day. Cam did, and Joel did in Risky Business, but Ferris learned only that, once again, deceitful and impulsive behavior results in no consequences. This was perhaps the movie's message, that Ferris was some sort of God or something and well, \"just don't try this at home kids!\" Sounds like I really didn't like him, heh? Well, but i DID! I'm not one of those Ferris haters. But I gotta admit, of the three characters I'm referring to, he's the one who's going to have the most issues to deal with later in life, IHMO!And so the irony to me is that Ferris was the catalyst that caused Cam to grow up and face his fears, but it was really Ferris that needed a catalyst, not Cam. Catalysts cause other things to react and change, but don't change themselves. This was the \"Teflon\" aspect of Ferris's existence. He didn't project any sense that he needed to work on himself, to grow. Perhaps unconditional parental love is not always a good thing then, and Ferris never appreciated how good he had it. Guys like that can get you in a lot of trouble because they have few moral boundaries owing to that love. I don't know, but remember that \"the motorheads, dweebs, wasteoids, dickheads, etc\" all loved Ferris. That left Ed and sister Jeanie to lead any attempts to burst his bubble, to catalyze any change in him. They don't succeed here, but maybe they planted some seeds in his brain? So \"wake up and smell the coffee\", Ferris. Cam's dad's is going to find out that you really wrecked the car, not Cam. And then your reputation is going to be the next hot topic around town.....OK, OK......there, I've said it. I've made my peace with myself and with Ferris. Yeah, we love you, and I'd still pluck my money down to watch you outsmart Ed Rooney and the whole town of Chicago. But if immortal youth is the only God in this universe, you've got some years of reckoning ahead of you. That is unless of course, you drift into theatre, acting, comedy, or are independently wealthy. Because I guess I still don't know what you were really planning on doing with YOUR life? What skill sets were you going to bring to the rest of world? Well, you might have made a pretty good houdini....",

He is good looking, but not a jock, he is good at study but not a nerd, everyone likes him, but he is not a hero, he is good looking but wears bad 80s clothes and has a bad 80s hair cut.Skipping school, borrowing his friends dad's Ferrari, singing \"twist & shout\" at a parade and crashing an exclusive french restaurant don't quite add up to a riveting story.What we have a school student who is not a loser who makes good, but someone who is perhaps too perfect. He is the person whose head you would must like to shove down the toilet and flush on a bad day at school. But he is also the person you like and in many ways admire. He is the over dressed wussy boy you actually want to be (or perhaps date...or both).Like \"pretty in pink\" it was one of those movies in the 1980s you quietly mentioned to friends you liked only to find they also liked it.

            "content": "This used to be one of my favorite movies, and I still love watching it, but I can't help but realize more and more flaws in each viewing (which can add to the fun).  I understand it's a farce, from a teenager's point of view--and that's why all the adults are such incompetent jerks--but you gotta draw the line somewhere.But all in all, \"Ferris Bueller\" is not an easy film to resist.  It's a wild, energetic ride that will probably even make discerning grown-ups crack a smile.  There are some landmark moments, including Ferris singing \"Twist and Shout\" at a German parade and him driving away with his buddy Cameron's Ferrari with the song \"Oh Yeah\" pumping in the background.  Matthew Broderick gives a spirited performance (probably the one that put him on the map) and you couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Ferris as well as him. The same goes for Alan Ruck as Cameron and Jeffrey Jones as Principal Rooney.  Mia Sara is a beautiful choice as Sloane, Ferris's girlfriend. Keep a lookout for Charlie Sheen in a cameo as a drug addict who ends up falling for Ferris's sister, Jeannie.  I guess one of the reasons why I love this movie is because I relate to it, in my own way--and I'm sure many others do too.  Everyone aspires to be like Ferris--slick, free-spirited and without a care in the world.  My best friend is somewhat like Ferris, in a free-spirited sense.  And I would compare myself to Cameron.  I admit, I am quite cranky and paranoid at times.  Cameron doesn't like to throw himself into troublesome situations, like me, mostly because he's under the strict rule of his parents.  Now, my parents aren't that strict and they are decent people, which is why I don't try to violate their trust.  But there is something inside of me that wants me to break out of this constrictive shell that I seclude myself in, and I am somewhat envious of my best friend for being able to function without that shell, like Cameron is obviosly envious of Ferris without that shell.  I believe that everyone either is Ferris or knows a Ferris, and everyone is either Cameron or knows a Cameron.  The characters are both exaggerated, but the basis of them are true.\nThere are ridiculous scenes that couldn't help but make me roll my eyes and scream \"Yeah, right!\"  How many times did Ferris almost come face-to-face with his Dad and escaped at the last minute?  After Jeannie kicked Principal Rooney in the face, how come she reported that a stranger invaded her house? She knows Rooney from school!  When Ferris's Mom went to check on Ferris, how come she didn't actually step inside the bedroom and check on him, even after she remembered back to Rooney mentioning he was absent 9 times?  I'm sure any mother, whether her son was sleeping or not, would've went inside to check on him.  This is a great fantasy world, but us young people ain't stupid and our parents ain't either.  I don't even have overprotective parents, but my parents (well, my mom at least) are like human lie detectors.  They have extra-sensitive senses and are basically like psychics.  It's like the characters, not the actors, read the script and memorized their cues to become ignorant morons.So if you wanna have fun with this movie, please suspend and suspend and continue to suspend all disbelief.  The plot holes are so evident that a 10-year-old can point them out, but trust me--it's still a wild and crazy ride with some good laughs to spare!My score:  7 (out of 10)",

We never get to see the parent, being the modern garage filled with pictures of his beloved cars (contrary to what we imagine to be as stripped a house on the inside as it is on the outside) sufficient proof of Cameron's empty relationship with him.In the end, we don't even need to see the resolution, witnessing instead the certainty of Cameron's attitude as he doesn't even flinch at the idea of the confrontation with his father, in contrast to the insecurity we hear and see at the beginning.",

Over the years not only did I visit a number of times on business or pleasure, I also had two daughters living there and two of my grandchildren grew up there. It is even more fun now because I am very familiar with the city, including Wrigley Field.I vividly recall seeing \"Ferris Bueller\" in the theater in 1986, and it delighted me, especially the ending where the final scene is playing alongside the credits, then when the credits were over, Ferris comes out, looks us in the eye and says, \"It's over...go home.\" I have always been one to watch the credits anyway so I didn't miss any of it, as many theater-goers did. All the way through this is a very clever and entertaining film.Now, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" has recently been issued as a DVD with Dolby 5.1 sound and widescreen, and with a selectable director's commentary. I bought my own copy and it really is a good one.June 2019 edit: Being reminded it is the 33rd anniversary of this movie I watched it again last night, almost as much fun as the first time! A classic.This is somewhat a vanity project for writer/director John Hughes who grew up not too far from Chicago, the setting of this film. Hughes has had quite a good history with screenplays, including such films as Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Uncle Buck, Home Alone 1,2, and 3, Flubber, just to name a few. His commentary on this DVD is among the better ones, not going very often into the self-indulgent mode, and giving very interesting \"behind the shots\" commentary. An example of an interesting tidbit, although the film was set in Springtime, the outdoor shots at the ravine in Chicago were in the Fall, so they had to paint colored leaves green before each day's shooting, taking care not to knock them off!Some SPOILERS - The story is one day in the life of smart, master-slacker and high school senior, Ferris Bueller. Pretending to be sick, he gets his girlfriend Sloane out of class, his really sick friend Cameron out of bed, they borrow the rare collector car and have a day on the town. Restaurant, baseball game, stock market floor, parade, tallest building, art museum, lakefront. Meanwhile way-too-serious Dean of Students Rooney is trying to nab Ferris and expose him. The footrace with the cars near the end is a highlight. Ultimately, brother and sister bond are stronger than jealousy and Rooney gets his due.The filming at school was done with real high school extras, but only Mia Sara, who played Sloane, was a teen-ager among the cast. Broderick (Ferris) was 23, Alan Ruck (Cameron) was 29, pre-nose-bob Jennifer Grey (Jeannie) was 25. The film addresses Cameron's timidity and this day converts him, he decides to take a stand in his homelife. Also, Jeannie learns to appreciate and accept her wily brother. However, there isn't much message here, just clever fun and every student's secret desire, to make a fool out of school administration. My word description may sound sinister but in reality the comedic tone of the film doesn't allow us to take it very seriously.Of course this was a landmark role for Broderick, who looked like a teenager, and it made it hard for him to get \"adult\" roles later. Jeffery Jones plays Rooney just perfectly, a parody of a Dean of Students who has little connection with the real world. All in all an almost perfect cast, a witty script, and very effective directing make this one of my favorite films of all time.",

It has a great cast including Matthew Broderick, Jennifer Grey, Mia Sara, ALan Ruck, Edie McClurg, Jeffrey Jones, Cindy Pickett, and I must have left somebody out. Anyway, Ferris takes off school on a beautiful spring day. He fooled his parents but not his sister played wickedly by Jennifer Grey before she did Dirty Dancing. Anyway, Ferris is one of the most popular kids in his overcrowded high school. Also Ben Stein made his acting debut as his homeroom teacher where he repeats Bueller several times. THe film's cast is always excellent and in place. I will never understand some things like why Ferris has to be home by 6 P.M. or why the school buses run so late but I'm not going to ask questions. Ferris, his girlfriend Sloane, and his best buddy Cameron (odd names?) have a memorable day in Chicago. They go to museums, see a parade, a ball game, and have dinner in one of the city's finest restaurants. Of course, Ferris has to convince his parents that he's sick or ill. The town rallies around his survival. Of course, it's not always perfect.",

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" endures for a very good reason. John Hughes was a tremendously gifted writer and director, and his talents are what make this movie so damn good. What's really surprising about this movie is that the main character isn't a likable one. So it really speaks to Broderick's abilities that he's able to bring such a 4th-wall-breaking charm to the role. And it's not just the stars, but the supporting cast makes an impact; Jeffrey Jones, Lyman Ward, and -especially- Edie McClurg. She made those scenes in Rooney's office hilarious. And the other really notable aspect is that this movie plays as a love letter to Chicago. The cityscape flyovers, the scenes in the suburb (I've always wanted to live in that neighborhood); these are very picturesque locations. It's visually striking in the same way as \"Risky Business\". This flick never gets old. It's got a great soundtrack (Hughes really knew how to pick songs), and it excels on all fronts: solid '80s/teen/Hughes movie, and an all-around great comedy. My favorite John Hughes movie.9/10EDIT: Cameron's George Peterson voice is solid gold!",

            "content": "Using one of the musical leitmotifs of the film, I can only respond with the iconic \"Oh, yeah\".Indeed it's pretty hard to disagree with that statement. I just passed the 35 line and it seems like yesterday when I hit the '30'. There's a sort of acceleration of time when you get older that makes ten years feel like two in your 'childhood' referential. Ten is the age I was when I saw the film for the first time and I enjoyed it for what it was: a fun teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick, a name I instantly identified because I had seen in \"The Freshman\" a few weeks only before, but just like I didn't get the Brando references, in \"Ferris Bueller\", I laughed at the slapstick gags with Dean Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), I enjoyed the dance sequence, I had a child crush on the beautiful Mia Sara, I felt sorry for Cameron (Alan Ruck) but the whole existential undertone of the movie passed over my head. I wish I could be mature enough to grasp the message and use it for my teen years.It's only today that I realize I'm getting older and bitter because I should have enjoyed my youth as much as I enjoyed the film. I kept nodding at some statements and looked for opportunities to be emotionally touched. I loved that Sears Tower moment and how things seem pretty tiny and insignificant when you take some perspective, which is a metaphor of life that speaks for itself. But it's the Art Institute interlude that got me, I don't know if it's the static poses or the music or the way Cameron kept looking at the infinite details of the painting, until getting to grainy dots. Sometimes, you can also look too much at things and miss the essential.It's for moving strokes like that that the 80's are remembered and revered, even in a movie intended to be fun, you could have these moments of sheer contemplation, moments that consecrate John Hughes as the youth's voice of wisdom. If directors treated youth with one tenth the respect Hughes had, movies' quality would be multiplied by ten. Parents, teachers, deans are represented as dream-killing figures, always trying to prevent you from having a good time and being yourself, it seems superficial at first sight, but that 'superficiality' is integral to the youth' spirit, it's for this capacity to confront and challenge the adult world that ironically, kids like Ferris won't have any problems becoming adults. And the more submissive you're to parents or teachers' rules (like Cameron and indirectly Ferris' sister) the less likely you are to become yourself. And that's the truth. So \"Ferris Buller's Day Off\" is less a road trip in Chicago, although Hughes wanted to capture the spirit of the city, than a tour over the lives of three teenagers who don't have real plans for the future but only know they're having their last year in school and better be prepared to adulthood. Ferris shouldn't miss school, one more truancy day and he's expelled, his girlfriend doesn't endure the same risk but her presence requires the help Cameron, a sickly awkward teen estranged with his father, and more than that, it requires his father's 1961 red Ferrari, perhaps the one thing he values more than his son. The trip won't do without the car and there's a way the film uses it to materializes the personality of Cameron and his Freudian arc in the film, making him the most sympathetic character before Jeannie (Jennifer Grey).Jeannie is devoured by jealousy, by the fact Ferris is so popular and can get away with everything he does, she epitomizes the individual crisis of teens who can't just enjoy what they are and value their self-worth, like Cameron, but instead of depressed passivity, but chose to deliberately live under the shadows of better, she tries to ruin Ferris' plan. Just like Cameron, the day will be an opportunity to discover the real truth and try to be a better person not without the help of a wise punk played by a young Charlie Sheen. Jeannie learns to a better person, focused on herself just like Cameron learns to deal with his father and value his own feelings.It is fascinating that the main character doesn't undergo any change, any coming of age, he's the one who possesses the real truth and breaks the fourth wall to better deliver his message. The day off isn't much a day off school but a day off the usual routine allowing you to have a look at your life and try to change things for the better. A day at the restaurant, museum, ball game, German parade or a simple talk can do the difference. The film is wrapped up in the package of typical 80's comedies but there's nothing typical in the way, it unveils many beautiful truths about life, like other John Hughes' movies, not all of them centered on adults. And a thought had just occurred to me a few days ago and it seems to been in line with Ferris' philosophy, we're either nostalgic of sorrowful toward the past, and too worried and anxious about the future, we have valid reason rot hat but it comes to the point where the only time to be enjoyed is the present, when we go to a party, travel, have sex, everything is about the present actually, that's what happens while we're making plans, and \"Ferris Buller's Day Off\" there are many impending threats: parents, Dean Rooney, Cameron's Dad but they never stop anyone to seize that day off.And teenage years are the microcosm of the day in your life that indeed moves pretty fast... and everyone I the film ends up having the time of life, Ferris, Sloane, Cameron, Jeannie, the two parking attendants... except for Dean Rooney.",

            "content": "The so-called \"Great Generation\", those who fought in and/or came of age during and just after the Second World War, predominantly born during the First World War (circa 1910 to 1925), have been characterized as doing their duty. The Silent Generation, born circa 1925 to 1945, were known for conforming, hence they were \"silent\" on social matters instead focusing on careers and buying homes. Then came \"the Boomers\" (born circa 1946 to 1960), often associated with not only the social protests of the 1960's but also challenging the status quo. Then came Generation X, born circa 1961 to 1980. Generation X, so-called because they were largely undefinable, were about \"me\", sometimes called \"The Me Generation\". \"I want to do this, and I don't want to do that\" has been the mantra of Generation X. \"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\" is quite possibly the quintessential Generation X film about a kid who skips school to give a repressed friend the time of his life.\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is certainly a comedy-fantasy, but unlike most comedies of the 1980's, there is an underlying message which spoke to Generation X. Certainly the message is perhaps not as deep as that found in something like \"Rebel Without a Cause\", but it does have a point to make. Through a largely innocent fantasy tale of three high school students who decide to take a day off from school without permission, they learn about life outside the classroom. They have experiences which couldn't be gleaned from text books from within the Purgatory of an American high school.The catalyst of this little adventure is Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a relatively intelligent but free-spirited high school-er who is determined to get the better of the school administer. He concocts a plan to fool the school and his family that he's in bed sick, which is one of the best bits in the film. His friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is in desperate need to \"get out\" and live a little bit. He suffers from hypochondria, obsessed with his health, and repressed resentment against his father. They are joined by Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) where they take Cameron's dad's car for a day trip into Chicago. They explore the city by doing among other things visit art galleries, sing in the streets, and attend a Chicago Cubs' baseball game.Meanwhile, school principal Edward R. Rooney, Dean of Students (Jeffrey Jones) believes something is amiss. He's convinced Ferris is up to something and decides to expose the \"cheating\" high school-er by engaging in a chase to trap him. For Generation X'ers of the time, Ferris getting the better of a high school administrator was probably worth the price of admission when it was originally released in the 1980's. But the principal is not the only one. His sister Jeannie Bueller (Jennifer Gray) is also suspicious that Ferris is not really home in bed. She ends up having a conversation at a police station with Garth played by Charlie Sheen in a small role.This is mostly a pure fun film but strangely I found it more satisfying than \"The Breakfast Club\" also directed by John Hughes. In \"Breakfast Club\" the characters talk and talk and talk, and they dance. In \"Ferris Bueller\", the characters actually do stuff. Yes, they do dance and sing, but they do other things too. And of course Ferris, being smart enough to outsmart previous generations, gives the film it's bite. However, it's not him but another character who actually makes the biggest statement through a faux pas action, something \"The Breakfast Club\" characters never do. Sometimes I wonder what if Ferris had burst into the library where the Breakfast Clubbers were being detained and saved them from the angst of 1980's American teenage-hood. I would have paid good money to see that. In a sense, \"Ferris Bueller\" is a kind of send up to \"The Breakfast Club\", demonstrating what happens when Gen X'ers are released from Purgatory. Look out!",

            "content": "Despite some really high reviews on this thread, while FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is definitely a funny movie it is not the greatest comedy of all time. But it is in that group of films with varied backgrounds (the HOME ALONE series for instance) where the grown-ups are easily out-witted by the children or high schoolers who confront them. Jeffrey Jones is Principal Ed Rooney. He runs a pretty taut, well run school, but there is one annoying fly in the ointment: Senior high schooler Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), who is extremely plausible and clever. Ferris understands the limits of the system Rooney dominates, and manipulates it. Ferris has a nice personality, so most people like and trust him. He certainly knows how to manipulate his two parents (Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ford) who are too busy in their business careers to pay sufficient attention to Ferris' activities. They feel he is a wonderful boy, which drives Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) crazy. Both Jones and Grey want to catch Ferris in the act, the former to discredit him with the students who regard him as a role-model and hero, the latter to force her parents to realize what a phony he is.The plot of the film is simple. With about one or two months left before his graduation from high school, Ferris wants to take the last possible day of sick-leave off, but to do so with both his closest friend Cameron/\"Cam\" Frye (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara). Make a real day of it in their home town (Chicago), doing all sorts of wonderful things. Cameron has health problems (usually dealing with his lousy home life - his parents hate each other, and his father is a car collector and restorer who loves his 1960 Mazzerati more than his wife or son). Ferris times a serious chest ailment of his own to occur on at the same time as Cam's absence. He sets it up using the electronic wizardry he has developed, complete with a fake Ferris covered up in bed who is \"snoring\" while \"sleeping\", and a series of recorded messages linked to the intercom in his home for anyone (including Rooney) who tries to call him to the door. As for Sloane, Ferris manages to get her released from classes (and leave Rooney with egg on his face) for the sudden \"death\" of her grandmother. We gradually watch the next eight hours (until 6:00 P.M., when both his parents return home) unfurl, with Ferris, Cam, and Sloane going to a fine restaurant, going to an art museum, going to a Chicago Cubs game, and taking over a parade, while Rooney gradually manages to figure out he's been duped, but always finding himself not in command of the situation. He insults strangers who spit on him. He misses seeing the kids on a televised baseball game (he barely listens to what is going on in the game...or what the game is!). He runs afoul of a mean dog. His car is towed away. And Jeannie also discovers her suspicions about Ferris are correct, but she ends up arrested as a result of a phone call. The enjoyment of the day for Ferris, Sloane, and Cam is mixed - Cam's personal problems (which are symbolized by the Mazzerati) are too big for him to get away from...or seemingly so. And Ferris and Sloane are aware that they may not be able to maintain their romance after Ferris graduates.A clever film with good performances, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF really delivers. If I must choose my favorite performance it's a toss off between Jones and Broderick, but I may add that towards the end Charlie Sheen as a teenager arrested on a drug charge does quite nicely opposite Jennifer Grey. Certainly a worthy film comedy to watch...particularly on one's day off.",

I didn't know what the heck that meant and eventually found out who he was and watched the movie.This is the movie where Matthew Broderick famously breaks the fourth wall. Making comments and giving looks directly to the audience. It's a funny gag, there's even an post-credits scene where he approaches the camera asking why the audience is /still/ there and tells them to go home. While I did watch this movie in my house, the line did get a couple chuckles out of me. The premise is incredibly simple: teen gets friends together, skips school, and causes shenanigans throughout the city while a skeptical principal (Jeffrey Jones) pursues him. Oh right! The dynamic between the principal as well as Bueller's sister (played by Dirty Dancing actress Jennifer Grey) and Ferris creates some of the funniest moments. It's a cat and mouse game, like Tom And Jerry, between them and is incredibly entertaining to watch.Now I know this will sound iffy, but Ferris Bueller is and can be a positive role model, just depends on how you look at it. Yes he cuts school and makes risky decisions throughout, but it's all in good fun. And for those of us like Cameron Fry, sometimes we need to just let loose and have fun every now and again. Like Bueller famously says to the camera: \"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a comedic classic written and directed by the late 80's icon John Hughes. It's one of those movies that provides something for everyone and this is indeed a feel-good movie. While there's a little bit of language, it's not too bad.",

As well as that, it has a lot of heart, it takes place at a time in these three teenagers lives when they are moving on, concerned about what the future may hold, and there is always a hint from Bueller's fourth wall breaks that this day off will be their last for a long time, which adds depth to their fun shenanigans. The cast could not be any better. Matthew Broderick shines as the title character, it will always be his greateat role, his on screen chemistry with Alan Ruck and Mia Sara is flawless. Jeffrey Jones steals all his scenes, Jennifer Grey is as talented as always and a cameo by a young Charlie Sheen is still some of my favourite work from him. Funny, heartwarming and simple, Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that less can sometimes be more, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Ferris Bueller knows he's on his way to a solid career and a trophy wife. He may as well enjoy the ride along the way. Even with our recognition that Ferris is dishonest, selfish, and arrogant, we can't help but be on his side as he outwits adults at every turn.Matthew Broderick was born to play Ferris Bueller, and he is spectacular in the role. All the other characters are only important insofar as they rotate in orbit around Ferris. Jeffrey Jones does a competent job as Principal Rooney, who plays Wile E. Coyote to Broderick's Road Runner. Rooney knows Ferris isn't sick and he takes on the job of catching his nemesis violating regulations. (We can guess that he'll be no more successful than Wile E. Coyote, but neither Rooney nor Coyote ever catch on.)Mia Sara is attractive as Ferris's girlfriend Sloane, although I'd advise her to think twice before considering Ferris as marriage material. Ben Stein is perfect as the economics teacher whose teaching techniques have reached a perfection of tedium.Finally, how can you not like a movie that features Charlie Sheen as \"Boy in Police Station,\" and that gives the world the definitive cinematic version of \"Twist and Shout\"?",

            "content": "\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"In only a span of six years, John Hughes managed to direct some of the best comedies from the 80's which surprisingly hold up very well to this day. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still regarded as a classic in the genre and despite being a simple mainstream movie, Matthew Broderick delivers such an iconic performance that many teens continue to fall in love with his character as the decades pass. The gags are handled with perfect comedic timing and the soundtrack has become such a recognizable tune in pop culture. I don't know exactly what it is that has made this such a beloved film amongst American teenagers, but it seems to transcend generations over time because of its accessibility. It's a light comedy about being young and mischievous that simply seems to delight and captivate audiences who are looking for some form of escape. It's rare for a film with a simple premise like this to continue captivating audiences over time and even those teens who watched it in the 80's and are now mature decide to go back and revisit it for nostalgic purposes or to introduce it to their now teenage sons. This is just further proof that no one had the comedic touch that Hughes had in the 80's with his teenage comedies. I still prefer Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as his go to movie, but Ferris Bueller was a delightful experience. I look forward to catching up with some more of his classic films. I remember having seen classic scenes of this movie, but this was my first time watching it from beginning to end and I was delighted and surprised because I didn't think I would ever like Broderick as much as I did here. This is by far his best performance.The film takes place in Chicago where we are introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a senior in High School who has decided to take the day off from school by fooling his parents into thinking he's sick. Ferris constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the audience letting them know what he's thinking. His plan is so well thought out that even his friends at school think he's developed a serious condition and are trying to raise money for his treatment. He's the sort of guy that everyone in school dreams of being and his life motto is simply to enjoy life to the fullest. He personifies the spirit of youth and that is what makes him such a likable guy despite acting irresponsable at times. The only people who don't believe him are his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who is angry everyone keeps on falling for his lame excuses, and the school principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) who is determined to discover his lie and make him lose the school year for it. Ferris has everything planned out very carefully and is convinced his plan will work. He calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who has also taken a sick leave, but in his case he's really feeling bad. Ferris convinces him to come pick him up and together they come up with a plan to help Ferris's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), get out of classes. In a hilarious scene the duo call Principal Rooney impersonating Sloane's father and asking him to give his daughter permission to leave the school because her grandmother has passed away. Ferris then convinces Cameron to take his father's Ferrari and the adventure begins for the three friends through the streets of Chicago. Hughes has always excelled as a screenwriter and he is responsible for some of the funniest comedies from the 80's and 90's. He didn't direct as many films, but he has been involved with many scripts. In Ferris Bueller he seems to have written a simple but perfectly executed script of a young teenager who is trying to live life to the fullest. He could've come out as cocky, but there is some heart to his character and it becomes incredibly hard not to root for him, especially when Hughes put so much emphasis during the opening scene portraying the dullness of High School life and then introducing Principal Rooney as such a douchebag. The scenes where he is desperately trying to uncover Ferris's plan are incredibly cartoonish and over the top, but it is funny nonetheless. There are also a few heart felt scenes between Ferris and Cameron which make his character even more likable despite his bad influence. Broderick delivers the performance of his career and there are very few actors who can break the fourth wall the way he did here without interrupting the flow of the story (the other who comes to mind is John Cusack). There is also a great scene in which Ferris covers one of The Beatle's song in a parade that simply adds to the already amazing soundtrack. Jones is hilarious as Rooney and it's not often that these over the top villains are portrayed well. He never comes off annoying, and that's something difficult to achieve. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a comedy that has transcended time and generations and it may come as a surprise to many considering it's such a light and simple premise, but Hughes manages to work his magic. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Out of the movies I've seen by John Hughes, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is my favourite out of all of them. It's a great movie for teens everywhere.It starts out when Ferris' mother Katie checks up on him. She sees him in bed and he doesn't look too good. When I see Ferris, I laugh. It's just the way he looks; he looks dead, eyes open. However, he is only pretending, and his sister Jean knows it from the second she sees him. It's odd how Jennifer Grey and Matt Broderick were dating when they filmed this. Of course, the parents buy it, and they leave him to rest and he will miss school for the day. A classic line from Ferris: \"They bought it.\" He then teaches us how to fake the parents out. It's pretty good. At school, the Dean of Students, Mr. Edward Rooney, is suspicious of Ferris' increasing amount of absences from school. He feels as though Ferris is skipping. Well, of course, he's right. Meanwhile, in Ferris' class, the teacher--who I do feel bad for--repeats, \"Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?\" At that same time, Ferris' best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is actually sick. A line that I still like from there is, \"When Cameron was in Egypt's land...let my Cameron go.\" Eventually, Ferris gets Cameron out of bed. Back at school, Sloan (Mia Sara) is asked to go home after the passing of her grandmother. Rooney thinks that Ferris is behind it. However, he calls on the other line. It turns out that Rooney is talking to Cameron, doing his best impersonation of Sgt. Peterson, Sloan's dad. They pull it off, and they steal Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari GT California. It's something along the lines of that. When they get to school, they pick her up, and drive off into the late morning. Most of the movie takes place in the heart of Chicago, with the 3 of them seeing the sights of the city. Various things include cheating a snooty waiter into thinking Ferris is Abe Froman (The Sausage King of Chicago), and seating them in a restaurant that Ferris' father Tom goes to. They see a museum with some very nice paintings including A Sunday at Grand la Jatte. For those of you who don't know, that's the one that has all those individual dots of pigment. It's really cool; I don't know how that guy did it.In between this, Rooney invades the Bueller home, while Jeanie goes home to prove that Ferris is faking. When she gets there, she thinks Ferris is home when it's really Rooney. Rooney thinks that Jeanie is Ferris, with the 2 of them saying--Jean, then Rooney--\"Ferris..\" \"Bueller..\" When they jump for the other, Jean screams and kicks Rooney in the face. Her look is priceless. Her call to the police is funny. \"This isn't a phony phone call! There is a intruder, male Caucasian, possibly armed...my name is Bueller...look, it's real nice that you hope that my brother's okay but I am in danger! I am very cute, I am very alone and I am very protective of my body! I do not want it violated or killed, ALRIGHT???!! I need HELP!! SPEAKING IN English????!!!!!! D/CKHEAD!!!!!!!!!\" \"Excuse me, whoever was in the house is still in the house, I'd like to let you know that I've just called the police, so if you have any brains whatsoever you'll get your @ss out of my house..... I'd also like to add that I have my father's gun and a scorching case of herpes.\"Of course, last but definitely not least, Ferris goes on the float in the parade, first singing 'Danke shen', then 'Twist and Shout' by The Beatles, with a group doing, 'coincidentally', moves from the Thriller music video. It is a very memorable moment, and it would be so cool to do that!! With the last bit of time left for Ferris, they return the Ferrari back to Cam's place, but with the mileage too high, Cameron kicks the car's front because Cam's father loves the car more than he loves Cameron. When he leans on it, it drives backwards since they still had it in reverse to bring back the mileage, it smashes into the glass wall behind it, falls, and lands on the ground. Cam had \"killed the car,\" as Ferris stated. Cameron accepts this, and says he'll deal with his dad.With 5 minutes left, Ferris kisses Sloan, who says, \"He's going to marry me,\" and Ferris runs off home to beat his dad, mom, and sister. As the race gets more intense, Ferris runs to the back but gets caught by Rooney. However, Jeanie saves him, and lets him get back in bed. Jeanie throws Mr. Rooney's wallet that fell onto the floor into the mud. Ferris manages to get into bed as though nothing had happened just in time. When Katie and Tom check on him, they still think that he's still sick. The movie ends with Ferris saying as he said before in the beginning, \"Yep. I said it before and I'll say it again... Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around, you could miss it.\"Good words to go by. The movie is lots of fun. Clever one that Ferris is.",

            "content": "It's amazing how many John Hughes films I hadn't seen before my 80's April film list. Ferris Bueller's Day Off was the Hughes installment for 1986, which followed a lovable mischief and his quest to get a day off from school and have a memorable day in the process. Starring Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, and Mia Sara, Ferris Bueller's Day Off attempts a fun look at the lovable loafer character that everyone seems to know at least one of in their life. Unfortunately, the film results in leaving one feeling resentment to a personality that is usually enjoyed.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a high school student that doesn't take much of anything too seriously, except getting out of responsibilities. Throughout the film, Ferris highlights some of his exploits that involve him avoiding responsibilities and making the most of his responsibility-free time. One morning, Ferris decides to take the day off from school and bring along his girlfriend Sloan (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and show them a good time. Cameron, especially, needs to unwind a bit, as he is his overbearing parents and constant stress is overtaking his life. Among the activities he decides to have the trio engage in, including a baseball game, hijacking a parade float, and swimming, Ferris also convinces Cameron to take out his father's prized Ferrari as their means of transportation. While Ferris is enjoying his time off with his friends, principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is out to prove that Ferris is faking his illness and intends to prove that, no matter what he has to go through to do so. Hot on their trail, but always a step behind, Ed Rooney won't stop Ferris from enjoying his day, but a destroyed car of his best friends father might.I love a film that breaks the 4th wall. Matthew Broderick breaks the 4th wall all throughout Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The continual breaking of an otherwise frustrating film was definitely the standout. I think most people would agree that they have met or known a Ferris at some point in their lives. We all know the happy-go-lucky person that never plans anything yet always has situations work out for them. Most of the time we can laugh off that personality and wonder if life will ever catch up to them. Watching the exploits of someone like that on-screen, though, was a maddening experience. Ferris had no regard for the person who he called his best friend. Although Cameron is a rigid personality that would occasionally do well to be pushed out of his comfort zone, Ferris continually disrespected him and pushing him to make reckless decisions that he will have to confront himself. The longer you watch the film, the more you think that Ferris is a jerk, and his sister might be right to resent him so much. On the bright side, the film did have a fun score and a great end credit sequence that really makes you stay until the last minute, a piece of cinema I miss.",

Then, he got married, got fat, and became a 'cameo appearance' guy... waddling his fat, grey-haired self around, trying to smirk like Ferris Bueller. I figured it was for the sequel, because 'Ferris Bueller's Got Fat!' (2006) has a certain ring to it...But, alas, Matthew Broderick Jessica Parker wasn't preparing for a role, he was just over-eating to deal with his feelings of inadequacy from watching his wife cash those 'Sex In The City' (1998-2004) checks. Yeah, she's out cashin' those sweet, sweet HBO checks, and he's at home on the couch, eating expired 'Grandpa Eddy's Sweet, Sweet Choco-Potato-Mayo Cakes' (1993).Alan Ruck was good in this film. Somehow, Ruck ages 27 years in the following 10 years, and appears to be in his 40s in Spin City (1996). For those of you that have seen this film 25 times, but are still somehow unfamiliar with 'Spin City'... watching any 4 episodes of Michael J.

            "content": "I waited until I was well into adulthood to view this film, so I'm decades removed from its target audience of teenagers frustrated with high school. But I have to say that Matthew Broderick's considerable charm in the title role is a smokescreen for a morally questionable story.  Ostensibly a light-hearted romp with a \"stop and smell the roses\" message, this movie is actually about a con man who lies, cheats and steals, and cares about no one but himself.  Oh sure, he has a best friend and a girlfriend, but his concern for them is scarcely more convincing than his mock affection for his parents.As an example of how the story dodges its own implications, the uplifting reversal one character experiences because of Ferris's behavior is just talk (and a kick or two); we don't actually *see* the confrontation that would bring the change home.  Not that we want to; that would ruin the happy-go-lucky mood.Which is not to say that the movie is a total waste of time.  It has many fun moments (the parade scene especially) and enough ingenuity to keep boredom at bay.  And Broderick's appeal is undeniable.  But if you're like me and do not check your brain at the door just because you're watching \"mere entertainment,\" be prepared for an unpleasant aftertaste.For an interesting counterpoint, check out _Election_, a story with some similar themes, though with Broderick now on the teacher-authority side of the fence.

His attitude toward life is to get the most out of it, an admirable quality except that his methodology to achieve his end involves shameless manipulation of his friend Cameron and of course Cameron's father Ferrari California Spider, which he just has to have for his day off, reasoning that if Cameron's dad hadn't wanted the car taken he should have locked it in the garage. The logic here is that I'm not responsible for taking the car your irresponsible for not locking it up, therefore I'm blameless. OK never mind that this car sells for about 2 to 3 million dollars on the auction market when they ever come up, the fact that it gets wrecked at the end of movie is just a crime. Of course there's Ferris, once the deed is done shifting the blame and onus onto his friend for what happened. Is as if to say \"Ok I had my fun, now you take the consequences\" Maybe I love cars too much or was just imbued with a stronger moral code as kid, but I find the whole smarmy Ferris a bit much to take, friends are merely there for his pleasure and the minute that pleasure is done so are they.

He plays hookie with his friends Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and enjoys a day in Chicago. There's only one person who can stop the fun and that's the principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). And Ferris' sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey). OK, that's two persons. Ferris is a slacker but in his parents' eyes Ferris a perfect angel. So can Ferris get away with his plan or will he get caught?Seeking the company of his best friend Cameron to loan him his father's car which is a super sports car and the pride and joy of his father. Cameron is rather reluctant about getting his father's car but Ferris overcomes and they also take along Sloane Peterson, girlfriend of Ferris and they all head to Chicago, Illinios and have a ball going to baseball game at Wrigley Field, an expensive place to eat and visit the Art Museum. The movie is filled with some cool comic scenes involving his Principal and his witty tricks to fool people around him to get the things done in a manner he really wants. Don't miss the Greatest scene of the movie when Ferris gets up and sings TWist & ShOut by Beatles along with the parade making everyone out there dance. I admit that storyline is paper thin, and there isn't much substance that it contributes to the movie ,but at the same time we also don't want some complex storyline in a teen comedy. The dialogue for this movie has received such a following that it has even been printed on shirts and recited at parties by true fans of the film. I don't blame them. It's a classic!

I would love to try and do exactly what Ferris did in this movie, except for the fact that my city is boring and I'm too afraid of getting in trouble.As for negatives, well the musical numbers in the middle were annoying, not saying Matthew Broderick can't sing, but they were pointless and every time I just fast forward through them. Also some moments aren't that funny and go on for too long.The reason this movie works is because of Ferris, and it's weird, I should hate this guy, but he is just so charming and likable. I know I will get hate, but he's kind of like Sam Witwicky for me. Cameron is me, he acts exactly how I would act in this situation. And the movie is so over the top, unlike Breakfast Club, this one doesn't try to be realistic, which is why I like how the princibal acts. And it's just funny.",

He was everything I wanted to be.As the years roll by, I am content to be the Cameron I am. It's OK to be average. There's nothing wrong with insecurity, fear, and not knowing what the future holds.These truths is what makes the movie great. It takes you places, and hyper-focuses on the character development. Some moments are fast paced and hilarious. Then it slows down and gets very symbolic. The pacing of the movie is simply incredible. As for the story, it is cheesy.

            "content": "This popular teen movie was first released the year I was born, so obviously, I didn't have the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen back in 1986. I didn't even know about the film throughout my childhood and early teens (I was obviously too young for the majority of that time), but was finally introduced to it when I was around Ferris Bueller's age. I saw quite a bit of it at the time, but didn't see the rest of it until later. I have watched the entire thing again since then, and can say that overall, it's definitely my kind of comedy! On a beautiful day, fairly close to the end of Ferris Bueller's senior year, the rebellious student decides to take the day off. In the morning, he pretends to be sick, and even though this is certainly not the first time, his parents still buy it. Now that Ferris has the day off, he calls up his friend, Cameron Frye, who really is sick, and manages to lure him out of bed so he can try and enjoy the day with him! Together, they manage to get Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson, out of school by making phony calls. All three of them go out to have fun, but Ed Rooney, the school principal, just knows that Ferris isn't really sick, so he goes out, determined to bust him and prove to other students that he is not a good role model! Ferris' sister, Jeanie, is aware of her brother's tricks, and also wants to bust him! The popular high school rebel may be in trouble, as he will not graduate if he is caught!I must confess, I think there were a few jokes I didn't get, even though I can't think of any off the top of my head right now. I don't know if these are dated jokes that I didn't get because they're before my time, or if it's something else. However, for the most part, this certainly wasn't an issue. For me, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is mostly highly amusing, filled with slapstick and silliness! If you ask me, there are so many comic highlights in the film, including Cameron's reaction to Ferris taking out his father's rare, extremely valuable Ferrari, and the trouble poor Ed Rooney experiences as he tries to bust Ferris! The film may go downhill a bit towards the end, but in my opinion, this is not much of a problem. For those who are into the kind of humour that \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" has to offer, I think it should be entertaining to some degree.",

            "content": "This coming-of-age film focuses on a high school senior named Ferris Bueller, who takes a day off of school by faking an illness. His parents, however, believe he is serious about being sick. Ferris realizes that he will be going off to different colleges with his two best friends, Cameron Frye; a hypochondriac pessimist, and Sloane Peterson; Bueller's significant other/attractive girlfriend.You'll notice Ferris Bueller constantly break the fourth wall throughout the film to explain to the audience his thoughts and techniques in order for us to compare our own life experiences with his. The first one we see in the film is when Ferris gives us pointers on how to fake an illness in three different ways if we choose to play hooky.When we see Ferris Bueller's room, we learn that he likes Simple Minds, as we notice a Simple Minds poster in a few frames throughout the film. He also happens to be a punk, and turns on the television and guess what comes on? Classic old MTV! Before he showers, he blasts \"Love Missile F1-11\" and even tries to sing part of it while taking a shower. We also hear him share some of his philosophy after his shower and he claims that he thinks \"isms\" are bad and that people should only believe in themselves. He then quotes John Lennon and compares himself to him due to their mutual beliefs. This leads to Bueller stating that Lennon was meant to be \"the walrus\" and Bueller, valuing Lennon's philosophy, says that he'd like to be the walrus someday. This is a reference to the Beatles song, in which John sang it.The movie switches scenes between Ferris Bueller enjoying his day off of school and contacting his friends at the same time and Principal Rooney having a dispute with the school's secretary, Grace. Principal Rooney notifies Ferris Bueller's mother that Ferris has had nine absences throughout the second semester. Mrs. Bueller doesn't remember it, for some reason, so Principal Rooney talks to Grace about why Bueller was frequently absent. Grace explains to him that Bueller is a popular student and that he is a good role model to everyone. Despite him being popular, we learn that his sister, Jeanie despises him and thinks he's a phony.Cameron takes the day off school because he is suffering from hypochondria, and Sloane gets to miss school early when a teacher notifies her that her grandfather recently passed away. When Ferris and Cameron are at Bueller's house before they pick up Sloane, Bueller wears a different outfit in order to disguise himself and not get caught by the principal. In other words, Bueller is hiding his actual appearance to avoid getting in trouble with the principal.The trio drive around Chicago in Cameron's father's 1961 Ferrari GT250. Cameron states that his dad loves his Ferrari more than anything else, despite it being an inanimate/unnatural object with no emotion whatsoever. They stop at the Chicago Museum of Art, watch a baseball game at the Wrigley Field and see a parade going on in downtown Chicago. They pretty much just hang out one last time before they go their separate ways when they head off to college.",

It is a pure comedy, and that is what makes it so PERFECT.  Alongside movies like Rebecca and Miller's Crossing, I give Ferris a 10/10.Also, Ferris's portrayal of Chicago is brilliant, like that of Blues Brothers.

There's always an evil authority figure, a bunch of free-spirited and ergo protagonist teenagers that we're supposed to root for, a violent dog, a cool car, and a winsome young girl. This film has all of that and more.I never liked this film. There is something so inherently unlikable about a boy who cheats the system and emerges the winner. Who cares if America is going down the toilet due to truancy, at least the kids will get to ride around in a cool car and play make-believe at Chicago's finest restaurant. But I suppose that is the American dream; who cares about good grades?Matthew Broderick is perfect in the role of the miscreant Ferris Bueller, the boy who mortgages his future by skipping school. He talks to the camera, sings in the shower, lies to his parents, and convinces his best friend to steal his father's car. Nice role model.Jeffrey Jones, who has been shown since his star turn as the Emperor of Austria in Amadeus to take any role that he is offered, lowers his standards (if he ever had any) several notches and participates in John Hughes's prequel to the ouch-that-hurts-fest of Home Alone. Lest you forget, Hughes is the same man who wrote 'Beethoven' and 'Flubber'. There's plenty of slapstick comic relief as Jones is hurt many, many times. I guess it would be funny to an eight-year-old.Cliches abound: snooty restaurant hosts, flummoxed school secretaries, air-headed parents, hateful sisters. Gee, this thing wrote itself. I've been all over the world from Costa Rica to Paris and I have never seen a snooty restaurant host. Much like the mythical 'quicksand' that supporting cast usually get stuck in, the snooty restaurant host only exists in films as fodder to advance the plot. Also, someone please explain something to me: where the Hell did the parade come from? It's a school day and a working day for most people, yet there is a parade. Where did it come from? What holiday or event are they celebrating? The whole Ferrari-crash-through-window thing was the most pointless movie scene ever. Empty and soulless, this film says nothing except that ruining your father's car and house is a good thing to do if you are depressed.I will never understand the appeal of this dreadful film.",

            "content": "Without a doubt, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a 1980s comedy classic. This is a statement I believe most people would have a hard time finding fault with, but the question is -- how relevant is this movie today? For the most part, I'd say the film has aged relatively well. Sure, a lot of the elements are dated, such as the clothes, technology, fashion, and expressions of the day, but having said that, I still feel it is relatable to today's generation. Everyone's had a god-awful, boring teacher like Ben Stein, a friend who was wound up too tightly like Cameron, and a friend who got away with everything like Ferris.I do like this movie, but I've seen it so many times over the years that I do feel it's been played out. Now when I watch it, I don't laugh because I think it's funny, I laugh because I remember thinking it was funny in the past, and now it seems it's just a conditioned response.Realistically, it's probably highly unlikely, if not altogether impossible for Ferris to have done all that he did during his day off in the Windy City, but it wouldn't have been very fun to watch a movie called, \"Ferris Bueller's Uneventful Day Off\" either.The only problem with a movie as famous as this is that by the time you see it, assuming you've never seen it before, you probably know or have heard a lot of the famous lines, but never in context. It's worth seeing if only to be able to say you've seen it, too.This movie is definitely what put Matthew Broderick on the map, that's for sure. It's strange to think how at one time he played the ultimate cool kid, but now he's been relegated to playing mostly obnoxious losers. Actually, that's just sad.In closing, I'd say I recommend seeing it. However, keep in mind that as funny as you may find it initially, it will lose its luster in time.

It is something with its consequences, but with so many more personal benefits. Both are explored in a comedy fashion by John Hughes in my personal favourite teenage comedy.Undoubtedly there are problems when skipping the day of the normal routine, whether that's your jealous sister (Grey) or a paranoid teacher (Jones) and these supporting characters lend such good support and humour to the tale of this mischievous kid.But what about the benefits? Well not sitting in class, seeing the world and spending time with those you love what more could you want? It is the true meaning of freedom, and the unfortunate boundaries that we have to live in sometimes, and this wouldn't have been justified without such a great central protagonist.The opening shot of Ferris in the bed pretending to be sick and his parents buying it is funny, and later when he starts addressing the camera, invites us into his world of crazy ideas, intelligence and sophistication, beautifully portrayed by Broderick.The comedy is great, with a lot of slapstick humour and smart timings and insults thrown in for good merit.Teenage comedy mean girls is run by stereotypes, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is run by a stereotype, but a classic one who we can all relate to, and who we should all take a lesson from.",

            "review_title": "\"IIII'MMMmmmm Ferris Bueller!!!\"",
            "content": "Released in 1986, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" chronicles the misadventures of three high school seniors in suburban Chicago when they skip school to have fun in the city (Matthew Broderick, Mia Sara and Alan Ruck). Jennifer Grey is on hand as the title character's feisty sister while Jeffrey Jones plays the dean of students who tries to apprehend Ferris. Charlie Sheen has a glorified cameo as a dude from the other side of the tracks whom Ferris' sister (Grey) meets. Written and directed by John Hughes, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a coming-of-age comedy, but it's so atypical that it stands out from the pack of other 80's flicks of the genre. It has a quirky sense of humor that's so offbeat that it might turn you off upon initial viewing, but you'll catch a grip if you give it a chance. While there's some cussing (which is either realistic or amusing IMHO), there's thankfully no raunch or idiotic bathroom humor; the movie's too smart for that. The three protagonists are great and work well together. Mia Sara is jaw-dropping stunning throughout, but they could've (and should've) seized the opportunity and done more with her.The moral is carpe diem \u2013 seize the day \u2013 a conviction Ferris (Broderick) adheres to, which can be observed when he says to the viewer: \"Life goes by so fast that if you don't stop and look around, you might miss it.\" There are other messages: Cameron (Ruck) learns that living in fear of others' expectations will destroy you. And Jeanie (Grey) learns that resenting someone else's success, whether or not you think it's unfairly won, will eat you alive and morph you into a curmudgeon. While the movie's focus is obviously on Ferris' respite from the mundane and celebrating the freedom thereof he's not selfish. A veiled theme is that Ferris is concerned about his best friend (Ruck) in the face of his father's screwed-up priorities. When Cameron beats on his Dad's prized Ferrari we see his hurt due to a friggin' car being given a place of honor denied to him.Getting back to the main theme and Ferris, was it wrong for him to use deception against his parents and school officials in order to \"seize the day,\" not to mention later deceiving the host at the swank restaurant? Yes, but consider this: Ferris isn't a hoodlum in the least, nor an alcoholic or druggie. He's clearly got it together and brims with confidence; so much so that when he jumps on board a float at a parade he takes the mic and leads everyone in song. It's an absurd scene (and entertaining), but it culminates with a matter-of-fact statement by Cameron to Sloane (Sara): \"Ferris can do ANYTHING.\" When he says this you discern Cameron's monumental respect for Ferris' developing greatness. While it's true that Ferris' confidence and talents CAN devolve into arrogance, he's just an 18 year-old high schooler at this point, on the verge of graduation. Give him a break. He's merely experimenting with his mounting sense of freedom, which will segue into adulthood and the responsibilities thereof. Did YOU make mistakes when you were doing the same in your teens? Of course you did; so did I. For anyone who would argue that it's wrong to skip school, every student is allowed so many absentee days a year and it's clear that Ferris is on top of things, as far as school goes. In fact, there's an amusing scene that effectively shows how uninspiring the classes are. Ferris is more than on top of his education and knows that skipping a day for whatever reason won't hinder his current status or future potential. Furthermore, Ferris is a senior and it's close to graduation time. It's an unwritten rule that seniors skip school to celebrate, whether on official \"skip day\" or otherwise. Again, Ferris is taking charge of his life and he no longer needs the supervision of school laws and the strident taskmasters thereof. He understands and adheres to the SPIRIT of the law. Speaking of which, consider the most profound subtext, which I've never heard brought up by commentators, although it's obvious when you reflect on the movie: The dean of students, Ed Rooney (Jones), is a sourpuss legalist who naturally tries to squelch the spirit of freedom & life from anyone who would dare embrace it; and Ferris is public enemy # 1. In other words, Rooney represents legalism \u2013 law-ism or rule-ism \u2013 which is the rigid obsession with rules and the corresponding grouchy, joyless spirit. By their very nature staunch legalists HATE the spirit of freedom and will do whatever it takes to stamp it out when they smell it, which explains their nosey tendencies and why Rooney arrogantly feels he has the right to enter Ferris' house and snoop around. The message is: Don't allow crabby legalists to rob you of your true freedom and joy because they'll definitely try. Seize the day!Like I said, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a smart film; it's so eccentric and goofy that you can easily miss its profundities and write it off as nothing more than a silly 80's teen comedy. It is that, but it also treads the borders of greatness. I didn't like it on my first viewing, but 'got it' on my second, and might love it on my third. The film runs 103 minutes and shot in the Chicago area with Ferris' house exterior in California, as well as interiors throughout. GRADE: B",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986): Dir: John Hughes / Cast: Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey: This is every student's fantasy. A day without parents, teachers and authority. Ferris Bueller fakes sickness in order to skip his ninth day of school. He convinces his best friend to join him because one wrong move deserves another. Then they proceed to break Bueller's girlfriend out of school by faking a family death. The principal isn't buying it and makes an attempt to bring Bueller to justice. Entertaining and often very funny teen comedy directed by John Hughes who previously brought us The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles. One problem the film has is its moral dilemma. It seems to view Bueller's antic as heroic as he invades a parade as well as convince his friend to allow them to venture out in a vehicle that was totally off limits. Matthew Broderick plays Ferris whose actions are free spirited and without consequence. He is joined by Alan Ruck as his nervous best friend who must take a stand against his dominating father. Mia Sara plays Bueller's anxious girlfriend full of life. Jeffrey Jones is hilarious as the principal whose day keeps getting worse. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's sister Jeanie who knows of her brother's schemes but cannot convict him. It seems to address freedom and adolescence and our everlasting war against public education. Score: 8 / 10",

The story about a teenage kid Ferris (Broderick) who decides to take the day off with friends; high strung Cameron (Ruck) and his girl friend Sloane (Beautiful Sara). With principal Ed Rooney (unforgettable Jones) hot on his trail (so he thinks) and determined to catch Ferris if it's the last thing he does.

All of his films seem to send the message that being completely carefree is okay.I think this film sends the wrong message. While childhood and adolescence are supposed to be happy years, I don't believe that kids are supposed to be so irresponsible. Most people who watch this film say: \"it is just a movie\", \"kids are kids\", \"they didn't do anything so bad\" or whatever. But I don't agree. It is not about what they did, it is about how much impunity they had and how Ferris was depicted as a \"great guy\".What's kids mentality today? They think that they \"deserve\" to have an hedonistic, exciting and devil-may-care life. I dare to say that this film is one of the reasons a whole generation became more like this. Many people grew up watching this film, seeing Ferris as a hero or something.The difference between today's films is that when teenagers show acts of recklessness, they at least get punished in some way. I guess Ferris is the kind of character that is supposed to \"always have his way\", but I think that he should've been at least a little sorry for all his acts.Personally, I didn't like the principal's character either. They \"satanized\" the guy so much it didn't even make sense anymore. While some school authorities really don't care a lot about their students, it doesn't make sense that a grown man would be so resentful towards a kid.And well, while this film is certainly a classic... I can't help but feel a little disturbed that recklessness could be so glorified.",

Principal Rooney suffers the most, but he brings it all on himself; if he only stayed in the office, and waited it out, he would have caught Ferris in the act of truancy, he did not have to chase him all over the city.

At the stage of adolescent rebellion, highschooler Ferris Bueller is against the grain and aptly jostles between his wide-eyed parents and the staidly villainous school principle (safely inside the comedic zone though), he is the paragon from all kinds of aspects (save for his overshadowed sister), so hymning the free spirit under the milieu of 80s, no wonder its evocation and novelty was such a blockbuster during its cinema runs. There are numerous gags in the film, mostly benevolent but virtually diverting, while the narrative also nurses a plausible character development, the contrast between Ferris and his bro Cameron is plausibly enacted, but a graceful and underage exemplary girlfriend Mia Sara has barely her own lines and scenes to show her wisdom other than \"just being there prettily\". The film's apex achieves when Ferris staggering showcase his dance routine of The Beatle's TWIST AND SHOUT during the parade, Matthew Broderick is unparalleled and glistening in the leading role brought him to an instant stardom elevation. One just cannot help being nostalgic after watching this film since nowadays in the mainstream track, youngsters are pandered and reveled only in raunchy stench of coarseness and crassness, the good ole days are bygone with the premature demise of Mr. Hughes. All the social ethics and aesthetics spin faster than we generally expected, being reminiscent of these timeless cream from time to time is a stroke of luck which is not exclusively in the hands of cinemagoes",

            "content": "John Hughes has always had a problem with ending his films. It seems he enjoys expanding his slapstick to its fullest extent, but suddenly - right when we're getting comfortable - he realizes he has to end the picture and resolve the conflicts of his characters, so he diverts the course and natural progression his movie and it transforms into an introspective psychology session.Point in fact: \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" The first half is excellent. Our heroes our introduced, comedy ensues and we have a great deal of fun watching the narrative unfold.The second half - or more appropriately, last third - of the film is not excellent. Suddenly Hughes realizes Bueller's foil, Cameron (Alan Ruck), must confront his father. That Bueller's sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) must come to terms with her resentment towards her brother. That Ferris must contemplate the meaning of life, marriage and love between himself and his wife-to-be (Mia Sara).It's this type of stuff I can't get into. Look, I really love some of the stuff Hughes has done. He's a very good filmmaker. But he's always had a problem with endings and pretensions... the turning point for me in \"Ferris Bueller\" is when Cameron stares into the oil painting at the museum in Chicago...from here onwards Cameron goes into this weird state of comatose (particularly towards the end), Ferris starts talking to us about moving on to college, how Cameron's dad is a jerk, etc.Of course this is a natural conclusion for any film or literary writing - conflict --> desire --> outcome. But Hughes' problem is that his change in progression is too swift - the movie goes from being a light-hearted comedy to this pretentious study of teenage angst in which it takes our selfish Cameron hours to realize he must step up to his father...and for what reason? At what cost? What truly is the point? For Ferris, a great future awaits him. He will marry his high school sweetheart, go to college, continue milking friendships for what they're worth. His sister will get a new boyfriend and stop hating her brother.But poor Cameron...his revelation at the end of the movie is that he's going to step up to his father and almost certainly face a miserable life? Yes, it's nice on film to see Cameron \"rebel\" against his strict father...it's a teenage ideal...all fathers are evil. But come on already - wrecking a Ferrari and having your character's inspiration be taking the blame for it is a lame ending. I've never liked it.I understand many people do. Somehow, I can see why. As I'm writing this, I have to admit, it doesn't sound quite as pretentious as it comes across as being in the film. One could say the same thing about any teen movie - particularly \"Risky Business.\" But there's just something about this one. It suffers from that flaw Hughes has had his entire career. He just doesn't really know how to end his film (he's admitted this before... he said in an interview he never likes to end a movie, and that's why his closings always extend with extra footage while the credits scroll down).Sometimes he's gotten away with it - \"The Breakfast Club\" for example. That movie ended with a sudden introspective moment where the kids all got together and examined each other's problems. But it made more sense, given the context. It was justifiable. The ending of \"Bueller\" is not. I think it's childish and myopic.I do realize I've just repeated myself for about ten straight paragraphs, but that's something that's always bothered me about this film and I had to get it off my chest.What I DO like about it: (1) Matthew Broderick is hilarious and perfect for the role (2) The first hour or so is very funny and straightforward comedy (3) The characters are likable and seem realistic (4) Jeffrey Jones' quest to find Ferris is a very strong subplot...and so on.It's just a shame, you know, about that ending...",

Thank God my parents didn't allow me to watch The Boys in the Band or I might get ideas on how to become gay. (Sorry, old reference \u2013 1970, but Brokeback Mountain wasn't around when I was a child.)Too bad. For me, that is. This movie is as near a comedic masterpiece as one can come upon. Perhaps I would've been a better writer, or told better jokes had I been subjected to such genius.Ferris Bueller, genius? Why, yes. Originality? Check. Jokes that hold up and a script almost 99% timeless? Check. Relevance, drama mixed with comedy, convincing and believable acting? Check, check, check. Wow, that's starting to sound like \"Bueller, Bueller, Bueller\u0085\"Speaking of which, and this may be just my opinion, but this is one of the most quotable movies, next to Office Space that would come out 13 years following. I, myself, have been single-handedly quoting this movie since I saw it for the first time 20 years ago. And surprisingly, I haven't even seen this movie since then, not once, but I can still quote the film almost verbatim. (Though I got the Kristy Swanson \"Um, he's sick\u0085\" line mostly right, I sure as heck toned down on how long she rambles. And, I completely blew the \"Cubs/Bears\" bar line. But then, it was something I probably didn't catch before \u2013 I had no idea the Chicago Bears weren't a baseball team. Ha. I hated sports back then.)And now, watching it for the first time in two decades \u2013 now with critique eyes, I have to make the statement: this is as close to perfect as a comedy, er, make that, any movie, as one can achieve. The only things holding it back from being flawless, well, thing, is probably the pacing, but that's only slightly a problem in the third act and boy things get back on track for the finale.I found myself laughing out loud, rooting for our \"heroes,\" shaking my fist at the evil principal, singing along with the fantastic soundtrack, mourning with Cameron and getting so pumped at the climax, I just wanted to start from the beginning to watch it all over again. These statements are very rare coming from me and gave me a deeper appreciation for this film than I ever have before.If anyone hasn't seen this classic tale of high school rebellion, allow me to elaborate on the synopsis: young Ferris (Broderick) is trying to enjoy every day as if it were his last, and he does this by skipping school and dragging his best friend, Cameron (Ruck) and girlfriend, Sloane (Sara), along with him.This will be his ninth (or second?) absence this senior year of high school so he wants \"to make it count.\" He fools his parents, disturbs his jealous sister, Jeanie (Grey) and irritates his principal, Ed Rooney (Jones) enough to make it his mission to catch Ferris in the act of ditching school.Along the way, kids (and adults alike) root for Ferris to feel better (SEE: the now debunked ska band, Save Ferris), the threesome have zany and close-call adventures in the downtown Chicago area and learn about their lives, future and how to further avoid being caught.Will Ferris get back home so his parents don't realize he faked a sickness to avoid school? Will Cameron deal with his dad who loves his car more than life (or son) itself? Will Sloane get the proposal she desperately wants while dealing with the fake death of her grandmother?If you have not seen this, you MUST. Without (re)watching and reviewing all of late Director Hughes movies, it's tough not to put this absolutely excellent and all-but timeless film in the top 2-3 spots of his films. Oh, and by the way, it's almost timeless\u0085I honestly can't see too many things that would have prevented this from appearing fresh, even after it being released 24 years ago. Caller ID, maybe?",

            "content": "Of all the movies ever made, Ferris Bueller feels like one of the most iconic movie characters. Years after this movie was made, there'd be an even more iconic movie character in a Coming Of Age movie, Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon Dynamite which I think was supposed to take place in the 2004-2005 School Year as it said it on his I.D. looks like it was supposed to take place in the '80s. Ferris Bueller actually does take place in the '80s, but looks like a more modern recent film than Napoleon Dynamite, even though obviously the producers didn't intend for Napoleon Dynamite to look modern. I'm not a fan of Napoleon Dynamite, and would say Ferris Bueller is a much better movie.About being iconic, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is no doubt one of the most iconic '80s movies, and most iconic Coming Of Age movies. So, I just mentioned 2 more aspects that make this movie iconic. Watching this movie gives you an '80s vibe. I've heard so many people wish they could go back to the 1980s. This movie will give you a reason to wish to go back, especially as a High School Student back then.Even though this movie is from the '80s, like I said it will not look so old. It is no doubt a timeless movie. They brought out some of the best technology they had at the time this movie was made. A computer before computers were everyday devices, and hacking onto somebody else's computer in the '80s. A Ferrari from 1961. A synthesizer which was $8,000 in 1984. We see how Ferris's keyboard has sound effects of coughing. We have a nice suburban neighborhood with nice houses, and a lot of this movie takes place in the city of Chicago. There's that memorable exciting scene of the parade.The plot of the movie is also timeless. Playing hooky from school. A high school student not feeling like the things he's learning in school are worth his time. But, we have the main message and quote from this movie, \"Life Moves Pretty Fast, If You Don't Stop And Look Around Once In Awhile, You Could Miss It.\"Another interesting thing about this movie is how the whole movie takes place in a single day. It doesn't even go to night. This movie is a clear example of enjoying life and how much you can do in just a single day!! That reminds me, I think it's interesting how we think time flies. It can be hard to believe how many days have passed in our lives from moments that happened years ago that might not seem so long ago. We can easily calculate online how many days have passed since then, and it will seem like a lot. Most of us wouldn't be able to remember at the top of our head what we did on a random date years ago. I've heard of some people with a memory that good. It's hard to believe that each one of those days was 24 hours.But, that's what make this movie amazing. They might be awesome movie characters, with the right actors for their parts. We might be curious about what happens next? But, this movie has no official sequel, because it's supposed to be a certain day. I think this movie shows us how much we can do just in a single day. We can't get the time back when it's gone, and it's hard to believe how many days have passed. But, we can ask, \"What Can I Do Today?\"This movie is a fun exciting movie to watch that will put you in a good mood. If you haven't seen it, definitely see it!! This is one movie that is worth seeing at least once in your lifetime.",

            "content": "I went to see this movie in the theatre when it first came out (so long ago it seems now.) I loved it at the time. Laughed the whole way through. Although I've seen snippets of it since then as I've channel hopped and come across it, until today I had never actually seen it all the way through again. Somewhat to my surprise, it holds up quite well and I had an enjoyable couple of hours with Ferris and the gang.I've become accustomed to seeing Matthew Broderick playing dramatic roles, and he plays them very well. I'm convinced that he is extremely under-rated as an actor. Seeing him in the part of the master manipulator Ferris Bueller reminds me that he is a very versatile actor, with a good sense of comedy as well. He pulls this role off perfectly. It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Ferris. But with age and (I hope) a bit of maturity, I found other things to appreciate in this movie. Jeffrey Jones for one.Perhaps it was because I was younger and more likely to be unsympathetic toward authority figures, but I don't recall thinking much about Jones when I saw this movie originally, probably because he was playing the authoritarian role of Dean of Students Ed Rooney, whose sole purpose on this particular day was to spoil Ferris's fun. But Jones is marvellous in this role. If only comedies were taken more seriously, Broderick and Jones would have been a credible pair of nominees for Best Actor and Supporting Actor. Again, with more maturity, I was also able to better recognize and appreciate the subplot revolving around Cameron's (Alan Ruck) troubled relationship with his father, a piece of the story I frankly didn't remember from my earlier viewing.Sure, the storyline is paper thin, and there isn't much substance to the movie. But it's a decent time-waster. Better than decent, actually. It's a good way to fill a couple of hours. Nothing too deep; nothing much to think about. Just some good plain fun. And there's nothing wrong with that.I rate it as a 7/10.",

            "content": "The premise of \"Ferris Bueller Day Off\" is one of the best ever created in motion picture and that's why most people love this film: a teenage in his last year at high school whose major interest is to skip school, have fun, living the life of his dream. The execution of the film is good, almost hits the target of being a great comedy but there's some flaws in there that seems to be unnoticed by audiences in general. This movie is a classic comedy, considered to be John Hughes's best work among his fans, fact in which I respectfully disagree because he stepped outside of his usual humor with this film, and most of the actors who worked with him in other films are not here, and there are moments when you think that this is not a Hughes film. It works? Yes, the movie is funny, the performances are great, the soundtrack is even better, and the technique of Matthew Broderick speaking to the viewer is excellent.What doesn't work quite well in this film is that Ferris (Broderick) is flawless. This guy skip classes, plays the good son tricking his parents, annoying his sister (Jennifer Grey), has lots of fun with his girlfriend (Mia Sara) and his friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and so and so; nothing goes wrong to him, or his confusions always leaves him out of trouble and this kind of perfection left the film without laughs at some sequences, something should have gone bad so that us viewers have something to enjoy, laugh, or say something. He's not the only one with problems: his sister keeps complaining about his actions of fooling everyone and not get caught, she seeks revenge but doesn't do much, and she has the chance she saves him, so here the story became contradictory, no coherence at all.One of the things I enjoy in \"Ferris Bueller Day Off\" is Alan Ruck, who plays the rich and shy friend and that's something rare, I guess most people get identified with Ferris and his tactics of skipping school. Of course, people will get identified with Ferris rather than Cameron because they like to see something they're not (Ferris) instead of something that they might be (Cameron). But I enjoyed his persona, his nervous breakdown moments, and the most funny moment with him is trying to fool the school principal (Jeffrey Jones), pretending to be Mia Sara's dad. I'm not going to the same path as many other users walked by claiming that the film wasn't realistic and all, but I will expose some things that didn't work and could be better developed here. You might wonder what these three friends will do instead of going to school, and if you pay attention to where they go and what they do you'll notice that it wasn't so funny to be in a comedy. Do you skip school to go to a museum? I don't think so! And for people who doesn't attend classes these characters are too much nice, almost square figures that acquires cultural education by not going to school. At last but not least, the system made by Ferris to fool everybody, pretending he's at home and sick....that just doesn't work, because if you're sick parents will take you to the hospital and then you'll think that is better to go to school then to go to hospital. Believe me, I had better ways to skip classes and no one ever found out.For the ones who never saw it watch it fast because it is a good comedy from one of the most interesting decades ever for films. For the ones who give ten stars to this film make a good revaluation, and see how this film is not that funny as many claim to say, it only gets near. 8/10",

            "content": "For anyone who grew up in or even around the 80's...this film is a classic period. Some might not understand that but in watching it again recently I really watched it and I completely understand why it endears itself so much to us. This film defines the 80's the way other films have before it like The Graduate or Casablanca. Sound hard to believe comparing it to those films? The 80's was a decade of pomp and success and flashy...everything...and even now when we look back that's how we remember it and Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that this is what we all wanted life to be like. The film is funny, sad, expressive and wild. The legend of teenage angst and modern day classics John Hughes had to know he was truly hitting his mark with this one. You could (and people do) quote it for ages and it still holds its own even today and is just as entertaining and silly and yet really effective as it was then. This film is about freedom and growing up and bucking responsibility...it is an homage to being a teenager and we all wanted to be Ferris Bueller or be his best friend because everyone was either a Ferris or a Cameron.As often happened with John Hughes films the man knew how to score a great cast. His plots and scripts seem to simple and yet they are easily some of the most memorable films. Matthew Broderick gives an absolutely stunningly charismatic performance as Ferris Bueller. He breaks the fourth wall to narrate his own life. He's popular and well known and has clearly had some wild adventures before. Hughes manages to really make us understand Bueller before we go on this day with him. Broderick is perfect. Alan Ruck is his perfect counterpart. Cameron is neurotic, scared, anxious and desperately needs Ferris' help to break free. They have good chemistry together and they are the perfect balance. Mia Sara is the lovely girlfriend to Ferris. Sara is mostly eye candy and she is beautiful but she doesn't really stand out amongst the cast. She has a purpose and she fulfilled it. Jennifer Grey is absolutely fantastic as Ferris' terminally angry sister trying to stop Ferris in his tracks. She is sort of the villain and yet you can't help but love to hate her. The supporting cast of the film are all very good too including Jeffrey Jones, Edie McClurg and Charlie Sheen in a legendary cameo role.What can I really say about John Hughes as a director that hasn't already been said. He just simply had this absolutely magical talent at telling stories that you felt like you were a part of. It doesn't matter how improbably you are right there with his characters and you never forget them. He is an amazing writer and he is absolutely the exception to the rule that writer's don't usually translate to directors very well because no one knows his vision like he does. He probably has more classics and memorable films to his credit than most other directors. Most of all John Hughes' films are just fun and Ferris Bueller's Day Off is just simple fun. Its not intense and it doesn't make you think really, its just fun and a wild time and the perfect definitive 80's film. Whether its the product placement or the characters or the clothing...its a must see from the 80's generation. 9/10",

Not only is this possible John Hughes' funniest feature to date, but there's plenty of heart to be found underneath all the giggles.Ferris, one of the biggest procrastinators in film history, decides to take a day off from school and suggests/forces his closest friends do the same. What follows is just about the most ridiculously funny high school films to date. Pulling your parents leg about being sick is one thing, but convincing the entire city of Chicago that you're nearly on your death bed when you're actually singing Twist and Shout in the middle of a parade? That's another thing entirely.Yes, seeing a principle go to the lengths that Ed Rooney does to take Ferris down is a bit silly. But when you have a talent like Jeffrey Jones to work with, you have to take advantage of all the physical comedy chances you have. But speaking of talent, no one could have played Ferris better than Matthew Broderick. If you don't buy into Ferris breaking the fourth wall within the first minute or so of the film, than the entire story won't work. But with Broderick's charismatic charm, you buy into every second of it. It's like a great 90's action film, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It knows that most parents wouldn't actually buy into Ferris' \"sickness\", or that he could impersonate a well-known Chicagoan to get into a restaurant, or even lead a parade, but the film exploits every one of these situations. They take every chance they get in creating a ridiculously humorous moment. It's not going to blow your socks away with a realistically dramatic take on high school or real-life problems (though some are certainly touched upon), but it is a timeless tale of procrastination during youth, and the great lengths that one could go to make their day extraordinary. The imagination is strong here.+So ridiculous+Only works if Broderick is as good as he is+Fast paced with another laugh just around the corner8.8/10",

Matthew Broderick is just perfect as Ferris. Another perfect casting choice was Jeffrey Jones as the principal. He actually had the best scenes in the movie.

The 1 hour 43 minute run-time felt like robbery, couldn't it have lasted at least a half hour longer?Alan Ruck played the dumb friend, Cameron, very well..., Mia Sara was excellent as Ferris girlfriend, Sloane..., and as for the master Matthew Broderick, in my humble opinion, he was outstanding as one of cinema's most iconic characters (yeah you heard me right). The best of the best in turns of scenes had to be at the school, as Ferris craftily tried to pull the wool over the eyes of his principal, Mr. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), also as he tries to pull his girl Sloane out of class, pure genius, subtle comedy at its funniest.Jennifer Grey, who would go onto play the lead role in hit musical, Dirty Dancing, had a smaller role here as Ferris sister, Jeanie..., although only a minor role, the serious performance of Jeanie who despised her brother and carried a hint of jealousy and dismay towards him, only added to the humour. He wanted a day off and boy did he get one, now I suggest you take a day off too to watch this well sculpted 80's masterpiece..., do it now before Mr. Rooney catches you!",

            "content": "This movie is a light and fun comedy that takes us back to school days. After all, who hasn't wanted to take a day off and simply enjoy their youth? I think all teens have felt this urge, and often have, or played sick for one more day to themselves. What, surely, will never have happened is something as complex and sophisticated as what Ferris Bueller decided to do.The film is fun and uses a tasteful comedy style, without good resources, able to delight the whole family. John Hughes assures a firm and intelligent direction, who guides the film with skill, combining a creative and intelligent story with a very well written and thought out sense of humor.The still young and inexperienced Matthew Broderick does a good job as the protagonist, and is already showing signs of the talent he will develop in mature works. He knew how to give his character a strong charisma, combined with a rebelliousness and stubbornness typical of a teenager who has been pampered too much. Mia Sara did an equally competent job, even though she's a more clich\u00e9 character: she's the pretty, popular girlfriend, who's obviously also one of the school's cheerleaders. We find characters like her in virtually every teen comedy! Personally, I didn't like Alan Ruck very much. The actor is good and does what he can, but the character is irritating with all his spoiled rich boy whining. However, it's not just Broderick that makes the movie worthwhile: Jeffrey Jones' incredible work also deserves applause. He gave life to the school principal, who wants to prove that Ferris Bueller is deliberately skipping classes, and at the expense of that, he goes through a series of hilarious situations where, of course, he suffers hard. It's an impressive work by this actor, which makes us laugh until we cry.Technically, it's a film that doesn't have any major demerits, but it also has little that stands out: it has good cinematography, an excellent soundtrack and a series of witty and well-written dialogues, but everything else is within the standard you would expect from a 80s comedy.",

            "review_title": "Classic American Teen Movie!",
            "content": "Ferris Bueller's day off is an inspiration to everyone that understands the complexity of high school. Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) is an American Idol to all in this country. Everyone can appreciate the movie magic that is created when he takes of in the red car. The ingenuity of a moving, mechanical sleep dummy gets him started and on the right path to a truly successful day off. The plot is carefully orchestrated with Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as a wise-cracking high school senior from the fictional northern Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois (in reality, Lake Forest, Illinois), who decides to skip school (Lake Forest High School) for a day on the town by pretending to be sick. He convinces his nervous friend, Cameron (Ruck) to take his father's carefully restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California out for a spin, although Cameron's father has so little trust in him that he has memorized the car's mileage. Ferris makes the promise to erase any miles they put on the car by running the car in reverse when they return. Masquerading as her father, Ferris springs his junior girlfriend Sloane (Sara) from school on the premise that her grandmother has died. this is a truly remarkable film. This movie simply cannot be subjected to being graded by the same criteria as any other movie. It is completely original. To attempt to assess the acting in this movie is just stupid and pretentious. I have yet to see a movie that stands out in my collection (which is considerably large) as does this. Whether you are looking for depth or just comedy, which i think this movie achieves with class. Aimed at a younger generation of the time, it's truly surprising how much credit this movie gives to its audience; the esoteric conversations, the humor-in-dialogue-form, and the lack of crudeness is significantly above meant-for-the-average. This movie delivers any message a viewer may wish to find with class such that the movie/characters establish(es) an almost intimate relationship with the audience which must feel flattered by the highly intelligent work of art this movie is. It's a compliment to its viewer. Nine out of ten.",

            "content": "I guess Ferris Bueller's statement \"life moves pretty fast; and if you don't stop and look around you will probably miss it\" sums up the entire theme of this movie. In fact Ferris Bueller's Day Off, in some circles, has reached the status of being a cult movie. I know that it is a cult movie in my circle of friends, though I don't see it as such. In my opinion it is a okay movie and does deserve to be stated that it is good, but I would not make it a cult movie. I guess when you compare it with real cult movies such as The Blues Brothers, Eraserhead, any Jackie Chan movie, and Edward Scissorhands (okay, it is not really a cult movie, but it is one of my favourites) Ferris Bueller's Day Off can't really compare.Anyway, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is about a final year high school student named Ferris Bueller (surprise, surprise) and guess what? Yes, it is about a day that he takes off from school. But there is a bit more to this movie that that. Ferris Bueller is an idol not only among the people at his school, and not in his home town, but basically everywhere. This idolisation of Ferris Bueller is taken right out of proportion, and in a way he is seen as the champion of everybody. He is the all round nice guy who befriends everybody, but earns himself bitter enemies, and these enemies are his principle and his sister.I guess this movie looks at High School life through the eyes of a teenager. Bueller's ambition is to own a car, and to drive the best car there is, which is his best friend's 1969 Ferarri (which is really the property of his best friend's dad). School is portrayed at a dull and boring place with dull and boring teachers. They are simply automations who tell the students everything, while the students sit there brain dead. This is contrasted with the time that Ferris Bueller is having. He is driving a cool car around the city, and going to expensive restaurants, singing in parades, and catching baseballs at a baseball match, while avoiding his Dad, his principle, and his sister.I guess the thing about this movie is the whole idea of carpe diem. Why worry about school when you are young because one has all of this energy and wants to waste it. Unfortunately when one reaches my age, one has the desire to be going out and making an impact on the world. I lived the Ferris Bueller life when I was younger, but the life got wilder and wilder until it crashed to a halt. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction - the fun that I was having running around creating trouble smashed back on me creating a time a deep depression. Now I am much older and really wish that I did not waste so much of my youth - but in another way I if I did not waste my youth I probably will not be the person that I am today, and I would not have met that lovely lady that I have, as well as the really cool colleague that I have.On the other hand, Ferris Bueller is looking forward and knows that he must go to college to get somewhere, he simply justifies what he does now as taking time out too look at life for it goes so fast now that we will miss it if we are not careful. I guess there is a lot of truth in that because our obsession with making money and getting ahead means that we can miss a lot of the beautiful things such as love and the beauty that the world has to offer. It can also be that we miss the opportunity that God gives us.",

            "review_title": "OH YEAH! Ferris Bueller's Day Off is more like Cameron's Day off",
            "content": "Honestly I felt that this was more Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck)'s movie than Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) because nothing about Ferris is a coming of age story character arch. Ferris Bueller just end up being just Ferris Bueller by the end of the film, while Cameron grows as a character. This comedy movie written, produced and directed by John Hughes tells the story of Ferris Bueller who decides to skip school and spend the day in downtown Chicago, while not getting catch by Dean of Students Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) or Ferris' sarcastic sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) . It's just another day in the life of Ferris Bueller. While, normal fans think that the movie is just that. A simple plot. Others think, the events of the day are really happening in Cameron Frye's mind. Ferris Bueller and even Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) might just be made up in Cameron's mind to feel the void of no- friends. This might be taken serious due to the fact that Cameron is clearly older (Ruck was 29 playing 17) have no girlfriend, lonely, and has a control freak of a father. Ferris is the total opposite of Cameron: he's fun, spontaneous and has a loving family and sexy girlfriend. I don't really like Ferris due to his unrealistic nature. Truly he is unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker without judgment. It's Cameron that is the punching bag of events, taking all the risk. While, Ferris act sick to get out of school, Cameron is sick. This theory explains the more fantastic elements of the film such as the breaking of the fourth wall or unexplained events. For example, the whole city of Chicago rallies around the sick Ferris. This represents Cameron's dejected home life and how he yearns for people to care for him. This might also might represent what Cameron thinks the \"popular\" kids at school are like. The world revolves around them. Most of the film has Cameron wearing a medical insignia t-shirt. By the end of the film, the medical insignia, is inside out. Perhaps saying he doesn't need the medical help anymore, he has set himself on the path to correcting his life and facing his father. This film might be a comedy, but it's a thinking man comedy. There was the odd scene with Cameron was fixated on the little girl in Georges Seurat's 'A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte' painting. Does it any deeper meaning or just pointless. Cameron might see his life in pointillism, a technique of painting using small dots, hence the zoom in. That's kind of a discouraging thought. Unless, perhaps this was Cameron's mental journey towards understanding. In a way, that really works with this theory. The closer you look at the movie, the more everything looks like abstract blemishes on the fabric of Cameron's mind. When you're just observing the movie without thinking too deeply about it, it's just Ferris and his friends having a day running around Chicago. But the closer you look, the less things appear to be what we're shown. Actually, even before I did notice near the end that Ferris and Cameron had a bit of a role reversal when the car went over the edge. In that scene, Ferris, the always calm confident guy was scared and Cameron stepped up as the calm confident guy. Almost as though there was a momentary persona swap as though Cameron where beginning to reconcile himself, drawing Ferris strengths into himself and offloading his weaknesses into Ferris. Fascinating. Anyway, it's a cute theory, though probably not what John Hughes had in mind. The humor is so funny that it is often parody or use in other movies. The acting from all the cast is spot on. This movie is a tour guide of Chicago as it feature many famous Chicago landmarks including the then Sears Tower, Wrigley Field and the Art Institute of Chicago. I like how Wrigley Field had a Ferris Bueller's Day game in 2011. John Hughes wanted to film a scene where Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to a strip club. Paramount scrapped it. Honestly, that would have made the movie way more interesting than it supposed to have. I love the 1961 Ferrari GT California. I hope to get one, one day to drive around Chicago. Things I didn't like about the film: no character development for Ferris. All fun, but no work ethic. It might be telling kids, it's OK to have fun, it's not like you have to work a little to have that fun. I dig the \"Danke Schoen\" and \"Twist and Shout\" songs, just not the over the top parade scene. It felt too cheesy. I did like the 'Oh Yeah' song as well. The soundtrack is amazing. The movie was so popular, it got a short live TV show in 1990's with a then unknown Jennifer Aniston, a 2011's documentary and even an Super Bowl commercial in 2012. Overall: it has the spirit of effortless escapism. Like Ferris Bueller said on his day off, \"Find the joy in life, because Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it!'\" So don't miss out on seeing this film.",

            "content": "As with many classics which have been circulating around the historical presence of cinema, it's stupendously easy to be intimidated by a specific film. Ferris Bueller was one of those films. Endlessly referenced in pop culture, frequently discussed as one of the best teen comedies ever and directed by the 80s maestro himself that was John Hughes. Would I, a soulless British twenty-something, enjoy the fiascos and shenanigans of one Ferris Bueller? Turns out, yes! Ferris, nearing the end of the school year, decides to fake being sick so that he can explore the historical and cultural impact of downtown Chicago. However, hot on his tail are his sister and school Dean who are suspicious of his frequent absences.Not all films have to be heavy-hitting dramas tackling taboo subjects in a bid to evoke some repressed powerful emotions. Some can just be mild entertainment for the sake of depicting a joyous journey. Y'know, bringing a smile to one's face. And I know what you're thinking. \"I hate smiling\". Yes, well so do I. But I can guarantee, if you watch Ferris Bueller convince his friend Cameron to drive his father's 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder (believe me, had to look that one up!) or generating American buzz by slaying a infectious rendition of \"Twist and Shout\", you will not only smile. But laugh also. I laughed. I actually laughed!The sheer bombastic feel-good nature of this rather plotless comedy is too good to pass up. I mean, Hughes wrote the screenplay in less than a week, so clearly had intentions on character focus rather than an absorbing plot. And, despite a blas\u00e9 hedonistic approach that lacked purpose other than being an exploration of Chicago (who goes to an art museum when pulling a sickie?), the intent narrative structure relying on characters worked to a certain extent.This is a film about the eponymous Ferris Bueller. His sly, meticulous and often charming personality makes him relatable. Fourth-wall breaks and all, a now legendary technique used to elaborate Ferris' inner thoughts. Broderick did a smashing job, and I couldn't envisage anyone else in the role. It was his, and his alone. Ruck as the constantly anxious Cameron also ensued some hilarity within his performance and was just as memorable as Ferris. Just a shame that the character of Sloane tagged along and had no substantial depth. In fact, she had no depth at all! An unexpected frustration from a screenplay written by Hughes, who usually carefully creates every character. Dean Rooney and Jeanie Bueller were also highlights and elevated the joyous buoyancy of the narrative. And there's something satisfying about a young Charlie Sheen playing a drug addict. I don't know why, but it amused me.The third act wrapped up too quickly for my own personal taste, with no real obstacles to overcome. Aside from Cameron confronting his father, to which we never see, Ferris surprisingly had an easy day which hampered the investment I had for the overall story. Ferris Bueller is essentially the \"Easy Mode\" of Chicago. Banging soundtrack though! \"Love Missile F1-11\"? What a tune!And to end the film with a poignant message, well, that's a Hughes film for you. Quotable, innovative and quite frankly a jubilant day off from start to finish.

I was skeptical taking in consideration that this movie was highly compared with \"American Pie\" and many other American teen flicks.Well I decided to give it a try some years ago and I was impressed. This movie fits on any part of the world. Ferris has every single and possible clich\u00e8 that perfectly shows how a teenager's life can be.The situations are hilarious and make you wanna return to high school times. Really! I couldn't stop praising American humor that does not necessary needs scatological references or clich\u00e8d mockery against minorities.\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is the perfect teenager movie with clever jokes, situations, and extremely likable characters. The chemistry between Ferris, his girlfriend, and his best buddy is simply charming.Ferries takes into practice the \"carpe diem\" phrase and teaches how a single day can change your life as a student. Sure, we all got responsibilities during that phase but come on, some spice is always necessary if not obligatory.My favorite scenes include the infamous car action where the two valet parking guys ride with the Star Wars score in the background; the way the Principal tells a girl \"your ass is mine\" thinking it's Ferris; the ending; the song \"Oh Yeah\" which is now used in \"The Simpsons\" as the Duff Beer theme, etc.Ah, this is a great movie that hasn't suffered from the strays of time. The best American teen movie to date. Forget about the \"American Pie\" boom.",

This move is near and dear to a lot of people's hearts, and to many this may be their favorite film from the 80's. Personally, I thought it was just OK.I'm not a particularly huge Matthew Broderick fan. Not because he's a bad actor or anything. I just never really understood if he was more of a theatre type guy, a comedy kind of guy, a drama guy, or whatever. Don't get me wrong. The fact he can fall into all those categories is a testament to his versatility. It's just that of the films I have seen him in, I have always had just an average opinion of the film.The movie has a good story. Ferris Bueller obviously inspired the inspiration for Saved By The Bell's Zack Morris. And Mia Sara was the \"too hot for him\" type girlfriend. Even Alan Ruck provides some quality acting in this film.Perhaps the main issue with this is there were so many great movies in the same time period. This is one of those that if nothing else is on, I may tune in and watch it. But as a movie that bills itself a comedy, I feel it comes up short of the same kind of laughs that I get from watching most any other popular 80's comedy.",

            "content": "\"Bueller?... Bueller?... Bueller?\" Every teenager dreams of skipping school and Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) does just that. In this 1986 teenage comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, a not so innocent teenager nearing the end of his high school career, ditches school and, with best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), embark on an adventure to the \"Windy City\" of Chicago. With the upcoming obstacles of college, Bueller plans a day of shenanigans in hopes of saving Cameron. Little does Bueller know that his sister, Jeanie Bueller (Jennifer Grey), and principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) would do everything in their power to make sure that the so called \"perfect\" child would be caught red-handed.Jeanie Bueller and Principal Ed Rooney didn't expect that catching the famous Ferris Bueller was going to be easier said than done. Along the way, they themselves dig into deeper trouble, even with the law! Running through neighbor's yards, encountering a gruesome rottweiler, and maybe even a little romance with a young, troubled teen (Charlie Sheen). What else could possibly go wrong? Throughout this movie, it is hard for anyone to despise Ferris. His young, seemingly childish attitude that never gets him in trouble appeals to everyone. He never ceases to address the audience with a sarcastic, funny side note as if we are apart of his scheme. By the end of this movie, the audience will see Ferris develop on so many levels. He even goes as far as taking the blame for something he didn't do, even if that means being caught. Matthew Broderick comes through with his best performance to date.Although Cameron, much more reserved than Bueller, is a bit skeptical of Bueller's mischief, he slowly warms up to the idea of fun and even does the unexpected. Yet throughout this movie he never seems to wear more than three expressions. It's not until the end that the audience sees the true Cameron that has been bottled up. Will his father ever open his heart to his son? Sloane Peterson plays the perfect girl for the wild and unpredictable Ferris Bueller. She's able to keep Ferris in check and temporarily out of trouble, yet she still plays along with his shenanigans. Together they balance out to the perfect high school relationship.John Hughes, director of the famous \"16 Candles\" and \"The Breakfast Club,\" adds another memorable and comedic piece to his repertoire. Through the cultivation of every teenager's dream and the development of these characters, John Hughes certainly delivers. Anyone looking for countless laughs should indulge in this one of a kind teenage comedy.",

            "content": "I love this man, his work, his sense of humor, and his way to say important things by comedy.However, I see that the comic scenes here were less than what they should be, or maybe it's just me who waited for more! Plus, somehow I think that the real hero of the movie's drama was (Alan Ruck) as (Cameron Frye) the friend, because he is the only person who changed through the journey of the day / the movie, as he was dying because of his fear to do what he really wants, as the opposite of (Ferris Bueller). However, at the end, he became capable of facing his fear to be what he wants. But on the other hand, the original hero, or the movie's title character, remained the same till the very end; as the selfsame liar, swindler, who's enjoying the moment without any concern, or whatsoever about the future!Maybe (Hughes) was showing a nice symbol for being loose, released and free just to teach us, as the regular bourgeois, how to loosen a little, so not to miss the train of life. The beauty of it is that (Ferris Bueller), with all of his values, isn't harmful. Look at his frauds; for instance, he didn't run away from school to do drugs, or to rob a bank. He went with his friends to an art museum. I tried, so many times, to do such a visit with my own friends, and after the school time, but I couldn't convince them! And (Hughes) presented him as that intelligent wicked, to the extent that he could beat any future problems, especially with the love of the people. For example, he vanquished the principal too many times by his cleverness, having the ultimate victory by his sister's last minute rescue, when she finally believed in his crazy deeds and his lively philosophy. Therefore (Bueller) was just a symbol, a lovely mentor, more than a guy who would change. Although it's not as strong as being weaker, or suffering from defects sometimes, but (Hughes), by this dealing, didn't only venerate the character itself, he also meant to disclose our frailty and failure, compared to such a young man.I loved the glee childish feeling of the whole movie, the condensation of all the events in less than a daytime, the special appearance of (Charlie Sheen) in a brief yet suitable role, so (Jeffrey Jones) as the poor clumsy principal who looks and walks as so confident (Dirty Harry)! Plus those fresh ideas: the school's contribution for the fake sick (Bueller), redressing the car's counter by the hard way, the mechanical robot as (Bueller)'s clone in bed. And yes, I loved the main character and the performance of (Matthew Broderick), but I just think that he was more sensitive and less bravery to be (Bueller). Of course (Broderick) is a gentle comedian and his acting here is so vivacious, however his soft presence was one of some reasons that made me think that he wasn't as mad, bold and indifferent as (Ferris Bueller), or maybe not as any (Ferris Bueller) of who I've met.At last, you must ask yourself with confusion, as well as fury, where is that great writer?, and where are his enjoyable, innocent, and meaningful comedies?, and how could he let us in the hands of so-called comedies which have tons of toilet humor, and don't say something that lives longer than a week!",

Matthew Broderick brings the brash, popular title character to life with an energy that's so infectious it's easy to overlook a few ridiculous twists and turns, and the plot takes full advantage, pushing the envelope as far as it can feasibly get away with. Great comedic timing, an astoundingly deep, versatile cast of characters and the rocketing pace of an out-of-control avalanche help make this a timeless comedy that's aged extremely gracefully.

It's also funny how breaking all the rules is a desperate longing for rebellion and following all the rules is a desperate longing for acceptance. Highschool was surely a funny time.Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) was an interesting young chap who wanted to enjoy his life as a youth whilst living in a suburban Illinois neighbourhood. I must say, it is typical behaviour in places where there is no action. Suburbia is a 'manufactured' lifestyle where there is no activity of any sort. Children often feel bored and as a result, they misbehave more often.Ferris is in his senior year and he longs to have fun before he graduates. It may not seem so, but he means well when he drags his scrupulously-natured best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) and his sweetly-natured girlfriend, Sloan Peterson (Mia Sara) to 'dance' the day away (so to say). They play along with it and as a result, they unexpectedly had an unforgettable day and a thrill of a lifetime (the ball game, fancy lunch prank, cruising downtown Chicago in a red Ferrari). He cunningly fakes sick in the most technological of ways (even with our advanced 21st century technology, I must say this is more advanced than I could have ever imagined; he must have really planned this). Life is short. We should live every second as if it were our last.Mr Rooney was a successful, suburban secondary school principal who obviously has nothing better to do than to 'catch' Ferris in the act. He was so determined to do so that he went well out of his way to the point where he was only fooling himself. To reinforce authority is one thing, but to 'chase' someone is another.This movie really gets one thinking about how things could have been if he or she followed or broke the rules. Out of all the skip days I have seen, I must say that this is one that could never be easily executed (for those of whom I knew thought they were 'bad' by skipping school by writing false parental notes; that is rather asinine).

Credit goes to John Hughes for some of the really side-splitting funny scenes. Jeffrey Jones is superbly funny as the determined principal who tries to catch Ferris red-handed and then falls to Ferris' pranks. Broderick, Ruck and Sara, they all do their parts and delivered a nice performance together. Jennifer Grey is also good as Ferris' resentful sister. Lastly, quoting Ferris \" Life moves fast.

            "content": "Variety was way off the mark when it stated that Ferris Bueller's Day Off exhibits John Hughes on an off day. This is one of the high points of the teen-comedy genre and probably the best of John Hughes's films (only The Breakfast Club can be considered a rival).Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a teenager from a rich Chicago family. Adored by the pupils at his school, Ferris is the ultimate Mr. Popular with everyone apart from his spiteful sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) and the school's obsessive principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones). One hot summer's day, Ferris feels the urge to skip school so he fools his parents into believing that he has a fever. He then enlists the aid of his depressed buddy Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to plan the ultimate adventure. First, they \"borrow\" Cameron's father's classic Ferrarri, then they engineer a story to get Ferris's girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school, before heading off to Chicago to live the dream. On their agenda are such excesses as lunch in a swanky restaurant, a visit to Sears Tower, a trip to the baseball stadium, a whistle-stop tour of the museum, an interlude at the stock exchange.... at one point, Ferris even hijacks a parade float and performs a Beatles tune for the adoring crowds! Meanwhile, Ed Rooney spends the entire day attempting to catch Ferris out, proving once and for all that he isn't the dream son his parents believe him to be.What makes Ferris Bueller's Day Off work is the simplicity of the premise and the skillful accumulation of comic moments that are built around it. Jones has a fabulous time in his role as the ever-suffering school principal; Lyman Ward is hilarious as Ferris's gullible, goofy father; Ruck is by turns funny and pitiful as the melancholy Cameron Frye; Grey perfects a bitchy scowl as Ferris's sister; and, if you watch closely, there's a truly outstanding cameo from Charlie Sheen as a streetwise junkie who melts Jeanie's heart. All this is held together by Broderick's good work as the central character. There are some terrific comedy moments, the best of which for me are when Ferris's father gets held up by a car being erratically driven by a 4 ft octogenarian, and the scene where a busty nurse turns up to \"cheer-up\" the poorly Ferris. Many critics and reviewers have noted the sentimental vein that runs through the film, and it's true that it spoils things slightly, but on the whole this is an irresistible comedy and an absolute must for anyone who enjoys a good teen flick.",

There are some annoying sequences and the odd cliche, but mostly it's a well-written, funny take on a boy, Ferris (Matthew Broderick) who plays hooky from school, while trying to dodge the ever-annoying principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his parents (Cindy Pickett & Lyman Ward).Although the plot is well-known to most, I still have to say:***WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***Grade 12 student Ferris Bueller decides, impulsively, to take the day off & play hooky. He contrives a plan to get his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school, and cajoles his pal Cameron (Alan Ruck) into going along. Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jones) who discovers Ferris has been absent 'niiiiiine times this semester', also contrives a plan - to catch him in the act in order to keep Ferris from graduating. Ferris & his pals take off into Chicago, eating at expensive restaurants, seeing museums, and getting caught up in a parade (in a very badly overblown sequence). Mr. Rooney, meanwhile, tries to break into the Bueller home but finds himself confronted by the family Rottweiler and - later - Ferris's sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey). What follows is a comedy of errors as Rooney finds himself sinking into a mudhole, getting chased by the Rottweiler, and being confronted by an obnoxious flower-delivery man. ***END SPOILER WARNING***The parade sequence was overdone and some of it was totally unnecessary, especially the 'Twist & Shout' sequence. I found myself squirming in my chair until that one was over. It also seemed a little cliche in the sequence where Ferris is racing to get home before his parents, and stops while running through a yard to introduce himself to 2 girls in bikinis suntanning in their yard. The teachers are portrayed as dull, boring, uninspiring goofs (which is exactly what I thought of some of mine!), especially the economics teacher (Ben Stein, in the role that launched his career) whose dull, monotone voice...'Anyone? Anyone?...the Great Depression...' left the students in an apparent trance, most staring at him with their mouths agape or in one case, asleep on his desk and drooling. The english teacher (Dell Close) was another favorite, leaving Sloane and her classmates in la-la-land with his bland, dragging voice; 'In....what...way...does the author's use of prison....symbolize...' This guy reminded me of teachers I'd had in Grade 8! By the end of these takes I was roaring. I'm not going to spoile the ending except to say it is hilarious as it shows what finally happens to Mr. Rooney. Rent it to find out!**** out of *****",

Ferris contains some truly unforgettable one-liners (most of which are spoken by Grey). The facial and physical actions of all the different characters are also a riot. From the sick in bed scene, to the boring teachers, to the snooty restaurant, FBDO, never loses it's comic momentum. John Hughes has truly capture the spirit of every coming of age teenager, in this film, which I've seen dozens of times. It's one of those classics which just never gets old.

Its the only time in his career he did a John Hughes movie and boy did he pick a good one, but its mostly because of him that its so good.  Ferris enjoys life, has a ton of friends and a very pretty girlfriend named Sloane Peterson.  The only strain in his life is his best friend Cameron who is prone to anxiety attacks, wild mood swings and general unpleasantness.\nOne day Ferris decides he cannot bear school so fakes an illness to spend the day with Sloane & Cameron.  They go to Chicago, see the city from way above, go to the Art Institute of Chicago and a Cubs game, have lunch in an upscale restaurant, and join in on a parade.  While all that is going on, Ferris is being found out by the principal Ed Rooney.  His sister is also after blood because she knows he's faking it and is jealous of his ability to get what he wants. Its all for fun and a lot of it works, but for me the movie drags considerably when Cameron starts in on his litany of problems.  I am not unsympathetic to a teenagers problems, but they are in the wrong movie. \nThe best thing about this movie is the parade.  Ferris yells 'Twist and Shout' by the Beatles and all of Chicago joins in.  Something about all those people, all getting along and laughing and smiling and having a great time, makes me really love that scene.Lastly, what a car!

Maybe we all lived vicariously though Ferris!I remember very few teen movies from my past as popular as this one although there were a few. My feelings about Ferris Bueller(who came up with that soapopera like NAME?!) are all positive although I don't remember it as being quite as funny as others do. But this is a lovely little movie that didn't need to resort to cheap gags and over tired plots to be original and funny and that's a plus.

The movie has very funny jokes and slapstick. The parade downtown with Ferris on the float singing \"Twist And Shout\" is a showstopper, and a memorable cinema scene. Broderick is good. He brings Ferris' cocky charm to life and makes it real. Grey is perfect as the sister from hell. Overall, this is a great, funny, poignant movie, a tribute to living, instead of getting caught up in life.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "In less capable hands than those of Matthew Broderick, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" might have been unbearable. Ferris is self-centered, manipulative, dishonest. He uses his friends and family. He hacks into his school computer. He commits identity fraud. But there is something so darn likable about the way Broderick plays Ferris, we don't hold any of that against him. He comes off as likable as any other literary trickster (more likable than some). One of the charming things Bueller does is break the \"fourth wall\" and talk directly to the audience, sort of like his own Greek chorus. This way we willingly become co-conspirators in his misdeeds, and share the wonderful feeling that comes with shaking school off for the day and having a good time.At rock bottom, Ferris is just a boy who doesn't want to go to school. And it makes sense. Ferris does not seem to cherish a good education, but he is a whole lot smarter than anyone else, especially his drab teachers (one of whom is played hilariously by Ben Stein). By his talk of college, Ferris is probably making good enough marks, and having to sit through one tedious school day after another is wasting a good mind.After all, one of the things Ferris does is to look at Kandinskys in an art museum. A boy who goes to a museum when he blows off school rather than a brothel should not be forced to grind through boring school days that confine his mind. Oh, he also takes in a Cubs game (the film is set in the Chicago area).But Ferris' cleverness is not appreciated in all quarters. Because everything seems to come so easily for Ferris, his sister (Jennifer Grey) is envious. Knowing Ferris is faking sick, she becomes determined to blow his cover and get him in trouble -- not knowing he has taken off from the suburbs and is in the big city. Ferris is also being stalked by Mister Rooney, the principal (Jeffrey Jones, who turned in a wonderful performance as the emperor in \"Amadeus\" a couple of years earlier, and who is just as good this time around in a very different part). He has no proof, but he is certain he can catch Ferris Bueller malingering. So obsessive is he -- even though he has Ferris' mother's assurance her son is off sick and not being truant -- one feels Rooney and Bueller have a long history together, and it is not just this one incident that sets him off. Bueller's little games, we sense, have gotten the better of Rooney before.Can Bueller escape detection in truancy with his sister and Rooney both pursuing him? Can he get his friend's father's EXTREMELY rare automobile, which they have taken without permission, back home without a scratch? And will he and his pals get safely back from Chicago before their parents catch them?Loath as I am to bring in personal experiences, I'll admit I am the age of some of the actors in the movie. I was born in the year after Jennifer Grey and the year before Matthew Broderick (I'm also exactly Broderick's height). So even though they are playing teenagers, they were both well into their twenties; I was in grad school the year this film came out. Somehow, I missed it. I probably figured it was another dreary John Hughes \"teen angst\" flick. I only caught the movie in 2011, twenty-five years after its release; I may be the only fifty year old this movie speaks to. My philosophy in school was the same as Bueller's. And frankly, work for me has been nothing more than an extension of school. I have pulled many \"Buellers\" in my time without having a name for them -- which I will now regularly apply when I call in sick to have a good time. Since I knew nothing about the movie before seeing it, I was able to enjoy it without knowing what was coming next, and seeing it as fresh as if it had just been released. And I related to it on its most basic level, which I probably would not have had anyone but Broderick gotten the lead role. Otherwise, I'd have written him off as a manipulative little skunk. With Broderick in the lead I can list this among my \"feel good\" movies.And I think I'll pull a Bueller this Friday!Oh, \"skive\" is British slang for shirking responsibilities to do something fun. And I won't be going a museum. Whoopee!",

You'll learn something.The eighties were about grim optimism, and this sort of semi-nihilistic veneer is expressed in the scene where Cameron and Sloane discuss their interests. Sloane: What are you interested in? Cameron: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.And they chuckle it off like it's no big deal to have no interests in life. Their outlook is positive despite themselves, or in spite of themselves. Meanwhile Ferris lip syncs on a parade float and the world is there to catch him before he falls. The Eighties and the Fifties had many cultural similarities, and let me just point out that Matthew Broderick is the first and only male lead since Johnny Weissmuller in \"Jungle Jim\" to effortlessly pull off animal prints. Bueller sports two: his vest, and in one scene, his swim trunks. Does this embody coolness? Probably not, but it works here.

I saw this film and initially thought I hated Broderick, which was puzzling, since I'd previously found him amiable enough in \"WarGames\" and \"Project X\".  Then I caught \"The Cable Guy\" on TV and realised that it wasn't necessarily Broderick that I hated, but Ferris Bueller!   Some people admire the character's brash personality and hip posing.  I don't.  Every time Bueller was onscreen I wanted to punch the smug, cocky little **** into the middle of next week.  Was it just me?  My repeated fantasies of doing immeasurable harm to Broderick with various sharp implements were just that, fantasies.  What's worse, is that I will never get my chance to exact revenge on Ferris Bueller, due to the minor inconvenience of his non-existence...  Despite these barely checked psychopathic tendencies at the mention of Bueller, I found it impossible to dislike the film.  It screams \"good natured wish fulfillment movie\" at every turn, is pretty inventive, and gets you wondering \"What would I do?\" at certain points.  The cast all have fun will their roles, but Matthew Broderick's status as a C list star and John Hughes' current record of cr*p movies is living proof that they are being punished by a higher power for their hateful rendering of such an obnoxius little prig.    After all the bonhomie, only the hardest of hearts will remain staunch in their hatred of the movie.  The hatred of Ferris Bueller, however, will remain supreme.  The fact that certain characters in the movie also hated Ferris as much as I did made a slightly bitter pill that much easier to swallow.   This could have been a great teen movie, but the fact that I consider it slightly over-rated and want to kill the main character merely makes it good.  There is a silver lining to every cloud, though, and for \"Ferris...\" it is this:  the fact that I consider it only a 'good' movie means that I do not feel obligated to add it to my collection.  Were I motivated to rate it one mark higher than the 7 out of ten that I actually gave it, it would require purchase; and then I would have to grimace through an otherwise decent film every time 'HE' appeared onscreen...   One final point: you may think that my slight hysteria over the main character is something of an act, in a crude ploy to make my review more interesting and amusing.  This it MAY have done, but an act I can assure you it is not.  I think I'll go have a lie down now...",

A little misguided and vain, but a character that \"most\" of the audience will root for nonetheless.NOTE: The story of Ferris Bueller is told from a young persons perspective, with the adults either relegated to minor roles, or portrayed as stick in the mud buffoons (for its intended audiences pleasure of course). This narrative is typical of most of Hughes best films, as is a certain \"cartoonishness\", so if not your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this film could be diminished.Ferris Bueller scores 8/10 (7 for the film itself plus 1/10 extra for the music)",

            "content": "Having watched the recent Honda commercial send-up of Matthew Broderick, I watched this movie again.This will always be a great teen coming of age movie, or at least a movie for people under the age of 30 who were recently in high school. It's premise is based on the human urge to go against the system and buck the rules and just have a good time. Practically every kid that feels stuck in the walls of an institution such as high school is going to get these urges, and for all of those kids, Ferris Bueller is their hero.Matthew Broderick brings a warm, innocent charm to the title role as a young man who has luck on his side. Everything goes his way, from worming his best friend (Alan Ruck) into taking his father's rare Ferrari, to warding off the high school principal (Jeffrey Jones) to getting his girlfriend (Mia Sara) out of school as well.Writer/director John Hughes takes his love for teenagers and school situations and gives us a story that deals with life outside school and the freedoms and privileges of being a kid. What Ferris does is, as they say, getting away with murder, but it is such a joy to watch him get into predicaments and wonder how can he possibly get out of this one. Broderick is a delight, as are the supporting cast, especially Jennifer Grey as his envious sister. This movie is about luck and what that power can do for you. It is also about enjoying life and the power that can do. It is the ultimate skipping school movie and is one of Hughes' best efforts as a writer and director. See it for the story, the funnies or the plain joy of skipping school and catching a glimpse of life as it was back then.",

            "review_title": "A classic 80s comedy that never gets old",
            "content": "What John Hughes brought to Hollywood in the 1980s was some classic teen comedies that went on by cult classics and brought inspiration to many other teen flicks. Hughes was a director that brought a new generation to the coming-of-age genre, and with films like 'Sixteen Candles, 'Weird Science', and his most famous 'The Breakfast Club', comedies that many teenagers today are sadly missing out on, as Hollywood has declined more and more with original comedies. In recent years, the teen comedy genre has been gradually losing its vibe with movies depraved of originality. This comedy directed by John Hughes, is one that stands high on the pinnacle of teen films. Matthew Broderick plays Ferris Bueller, a popular Chicago high school senior who's been known playing hooky from school by faking medical illnesses, unlike his sister Jeanie (played by Jennifer Grey) who's grown frustrated for being unsuccessful with ditching school without getting caught. On another day of skipping school, Bueller calls his reluctant best friend Cameron (played by Alan Ruck) and his underclassmen girlfriend Sloane (played by Mia Sara) to ditch school and join him on an adventure through the streets of downtown Chicago for a day of fun in Cameron's dad's 1961 Ferrari GT. Their truancy however, gains the attention of the school principal Ed Rooney (played by Jeffrey Jones) who's tried desperately to catch Bueller skipping school throughout the year, and goes the hunt for him, Sloane, and Cameron as they tour through Chicago on their day off.Ferris Bueller is definitely the role that defined Matthew Broderick's career, at least my opinion. Bueller is the kind of character who is easily likable and fun to watch, and his message about how life moves pretty fast and if you don't stop to look around every once in a while, you could miss it, a message many can relate to. The movie itself is very easy to relate, especially nowadays. When you reaches your senior year of high school, there's a good bet you developed a case of \"senioritus\" to the point where you might have planned a day to ditch school with your friends and go to the mall, got to the movies, etc. Yes, it is not the smartest decision to make and can handle you into trouble, but it is just the reminder that we were all teenagers at one point. Matthew Broderick brings such delight and charm to the titular character, and he is very funny in most scenes that it keeps viewers entertained and liking him as a character. Alan Ruck who plays his best friend Cameron who struggles to endure their day of fun from the fear of being caught by his hard-nosed father or Bueller's day who happens to be touring around Chicago the same day, is very great in his role and fun to watch, much like Mia Sara who plays Bueller's girlfriend. Every scene these three are in is entertaining, and provide viewers with some of the most quotable lines ever delivered in a comedy, as well as beautiful imagery of downtown Chicago and a nostalgic 80s soundtrack. And then there Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney, the sneaky principal has nothing better on his agenda than to catch Bueller skipping school and hold him back for another senior year. He provides some good comedic relief as we watch him involved in his unexpected shenanigans that make his day a living (and funny) hell. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is classic 80s comedy that certainly holds up today and something that everyone should watch, especially the teenagers who have yet to explore the 80s era of Hollywood. This movie is easily one of the most memorable movies of its decade, and quite quotable for many. If there is a friend you know who hasn't seen this, I strongly encourage you to make this a recommendation for him or her.",

            "content": "Sharp-as-a-tack high schooler Ferris Bueller(Matthew Broderick,whose long and successful career since owes itself majoritively to this role over any other)decides on this particular sunny Chicago day that he should take another \"sick day\" off. His reasoning is simple: he feels that going off to school like a mindless drone when there are other things he'd like to do is a complete and pitiable waste. As he so famously puts it:\"Life goes by fast,and if you don't slow down,you'll miss it. So slow down.\"To this end,he perfects a simple yet elaborate ruse to dupe his parents into having him stay home,much to the seething envy of his sister Jeanie(Jennifer Grey,who will always be Jeanie to me,much the way she's Baby from Dirty DAncing to others)who rarely gets this kind of parental benefit of a doubt. Next,he rounds up his two best friends:dyspeptic,hyper-depressed killjoy Cameron(Alan Ruck,fantastic here!)and his pretty,quiet girl Fallon(Mia Sara,lovely),who as much become party to the ploy as Ferris himself.The three are pretty much in the clear,save the dogged suspicions of the pompous,self-righteous principal(Jeffrey Jones,practically born to play this role it seems!),who goes in pursuit of catching Ferris,whom he's been convinced has been faking it through all of the(so far)nine sick days hes taken. It goes without saying that all three,Ferris,Cameron and Fallon have all done this before,and gotten quite good at it.From there,the tour-de-force(farce?)becomes a rollicking travelogue for the city of Chicago. The fun that is culled from these experiences is nearly surreal,and the time-line that these events(German Day parade,Chicago Cubs game,Art museum,dining at a ritzy four-star)would suggest that they didn't spend too much time in one place,just enough to drink in the experience.Director and co-writer John Hughes was on a colossal roll in 1986 and after dipping into darker material in the previous year's The Breakfast Club,returned to lighter fare here and did it seamlessly. Probably one of the best elements of the movie was the breakdown of the \"fourth wall\",where Ferris talks to the audience,setting the tempo and giving the story a \"persona\" that is endearing as well as humorous. This film is a keeper,and despite the datedness of the music,clothes and hairstyles,this film is timeless in its theme and as always enjoyable.",

Ferris Bueller's day off is probably the best teen film ever too. There are some great teen comedies, like Clueless and Mean Girls, But Ferris Bueller is absolutely fantastic. Every character in the film is likable, even the ones that you wouldn't expect to love. Like Jeanie(Jennifer Grey, who gives her best performance to date) and Rooney(Jeffery Jones, who also gives his best performance to date). Of course Matthew Broderick is fantastic Bueller, and i love it when he's on that float. Ferris Bueller's day off is one of the most memorable teen comedies ever. My favorite scene is where Jeanie and Rooney jump out at each other and Jeanie kicks his ass. Ferris Bueller's day off is a classic.The Plot: Ferris Bueller, the funnest teen in the world, decides to take a sick day off. Him and his friend Cameron and his girlfriend Sloan join with him. Meanwhile, Principal Rooney and Ferris's sister Jeanie go out of there way to prove that he is skipping school.",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller reportedly lives life on the edge, unplanned, spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment. But what we only later see are the clever little devices he has rigged up to precisely maintain an illusion of his sickness, and how he has carefully orchestrated a day for his friend to gain some self-worth and respect so that he may stand up to his father. It is easy for a viewer to take the opposite perspective in line with the dastardly Principal Rooney. Ferris is young, good looking, popular, has the girl; the sorts of things that are easy to be jealous of. And his sister, too, is not convinced like his legions of adoring fans, and in particular, his parents. We see then, how Hughes has magnified each and every close call because of this perspective, this needy desire to expose and ruin a teenager's fun. When Katie Bueller creeps up to her son's bedroom to check on her, the soundtrack takes a shrill, horror-influenced turn and the walls turn into something out of The Shining as she slowly approaches (and note that the fake arm is clearly in view; but these caricature parents are so endearing and loving that they never once question Ferris). And then as she is relieved, she skips down the steps and the score is once again pleasant. The same technique is used as Rooney attempts to trap Ferris in his tricks, only for a two way phone call to suddenly put into harsh light all the insults he has sprayed through the speaker. Again, this loud, ominous fanfare blasts as we zoom into his shocked realisation, and his bumbling attempts to patch up the situation milked all the way from Hughes, until the humorous reveal that Cameron is now on board with the day-trip. From the loathing tone in his voice you might have thought that Ferris was an escaped murdered on death row. But what we instead see are a series of innocent little adventures through the city of Chicago that are designed to slowly peel away at Cameron's shell. As they lean their heads on the glass of the Seers Tower and survey every tiny ant with their own lives, all he can think about is the coming rage of his father. Later, he nervously teeters as Ferris bluffs his way into a high-end restaurant before assisting him yet again by mimicking a police officer. In perhaps the most iconic sequence of the movie, they visit the Art Institute, and on the backdrop of a dreamy cover of Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want (a teenager's plea, if ever), they lose themselves and descend into playtime. Hughes freely admits this as a sort of self-indulgent nostalgia binge; a place of refuge and comfort for the youth of his time. And here they pose in mock pretense, they kiss like teenagers do in the silhouette of the beautiful blue glow of Chagall's America Windows, and it's just so soft and light- hearted. And like a teenager does, Cameron seems to find meaning in a grand Seurat, and through a series of axial cuts he focuses until the details are merely splotches of indistinct paint. There's no real meaning to be found in the canvas, but there is plenty of introspection that can be found in Cameron. And in the midst of these whirlwind events, there is a little side- plot that concerns Ferris' sister, whom is constantly pushed aside. While Broderick charms and addresses the audience directly and invites them along on his day off, we see reaction shots that tell us Jeannie has been enduring this farce for so long. She got the car, but what good is it if she cannot escape school like Ferris has the ability to? So while we are swept up in his adventures, there is a quiet, modest scene completely dedicated to Jeannie, where she voices her frustrations to a stranger played by Charlie Sheen. She bemoans the fact that he is always getting away with things that she cannot, and how unfair it is; anyone with a sibling will know this feeling. And then as he makes her come to the realisation that this says more about her than it does for Ferris, she becomes this giggling schoolgirl and her facade is shattered. This is handled extremely well without attacking Ferris, but allowing Jeannie to really show who she is, and that her problems are not really that bad. Another memorable scene is the parade that seemingly erupts in the middle of the day, to be high-jacked by Ferris. It seems like something of a daydream. Where did these people come from, and how do they have the time to dedicate to an elaborate dance and song? We see everyone drop their things like it is a pre-planned flash-mob, but it is anything but. The construction workers up above join in to a rousing rendition of Twist and Shout, and even Tom Bueller dances in his office. It's just pure, clean fun. And the iconic theme of Star Wars magnifies the slow- motion frenzy of two parking attendants who take the Ferrari for a joyride, where in some other film might result in a crash and a panicked hurried attempt to patch things together before Cameron's father reaches the front door. But that doesn't happen here. It seems that most people just need to take a Ferris Bueller day once in a while.",

A friend of mine had seen this ages before I'd made the effort to, and he condemned it, apparently for the facts that he hates Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Grey. Whilst in films like \"Godzilla\", I'd happily agree that Broderick is an unoriginal, relatively irritating actor, the reasoning for this is that in another life he was obviously Ferris Bueller.In this film, we are introduced to Ferris Bueller. A popular guy around school, Bueller one day decides to take the day off and sets up an elaborate scheme to allow himself, his girlfriend (the delectable Mia Sara in one of her first roles) and his best friend Cameron (played beautifully by Alan Ruck) to travel to Chicago and to have the time of their lives. Along the way Ferris will show Cameron the \"best day of his life\", punish people who deserved to be tortured, and allude and torment his principle Mr Rooney (performed by the outstanding Jeffrey Jones).It's hard to really criticise this film. The plot is generally brilliant and feels almost like the \"missing link\" between 1980's comedy and later films like \"American Pie\", the directing superb, and the acting ranging from middle of the road to 100% believable. Despite these though, two things from this film spring to mind I confess.Firstly, possibly the highlight of this film is the introduction of a young actor with an amazing father who was only in acting for two years when he produced this film. That actor was Charlie Sheen, and after Matt Broderick, he must take full honours for coming out of this movie the brightest.Secondly, and most importantly of all is perhaps a minor criticism. I stand by a previous comment that it is hard to criticise this film, simply because that's the truth. The one really serious moment when Alan Ruck's Cameron is forced to face upto his past is stunning. However, the one criticism with this film is more to do with the third of the partying trio, that being the stunning Mia Sara. Now Mia was new to the world of acting when she appeared in this movie (only previously featuring as Princess Lily in \"Labyrinth\" the last year), but in this film at times it does feel very much that her character is more attracted to Cameron than to Bueller. I confess I don't know whether this is intentional or not, but until her last scene when she mutters to herself that she loves & is going to marry Ferris, it feels incredibly like she is going to reject him in favour of Cameron who she seems to be increasingly friendly towards. Perhaps this is just me, either way, this point does not detract from the film in any way.I guess, to summarise, often this film when viewed anytime after 1995 (I'm viewing it in 2004!) is going to appear slightly 1980s, but irrelevant of this, we are presented with the heart warming, often hilarious, story of one 17 year old who one day decides he wants a day off.

            "content": "This film has more or less interesting story and funny moments, and you can watch it if you want to spend an evening with some comedy, but it has some drawbacks. First is Ferris being an egoistic fool sometimes. I like Matthew Broderick as an actor, but in this movie his character isn't that good. Second is that his companions are badly represented. For me both Cameron and Sloane are poorly written and played, not to mention the actors who performed them. I think this is a miscast. Cameron is an irritating character and Alan Ruck is a bad choice for this role. His story is not finished as well, and I don't know what was the point of leaving it unfinished. Charlie Sheen in his cameo looks much better. And speaking of Mia Sara, she just doesn't look like the right actress for the part of Matthew Broderick's girlfriend. He looked much better with Ally Sheedy in WarGames. They had chemistry on the screen, which is abscent in this movie with Mia. In other respects films is quite funny, especially the moments with Ed Rooney. Thus I can give this film only 7/10, it could be better.",

            "content": "I went to see this movie in the theatre with my sister, and we cracked up! I just loved the classic \"School-Itis\" scene in the beginning and the love/hate between Ferris and his sister Jeannie! She knew he was faking but he totally fooled his parents! And then he winks at Jeannie and she gives him one of her hate-filled stares (which she did all through the movie,) and her expressions were just so evocative! She was GREAT in this movie! (And I've always had a thing for JG!) Her classic lines: \"I KNEW IT! OHHHHHH!\" when she finds Ferris' dummy under the covers in his bed - \"And if you say Ferris Bueller you lose a testicle!\" to Charlie Sheen in the police station - \"My name is Jeannie but guys call me Shauna\" - the same \"You don't have to live with the little trouser-snake!\"But I have to confess that I really despise Ferris. He thinks he's so funny, but he's nothing but a selfish little boy. He doesn't give a damn about anything but his own pleasure. Just look at the way he treated Cameron. He didn't give a POOP if Cameron was really sick, or if Ed Rooney caught Cameron ditching and he got in trouble for that, or much worse for a phony phone call, or if Cameron's old man beat the s**t out of him for taking the Ferrari, or anything else - he just manipulated and shamed and bullied Cameron until he got what he wanted. Then he burned rubber out of the school parking lot, he took his hands off the wheel a lot while driving, and then he left that priceless car with those two dirt-bags! Then he under-loaded the engine trying to run the speedometer back for 150 miles (which won't work on a Smiths-Jaeger speedometer-it's made to defeat that.) And he called Cameron's Subaru \"a piece of s**t.\" You know, Sloane could do better than Ferris. I really hated the little b@st@ard!Poor Ed Rooney! I liked Grace, though! She was funny, especially her accent. I'm from Minnesota and the Chicago accent is really quite similar, and she did it perfectly. Classic Grace lines: \"Sluts, dweebs, jocks, motor-heads, they all love him. He's a Righteous Dude!\" (which she pronounced 'doooooooode,\" which cracked me up!) \"Peterson home on Line 2 - and watch your mouth this time!\" \"Oh, Ed! You sound just like Dirty Harry!\" Ed says \"Ferris Bueller's behind this, I know it! And now he's got Sloane Peterson involved in it.\" and she says: \"And her grandmother, too.\" Not to mention how she put down Jeannie when she got a little smart-mouthed.And now we come to Mia Sara... smoking hot is the best way to describe her. Dude, there are all kinds of nude pictures of her on the web and I've downloaded every single one of them. Like Beavis said: \"Boingoingoingoingoingoing!!!!\" How could a geek like Ferris land a girlfriend like that? Only by being a consummate bull-s**tter... It really cracked me up when the school nurse walked into the classroom and Sloane starts putting on her jacket (which was really ugly, by the way) and grabbing her purse EVEN BEFORE the teacher said anything! She knew!You know, the girl's clothes in the '80s were a lot more modest than the '70s. They looked better. Now - God! It's horrible!Classic Sloane Lines: Ferris says \"do you have a kiss for Daddy?\" and she says \"are you kidding\" (TOOOUUUUNNNNGGGGE!) and Ed Rooney is standing up there, just TOTALLY FREAKED OUT! Dude, I damn near died laughing!Bloopers: Every movie has at least one. When the dirt-bags are out seriously abusing the Ferrari, the speedometer they show is NOT the real one from the actual car. Ferris' parents supposedly didn't have the money to buy him a car, but between the synthesizer, the stereo and the computer, there's about $13,000 worth of electronics in his room (Back then, a car (like Jeannie's Fiero) was only about $9,000 (in 1986 prices.)So, it's a really fun movie and it'll go down in history as a classic, but I still say Ferris is a trouser-snake . . .",

This is, of course, another nearly-timeless teen classic from John Hughes in his golden era. Unfortunately, this means it suffers from the same flaw most of this period does: after about the first third of the film you can probably turn it off since you've seen the best it's going to get. Aside from Principal Ed Rooney's very funny pursuit of Bueller through the remainder of the movie, the best moments for my money occur before Ferris leaves the house! I understand this excludes the well-known 'Danke Schoen'/'Twist & Shout' parade scene, but this is an overrated one anyway. Our insights into Ferris -- as well as into the excellent portrayal of what could easily have been a thoroughly irritating spoiled brat by Broderick -- chiefly occur in the first half-hour of the film, and much after that is filler. Not that I would dissuade anyone from watching this fun movie all the way through at least once, but be prepared to make your popcorn break about the time they show up to pick up the girlfriend.",

This movie is filled with jokes about our culture. I haven't met one person yet who has seen it and not liked it. Talk about a 1980s cult classic. The film uses witty humor and a bit of goofy humor. It's the PERFECT film for light comedy. If you're into those kind of films that make you think a lot, this one definitely isn't for you.

This comedy was a smash hit at the box office that became an instant classic and made a star out of Matthew Broderick, who is absolute perfection in the title role. Broderick lights up the screen and tackles this role with an effortless charm that is quite engaging and even appears quite comfortable during the moments when Ferris talks directly to the camera. John Hughes' inventive direction is a plus and Broderick is given sterling support from Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney, the principal of Ferris' school who is determined to catch Ferris ditching school, Edie McClurg as Rooney's secretary, Alan Ruck as Ferris' best friend Cameron, Jennifer Grey as Ferris' jealous older sister, and Lyman Hall and Cindy Pickett as Ferris' parents. Yes, the screenplay is a little one-sided...all the adults in the film are made to look like idiots, but if you can accept that, this comic-fantasy adventure is one entertaining roller-coaster ride. The film made a star out of Broderick but he was so good in the film that he became type-cast for years to the point where no one would even think of casting him as an adult, but if you're gonna get typecast, be thankful it was due to a classic like this one.

The movie stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller a senior in high-school who is determined to act sick so that he can ditch school for a ninth consecutive time so that he can some fun with his best friend Cameron (played by Alan Ruck), and his girlfriend Sloane (played by Mia Sara) for the whole day while his parents are away from home, while Ferris is on his so called sick day his school principal Ed Rooney (played by Jeffrey Jones) is determined to get him busted for ditching school. Writer-director John Hughes has written the perfect story for a well done teen comedy, and his direction and his cast try to prove that the stupid thing that teenagers do can be very laughable. the movie also includes a very good supporting cast which includes Jennifer Grey as his sister Jeanie who gets ticked off in the beginning of the movie when she knew all along that he was going to ditch school when her parents found his performance to be very convincing as well as the other 8 times that he ditched school to take a guess, and Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward as their parents Katie and Tom Bueller the parents as I mentioned earlier got fooled by his prank.

            "content": "If there was an perfect actor for a movie, it would be Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's day off. All that lovable cheek, and those classic facial expressions, one when looking straight to camera, sometimes before he delivers his insightful and colorful monologues. Ferris, the professional, shows us some tips for successful faking in front of the folks. There's absolutely no way you could hate this guy, unless you were Ferris's sister (Jennifer Grey) who envies him the way he always gets out of stuff, like school, and his award winning performances of a sick kid in bed, his parents taking the bait, where he gets to bludge his way through college. He takes no chances, making sure his operation is foolproof, where all avenues of his little charade, are backed up, if anyone should pay a visit or ring the house. He has a tape equipment, with a synthesizer of sounds, coughs, vomiting, or barfing up a lung. Only the headmaster, Ed Rooney is onto his little show, out to catch him if it's the last thing he does, even if it kills him, which it almost does, on a return bus trip back to school, in tattered garb. What this movie's message is, stands true to a few of Ferris's wise words. Everybody should relax and take a break every so often like a day off work, or in Ferris case, high school, though never as many days as Ferris. Being a wagging student myself, I did relate a bit to it, only I just went on and wagged school, especially in my last year in grade eleven, where I left a week before the end of the second term. Coincidentally, I left a week before this movie hit cinema. In home class, the last two or so months, I was absent almost every day, and my parents never got a call. In fact I was wagging subjects I didn't like and I had an assortment of grades ranging from A's down to E's. And to tell you the truth, I felt much better, liberated, and defiant. How I hated biology. Ferris's best friend, Cameron, worked and stressed to the max, with a real arse...e of a father, although we never see him, is a severe example of someone who needs to decompress, I was myself concerned for him, even though he was just a character. On Ferris's latest day off, he keeps hounding Cameron, to drive over and pick him up for a city trip. Cameron's sick in in bed, though Ferris tells us, it's only in his head, which I believe too. Cameron folds, helping Ferris too in a plan of phoney voices, that involves taking Ferris's girl (Mia Sara) out of school. You'll love how this plays off. So now they have the rest of the day, and how they spend it makes it a fun filled adventure. One scene in particular, that's unforgettable, is in a museum, with Cameron relating to a painting of void, that keeps minifying, where he feels so small. Ferris brazes out, and risks all, jumping up onto a float before live t.v. and sings Twist And Shout. Another potent scene involves Gray at the police station, pouring her troubles onto, a wasted teen, who else but Charlie Sheen, who makes her see with his insightful analogy, that Ferris is not the problem. And just when you think Ferris is about to be caught out, when making like a hare, crossing numerous backyards and jumping fences, in a hasty rush to beat his parents, returning home, guess who saves the day. Highly infectious comedy cult hit of 86, that I've heard favorable mentions from people here and there. One of Hughes's best, again another one with it's share of morals.",

Definitely John Hughes's best movie, Ferris Buehler's Day Off has many memorable scenes, my favorite being when Edward Rooney (the villainous principal in search of Ferris...) walks into a bar with a television set playing the same Cub's Game that Ferris is ditching school to attend.

John Hughes is a director who knows how to talk and broadcast the dramas and yearnings of youth like no one, always dressed in comedy, his films take all audiences and always preach the philosophy of total entertainment, from beginning to end (not stopping even in the credits) , but John also uses his communication skills to talk to his audience (even though the feature of the breakdown of the fourth wall is widely used here), John creates a film of three characters discovering themselves, but of an emphasis mainly on Cameron , he is the character who understands his purpose and makes the biggest break of rupture of the film, the whole movie is based on trying to enter his mind and understand his personality -Vide the scene of the pictures- he is the real protagonist of the film, and John deserves all our respect for including all this layer on the long and cover of fun and comedy. But in addition to that, the feature has a wonderful technical direction, camera angles and cuts of the film are surgical, in addition to those against flat and long plans, not to mention the richness of screen compositions and costumes, and the striking soundtrack, speaking in remarkable things, we can not forget Mattehew Broderick, who plays the role of his life, although all the actors are great in their roles.

And perhaps there are other deep studies that could be made about many of the characters-- including the hilarious bit-role from Charlie Sheen-- but let's face it, that's not why we watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off. However, it is worth mentioning that the profiles made of all the characters work so well in the flow of the day and the interactions that take place.For those who haven't seen this movie that's considered a classic, you will not get laughs-a-minute where you consistently give small chuckles to clever lines. And those types of movies can be great (look at Airplane! and The Lego Movie), but that's not what this is. And that's okay. Instead, you have a fleshed out adventure in one day from John Hughes that gives situation after situation where he knows exactly what he wants. The slightly off-kilter vibe separates the movie from others like it, and the result is many genuine laughs. I'm not here to say it's a classic, but it is hard to deny that there are many elements that have worked their way into classic pop references.There's a lot that happens in this single day. And when I make statement like that, that is usually a very scary thing for a comedy, for everyone knows that the longer a comedy drags on, the worse it becomes. To its credit, this film is consistent in its type of humor while creating scenes that feel fresh-- even with subsequent viewings. From the Ferrari to the parade to the baseball game, some sequences are big and some are really only for a couple of seconds. It's this combination of build-up scenes for a great laugh or clever visual gags that keep the pace going; to sum it up, it works.I won't say this is one of my favorite movies or even one that everybody has to watch, but it is something that almost everybody will enjoy. Not to mention one thing I always appreciate is that films would copy the formula (obviously with less success in most cases), a sentiment to the status of this film.If nothing else, the recreation in Deadpool is enough to put a smile on your face.Bueller...Bueller......You can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com\nYou're still here?

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much.1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller, a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught, is an expert at fooling his parents, everybody likes him, and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him! 2. Cameron, a geek friend of Ferris, is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents, negative, and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very, very good.3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris, is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great, and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever.7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8. The most memorable scene was \"Twist and Shout\" scene, where all people dance in this song with Ferris lip-synching.9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.10. After watching this movie, I am planning to take a Day-Off of my own! Overall, I give A+ for being the best teenage movie.",

Ferris is one of those characters you just want to see win in the end.Alan Ruck was funny as Cameron Frye, the nervous, insecure, self-loathing, self-contradicting best friend of Ferris.Mia Sara was good as Slone Peterson, Ferris's girlfriend.

I read on this site that Anthony Michael Hall turned down this very role, fearing he'd be type cast. That was a definate blessing in disguise. Alan Ruck took the role and he gave the character a thousand more dimensions than anyone, let alone Hall, could have contributed. Cameron Frye is my favorite character of all time and I know I wouldn't be saying that if he was portrayed by anyone other than Ruck. I love you, Alan Ruck!",

The movie would have had a lot more depth to it if it concentrated on Cameron, how effective would it have been if instead of just showing us Bueller's morning it also contrasted with Cameron's morning to further show the audience just how much more Cameron needs live and let go. What about a scene where Cameron confronts his dad i mean i would have taken that over Bueller's sister snogging Charlie Sheen; that was not necessary at all towards anything other than magically changing her views on Ferris;i was like \"wow Charlie managed to rearrange her brain with his tongue\".Movie felt like a forced smile and can someone please tell me why there was so much unnecessary cringe when Ferris's mum and dad where pampering him i mean this kids almost going to college, also the trust relationship with his parents is just so damn strange if only my parents were that easy to manipulate. So much more wrong with this movie that could have been fixed if they replaced the numerous cheap laughs with more development of Cameron; i am right in thinking this movie is based around Cameron and not Ferris? anyways this movie is a good pass time but its nothing to marvel at i know I'm gonna hurt a lot of peoples childhoods with that statement but eh...",

Voodoo economics\"). Now, I'm a regular visitor to the Windy City and on the long flight over from Australia, I nearly always watch it. What a brilliant advertisement for CHicago itself, with scenes at Sears Tower, Wrigley Field, the Art Institute of Chicago, Glencoe Beach on the shores of Lake Michigan, a few shots of downtown Winnetka, and the parade scenes on Dearborn Street. It's weird seeing the city before Millennium Park!It's rare that a movie is legitimately funny in every scene. John Hughes strikes again, another masterpiece. You can't help but cheer for Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick, in the role that, unfortunately for him, typecast him - he was brilliant) enjoying his ninth sick day of the semester, matching wits with Edward R. Rooney, Dean of Students, who is desperate to make an example out of Ferris and his truancy. Ferris' ingenuity is brilliant, as he gets around Chicago, trying to avoid running into his dad, impersonating the Sausage King of Chicago, and performing in a parade - which might actually be the best part of the entire film. Or maybe the \"Star Wars\" scene - if you know, you know. No, scratch that, the final scene where Ferris has to race home ahead of his parents is the best part.The supporting cast: Alan Ruck as Ferris' reserved best friend Cameron is great, and so is Mia Sara as Ferris' girlfriend Sloane. And how can you look past Jennifer Grey as Ferris' sister Jeannie. There's even a cameo from Charlie Sheen at the police station where Jeannie has been taken, who is 50% responsible for some of the funniest exchanges of the film, talking to Jeannie about what she is doing there. Jeannie's own battle with Rooney is fantastic.Such a good movie. Makes me laugh every single time.",

It made me question the possibility of doing the journey he embarked on himself (Which by the way, is not possible given the time restraints, I did a paper on it before).\nThis movie fits very well in the genre of comedy, as the jokes are well distributed throughout the film and has the appropriate amount of fourth-wall breaks.\nVery little can be improved about the film, but if something had to be changed, it would be making it a bit longer, giving the crew the opportunity to visit more places in the city.",

When I watched this I felt like ditching school the very next day. I did not, but I felt like it. This movie contains some very famous scenes, like Ferris Bueller's trip back to his house, and the parade scene, and more. I also think that this Matthew Broderick's very best film, and funniest film.Here is the plot. The title pretty much says it all. A popular teenager named Ferris Bueller takes, well, the day off from school with his friend and his girlfriend. He pretends to be sick. Amazingly, his parents do think he is sick. He puts a dummy in his room. He takes a trip into the city of Chicago. The only problem is that his principal and his sister Jeanne do not think he is sick and they both try to prove that he is faking it. By the time he does everything he could possibly do he runs home to his house. His parents never found out that he skipped school.Overall, this is an excellent teenager movie. I also loved the very end of the film when Ferris Bueller asks the audience way they are still bothering him. The movie is over. Also, this is only Ben Stein's second film. He also has a great line, \"Bueller? Bueller?\" Anyway, anyone that is a fan of comedy would bound to love this film. This is definitely John Hughes's best movie.9/10Recommended Films: The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles.",

            "content": "John Hughes' 1986 classic comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off is irresistible. It set the benchmark for teen comedies which few have matched, with its all out fun story.The story is simple enough. Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is everybody's favorite guy. He's handsome, cool, funny, fearless, and charming to no end. He has a beautiful girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), and a very paranoid, yet lovable best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck). One day, Ferris wakes up and decides that he doesn't want to go to school, thinking that spending the day in downtown Chicago sounds like a better idea. So Ferris whips up a clever scheme that fools his parents, and drives to pick up Cameron and then Sloane at school. However, 2 people are not fooled: over zealous and crazed school dean Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) and Ferris's sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey...yes the one that dated Matthew Broderick...weird, eh?).The character Ferris Bueller is simply irresistible. Matthew Broderick brings an unprecedented amount of cool to the character that will make him one of the most lovable rebels in film history. Each of our 3 main characters compliments the other. While Ferris has his wild and crazy moments, Mia Sara's character brings out the good guy in him, as they have great on screen chemistry. Alan Ruck is also great. Cameron is the exact opposite of Ferris...paranoid, by the book, afraid of confrontation, and unwelcome to change. But that's what makes them such excellent buddies. Ferris brings out the best in Cameron and vice versa. Jeffrey Jones is great as well, and the film features a priceless cameo from Charlie Sheen that may be his on screen breakout (prior to Platoon, of course). All in all, this movie is a great example of why Broderick and Sheen are as bankable and famous as they are today.John Hughes just knows teenagers and the 1980's. The spirits of both are alive and well here. The music is 80's, as are the characters. But the mark of how great a movie it is and how classic it is is that it can be enjoyed by anyone from any generation. It's a great movie that I'd recommend to everyone. Everybody should see Ferris Bueller's Day Off, because of the wonderfully fun experience it is.10/10 --spy",

            "content": "SPOILERS!I see this film differently as an older adult than as a young one.  When this first came out I was still a few years out of High School, so I revered Ferris and all of his slickness and charm.  Now as I near 40 (with a grad degree in Education Administration to boot) I'm a little leary of the mischevious Mr. Bueller.  Still this is a funny movie with plenty of crafty scenes (though some of the outlandish stuff has become thin through the years).Creator John Hughes stuffed this comedy full of clever details and quirky moments.  Broderick performs well in his tounge-in-cheek role, and one of the joys of the film is his sub rosa sides with the screen audience, culminating at the very end with a reminder that it is time to go home after all the film credits have fully finished.  For all the celebration of smart-alleck youths in this movie, it is two adults who steal the show--Edie McClurg as the pixilated secratary Grace (I have watched this numerous times and I have yet to not laugh at her enumeration of all the school cliques)and Jeffery Jones as the unforgetable arch-enemy of Ferris, Principal Ed Rooney. His antics in his quest to ruin the young truant are ultimately the picture's funniest moments.One side note- When I give educational presentations I often use the Ben Stein scene (discussing Taft/Hartley-Voodoo Economics) with all the bored students (that kid drooling on his desk is classic) as an opening ice-breaker.  I juxtapose it with a scene from \"Better Off Dead\"--where the kids are intently listening to a recondite physics lesson.  I then ask the educators which scene reminds them more of today's kids.",

            "content": "Matthew Broderick plays the title character in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" a hilarious, congenial and timeless comedy from the 80's teen-flick king John Hughes (\"The Breakfast Club,\" \"Sixteen Candles\"). When one sees the words \"A John Hughes Film,\" one expects an 80's gem, a pure classic. In the case of \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" truer words were never spoken.Despite the fact that he is nearing the end of high school, Ferris will do anything for a day off. This means enlisting the aid of his depressed best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), his too-nice-to-be-true girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) and a mint 1961 cherry red Ferrari. Cruising through downtown Chicago, taking in a baseball game, partaking in a parade, inspiring an outlandish dance routine, strolling through an art museum and playing grown-up at a classy French restaurant, Ferris is bound and determined to live it up, partly for himself, and partly for the benefit of his troubled friend. Along the way he must match wits with his principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his bitter sister, Jeannie (Jennifer Gray).Without a doubt, this is Broderick's signature role, the one he will be remembered for. Despite the fact that his character appears mildly psychotic \u2013 throwing caution to the wind one too many times, talking to imaginary people (a.k.a. the audience) \u2013 it's a well-written one that is as likable as it is life-like. If John Hughes was known for one thing, it was creating believable teenagers on film, and Ferris' best friend Cameron is perhaps his best example. Alan Ruck nearly steals the show as the character more people can relate to, but despite his serious tone, never drags down the film and the film never feels too melodramatic for it. The rest of the cast is superb as well. Jeffrey Jones is unforgettable as the mad principal holding a grudge, and even Charlie Sheen manages to sneak it a cameo as a charming junkie.The film is sharply written, brilliantly paced and most importantly: Timeless. The idea of skipping school (or work) is a fantasy we've all indulged in at one time or another. Surprisingly, it has not dated itself too badly either. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is simply a fun film that people from all walks of life can appreciate and which generations of teenagers will relate to many, many years down the line. To put it in a sentence, they sure don't make 'em like they used to.",

            "content": "Ferris Buellers' Day Off follows three adolescent teens who decide to take the day off school. Ferris Bueller, the executor of the plan, decides to fake an illness in order to trick his parents into taking the day off. Ferris convinces his sick friend, Cameron to also take the day off and bring his fathers Ferrari. As soon as the two unite they form a plan to bail Ferris' girlfriend Sloane out of school. The principal, Ed Rooney, is aware of Ferris' rebellious manner and is hot on Ferris' tail to expose him for wagging school. Fortunately Ferris is always a step ahead of Rooney as he gallivants around the city. Ferris' sister Jeanie, jealous that Ferris is able to get away with ditching school on a regular basis, decides to catch Ferris in the act when she finds out the entire school thinks Ferris has come down with a serious illness. Ferris and his friends throughout the day manage to dine at a prestigious restaurant, attend an art gallery, view a baseball match, and sing at a street parade and other escapades in which he almost encounters his father. Cameron, Ferris' friend, is a neurotic individual who is eventually set over the top after the miles on his fathers Ferrari are raised significantly by the hoodlums in charge of taking care of it throughout the day. Eventually he is set into a catatonic state of mind before the entire car is destroyed set off by his mental angst. Cameron learns a valuable lesson in life following these incidents. Following the days events, it's eventually time to head home. Ferris' sister Jeanie learns not to stick her nose where it doesn't belong and Ed Rooney is in the end outsmarted by Ferris and Jeanie. Ferris achieves his goal of having an enjoyable and fulfilling day. Many genres of music are featured in the film, notable songs are Twist and Shout by The Beatles (lip synched by Ferris at the parade), Oh Yeah by Yellow which is played throughout the film, Star Wars is parodied with the main theme song when the men in charge of the Ferrari accelerate it into the air.Interesting camera shots include: a long shot of Ferris on the top of the float singing at the parade, a mid shot approximately 24 minutes into the film of Ferris and Cameron's feet right before they gaze upon the Ferrari, mid shots of the dull looks on the children's faces in school at the beginning of the film. Hughes took his time when editing. Edited scenes such as Jeanie triple kicking Rooney came out nicely. There is also another scene where Ferris has disguised himself and he kisses Sloane while Rooney is watching. The kiss was in fact brief and because of the editing which switches back to shots of Rooney and the kiss, it is made to appear longer then it is. Other interesting production elements are the fake 1960 Ferrari which in actual fact was worth $350,000 at the time. Insurance for the car to stand still most of the time on a movie set would cost a fortune. Instead they had three cars with fiberglass bodies using the framework of a mustang. One for the stunt was a higher powered vehicle, one which was driven by Ferris and his friends, and one which was just a shell to be driven through the window towards the end of the film. Acting is the film is outstanding at times the characters express more through actions and expressions rather than dialogue. Alan Ruck is able to project his voice in an amusing manner for one particular prank call scene which is exceptional, Mathew Broderick is fantastic in his portrayal of a confident and charismatic young teen and Mia Sara is also strong on performance. Jeffery Jones plays a convincing principal who seems to be more of a villain. Jennifer Grey accurately portrays the jealous and spiteful sister. Overall the acting is excellent and the supporting casts are great. Charlie Sheen's brief cameo appearance as a drug addict is even brilliant.My favorite part of the film would have to be where Ferris takes Sloane and Cameron to the street parade and jumps on board the float and dedicates a lip synched solo to Cameron: \"a young boy who thinks he hasn't seen anything good today\". Ferris gets everybody dancing in a lively performance of Twist and Shout by the Beatles, with the band. This is my favorite scene because it's quite entertaining and shows just how much Ferris is able to influence those around him. There is a choreographed scene of the crowd dancing which is also quite good. My overall opinion of the film is that it is a highly entertaining film and definitely one of the greatest teen films ever made. Overall the scenes are well put together showing us what one can accomplish in one day with the right mind. The humor in the film works on a scale of different ages which makes this one suitable for the entire family. The acting and shots are definitely strong aspects making the film a highly enjoyable one. I give this film four stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to get into films of the teen genre.",

You can definitely see where John Hughes got the ideas for Home alone, since Ed Rooney got treated the way the thieves did in home alone. :D Ferris Bueller just could pull anything off, on the other hand his friend Cameron was scared to do anything. This is a great message, sometimes it is better to risk and try, not just sit around wasting your time and being bored. The things Ferris did were a little bit too hard to pull off in real life, but the point was, that with courage and confidence you can do so much and it is really one of the most important things in life.This movie, without a doubt, is a classic, definitely one of the greatest comedies ever. Remember, sometimes it is better to take a day off school and to something fun and memorable, but only sometimes ;)",

High school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Roderick) brings his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) on a trip around Chicago when they're supposed to be in school.My main problem with that movie is the title character, Ferris. He is super popular for some reason, but he doesn't seem to care about how what he does affects other people. However, you just can't help but like him more and more as the movie progresses, probably because of Roderick's acting.What saved this movie for me was Alan Ruck as Cameron. He did a terrific job, and I never would've guessed that he was in his late 20's. I just love the way Cameron and Sloane get along; while Ferris is off singing on a parade float, they are content to stand there chatting without seeming awkward at all.This might not be the best movie in the world, but it is still quality entertainment and in my top 20 favorite movies.

This, as films should do, is make us forget real life, the recession you mention, and indulge in our fantasies.

He wrote eloquently of it in \"Sixteen Candles\", \"The Breakfast Club\" and \"Pretty in Pink\". And with \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", he creates a person and a time in life that just about anyone who's ever been a teenager can relate to.Who hasn't known someone like Ferris Bueller? Someone who always has a plan, someone who made loafing off an art form, someone who could fall in a barrel of you-know-what and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago - simple enough, but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron (Ruck) and his best girl (Sara) to join him and, in the process, learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally, there is a tyrannical school dean (Jones) who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hooky and Ferris' own sister (Grey, PR-nose job) who has it in for her brother, the \"trouser-snake\". There are funny situations throughout the movie, and the characters are ones that grow on you, especially Ruck's worry-wart portrayal of Cameron Frye, constantly fretting about his dyslectic, cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool, all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do, but she plays the object of desire well, and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things, like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end, this movie is a great trip in search of fun, relaxation, not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade. You want to catch vintage John Hughes and classic '80s tendon at its best? Seize this \"Day\"!Ten stars for \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".",

It's one of that movies, which simply makes you feel good. It hasn't got any weak parts and after watching it, you are sad that is over. As for me, a critical viewer, i rate it 9/10.

A running joke is that the students at the school are incredibly worried about him as if he is at death's door, which really annoys his sister who is stuck going to school and knows that he is completely healthy.He also gets his girlfriend out of school, as well as his hypochondriac friend Cameron who has serious daddy issues which come to a head at the end of the movie.

I think Reese was cast just for eye-candy, and I think the movie should have, instead, focused on the interaction between Ferris and Cameron: What does Ferris have to offer Cameron? Is it possible that Cameron has something of value for Ferris to learn? Because of Bueller's smug attitude, even toward his best friend, the manipulation disguised as \"liberation\" he offers Cameron comes to a destructive, suicidal head as Cameron acknowledges the lie he is living and seeks escape from both his unfeeling father and Bueller. There are some funny moments in the movie, don't get me wrong. Broderick also has charm and stage-presence. The supporting cast is wonderful, especially the High school administration members. Jennifer Grey is a fine actress and Charlie Sheen's cameo is memorable. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off, the main character gives us a somewhat potent illustration of the lesson many of us need to un-learn: How to project an illusion. As a testament to Cameron's character, he survived the \"friendship\", and hopefully, there-after, demanded a new level of authenticity from his social contacts.Even with Ferris's falsity and smugness, his manipulation and shallowness, we all find ourselves rooting for him during the movie; (even at the absurd, surreal end scene where the entire city is gathered at an indescript \"parade\", with Bueller doing an impromptu, amplified lip-synch to a rock n roll song.

            "content": "Anyone who doesn't like this movie is crazy. What's not to like? I mean, it's a classic. It's a pretty light hearted and silly comedy that is very hard not to laugh at. John Hughs is a great comedy director, and he always will be (hopefully). The story is set mainly in Chicago, so you know that strange and unusual things will happen. This movie has a lot of running and chasing and tricking other people, so I ask again, what's not to like?\nMatthew Broderick is Ferris Bueller, the coolest kid in school, who just wakes up one morning and decides he doesn't want to go to school, so he convinces his overly trusting parents that he is ver sick, so they tell him to stay in bed, and they head off to work, sure it's nieve, but who cares. Ferris then drags his up tight best friend Cameron, his equally mischievous girlfriend Sloane, and Cameron's father's rare Mustang for a day on the town filled with mis-adventures and some of the strangest people in Illinois.Ferris' angry sister Jeanie is hysterical. She and the nosey Principal Rooney are both out to get Ferris and put him in his place. Rooney is a very funny character just because of all of the situations he gets himself into. I recommend this movie to anyone who goes to or has gone to school, or who likes a good comedy. Matthew Broderick is really funny as fun-loving Ferris. Just watch it, and you'll see. 9/10",

            "content": "A carefree teenager decides to skip school and enjoy the day with his girlfriend and best friend. His philosophy is that life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it. He takes advantage of every chance he gets to have fun during the day while his sister and the school principal are out to expose him.Fantastic concept and brilliant execution. This movie focuses on how high schoolers feel about school and life. It shows how sometimes you gotta take it easy and relax for a bit. Life will keep moving so you gotta stop and chill once in a while. Even though I'm far past my high school phase, I really enjoyed this movie.Matthew Broderick delivered a fantastic performance as the mischievous Ferris Bueller. His dialogue delivery and expressions were on point. His reluctant best friend Cameron Frye is played by Alan Ruck who also delivered an amazing performance. The principal Rooney played by Jeffrey Jones was also great. Jennifer Grey also did good as the sister of Ferris.John Hughes did a great job. His direction is beautiful and in my opinion, this movie is easily his best work. He did a brilliant job focusing on the city Chicago and shooting the film on location.This movie is a classic 80's comedy which will bring back a lot of nostalgia. It's a beautifully made comedy film which will make you laugh every few minutes throughout the whole movie. Whether you're a teenager or a middle aged adult, this movie can be enjoyed by anyone. I'm very fortunate to have come across this movie.After watching this movie, I finally understand why this movie has become a cult classic. Makes me wish I got to take advantage of all the chances I had to have fun during high school. This movie is definitely one of my all time favourites.",

So funny.And the scene at the end of the movie where cameron freaks out when he sees the mileage on the car. And then they decided to try and take the mileage off by running the car in reverse while its on a jack running in reverse. When the car falls off the jack when cameron puts his foot on it.

            "content": "Before Matthew Broderick became typecast as a lukewarm simpleton, he was the epitome of 80s cool. British flag adorned doors be damned, Broderick was the natural heir to the throne of cineAmerican teendom. James Dean was rendered irrelevant the instant a Mohawked Matthew decided to sing in the shower. I mean this is a righteous dude who can eat pancreas, contemplate modern art, make downtown Chicago sing and dance all in one irresponsible day. Moreover, he is a pioneer of deception. Ferris' technological arsenal of tricks designed to dupe adults make anything that Kevin McCallister concocted look childish.But the best thing about Ferris Bueller's Day off is not Ferris Bueller. No! It's his best friend Cameron Prye! Cameron is a depressed hockey player (formerly of the Detroit Red Wings) who quite frankly deserved a sequel or prequel based solely around his plight. He lives in a house that looks like it was sponsored entirely by Sharper Image. For those too young to know about Sharper Image... you know... just Google it. Unlike Ferris, Cameron is a depressed teenager in desperate need of a Breakfast Club to call his own. This isn't a guy who can finesse his way into a swanky restaurant or emotionally manipulate people and hope that a sly smirk or a raised eyebrow will charm them into forgetting they've been played. That's what makes Cameron so much more endearing and relatable than Ferris. You get the sense that Bueller is a character designed, whereas his friend Cameron is happlessly conceived. It's easy to imagine that he is the unforseen result of a loveless marriage where two yuppie adults convinced themselves that a child would validate their lives. Ferris on the other hand, is that disgustingly perfect combination of boyish charm, good looks and juvenile idealism.Then you've got the girlfriend, Sloan. What's the point of Sloan? I'll leave that for you to decide. Perhaps just ask yourself if the plot would be affected in any way had she been edited out. Much like Ferris, her appeal is superficial at best. Much like Ferris, she is fully-realized. She has no concerns, no fears, no challenges and she's rediculously good-looking to boot. Oh the random intricacies of youth. Unlike Ferris and Cameron though, the result is a character that is somehow bland and boring. Her qualities are sincerity and enthusiasm but does that make her interesting in the least?Interestingly, Ferris' sister Jeannie is the only character besides Cameron to have a character arch. She comes across as hopelessly angry and jaded and she would be completely justified in getting what she wants, to see her brother go down. But when the chance comes to reveal him as the con artist that he is, she opts instead to become his ally. This arch feels a little baseless, but it is nevertheless, a healthy development. She has let go of her anger in favor of a more centered approach to life where she is the focus of her own life. Of course, this is all attributed to the sage advice of Prince Sheen in all his sweaty disheveled leathery glory as he looks like a permanent fixture of the police station waiting room.Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and steal your friend's dad's Ferrari and visit an art museum once in a while, you could run the risk of being lamer than a vest with no leopard print.",

Yes, obviously it's no cinch for Ferris to not get caught, but as we learn, Ferris Bueller never gets caught. Sure it's no sophisticated Oscar winning comedy but I'll watch it over 'Shakespeare In Love' any day. Why? It's light, it's easy, you don't have to stop and think to understand the jokes, it's one of those stupid comedies that you can't resist. One of those movies that you keep in the video drawer and watch on a rainy day... it's also a movie you don't want your kids to get ideas from.I haven't seen many of Matthew Broderick's films but from those I did, this is my favorite (I mean Godzilla, eh ok, but Inspector Gadget, in the old Jewish words of wisdom: Oy Vay). Matthew Broderick is absolutely brilliant and Alan Ruck (Cameron) and Mia Sara (Sloane) are great too. I have many favorite lines, but one of them is in the beginning where Ferris explains the rules on how to ditch school without getting caught, after he finishes explaining- he then says: \"It's a little childish and stupid but then- so is school\". I also liked when he said: \"I asked for a car, I got a computer. How's that for being born under a bad sign?\", yes Ferris- we sympathize with you. But enough quotes.Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a great movie that can be enjoyed by anybody (even teachers, well maybe I'm going a bit too far now). It's one of my top ten favorites, a must see for all kids who wanna skip school and a reminder to parents of how naive they can be some... all the time.",

I rewatched this film for Cameron and Jeanie, to see if I remember the treatment of their characters correctly, but it was actually worse. I think Ferris's good intentions and care towards Cameron were his only redeemable quality as a character, but the realization of these intentions of course pretty much cancels that out. The point is not the sports car, the point is that the moment where Cameron seemingly wakes up from his long sleep he actually hands over to Ferris all power to define himself. Ferris has been right all along in refusing to realize Cameron is actually deprressed. This exasperating turn is echoed in the scene where Jeanie is told by a random dude that \"she's the problem\" and then left fluttering and giggling as the effect of his apparently masterful kisses. This after Jeanie has been victim blamed for being very legitimately scared by an intruder in her house. Ah, this is all so tiring. I read a few analyses of Jeanie where the writer seemed to attribute some sort of underlying feminist critique to Hughes himself. No way. Jeanie was \"uptight\" so she deserved all that, and the cure was a random guy making out with her. Also Sloane's prediction of her own future is \"he's going to marry me\", like she needs no say in that. Can't get more misogynistic than this in a feel-good, anti-hero teen movie.",

Record it from TV and watch the TV edit! I don't care how you watch it, just do it!!!Now that's off my chest, I can actually comment on this movie.I don't know if it's just due to Matthew Broderick's likeableness (a word I just made up) or what, but you just can't help but love Ferris.  Ferris is the guy everyone wants to be with in high.  Heck, Ferris is the guy everyone wanted to be in high school...Get away with murder, get worshipped by your entire community and know all the words to \"Danke Schoen\".When I think back to my teenage years, I can honestly say that this movie epidomizes the 80's more than almost any other movie. (The only exception would be \"Back to the Future\".)  From the music to the clothes to the hair to the Ferrari, everything about this movie is 1980's!  Even Charlie Sheen is in this movie!I know that there are a lot of actors who don't want to be remembered for one certain role, but if I were Matthew Broderick, I would definitely accept that as a compliment that people know me as Ferris Bueller.  It's the ultimate role that I would do for free if I had the chance.Now, don't think that this movie is all about Broderick.  The supporting cast did a great job of pulling their own weight.  Jeffrey Jones, Alan Ruck, Jennifer \"Yummy\" Grey, and of course Edie McClurg.Ferris Bueller is just one of those movies that when you finish watching it, you can't help but walk out of the TV room with a smile on your face.

Teen movies are looked down upon because most of them don't live up to this one.The actors obviously weren't taken from the cast of Dawson's Creek, they didn't dig into Beverly Hills 90210, or Party of Five. They took real actors. These actors took on some hilarious roles and delivered.The music took me back to the 80s, the decade of my birth. I am only one year older than this movie, after all. Not only that, that Ferrari kicked ass! They don't make cars like that anymore.If you hate teen movies, this will be an exception. If you love teen movies, you will soon see them as inferior to this one. Ferris Bueller, you're my hero. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "An insightful, comedic masterpiece by the great John Hughes",
            "content": "\"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around every once in a while, you could miss it.\" Not only is Ferris Bueller's Day Off filled with plenty of insightful messages about life in itself and frankly, how to live a much better one, it is easily John Hughes' magnum opus (although, The Breakfast Club is a close second for me) and a hilarious comedy filled with wonderful performances. It follows high school senior, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) who decides to skip school by faking sick and his parents easily buy into it. Right from the start, the movie breaks the 4th wall and Ferris talks directly to the audience and in my opinion, it is one of the best uses of 4th wall breaking in movies. It allows the audience to get right into the head of Ferris without it feeling forced and allows Ferris to constantly make small facial gestures at the camera throughout the movie in reaction to the things happening around him. He manages to convince his depressed friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to join him and take a spin with Cameron's father's Ferrari. They also do some nice trickery to get Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) out of school to join them. They go out into the city of Chicago in which is John Hughes' love letter to the wonderful city as we see great beautiful shots of it all. Mr. Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is the principal of the school and doesn't trust Ferris in anyway, he wants to catch him and prove that he isn't the guy everyone thinks he is. Everyone loves Ferris. He breaks the clich\u00e9s of high school and is the guy that everyone just adores. Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) is Ferris' sister and also wants to prove he is faking sick and how he is always managing to skip out on school. So, throughout the film, three plot lines are going on. Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane's event filled day in Chicago from lip-synching to \"Twist and Shout\" by The Beatles or going to a Cubs game. Mr. Rooney trying to catch Ferris. And Jeanie trying to catch Ferris as well. These three plot lines all mesh together perfectly and let the film flow so well, allowing for what is in my opinion, a perfect film. Whether Ferris is saying something extremely insightful or extremely hilarious, Broderick does an amazing job with his performance. It's truly difficult for me to find a single real flaw in this movie. This has been my 2nd viewing of this film as I write this review and it really has quite possibly jumped into my top 10 films of all time. It seems to portray the aspects of high school so well without most of the film even taking place inside of a high school. The pointlessness of much of what you are learning. The boring teachers, the childishness coming from most of the people there (which is summed up fairly well by a single line), amongst other things. If anything, John Hughes gets it. He gets teenagers. Sure, most of his films are truly a more fantasy-esque thing as most of what happens in his films would almost never happen in real life, but that doesn't change the fact that he has such an understanding. He never belittles teenagers, he treats them like real human beings and it shows in all of his films. Ferris Bueller being the best in my opinion. If anything, thank you John Hughes for just getting it. Everyone should live a more Ferris Bueller life\u0085and well, that's about it.",

I watched the first two \"Home Alone\" movies to the point of where I had the lines memorized, and that was before I was 12. Then came \"The Breakfast Club,\" probably one of the best movies to watch regarding high school. (My middle brother saw it first and then talked me into it, but I do not regret it to this day.) After \"The Breakfast Club\" came \"Pretty in Pink\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" both of which I would only watch once. When I came to be a senior in high school, I was introduced to the awesome world of Ferris Bueller. If there is one movie that you should watch before you die, it would definitely have to be this one. It is also another movie that my middle brother and I know line for line and could watch it all day without getting tired of it. That's just the power that John Hughes has to this day, even after his death. A word to the wise, though: although this movie is fantastic with a capital F, do not show it around certain junior high and high school students, for they may actually get the wrong idea. Life does not work like fiction and you will get caught, no doubt about that. Having said that, enjoy this movie over and over.",

It is also a magical realist musical fantasy in the vein of The Blues Brothers. (Esp. the parade sequence and the restaurant scene ) and a comedy of superiority like Beverly Hills Cop (everything to do with Rooney) where the hero defies authority in the service of his friends and makes fools of the uptight and the unimaginative. 80's movies were all about the use of technology and extreme confidence to push the boundaries of existence. To defeat those who would defy your vision, limit your self belief and prevent the ultimate possibilites of reality from unfolding. And like any good 80s movie it has a cool car.",

I think it's called embalming fluid). I decided to watch this again the other day to see if it was as good as I remembered it. It had been about ten years since I had last seen it, and you know how movies from your youth are never as good as you remembered them. Well, this one is every bit as good now as it was then. I love this movie!There are just too many good things about this movie to mention. Broderick is instantly likeable as Ferris. Makes you wish you had a buddy like him back in school, if for no other reason than to get close to his hottie of a girlfriend (Mia Sara). For some reason, I keep thinking of Alan Ruck as being the most outstanding character in this movie. He gives a very sweet performance as Cameron, Ferris' loser friend. He actually has the most performance-intensive role in this one. And what a cast! I was most looking forward to seeing Ben Stein again, and a hilarious cameo by Charlie Sheen, and they didn't disapoint. Oh, but that's not all folks, we also have Jeffrey Jones as the principle (\"Rooney Eats It!\"). He's great. Even better is Jennifer Grey as Ferris' sister, \u0091Shawna-Jean'. I love her attitude.John Hughes, where for art thou? Seems he's been writing a lot for the last ten years. Yikes! I took a look at his resume and it's not a pretty sight. I think the 80's was his decade. Anyway, this one is easily his greatest film. Everything just clicks. This one is easily a 10/10 stars on my scale. G'night!",

Still, when I was watching it a few weeks ago I actually found a hidden underlying message. Ferris is just a person trying to help his nervous, paranoid friend gain some self-respect and maybe have a little fun in the process.

            "content": "During the 1980s, filmmaker John Hughes made a considerable, almost shocking amount of brilliant work in a short span of time. There is of course \"Thriller\", his music video classic with Michael Jackson performing one of the defining songs of the 80s. He also made an impressive body of work with \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"Pretty in Pink,\" and \"The Breakfast Club.\" While these movies are fantastic pieces blending a perfect synthesis of contemporary accuracy and thematic timelessness, there is one movie in his career which stands out above all others: \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" First off, the plot is very impressive. The four main threads - Cameron's insecurity, our hero Ferris with Sloan at his side, Rooney's dogged quest to bust Ferris the truant, and Jeanie's seething rage at her brother's successes - weave in and out of each other almost seamlessly. While there's been a long-controversial problem with Ferris's ability to do so many things in such a short amount of time, it should be at least clear that one could conceivably do what Ferris does, given determination and a little bit of luck. And anyway, time factors are not the point. Ferris set out to have an ideal day, and because he IS Ferris Bueller, he makes it happen despite the odds.As sophisticated and well-written a plot can be, it takes the actors themselves to give flesh to the bone. The casting was so flawless that it's hard to imagine anybody BUT Matthew Broderick as Ferris. The chemistry between all of the actors is quite genuine. Alan Ruck and Broderick were friends and colleagues on Broadway before the film, and given Jeffrey Jones' later criminal record as a sex offender, he is a perfect portrayal as the unnerving, oily law enforcer. Plus, Ben Stein in his brief role as an economics teacher is absolutely hysterical.The one thing that gives the film more depth than other John Hughes films, and what makes the film so stunning, is the philosophy behind it. Last year an Australian journalist wrote a piece declaring that he learned everything there is to know in life by watching the film. I don't have the link anymore, but you should be able to Google it. It's well worth the read, and only goes to show that Hughes wanted to illustrate a larger point about life. To paraphrase Cameron, we need to take control of our own lives when and where we can. Life is just too short to be miserable, and even one day of pure, unbridled freedom can make up for 18 years of insecurity and fear.\"It is a BEAUTIFUL day in Chicago.\" Truer words are rarely spoken.",

            "content": "I first saw this movie on 12/31/97. It's has to be one of the best comedy selections in my collection. Matthew Broderick is brilliant as Ferris. Alan Ruck plays a great part as Cameron. Ferris's girlfriend is attractive, no more than that. Jeannie is also hilarious. This is just a great movie. It has a simple plot. A high school student who wants to take the day off with his friends. One of the best parts is when Ferris gives pointers on how to fake a sickness. You start moaning and wailing and you bend over and you lick your palms. I know it sounds a bit childish and stupid, but than so is high school. LOL! Here's the plot. The movie takes place on a beautiful day,  so Ferris decides to take the day off with his best firend Cameron (Ruck) and his girlfriend Sloane. Ferris tries to fake out his parents which he always does successfully and he fakes them out again. The only four people that know that he is not really sick is Sloane, Cameron, Jeannie, and the evil Mr. Rooney. Mr. Rooney would do anything to get Ferris caught. He tries to tell his parents, but neither of them believe him. While Mr. Rooney tries to get him, Ferris and his friends take a day down to Downtown, Chicago, where to have fun and stay away from getting caught. Not to mention they take a beautiful 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California. Less than 100 were made. That's one of my dream cars.  Anyway Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a great movie and hope they never make a sequel cause it would suck and would be to predictable. This one of John Hughes best. His other one would be Home Alone. This movie gets a 10/10.",

            "content": "Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a strange film. At the time of its release, everyone loved it and praised it for its slick and original style. Having a main character talk to the camera was a pretty fresh idea for mainstream movies. This doesn't mean it never happened before. This film has been influenced strangely enough, by Jean Luc Godard's \"Breathless\". Who would have thought that John Hughes even paid attention to the French New Wave? Maybe he didn't and it's all just purely coincidental. What else is bizarre about this film is its dated and exaggerated use of technology. Ferris Beuller uses his computer to hack into his high school transcript and alter his attendance record. And this was 1986..? Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a funny movie and it has a very sweet side to it but the upper class atmosphere of this movie is really annoying. Ferris and his friends take a day off from school to live the high life in the city of Chicago by going to expensive restaurants, going to a Cubs game, visiting a museum and as Ferris puts it\" we saw priceless works of art!\" and they also sit in a booth by the Chicago stock exchange. What were they doing there? Before going home, Ferris and his friends spend an hour at someone's swimming pool and jacuzzi. All of this just wouldn't be enough without Ferris friend's car, which happens to be a Ferrari. Now there's nothing wrong with being rich and granted, this is a comedy which is not supposed to be totally realistic. But the theme of the film seems to suggest that in order to really have fun, you need to have money and spend it. These kids just cannot see through the superficial and material world they live in. At one point Ferris's sister is heard complaining to herself about Ferris. \"Maybe it's not so bad. After all, I got a car and he got a computer\". Ferris Beuller's Day Off is a light comedy and if there's anything to learn from the story, its that its that getting a little support from your friends goes a long way. In some ways, \"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\" was the 80's version of Forrest Gump. They don't exactly have the same story but both films deal with how success can be earned even if you don't play by the rules. Forrest Gump had a learning disability but he became very successful. Ferris Beuller slacked off from school but everyone thought he was sick and was rooting for him. This theme has a strong resonance with today's standard of living. Look whose running the country! And isn't it ironic that \"Ferris Beuller's Day Off\" uses George H. W. Bush as a reference when the boring teacher played by the conservative, Ben Stein \"something o-o economics. Voodoo economics.\" Well I guess you could say that John Hughes is a true visionary. Every plot and detail has a purpose. That I applaud him for. As for the spoiled kids, I could care less.",

A spoiled younger brother plays his parents for idiots (which in this case they really are!), uses his computer to hack into his highschool to change his record, talks his poor, insecure best friend into swiping his sadistic father's expensive car, steals a millionaire's identity and eats at the priciest gourmet restaurant in town (there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?), and gets away with it all in the end, just like he knew he would!This just doesn't happen in the real world.  Hacking and identity theft are crimes, and dimwitted parents usually cannot afford to buy their kids computers since the smart people have all the good jobs.  No friend of mine would leave me in the mess Ferris left Cameron in.  The highschool principal is a heavy, I agree, but no girl can kick a principal in the face and not get herself and her parents into trouble (even if the principal breaks into her house, which you never hear about).  The principal's obstinate secretary would be fired on the spot for aiding and abetting a hacker.  I never heard of a parade going on during a school day, and parking valets just don't get away with abusing cars.  And wasn't there a RECESSION going on in 1986?This flick gives a bad name to brothers, boyfriends, computer users and students.  Many a sister or girlfriend has accused some poor guy of being a \"freeloading Ferris\".  And smart-aleck know-it-alls are never regared as \"righteous dudes\" by every other kid.  Besides getting on your nerves, it is also missing the comedic tension that makes good comedy work: Ferris Bueller can't lose, but if he could he would seem human and his antics would be truly funny.

My attention could not keep up with the television screen.It did have its share of laughs, and its share of lame trash trash as well, like all teen movies.

Jeffry Jones as Mr. Rooney the principal and Edie McClug as Grace, Mr. Rooney's secretary, were hilarious and actually made the show with their characters.

With a faster pace it would have kept me more involved and believed that the events are truly real. John Hughes failed to address this.It feels weird that Cameron developed more than Ferris. Ferris teaches Cameron how to live his life more enjoyably and eventually Cameron succeeds in feeling this way. He decides to take matters into his own hands rather than running away from them. Ferris is a smart-ass throughout the whole film and in the end he only learns that he should be more careful when he goes out and about.Another thing that bothered me is that we barely know anything about Sloane. We know she is Ferris' girlfriend but other than that I don't feel she has any other use in the film.Overall this film was not very good but it had a great theme attached.

Its a poster of Ferris laying back with his feet up and in big letters over top, it says \"Leisure Rules.\" There is not a school day that goes by without me debating with myself, after looking at the poster, weather or not I should lick my palms.This is one of the best movies you will ever see because it indulges in a teenage fantasy: beating your parents, beating the school, and overall just beating the system to have fun when you aren't supposed to. \"Just think, if we played by the rules right now, we'd be in gym.\" That sums up the movie pretty much. Ferris has a great amount of magic in him: his presence is magnetic. Watching Ferris and Cameron trick Mr. Rooney into releasing Sloane is hilairious. I always wished I could pull something like that. I used to want to be Ferris and do everything he does, but I think now I realize that it is just a fantasy, and the audience will identify more with Cameron (\"Ferris can handle anything. I can't handle a thing.\"). But it is still great fun to indulge in the fantasy every once in a while.Everything about this movie is memorable and is treasured, even though now i tend to skip the scene in Cameron's garage. Only Ferris could beat the waiter at his own game, turn a typical parade into a block party, turn off his stereo with a baseball and get home in time to be sick in bed, gaining sympathy for his parents.THis movie rules and I haven't met anyone who can honsetly admit they didn't like it. Buy yourself a copy today and on your next REAL sick day, take a trip into Chicago in a Ferrari with Ferris Bueller and see if you don't feel better.",

As someone who grew up in the 80's, these movies speak to my younger self, evoking memories of good times with friends, and simpler time in life.Ferris Bueller is one of those people who seems to just have things always go his way. No matter what sort of shenanigans he gets into, his friends, acquaintances, family, and teachers all think he hung the moon - all but 2 people that is - Mr. Rooney, his principal, and Jeanie, his sister.When Ferris decides to fake being sick toward the end of his senior year, dragging his best friend and girlfriend into skipping school and heading out for a day of adventure, Rooney knows something's up, but can't prove it. He makes it his mission to catch Ferris in the act, and will do whatever it takes to expose his escapades.But Ferris seems to always be one step ahead of him, and as the day wears on, and Ferris and co have lots of near misses, Rooney keeps coming up short.The movie is filmed in Chicago and includes some iconic landmarks and events. One of my favorites is the parade where Ferris does an impromptu (via lip-sinking) version of \"Twist and Shout\" up on a float. The filming of this, and other parts of the movie, has been written about, and is actually a really interesting read if you ever get the chance. They way they filmed movies back then could never happen today.Anyway, If you've never seen Ferris Bueller, all I can say is...Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? Where have you been? It's a feel-good movie, and one that I nearly have memorized from seeing it so many times - it's that good.",

Now, given the character of some of our recently-retired political leaders, while that might qualify one to hold high office, I'm not sure its a good character trait for ordinary folks.That said, this isn't a bad movie.  It's a kind of blend of high school hijinks and teenage angst, the former supplied by Ferris and the latter by his friend Cameron.  The viewer is taken for a dizzying ride through Ferris' \"day off\" school (playing hookey) courtesy of Cameron's father's sports car. Its kind of fun to watch the various tight spots and scrapes Ferris manages to get himself into and then extricated from, again mostly by lying and conniving.  But, in spite of knowing better, you find yourself pulling for Ferris, who is basically a decent person but a bit full of himself.The movie is more a vehicle for showing off the beguiling charm of the young Matthrew Brodderick, who is fine in his leading role.  Actor Jeffrey Jones is his foil as the uptight school principal.  And Mia Sara does what she does best:  portray a beautiful young woman, this time as Ferris' girlfriend (naturally, the charming rogues get the best-looking girls, which I am convinced is really the type of guy girls want in spite of what today's women say about wanting an intelligent and \"sensitive\" man).  But the best roles are those of Alan Ruck (Cameron) and, as others have noted, Jennifer Grey (Jeanie).So give \"Ferris\" a look if you need a little time for relaxation and distraction, and maybe a chance to live vicariously the kind of \"day off\" we all wish we could have had at least once in our lives.",

            "content": "In 1985 I saw this film on a plane. An after that it became part of my life. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is not just a film, but its an instruction manual for a teenager to real life, guiding them to become a success. Its true, FBDO is a film that can build confidence, cure depression and make you realize that everyday of your life should be filled with as much fun, learning and excitement as you possibly can, and in many cases not even spend a penny. Successful people in the world are those who are confident, speak clearly and know how to plan and have great time management. Ferris Buellers Day off will be the cheapest MBA you could ever pay for, and perhaps be just as good. Trust me I have one from Oxford. Since 1985, 20 years later, I have seen FBDO 109 times, and know the dialogue by heart and even the entire cast including the extras. And I could put it on right now and watch it again. By 1996, with the scope of the Internet, it was only then I realized that I was not alone. Millions of people where Ferris fans and the film had a strong cult following. A TV serial was made, but without the originals charm, its popularity died. Matthew Broderick played Ferris Bueller as if he was born for the part. His on screen presence portrayed true charisma and charm. Broderick has never played a role more perfect since. 20 years on the film still does not look dated, in spite of DOS operated computers and the use of payphones (no mobiles / cell phones invented then) as John Hughes used classic cars and posh surrounding that fit in well even in the year 2005 and beyond. Save Ferris!!",

            "content": "In the 1986 film, \"Farris Bueller's Day Off\", one determined teenager pushes every limit to the max, with his sites set on the goal of having the day off from his own form of prison, high school. Farris is the ultimate wise guy. He outsmarts everyone who may potentially get in his way of skipping school. And, while doing so, creates many laughs for the audience along the way. This film incorporates great acting along with an entertaining plot that makes for a great comedy, just maybe not one for all ages. It seems as though every character was hand picked to perfectly fill their part. Matthew Broderick has the complete package for his role as the main character, Farris Bueller. His performance captures the essence of the crazy, free-spirited teenager who just wants to live life to the fullest. Starring alongside Broderick is Alan Ruck, or better known as Ferris's best friend, Cameron Frye. Ruck's drone voice and tense facial expressions mimic the characteristics of the up-tight personality his character is supposed to represent. Together the two actor's juxtaposition and spectacular performances make for a hilarious comedy of pranks and lies. Though the film will produce many laughs, my hope would be that those laughs are produced only from the mouths of those 14 and up. The plot is centered around lies that snowball throughout the storyline. At first it's one little lie, and then one more, until it seems as though it is the only dialogue being used. Younger children may process the message of this film to be finding it acceptable behavior to skip school, lie to their parents and authority figures, and steal a car with ultimately no consequences. But, these over-the-top lies and inflated situations are what make for such an amusing plot. With that being said, the film is rated PG-13 mostly for its language. Swear words flow loosely from the lips of some of the young characters. But, then again, the dialogue is part of what makes the movie so funny. The smarta** kids, the monotone teacher, and the na\u00efve parents are all needed to add cohesion to the piece. Director John Hughes seems to stay in his line of fire with this movie, filming the different perspectives of life viewed from the rebellious, love stricken teenagers, as he does in his other timeless films, \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) and \"Sixteen Candles\" (1984). Though Hughes doesn't incorporate any flashy special effects or amazing scenery in the film, it isn't needed. It allows the audience to focus on, and enjoy, the classic story of the young man who fakes sick to skip school and, in turn, makes the best out of his \"free\" day. If you are looking for a good laugh from a classic movie, it should be a must see on your list.",

He wants to help his best friend gain some confidence, although it is really the audience that feels the best in the end.This is the ultimate feel-good movie and is one that never gets old!

But if you've seen the movie, I'm sure you'll agree with me that that is just not enough to say about the one-and-only, unremakable, funny, just-for-fun and, like I said before, classic, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" This is a high school movie with girls and dating and referances to nudity and many curses, but just in case you're wondering, it's far from the 1982 classic \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\" There are no drugs and nothing really along the lines of sex like in that movie. This is also a classic, but it deals with a totally different aspect of high school. The point of the movie, the main plot, whatever, is ditching school. It is about how the very cool, slick, popular Ferris Beuller makes a hobby (technically, not literally) out of ditching. To add to the funniness, the producers add in Ferris's best friend Cameron Fry, played by Alan Ruck. Cameron's parents run their household \"like a museum. It's cold, very beautiful, and you're not allowed to touch anything.\"-Ferris Beuller. It's funny how slick Ferris tries to manage and convince Cameron, who is very law abident, into ditching with him. The ultimate is when Ferris insists on taking Cameron's father's Ferrari out to Chicago. Wait to see what happens there. Another funny part, probably the funniest of the funny parts and the real plot of the movie, is how Ed Rooney tries to nail Ferris for ditching, and how he fails at everything he tries to do. If you are in high school, or even in  middle school, you are sure to love this movie. If you haven't seen it, make sure you do.",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller is probably the worst friend, brother, and certainly the most popular kid in the state of Chicago. From the very opening image of the film he exhibits the pretty boy, handed- everything-on-a-silver-platter attitude you'd see from the bustiest blond in your own high school. But as much as you can try to hate him, everyone else loves him. I probably wouldn't have been in Ferris's entourage if we went to high school together, but I'd likely revel at the chance to hang out and try to steal Mia Sara from him (probably to no avail). The choice of name (Ferris, as in Ferris wheel) is symbolic of this arcade-like world of Chicago, where everything plays under Ferris's rules (like carnival or casino odds). Ferris even takes over the conventions of the cinema world by breaking the fourth wall. He kinda breaks bro-code too in the film's most emotional driven side-story. The most entertaining side-story is the Tom & Jerry chase between Ferris and the principal. Mr. Rooney is everyone's imagination running wild, while sitting and being \"justly\" punished in the principal's office. We feel their punishments are cruel and sometimes unique to us, and we all dream that someday we can have our own German Shepherd give them hell. Contrary to traditional Hollywood film and storytelling, Ferris Bueller faces little to no drama on his day-off. He does every fun thing under the sun- till dinner time, so no booze and strippers, high school remember- with the apotheosis of high school sweetheart, Sloane Peterson, and a friend willing to lend his daddy's Ferrari because, why would Ferris need a car? Their youth is beautifully captured on this day through Prank calls, visits to Art Museums, Wrigley's Field, and promises to get married. The ambiguity of their \"I love you\" confessions brought me back to the innocence of my high school days. Jeanie Bueller, Bueller's sister, is the moral figure in the story. She's smarter than everyone else and can see through Bueller's b/s. Actually, Jeanie is \"us\", the viewer, looking in with the \"normal-world\" goggles. But the one person who can expose Ferris's 9th absence (because we know Tom usually never gets Jerry) being his sister makes for a clean resolution that even though we may think, here's a guy who got away with everything and learned nothing, we expect Ferris Bueller won't be skipping school anymore. 8/10",

Which is in some ways instructive; the movie basically tells you to live for today, don't wait for tomorrow. But it's a fantasy. Living for today, in real life, spells disaster as often as not. I still wish I could be as cool and confident as Ferris Bueller, but I think there is some physical law against that many coolness particles occupying any one person's body. Oh well.It's really just light, frothy fun, in retrospect.

This movie succeeds on so many different levels: a teen comedy, a satire, a social commentary, even a promotional film for the city of Chicago. I've seen it a few dozen times and every time I notice things in a whole different way.The movie, on the surface, is of course the account of how an impossibly carefree senior named Ferris Bueller decides to skip a day of school and take his girl and his best friend out on the town, while setting clever traps and ruses to foil his clueless parents, his nosy sister and even nosier dean. Even on this level the movie is fantastic. But to me, and probably to many others, the movie is not really about Ferris skipping school and having fun. It's really about Ferris skipping school and trying to get his depressed buddy, Cameron Frye, to have fun and learn to have confidence in himself. Cameron is probably the character most people identify with; uptight, unsure of himself, afraid to stand up to his parents. Everyone has part of Cameron inside them at some point in their lives. No one is ever really Ferris. Ferris is the unblemished perfect soul that the Camerons of the world have to put up with: he gets away with everything, has perfect grades, perfect family, perfect girl, and he's always happy. The great thing about Ferris is, he knows all of that, and he's taking this day off to make it up to Cameron.The film has great characters (very few films capture the true nature of high school like this one; Ben Stein was born for this role), and even better directing: I love the camera work; the quick, rapid establishing shots are priceless. Even the story is excellent; it's sharp and intelligent (though Ferris sure seems to fit quite a lot of activity into one day). I sincerely doubt there's anyone who wouldn't like this movie.

I would consider `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' to be one of the classic movies of the 1980s and probably one of the most profoundly entertaining, enjoyable, hilarious and poignant movies of all time. This movie has everything in it to make it a success \u0096a wonderful storyline, a strong script, a wonderfully talented array of highly qualified main actors and supporting cast and naturally flowing dialogue. If some of the producers of today could learn from movies of the 1980s, this world would be a much better place.\nMatthew Broderick delivers high quality, first class and believable acting to his role as Ferris Bueller. Portraying Ferris Bueller seems to be a strong point for him and I would consider it as a defining moment in his acting career. He gives Bueller's character a lot of depth and personality that tends to be missing from the vast majority of movies. Alan Ruck and Mia Sara also provide wonderful portrayals of Ferris's friends Cameron and Sloane. Jeffrey Jones is priceless in his excellent portrayal of constantly beleaguered headmaster Ed Rooney and Jennifer Grey shines as Ferris's disgruntled sister Jeannie Bueller. Even the supporting cast \u0096such as Ferris's parents down to school attendant Florence Sparrow down to the garage mechanic who `looks after' the car-give wonderful performances that make the film even more wonderful than it already is.The storyline is entertaining, enjoyable and gripping enough to keep you hanging on to the end. It's portrayal of youth, innocence and having a good time is truly a class act. The dialogue is witty, catchy and contains some priceless one liners that are still popular catchphrases today. It had me laughing hysterically even watching it for the tenth time. Everything down to the music and scenery works for this movie.My advice would be to go and see it.

Though this movie is first and foremost a madcap comedy, there are some cute, sentimental (but not mushy) moments between Ferris and his girlfriend Sloane and his best friend Cameron. And of course, the best scene is hands down, when Ferris lipsynches to the Beatles' \"Twist and Shout.\" This movie should be required viewing for all high school seniors everywhere!",

            "content": "I don't understand what has gotten into John Hughes. The man responsible for such definitive and great teen films such as this one and PRETTY IN PINK, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is still possessed by the HOME ALONE formula. I mean after HOME ALONE hit it big, he made HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK which was the same slapstick formula but set against the background of NEW YORK, DENNIS THE MENACE the same slapstick formula set against the background of a Hank Ketcham comic strip, BABY's DAY OUT the same slapstick formula only with a BABY!!! 101 DALMATIONS, the same slapstick formula only this time with Glenn Close and a bunch of dogs tagged on, FLUBBER the same slapstick formula only this time it has Robin Williams to make funny faces and green snot. The list goes on. Back in the 80's, John Hughes was an icon. He truly complemented the teenage experience with his terrific movies with Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. But his greatest movie is FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF! This is the movie everyone remembers to the fullest and can fully quote scenes. Its just such a feel good teen movie, unlike the crap we see today with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Matthew Broderick is awesome and charismatic as the title character. He gives us inspiration to take things easy and not treat life too seriously. I loved Jeffrey Jones' portrayal of Mr.Rooney. The scenes with him in it are pure comic gold. He's perfect as the evil principal who'd do anything to see Ferris fail. Jennifer Grey is terrific as the sister who hates Ferris' existence because he gets away with everything. She's hilarious. She should have never got that nose job. There are so many memorable scenes in this movie. John Hughes knows how to direct. I liked the scene that focused on the faces of the students in the classroom as they hear a boring lecture from none other than Ben Stein. I liked the riotously scenes with Mr.Rooney and his assistant Grace. The parade sequence where Ferris Bueller lip syncs is a classic. I rewind that part at least 15 times every time I see it. And I love the dance those people do on the steps. MY FAVORITE SCENE OF ALL TIME IN THAT MOVIE: the kicking scene. Every Ferris Bueller fan should know what I'm talking about. It's just so hilarious and the perfect comic timing is so there. It's just hysterical. FERRIS BUELLER is a movie that defined our generation and I'll never forget it. Thank you John Hughes for such a great movie Quit the Disney movie remakes do something GREAT like you used to.",

So you haven't seen before then have to time travel pretty much back to be in a mindset to watch this. And from that point of view, this movie has some incredible new things. I am surprised by the usage of voice over narration technique in those time. I came to know about this movie through deadpool credit scenes. I have to accept that I had different expection than what movie offered. It was a little let down. I liked the message of the movie that \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" Its funny that how time passed quickly and its been 32 years since movie got releasedd. But I feel that this movie failed to deliver this idea clearly. I felt sometimes, the movie is heading no where and kind of not meaningful. Hey still its from 80's what more you can expect. Coming to the postive things, it explained how the schools were making students dumb and not being very much useful. I liked how bueller know his existence in the movie and his interaction with the audience. Thats simply brilliant. And he kind of guy where everyone knows him and care him. Ofcourse everyone would have crossed this kind people in our school days. So for me it is kind of interesting to know the teenage culture of US in 80's. Coming to cast, everyone did a great job. Maththew, Alan, Mia, Jennifer and Jefferey quite made a impression. The screenplay was sloppy sometimes. The movie has mixed pace. But make you sit through the whole.My rating:\n(Each worth a point)1 - Story (main theme)\n2 - Cast(Acting) \n3 - Screenplay\n4 - Emotion\n5 - Cinematography\n6 - Impression\n7 - Characterization\n8 - Dialogues\n9 - Sound\n10 - EditingStory, Screenplay(Voice over narration nailed it), Cast(Acting), Cinematography, Dialogues -> Checked5/10 \nVerdict: One time watchable.",

This obviously demonstrates my young age when I saw this movie back then.  Now when I watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off, now much older, it gains a timeless quality as I still love it just as much, or more than I did originally in 1986.  I strongly believe it is one of John Hughe's finest films.  Ferris Bueller's character (Matthew Broderick) demonstrates a heroic quality, with his charm, cunning and zest for life.  He displays a confidence that many of us could only dream of.  His friend Cameron on the other hand is the anti-thesis to Ferris' high strung personality, as this character is contrastedly low spirited and worrisome about life and his possible future after high school.  And this is the beauty of the movie, Ferris allows Cameron to finally bust out of his nervous shell and take hold of the reins of life. The plot is simple, Ferris a high school student is pretending to be home sick with the flu so he can enjoy a kick ass day o' fun.  His parents buy into his ploy but Ferris must do a little tampering with his attendance record (to avoid being caught by the nasty Mr. Rooney, Dean of Students played by Jeffrey Jones) by hacking into the school computer.  He is successful and notifies his good friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) of his plan to have an incredible day in the city of Chicago.  Cameron is wallowing in his own self pity and this situates his character symbolically as an everyman who we can all relate to, he is a person who is scared of life and would rather hide than face the bitterness of reality.  Therefore it is Ferris' job to aid Cameron in his voyage towards self realization.  And you thought Ferris Bueller's Day Off had no depth, think again!  But first they must rescue Ferris' hottie girl friend Sloan (Mia Sara) from the drudgery of her high school English class so they can escape to the city.  The fun begins once the trio take off to the city and many hilarious and wonderful scenes take place.  One particularly excellent scene takes place in the art gallery where Cameron is galvanized by one particular painting.  He cannot take his eyes off this painting and this scene strongly signifies his transformation towards self realization.Mr. Rooney is continually on a quest to defile the academic career of Ferris Bueller in his hilarious performance.  He remains the huge obstacle that stands in the way of our hero's enjoyment of a kick ass day 'o fun in the city. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a fascinating romp of hilarity with true moments of tenderness to keep every viewer happy.   Look for a young Jennifer Grey (from \" Dirty Dancing \" fame), she is fabulous in this movie as Ferris' despising sister Jeanie, all she wants is for her brother to be ruined in this whimsical tale of spiritual renewal.I give this movie *** out of 5 stars!  A very good film.",

Though considered such an '80s classic, the movie is extremely timeless, even though now-a-days, the actions the students commit in the film would probably get them thrown in jail. Students today will find much to identify with in the always-fresh and touching \"unknown future\" themes. But the most identifiable element in the film is the farcically bureaucratic characters. In other words, there will always be Ed Rooneys roaming the hallways in this modern educational environment. And as long as it stays that way, \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" will remain one of the most entertaining, satirical, and accessible comedies around. 10/10",

The trio is out for some fun but they have the principal and Ferris's sister hot on their heels. In the end they'll have the best day ever or get caught trying.This is one of my favorite movies ever. The story line is fun and full of great moments. Jeffrey Jones does a great job playing the principal who always seems to be one step behind Ferris. Additionally Jennifer Grey is amazing as Ferris's sister who can't accept the fact that her brother gets away with so much.The cast is wonderfully put together in a film written and directed by the late great John Hughes. Hughes is responsible for some of the best remembered films of my generation some of which include Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, The Great Outdoors and Mr. Mom. This film has some of those great signature moments that define some of Hughes films. Hughes also makes great use of music in creating one of the most memorable scenes of the film.I would suggest this film to anyone and everyone. If you haven't seen it I would hope you might take the time.Remember this: \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" \u2013 Ferris Bueller I give this a 3.7 out of 5 stars. (Remember that this is a guilty pleasure and one of my favorite films.)",

And even though this movie was made in the 1980's I know that Ferris would still be the most popular boy in school at the present time!\nI remember renting this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old. Well my parents rented it rather, and they almost peed themselves from laughing. I of course thought that it was funny but wasnt able to appreciate the subtle comic quirks that it possessed. The thing that I love the most about this movie was the random humor. Though Hugh's had alot of humor in Sixteen Candles, the humor was more bubblegum than anything else. Ferris' humor is a little more edgy and sarcastic...call it quirky if you will but shows for a more mature sense of humor.Things like Ben Stein as the history teacher announcing someone's name over and over until they acknowledged their presence for the attendance that day. \"Bueller, Bueller, Bueller\". Or how Ferris made a floppy disk of sick/vomiting noises that he would play over the phone to his friends at school. Even the \"Save Ferris\" posted on the Water Tower was a riot. It was the little things that made this film so great. Along with a great cast, this film is going to remain a real 1980's cult classic!",

Grown men want to be like James Bond, high school guys want to be like Ferris Bueller. He's cool, smart, and in control in every situation. One of the best movie characters ever created.The movie itself was brilliant. There's not a real strong plot, but like Seinfeld, the story is about the characters, their interaction, and the circumstances they find themselves in.This movie really did a great job of bringing together a lot of cool stuff. Maybe not all firsts, but the first time all these things were integrated and accomplished so well. For example, including the audience. Talking to the camera, documentary like sidebars with overlay texts, etc.The directing and cinematography were also excellent and the soundtrack was brilliantly matched to the content. For example the shot of the Ferrari jumping over the railroad tracks in slow-motion to the StarWars theme was brilliant. Also this is first movie I remember to make use of the cool sounds of the band \"Yello\" in it's sound-track. After FB made such brilliant use of Yello, many movies and TV shows started using them. Especially the cool track \"oh yeah\" (You know, shhhe-bow bow, cha chigga) See http://www.yello.ch/ to hear what I mean.There's just so many brilliant scenes in this movie, it's as near a 10 as I could vote. If IMDb allowed decimal voting, which I think they should, I'd give it a 9.8.Matthew Broderick is one of the great unsung actors of our time. He's amazing. I just saw him in \"The Producers\" and am reminded again how good he is. He's a throwback from the days of _real_ entertainers. When they could not only act, but they could do everything. Act, sing, dance, etc.Alan Ruck also put in a memorable performance as Cameron. I loved the \"he'll keep calling me\" and \"Sloan's dad\" scenes especially.Jennifer Grey also was great as \"Shauna\" and her scenes with Charlie Sheen in his cameo were a nice contrast to her angry sister performance.I love the quirky parents performances by Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward. I really love when Tom Bueller is listening to the parade, and when he's behind the old lady in the car.Well, anyway, if you haven't seen this, you don't deserve access to IMDb as you are a movie infidel. This is a must see classic.One of the most entertaining movies ever made, especially if you ever went to high-school.",

            "content": "I'm 30 and this is the first time I've seen this flick. I have no nostalgia whatsoever, though I think I have seen parts of the movie some time before when I was a kid.FBDO has such a huge status even today (the running scene in Spider-man: Homecoming is proof of this) and I thought I was going to be way, waaaaay more entertained by this movie. The film has a lot of charm and it is a well made movie that uses lots of music and scores to its advantage as well as having lots of well-filmed scenes etc.Part of the humor comes from how unrealistic Bueller's tricks and plans are and the insane amount of effort it must go into to pull certain technological stunts off (e.g. all the tapes) - wouldn't it been easier to just go to school? The message of the movie that we all should take a day off and experience life is also a very nice one and deserves to be lived out once in a while (though in FBDO comes from a place of privilegie and the rich main characters shouldn't have much to complain about...)But honestly, at least 60% of the movie is boring. So many of the \"good jokes\" (the ones from the Ferris/Sloane/Cameron-parts) didn't make me laugh or even smile. Then the movie has a lot of pure garbage-scenes involving the principal that tries to get back at Bueller but is forced to endure some incredibly boring and unoriginal slapstick. The scenes with Jeannie aren't that great either, which is too bad because the first scenes we see her in she seems like a real funny, badass character, a perfect contrast to Ferris - but no, there is not much payoff with that character at all.The sidestory with Cameron didn't resonate with me at all. When Cameron decides to confront his dad instead of being angry at Ferris it comes more off like the script is giving Ferris an easy way out. Though I like the multiple personality theory that some fans have (but it doesn't work because two people are calling the principal in the beginning...)Anyway, I can admit that hype probably plays some part in my disappointment with this movie. But if a movie is this hyped up and it doesn't deliver, then I think it deserves to be taken down a notch. 4/10",

            "content": "I'm sure by now you've heard of this wildly popular John Hughes film. Yeah, you know the one. The one with the teenagers who do a bunch of funny teenager things that every other teen wishes they were doing. Oh, you don't know the one I'm talking about? That's because he's made movies with this plot more times than teenage-you actually did any of these things. But guess what? He did it again with Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986).\nI've seen many a teen movie in my lifetime, so by now I've seen plenty of these plot-lines belly flop harder than my chubby Mexican cousin. This time around it's Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), the popular class clown type, and his partners in crime. He easily gets his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), to go along with his latest scheme, but his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) is a different story. He is informed by Ferris that they will be taking his father's prized possession: a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT. Ferris easily convinced his clueless parents he was on the brink of death to stay home \"sick\" from school, but not his younger sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey). Along with her being out to get him, Principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is also on his tail, fed up with his antics. Headed to downtown Chicago for the day, what could possibly go wrong?\nAny movie aimed at a younger audience needs that one special ingredient to keep their attention, or they will undoubtedly lose interest. You know what I'm talking about, right? Ok, say it with me now: comedy! This film is chock full of one-liners, sarcasm, and witty remarks. There is no way anyone could watch it without laughing at least once. At times the delivery is a bit much, (*cough cough* Principal Rooney -a grown man- growling many times throughout the movie), but in general the script does a good job of keeping the audience entertained.\nOne of the most memorable features of the movie is the setting. The film is set in Chicago, and it was actually mostly shot there. Their whole adventure through Chicago was all shot in Chicago, at such famous locations like Wrigley Field, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Willis Tower. Seeing that the setting in the film is true to the shooting location is refreshing to see and gives viewers a sense of authenticity.\nAdding to authenticity, the acting was all there. Not counting how Cameron started out very sick and somehow just... magically got better? The interactions between the characters were extremely convincing. If I were to ever meet Matthew Broderick in person, I would expect him to be the eccentric extrovert I saw in the film. And Jennifer Grey? She would roll her eyes and walk away. Even though at the time of filming, none of these \"high school students\" were really in high school, they managed to make it feel like we were ditching school right along with them.\nAll in all, I did truly enjoy this movie. It didn't feel like just another one of those cheesy teen movies that keep getting pushed out to make money. Compared to other movies John Hughes has done, like Sixteen Candles, this appeals to a much wider audience and was overall more impactful. I recommend this movie to anyone for a good time. Even if it's not your type you might as well watch it because after all, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it\".",

            "content": "SEE THE MOVIE BEFORE READING ON, OK? OK!!The second of Hughes' two classic teen flicks of all time. The wisecracking, wisdom offering, laid back Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides that it's time to take a day off. But not just any day off. Not a lay around at home playing video games sort of day off. We're talking the best day off ever.Taking his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who is forever wound up tight and his girlfriend, Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara), who is about the only person who can keep Ferris in check, to Chicago. But it's not Ferris style to go in Cameron's old car. No no no. The best way by far is in Cameron's dad's Ferrari. 1961 Ferrari 250GT California to be exact. It doesn't bother Ferris one bit that less than a hundred were made and that Cameron's dad keeps a close eye on the mileage. The car is sheer Ferris and it's something that he has to drive.But it isn't just a day off. It helps Cameron from being uptight all his life, it helps Ferris from screwing his life up and makes Sloane realize that Ferris loves her.Hughes directs this movie superbly. It has everything needed to make a successful comedy. A young cast, great camera shots and a 'hero' everyone wants to be like. Broderick's camera shots when he talks to the audience or gives them sly looks are classic and help the audience identify with a guy who gets his kicks from skipping school. We see everything from Ferris's eyes and how he views the world.Once again Hughes uses teen pyschology, mainly with Cameron in this movie. The film shows how Cameron goes from a guy who flips out because he's being forced to do something he doesn't want to, to someone who does what he likes and fights for what he believes in. The scene when the three go to the art museum is clever as it shows how Cameron feels inside. Staring at a piece of art Cam notices that the closer you look the less you see and believes that this is how people are going to see him.It's Ferris' intention to liven Cameron up before the go their seperate ways, off to college and work. That's the real reason of taking the day off. Of course it's for Ferris' own pleasure too. A trip to the Sears tower, a posh restaurant and a parade ensure that Ferris can make sure that Cam, Sloane and himself have fun.But it's not as simple as that. Ferris has Mr. Rooney, dean of students, on his tail. If Rooney has his way Ferris will be spending the next year at school resitting everything subject. But Rooney doesn't know when to stop. He leaves the school grounds in pursuit of Ferris and keeps going one step too far in his goal. This is his downfall as the more he tries the more of an ass he makes himself look. The faces the kids on the late bus pull when a bedraggled Mr. Rooney walks on is great. Ferris' other enemy is his sister, Jeannie, who feels that Ferris shouldn't get the day off when he's not really sick and does everything she can to catch him in the act. She too goes over the top and ends up in a police station, making out with Charlie Sheen's character, Garth Volbeck, who offers her advice on her troubles.\nOnce again Hughes manages to combine teen humor with slapstick comedy and it blends perfectly. As in Weird Science and The Breakfast Club the authority figures are ridiculed and mocked to the point of extreme, in this case the ever trying, ever failing Mr. Rooney.The reason this movie was more successful than Hughes previous films (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Weird Science) is because it has a wider appeal than say, surrealistic Weird Science. As in true Hughes tradition it has a cast of unknowns who later went on to become part of the Eighties brat pack, including Broderick and a cameo by Charlie Sheen.\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is a feel good movie. There's not a real plot, it's just pure entertainment, and Hughes directs it this way. If you're looking for fun then you can't go wrong with a John Hughes movie, and this movie in particular. If you have the chance I highly recommend you watch this.Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it.",

            "content": "This is not only one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most inspiring, life-affirming movies I've ever seen. If somebody were simply told this was the story of a teenager skipping school to go on a fun-filled journey through Chicago, many would expect Ferris Bueller to be a reckless teenager that doesn't take his life seriously. These people would then be shocked to find Ferris is taking a day off because he IS taking his life very seriously. Ferris is the person we'd all love to be \u2013 free from worries and problems and simply living life to the fullest. School faculties will hate me for saying this, but it's very exhilarating to see this happy-go-lucky character escape from the mind-numbing prison that is high school, and live his life in absolute freedom. If there was ever a convincing case for truancy, this is it.When I first saw this movie, I immediately related to Ferris's friend, Cameron \u2013 a worried and nervous person who \"feels better when he's sick.\" I have an anxiety disorder, and every now and then find myself in complete fear and panic when faced with a situation that I'm not used to. So to see this character's emotional journey throughout the film was probably one of the most meaningful moments in my history of watching movies. All of the supporting characters are well-crafted, with the principal being the anti-thesis of Ferris(a stressed and gullible man), and his sister being jealous of Ferris's annoying habit of getting away with everything. This film is one of John Hughes's best achievements as a director. He is renowned for having amazing soundtracks that fit beautifully with the images shown. One great example off the top of my head is the art museum scene with an instrumental version of The Smiths' \"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want.\" The parade scene is the best scene in the film, showing exuberant joy on an enormous scale. Critic Richard Roeper called this film \"a form of suicide prevention,\" and he's right. This film is the ultimate feel-good, laugh-out-loud movie; it might as well be used for therapy. This is definitely John Hughes's best movie, I love it and admire it so much that I want this to be the last film I watch before I die \u2013 that way, I can go out saying that life certainly was worth it.",

All the characters seem to only see their future at the latest keg party, love to get high, get knocked up, and for the most part, screw up their entire lives. And you know what? I AM A TEENAGER! But let me put it this way....Ferris Bueller's is the king of not only 'teen movies' but of all Comedy's!Ferris Bueller's Day Off came out a year before I was born. Though I don't necessarily care for a ton of 80's movies for the fact that all the huge hair and cheesy teenage love stories annoy me, but this movie has got to be one of my all-time favorites.I distinctively remember the first time my mom and I rented Ferris Buellers Day off together. I think I was 5...and I loved every Matthew Broderick movie I had seen (and still do...with the exception of The Cable Guy...that movie was a brick) So, naturally, I knew I was going to like this one...Within 2 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard I was crying. And not only that, I realized it was a movie that was made in an era that I was not at all too familiar with. But I didn't care, all I knew was that I loved the movie. And of course...I STILL DO!!!!Now here I am, a high school Freshman, and I've heard tons of adults tell me to remember my highschool years, because they are some of the best years of your life. Well, I'm starting to feel that. And not only am I now gaining good memories from high school, but good memories from a great movie, that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.10+++++++++++/10",

The supporting cast is equally up to the task, with Alan Ruck, Jennifer Grey and Jeffrey Jones especially noteworthy. Charlie Sheen also makes the most of a small role late in the movie. There are an abundance of laughs from beginning to end, and like all of Hughes' films, it also has a heart, and a serious moment or two.

The ingenuity of a moving, mechanical sleep dummy gets him started and on the right path to a truly successful day off. The plot is carefully orchestrated with Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as a wise-cracking high school senior from the fictional northern Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois (in reality, Lake Forest, Illinois), who decides to skip school (Lake Forest High School) for a day on the town by pretending to be sick. He convinces his nervous friend, Cameron (Ruck) to take his father's carefully restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California out for a spin, although Cameron's father has so little trust in him that he has memorized the car's mileage. Ferris makes the promise to erase any miles they put on the car by running the car in reverse when they return. Masquerading as her father, Ferris springs his junior girlfriend Sloane (Sara) from school on the premise that her grandmother has died. this is a truly remarkable film.",

Has there ever been a better, more believable Irritable Best Friend character than that created in Alan Ruck's sulking-Cameron scenes?

Most of the scenes in the movie were shot in Winnetka and Northbrook and as you can tell those towns are absolutely beautiful. I unfortunately grew up in a neighboring town called Evanston and often longed of going to the famous New Trier HS in Winnetka and living the life of Ferris' girl friend Sloan. You see my Ferris, we'll call him Mr. E to protect the innocent grew up in the area and went to New Trier. He was so cute and was totally like Ferris. I used to sit in class and write his name over and over in my notes, Emma + Erik, oops I let it slip. Oh well, I can't help it, he's just so dreamy!! As Cameron famously says after Ferris saves him from the pool \"Ferris Bueller, you're my hero\" Erik ....., is my hero. I often used to drive by his parents house and pretended that I was going to meet him for a date, then it was back to boring old Evanston. He talked to me once, and said \"can I have some napkins\" when he was ordering some food at this restaurant Buffalo Joe's in my town where I used to work. I touched his hand, it was the greatest day of my life. Unfortunately I'm a plump old housewife now living on the west coast, but at least I always have this movie to remind me of the good old days. Oh did I mention, Erik, I mean Ferris, is totally hot. So, like yeah see the movie. It is way rad!!",

Matthew Broderick is an extremely likeable character as Ferris Bueller: an intensely popular high school student with a close circle of friends.  I'm not advocating ditching high school classes and dodging parents, but this movie conveys a true sense of anxiety and excitement while skipping classes and barely making it home in time to finish off a day that could not have gone better.  A cult classic that belongs in the adventure/comedy section of a video collection.",

            "content": "A definition of a good movie is one that impacts people generation after generation. That never gets old to no matter who is watching. Like a good series over years, Star Wars for example Continue to be popular years after they come out. A movie that isn't apart of a series that has done this for many years and will continue to do so for many years is Ferris Bueller's Day Off. \n It has become one of the most classic comedy movies of all time and the main reason we all love it is because we all wish we could be Ferris Bueller for a little bit. For most of high school there are moments when I dream of not having to worry about the homework and absences of school. Ferris bueller has the guts to not care about all this and make the most of his time and live to the fullest unlike his buddy Cameron. Although for this one day Ferris gets rid of all doubt and fear and takes of course big risks. Although being caught almost everyday Ferris still risks it for the biscuit and gets bolder and bolder as the day goes on. Absolutely forgetting the fact Ferris could not graduate if he gets caught he still goes on and has a blast per usual. With Cameron leading their day it would have only lasted an hour or so but with Ferris they get the opportunity to go to a baseball game and lead a parade in Chicago and much much more while celebrating his life with his girlfriend and best friend and continue to live life with Ferris's crazy sister and very oblivious parents running around and living life while they can to the most of their ability and living by his own quote \"life moves pretty fast, if you don't slow down every once in a while, you might miss it.\"\n Matthew Broderick (Ferris) is extremely comical and very smooth throughout The Whole movie. He even connects with the audience on a whole new level when he directly talks to them at the beginning of the movie and multiple times throughout. This allows us to see in what Ferris sees and how he plans things and what he wants to happen and helps you better comprehend the movie. It shows him better that a lot of time and thought are put into his plans and that he is not just a big lazy bum and slacker throughout school and life but rather very smart and hardworking when he wants to be. Ferris throughout the movie seems to be the person that everyone is jealous of and wants to be who Ferris is. Even his sister who plots against him The Whole movie but when it becomes the middle of the movie and towards the end you come to realize that almost everyone who conspires against Ferris is actually jealous and respects what he has accomplished and almost envy him.\n Another thing that was really impactful throughout this film was the music and sounds. For example during the parade in downtown Chicago they used the song \"Twist and Shout\" by the Beatles and shows how cheerful and what a great time they are all having. The thing about songs and music is it can emphasize the mood of the movie and how the characters are feeling during certain scenes. Like when it would show his sister it would be a kinda darker slower music because she was always trying to catch him. Also the sounds emphasize where you are for example when the dean of students, Mr. Rooney is in the arcade it is a lot of noise and random objects emphasizing chaos and lots of confusion for him making him make mistakes and mistake a girl for Ferris. Sounds can change entire aspects of a movie making it fearful or joyful and throughout this movie the majority of the sounds are cheerful and show joy for Ferris and Cameron, whereas for Mr. Rooney and Ferris's sister are negative and dull. The sounds in this movie really help emphasize the mood and do a really good job making it the movie it is to be.\n One thing about this movie that could have been better I believe is the plot. I couldn't seem to find a point as to what the whole point is. I thought they could have shortened up the scene with Ferris's sister because I didn't understand really where she came in at the end and tried giving her more apart of the movie but I didn't think she really had a meaning or a purpose in the moving rather than trying to get Ferris in trouble. I think John Hughes the director should have cut that scene and maybe focused more on Ferris and almost getting caught by Edward Rooney the Dean of students. Although this is just a monitor flaw in this movie all in all I think it is a class act film.\n John Hughes who directs this movie does a wonderful job emphasizing that kids should live your life to the fullest and have fun while you are young. He shows don't care what other people think just do what you think is right and have fun while your doing it even if getting out of school is what is right. This movie is so good it will continue to be a gem for years to come as it has been since it left the box office.",

Except Ferris Bueller - he worked smart and played hard.Ferris Bueller was how we all wanted to be. The guy could bluff his way out of any situation. He had a gorgeous girlfriend, a best friend who idolised him, and access to a Ferrari. In order to cheer up said best friend, he decides to take the day off and show him the outside world. Of course he is being pursued along the way by school principal.The film is witty, artistic (compared to others in the genre), has a great 80s sound track, and really does capture the mood of the times.The funniest character in my opinion is the nutty secretary at the high school. This actress (who played Eunice in Whats up Doc) should have got an oscar.

Matthew Broderick is, of course, wonderful as the title character and Alan Ruck is absolutely brilliant (even upstaging Broderick at times) as the anal-retentive Cameron. The supporting roles are all very well done, especially Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward as Ferris' dim-bulb parents, Jennifer Grey as his wonderfully bitchy sister, Edie McClurg as the scatterbrained secretary Grace, and especially Jeffrey Jones as the hapless principal Ed Rooney. Also worth a giggle are the hilarious cameo performances by Kristy Swanson, Ben Stein and Charlie Sheen.  Best scene of the movie: the \"Twist and Shout\" scene. This movie is filled with some terrific one-liners, such as \"I weep for the future\", \"I think we should shoot her\" and my personal favourite \"what country do you think this is?\" Matthew Broderick may be making it big on Broadway these days but to me he'll always be Ferris.",

            "content": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off is directed by John Hughes and it stars Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, and Jeffrey Jones.Ferris Bueller contains many different themes in this movie, but the most important theme is \"Living in the Moment\". Throughout the entirety of this movie, Ferris and his two friends are skipping school to try and have a good time before the end of their senior years (except for Sloane).Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane have created created a lifetime of special memories in their lives together. None of these characters are perfect people, especially Ferris, but all of them care deeply about each other. For example, throughout the entirety of the movie Cameron is constantly worried about his father's Ferrari and Ferris is always trying to cheer him up. Ferris is definitely not a good role model, but he does care about making others happy.Even though this movie is mostly a comedy, I think one of the central focuses of this movie is on Cameron. Cameron is always worried about what his father thinks about him and feels like he is all alone. It is hinted in the movie that his father cares more about materials like his Ferrari, instead of his own son. Cameron eventually overcomes his fear of his father by crashing the Ferrari out of anger. Ferris tries to take the blame for the incident, but Cameron decides to take the blame because he is tired of being afraid of his father. His growth as a character is really shined on in throughout the movie and it is well executed by John Hughes.Another praise I have for this movie is the acting from Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller. He really shows his talents as an actor in this movie and has a special charm to his performance. Broderick also has a ton of fantastic comedic moments throughout the entire movie and breaks the fourth wall on multiple occasions.The soundtrack is also quite amazing in this movie too. One of the main features in this movie is \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello and also features \"Danke Schoen\" from Wayne Newton. The soundtrack helps create a sense of uniqueness to this movie and helps elevate it to a new level.Ferris Bueller has had a major impact on the world today. It is mentioned in numerous of movies throughout the years. For example, \"Spiderman: Homecoming\" and \"Deadpool\" both have referenced this iconic movie. Ferris Bueller has set its mark on the world and will stand the test of time.This movie is simply incredible and is one of my favorite comedies of all time.Ferris: Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.",

Except for the fact it never got a sequel! Only the television show, which lasted only one season and was poorly cast ed. And besides that, a series is not a good format and wouldn't do justice to the Day Off concept. Although I did enjoy 'Parker Lewis can't loose' as a kid. Which is a direct rip-off in my perspective. Ferris Bueller however is timeless. The Characters are great but the idea of the Day Off was most inspiring. I often say to myself the words \"How can u possible handle \"school\" on a day like this\" and then change 'school' for 'work' or 'social family obligations'. In the 80's I related mostly to Cameron (Ferris's loser friend). And I still (now twenty odd years later) when I don't like to get up, I hear his song in my head \"When Cameron was in Egypt land, let my people go\". This was so abstract for me, back then, and at the same time so perfectly clear. When you liked this one, you also should see; Better of Dead and The Breakfast Club.",

This movie is hilarious, and all of us can only dream of sneaking out of school and having a day off like Ferris does! (And we can only dream of our most hated principal/teacher always getting the worst of it while trying to catch us.) My favorite scenes are where they're trying to get into the restaurant with the snobby waiter, (\"I weep for the future!\") and Jeannie's chat with the guy in the police station. The only thing I don't like about this movie is how Ferris seems to slightly manipulate Cameron, his best friend, but despite that, this movie must be seen if you love 80's flicks. If you haven't seen Ferris Buller's Day off, then you haven't seen a great comedy! Rent it, buy it, catch it on T.V, but whatever you do, you gotta see this movie!",

            "content": "Who wouldn't want to be Ferris, at least for one day? And especially if it could be the day he takes off from school, with friends Cameron and Sloane, journeying into downtown Chicago impersonating the rich and famous while capturing the hearts of an entire city? Ferris represents everything all high school boys want to be: funny, good-looking, quick, charming, conniving yet smart, and popular. Having a girlfriend as hot as Sloan Peterson doesn't hurt either. And driving a Ferrari helps. What really won me over about his character was Ferris' ability to talk his way through conflicts and problems. Perhaps it is his strategic way of thinking I envy. When faced with similar confrontations (i.e. the restaurant scene with the `snooty' host), I'd probably crack and then wet my pants. Ferris was able to, though non-violently and painlessly, deceive people, achieve his goal, and make himself look like the good guy all while doing so. It's this ability I find so intriguing and sexy. In a way, yes, this movie told kids it's okay to lie and do the wrong thing. But it also taught kids not to give up in the face of opposition. But who really cares what the underlying message is? Movies are made to help one escape miserable reality for 2 hours. In those two hours I imagined myself as Ferris Bueller, conquering the world, singing in a parade, being ogled by beautiful dancers, and tooling around in a Ferrari. This life is a dream come true- as long as you ignore the final scene, which I suppose the director/writer John Hughes included to help movie-goers prepare for re-entry back into their pathetic and dreary lives.",

Chemistry and timing between the characters. You feel for Cameron and his many illnesses, you wanna see Ferris ALMOST get caught again just to see how he gets out of it, and Sloane, well she just looks cute in the pool scene.The gags are plentiful, and the cameo of Charlie Sheen very funny. I haven't seen the TV series, but i am kinda guessing it wasn't too much of a success otherwise it would be available on dvd :)I truly enjoyed this movie, and try to watch it every time its on sky.

From the pale lighting in the school to the large grandiose shots of downtown Chicago, This movie has it all. In what could be Matthew Broderick breakout performance, this movie was a portrayal of one man's effort to just take it easy. The lighting in this movie is worth mentioning, when they are in the high school the lighting is very pale and boring. Much like the school they are in, the natural silence in the classroom is what carries over the boredom in your head as well as the character's learning about \"voodoo economics\". Also one thing to mention is Ferris bueller's foil in the story, Edward Rooney. Ed is a man who takes his job too seriously and his attempt to finally catch ferris in the act of ditching led for some of the film's more funnier moments. One of the thing that really gets to me is the character development of Ferris' friend Cameron. Cam is a very troubled young man who lives in a very troubled household. My favorite part of the movie is him finding himself and his confidence when he destroyed that beautiful Ferrari and said that his dad and him will have a chat when they get home. His self discovery is something a lot of people can relate to. Overall the story of ferris bueller is one about living life to the fullest and not wasting opportunities. As ferris says \"life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop to look around every once and awhile, you might miss it.\" This movie is a classic and one I can watch a million times over. I suggest that if you are fan of comedy and teenage high school films then this movie is the one for you",

I mean, honestly, I was surprised.Don't get me wrong, I mean, It's always had a special place in my heart. But I never thought of it as real 'art,' or even as a 'film.'  It was just some amusing little footnote.  But lo, I was wrong.  Not only is this an exceptionally well assembled film (noting accomplished film editor Paul Hirsch), but there is some real merit to the subject matter.  The writing is smart and pointed in criticism of the mundane.  I don't wish to deeply examine the metaphors here, but the inter-cutting between Cameron (Alan Ruck) and \"sunday afternoon in the park,\" by Seurat (actually, I'm not sure about the painting, but that sounds right) was a particularlly nice touch.And since I mentioned him, Alan Ruck delivered an amazing performance as Cameron.  All of the actors were in fine form here, and subtle measures including shots of pivoting feet or hand gestures show the director Alan Hughes' expertise in the craft;  however Alan Ruck is particularly noteworthy.  The character of Cameron is a quietly multi-dimensional one. Whatever his situation throughout the film, he retains another level of, well, pain.  He is the suffering one.  He has had a loveless childhood.  He is nervous about having stolen his father's car.  He is resentful of Ferris for having all the luck.  All of these things are apparent throughout the performance.  Not once does Ruck let you forget that he is unhappy, even if he might crack a smile or two.  Truly impressive.I was very sad to discover the fates of those who worked on this film.  At the time of this commentary, John Hughes has written Home Alone 3.  Ruck is wasting his talent on an ABC sitcom (albeit an amusing one).  Broderick most recently starred in the farsical slaughter of one of the big screen's most beloved monsters (Godzilla) and is currently at work on the Hollywood adaptation of Inspector Gadget.Whatever will be, I suppose.",

This film also gave us a number of the sound bytes that you hear so often today (Ben Stein's \"Bueller...Bueller\" and the spoken-in-one-breath update on Ferris' condition by then not-quite-known Kristy Swanson).This film is Hughes at his best, and Broderick in probably his biggest, best role (or at least his most memorable).

That really isn't the point of the film; in fact, one of the most striking characteristics about FBDO is that it makes a point of reminding you that you're watching a movie. Ferris addresses the audience (one of the first to ever do so as a regular feature of the film); film sequences are tweaked to emphasize certain scenes (such as Jeannie kicking Rooney in the face and then bolting upstairs before he seemingly hits the ground), and the Ferrarri getting about 5 feet of air. None of this is the slightest bit realistic, but it's great fun to watch, and so is the rest of this movie. It's *supposed* to be over-the-top. That's the whole point.The great thing about this movie is that it uses all its elements in perfect harmony. The clothing is '80s, but not *too* '80s--miniskirts and hockey jerseys will always be in. The music is classic, not overly-familiar, overplayed '80s anthems. The scenery is pure Chicago. Ferris and Cameron are very believable as long-time buddies, and the other characters play off each other perfectly. The dialogue is brilliant. The comic scenes are hilarious, and the parade scene makes you want to shake it up right along with the movie. It's a great film by a great movie-maker who was smart enough to know exactly how far to go, unlike today's directors who would undoubtedly have sequeled and merchandised it to death. (Not that they didn't try to make a TV show out of it back in the day.) It is the quintessence of everything that was good about the '80s, and that's why it's a classic.",

He's fun to hang out with,he can make you get rid of your problems,and if not,take the blame on his shoulder,just as Cameron discovers. If you had a friend like Ferris during your high school years, you should definitely consider yourself very fortunate.Ferris,in his fun trip around Chicago,takes his girlfriend and best friend along and tries to make it special for Cameron,who leads a very mundane life. He tries to relieve him of his fears and as we see towards the end,Cameron learns to stand up for himself.A thoroughly enjoyable movie,and a must see when you get your day off.My Rating, 4 n a 1/2 out of 5.",

Other times we are like Ferris; uninhibited, fun-loving, and relaxed. We all need to realize that we control our lives and determine our future. I think Cameron put it best when he said, \"I am not going to sit on my ass as the events that affect me unfold to determine the course of my life. I'm going to take a stand. I'm going to defend it. Right or wrong, I'm going to defend it.\" We should all strive to be memorable in this life, to take some advice from Ferris. \"Life moves pretty fast.

He is not interested in anything and doesn't believe he is capable of anything. Compared to this, Ferris Bueller is the kid that always gets everything right and to people like Cameroon, it seems they can never get anything wrong. While we may not all have faced neglect by our parents, at some point we can all say that we related to Cameroon feeling down and out with no prospects and wanted to be like Ferris, the guy with the gorgeous girlfriend, supporting and loving parents and loads of popularity and confidence.Whats so great about the chemistry between the trio, apart from the great acting by all three actors, is that Sloane and Ferris are not arrogant in their popularity. They have a loyal and loving relationship together and are supportive and caring for Cameroon even in his strangest or lowest moments (the pool scene). Their main concern towards the last 20 minutes of the film is about Cameroon and if he's truly going to be ok without them.The triumphant ending for all three is a great one and the museam scene is absolutely iconic.",

A quote from the movie that fits the situation I'm in perfectly often springs to my head, and I drive my family crazy reciting all the dialogue each time I watch it. So many things about this movie ring true - friendship, teen stress, the need to have a day off once in a while. I think most of John Hughes' other movies (with the possible exception of The Breakfast Club) are poor excuses for a window on teen life, but he must be applauded for this one, as must the actors, writers, and everyone else involved.

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's day off\" is an overall feel-good feature film that easily relates and reaches the teenage audience. It's capable of brightening anyone's day, but struggles to keep the viewers attention throughout the entirety of the film.The overarching plot line is about a high school senior, played by Matthew Broderick, who decides to fake an illness and skip school when he hears about the very promising weather forecast. He then lures his reluctant best friends, Cameron (Alan Ruck), and his very willing girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), into his fun-filled day off from school, all while he's trying to avoid being caught by, his parents, his sister, and the principal all at the same time.Matthew Broderick has to play Hughes' attempt at what an essential teen, might be, hoping to create the perfect teen movie, after not quite getting there from \"The Breakfast Club\" or \"Sixteen Candles\". Yet, Broderick does quite a good job depicting a feel good teen who isn't caring about the past or the future. This directly appeals to teens because most of them can relate to the theme of not knowing about the future, and essentially not caring.Where the film lacks is in the plot line, catching the audience's attention on this fun ride through Chicago narrowly avoiding trouble. After less than an hour though, not much really changes and it can get repetitive, failing to keep the viewers attention through the whole movie. It lacks movement as pretty much the same things are repeating without much intensity growing throughout. Just about the only thing attempting at keeping the intensity up is the music, which hosts some feel good, and upbeat songs.The most important theme in the movie is actually quite striking, that being Cameron's abusive relationship with his father. While his father is never seen in the movie, he is represented through his expensive car that he owns. It's a good theme a good amount of the audience can actually relate to. We can see this specific theme portrayed in one of the scenes where Cameron is fixated on an oil painting in a museum specifically looking at a kid in the painting. Cameron seemingly learns more from this experience than he ever did in school, and we can see him change in his thoughts and behavior after this scene. Another important key theme is the fear of what's next. It's shared between all three teen characters in the movie that they don't know what's next in their life, where Ferris fears what's going to happen when he's goes off to college, and Cameron claiming he's not interested in anything. This key theme is about the most relatable to teenage viewers and is what allows them to grip on to the movie.\"Ferris Bueller's day off\" is a feel good movie depicting teens that just want to have fun without a care in the world, yet it struggles to grip the attention of most viewers, really only relating to teens with a few important key themes. Overall, it is a fun watch that won't necessarily strike as an important movie that must be seen.",

Ferris was not only an optimist, but he also took steps to live out his dreams. It did not matter how impossible these steps seemed to be, he still executed every step until his dreams were in the now.Cameron, on the other hand, did the same thing but moving in the opposite direction.

            "content": "Ferris Bueller's Day Off Movie Review\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" Though life may move pretty fast, Director John Hughes's Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one film you don't want to miss. Though this film is nearly 25 years old, it is considered to be a classic amongst teens and enthusiasts of 1980's culture everywhere. A well-developed story, believable acting, and the unique directing insight of John Hughes make this film worthy of a Golden Globe nomination, and a must see for anyone looking for an entertaining blast to the past. The premise of Ferris Bueller's Day Off is simple but something everyone can relate to. Ferris Bueller, played by Matthew Broderick, (War Games, The Producers) is an 18-year old High School Senior just weeks from graduating who fakes sick to enjoy one of his last days of spring with his best friend, Cameron (Alan Ruck, Spin City) and his girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara, Birds of Prey) to explore the metropolis of Chicago, IL. Ferris and his friends take a grand tour of Chicago in Cameron's father's extremely rare vintage Ferrari sports car, making appearances at Wrigley Field, The Art Institute of Chicago, and the Sears Tower. While \"the sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, wastoids, dweebies, and dickheads\" (who all adore Bueller) rally support to fight Ferris' rumored life-threatening condition, Principal Rooney, (Jeffery Jones, Amadeus) and his sister, Jeanie, (Jennifer Grey, Red Dawn) do everything in their power to catch Ferris in the act of skipping school. Though Ferris uses his charm, wit, and improvised acting to slip through the grasp of pursuers, the care-free joyride the trio takes turns out to be more than they bargained for. The climax of the film kept me on the edge of my seat, constantly wondering if Ferris would make it through the day without being caught. By the end of the film viewers will feel satisfied with the conclusion, but hungry to hear more about the characters and their futures. Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Ferris Bueller is outstanding. Broderick spent many years sharpening his skills in formal acting training focusing mainly on theater, and his performance reflects that. Ferris is a smart-mouthed, cocky, and daring teenager willing to do anything to encourage others to laugh and have a good time. Like many teenagers, his hobbies include skipping school, killing time with his friends, and praying that one day he will have a car of his own. The iconic \"Parade\" and \"French Restaurant\" scenes show off Broderick's ability to be charismatic and commanding in a lead role, separating him from many of the cheesy, over-the-top actors of the 1980's. Though War Games is considered to be Broderick's breakout role, Ferris Bueller's Day Off will be easily remembered as his greatest work. Alan Ruck plays the role of Cameron Frye, Ferris's sickly best friend who worries that a reckless cruise in his father's Ferrari will end in complete disaster. Cameron is arguably the most complex character of the film, as he struggles with depression, conflict with his parents, and disillusionment with the world around him, like many teenagers in the 1980's. Though Ruck was nearly 30 years old when he joined the cast as Cameron, he convincingly plays a teen that is not in control of his own life. As the film progresses, the viewer sympathizes with Cameron, and secretly crosses their fingers that he will recover from the problems he faces. Ruck secured his place in this classic because of his goofy sidekick role, quality acting skills, and his ability to evoke emotion from the actors on screen as well as the viewers. Mia Sara plays the role of Sloane Peterson, Ferris's popular girlfriend. After the boys impersonate Sloane's father to have her released from school, she joins the pair in their adventure around Chicago. Unlike Broderick and Ruck, Sara had little experience in Hollywood, but it hardly shows in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Like Ferris, Sloane loves fun and adventure, and wants to have one last good day with her boyfriend before he graduates. Sara's performance is emotionally genuine and authentic to the mentality of a 1980's teenager, as she was one at the time of the film's production. Though many actresses were auditioned to play the role of Sloane, I feel that Mia Sara was complementary to Broderick and Ruck, making her perfect for the part. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is known as one John Hughes's best films. Hughes wrote and directed this film, as well as the \"Brat Pack\" classics, Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, and The Breakfast Club. Unlike many movies of that era, Hughes wrote characters that were complex, with desires and problems that many teens to this day can still relate with. The camera style as scene in the rest of his films returns; unique and visually appealing. The sound track features many classic songs of the 1980's, including Bueller's own rendition of The Beatles' \"Twist and Shout\". As long as there are high school students who are eager to get more out of life than learning from a monotonous economics teacher and gym class this film will remain relevant. Without the unique vision and clever writing skills of John Hughes however, this film may have flopped. Though the era of the 1980's is slowly fading from the conscious of our culture, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is likely to remain as popular as always. The stellar writing and directing of Hughes, a unique story, and a perfectly selected cast make this film a rare gem. I urge everyone who needs a good laugh to skip school and watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off, you won't be disappointed.",

I believe that this film is not only the best teen movie that has ever been made, but also the defining movie of the 1980's. Although essentially a comedy, the film shows the essence of life as a teenager through brilliant performances by Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck. Broderick's Ferris is a wonderful character neither stereotype nor overbearing persona, and John Hughes yet again creates genius through the character of Cameron, played by Alan Ruck - who was 30 at the time!Many may disagree, but for me the best lines in the whole film are Camerons - 'When Cameron walked in Egypt land...... Let my Cameron go' wonderfully delivered to convey the characters stifled existence in his home life and the pressures of being the best friend of such a man as Ferris. In all, teen comedies don't get better than this. 10/10",

Plus a cool soundtrack. Still not sure of Broderick, tho he is rather fabulous in this him, but good god do i not forgive you for Godzilla 1998!!! Looking for an enjoyable comedy, try this breaking-the-fourth-wall rebellious riot.",

But I didn't expect to see one of the few movies I'll watch over and over again my whole life!Many fellows have already told enough about the plot, so I can concentrate on my personal impressions. The film is simply about enjoying life and taking a day off sometimes to do just that, no matter what circumstances. Although the 1980s setting may seem a bit dated to some viewers today - as the very American setting is still a bit strange to viewers from other countries - the movie hasn't lost a bit of its actuality. It's pure fun, combined with unexpected twists and turns, a bit of wisdom and a genius cast. Matthew Broderick is in his best role ever, closely followed by his appearance in \"War Games\", and his teenage looks still make it nearly impossible for me to accept him in any of his later films (\"Hey, what's Ferris doing in that movie?\").To round it all up, the perfect choice of music makes this movie the outstanding work of director John Hughes, although all his other teenager films are real gems, too!To put it in a nutshell: If you are in your teens, don't ever miss that movie! But be careful, it may seriously affect your whole life!10/10 (and just a handful of movies get that from me!)",

The acting by all the characters is excellent and dialogues are also good. at the end i would quote from the movie that \" Life moves pretty fast,and if you don't stop and look around once in a while,you could miss it\".",

Mathew Broderick is legitimately excellent as the titular Ferris Bueller, a fun fourth-wall breaking character (almost like a semi-slacker predecessor to Wayne & Garth) who is just barely able to ride the line between being Endearing and being Smug.  A lot of this comes from the fact that, despite there is certainly a mild narcissistic element to Ferris' character, he is also almost obsessed with making those around him happy, and honestly, I think it's this facet to the main character that has given this film its longevity.  The rest of the Cast do well with their respective roles, albeit much of them are toned-down caricatures, however the infinitely-underappreciated Alan Ruck deserves some serious props as well, as his character largely lives in a self-induced misery (caused perhaps by some mild but genuine neuroses), however his story is actually one tinged with a soft, long-lasting sadness due to his parents' (unseen in the movie, a wise choice in my opinion) intense emotional distance from him, as well as from each other.  Alan Ruck's Cameron is, in a sense, the beating-heart of the film, bolstering Ferris' more empathetic side, and this allows the movie to feel a lot more endearing by the end than it otherwise would.  And for that, I do genuinely kinda love this movie -- It's breezy, it's fun, it's never mean-spirited (at least never intensely or for more than a few seconds), and it has a softer side that's genuinely welcome.",

Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American teen comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by John Hughes, and co-produced by Tom Jacobson. The film stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, a high-school slacker who skips school for a day in Chicago, with Mia Sara as his girlfriend Sloane Peterson and Alan Ruck who plays his best friend Cameron Fry. The movie is part of the 80s slap stick era of comedy with home made contraptions and close calls that followed the home alone franchise.\n\nThe films story is about ferris wanting one last ditch day with his friends. Ferris makes his parents and school believe he is really sick and soon rumors state the ferris needs a new kidney which has the repeated joke through out the movie which is the simple phrase \"Save Ferris\". Ferris's sister and principle dont believe that ferris is really sick and that he is ditching. The side stories then follow what the principle and Ferris's sister do to try and catch him while ditching.\n\nFront a technical aspect the movie is also pretty good. It Shows off the downtown chicago really well with shots taken in Sears tower and other skyscraper. It is a blast from the past showing chicago not chriraq as it has been known today. The other settings are really good for example ferris's house is actually in laguna beach and not chicago but unless you know architecture you wouldnt know. It is because of all of these reason i give the movie a 4.5/5",

Well, you're in luck because in the movie John Hudges and starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, we learn just that. Ferris Bueller wants a day off of school, so he comes up with a sophisticated plan to do just that. The problem is that he has been absent for many days, so his principal, Ed Rooney, played by Jefferey Jones, is on the hunt for Ferris and his friends for playing hookey for too long. Will he catch them? Will Ferris come up with yet another brilliant plan? Well, to answer that, you should wait and watch. \n\n\nI enjoyed the idea of Ferris Bueller about to be caught in almost every scene. I wanted how Ferris could've been caught. So many different times in the exact times if someone was looking. For example, when he is on the TV where the principal is sitting and sulking about not catching him. It makes the audience want to scream at the person for not seeing them. \n\n\nOverall, this movie is 8/5 marrons for me because of the constant action and comedy in these high schoolers' young lives. For anyone not watching or was hesitant to watch this movie, you should just watch it. It's a bunch of fun and exciting to see if he'll get caught or if he will get away with it or not.

The film was of a high schooler named Ferris Bueller, who took the day off of school. He was already getting away with not showing up to class and not getting caught with the many tricks he is skilled in. And he took his friend Cameron and girlfriend along to Chicago driving Cameron's dad's Ferrari. His principal was determined to try to catch him in the act because he knew of Ferris' tricks.\nThe single aspect that stood out to me was Ferris having Cameron tag along in his ideas. It was sad that Cameron was always worried to get caught. While Ferris would be having the time of his life. And that despite Cameron being worried he genuinely admires Ferris for not letting anything get in the way. I did think it was selfish of Ferris not to consider Cameron's feelings though he is always worried. It did show how easily manipulated Cameron is though he is aware of how Ferris is. \nThe quality of this movie was good. I would recommend this film to viewers like myself because it was a fun comedy film. I give it a five out of five stars. I enjoyed watching the ways Ferris has used his skills of not getting caught. And it was funny how Ferris always got his way when pretending to be someone else to get what he wanted. Also, it was interesting that everybody in the school believed Ferris was home and extremely ill.",

            "content": "Think back to when you were a teenager. Remember the times we all dreaded. Waking up in the morning at the crack of dawn only to get ready to sit in boredom in a classroom that took a chunk of your day. Now, imagine if you had the chance to skip a day and have it all to yourself. What would await you? Some dumb fun with friends or the consequences of your own actions. In the Film Ferris Bueller's Day Off It follows that exact scenario. The film was directed by John Hughes and released on June 11th, 1986, and it is considered one of the greats in 80s films. \n \nA single aspect in the film that really caught my eye was the acting, the Fourth Wall breaks to be specific. The film is very comedic, and someone can even say the comedic value is on par with Home Alone, but the comedic moments in Ferris Buellers are enhanced with these fourth wall breaks. Ferris who's played by Mathew Broderik is the only character who's able to break the Fourth Wall and he does it quite a lot in the film. The moments when he talks directly to the audience make him look like a cocky teenager who's able to bend the rules of his parents every time, while also giving the audience something to laugh at. \n \nMy overall reaction to the film was positive. I saw little to no downsides to the film and experienced nothing, but the dumb fun of a teenager's day off from school. Despite being from the 80s the film's comedy has not aged one bit. I believe anyone with a sense of humor is able to come watch this film and have no trouble having a good laugh. If I had to rate the movie out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5. I think it deserves a 4.5 because as a good movie for what it is despite being a fantastic film that can have people laughing and smiling it isn't something to write home about.",

They did a good job making it seem feasible that he would actually get caught at some point; there are plenty of movies with similarly untouchable protagonists where the movie doesn't achieve greatness because it's too obvious the good guy will win. I liked this on a personal level in that I was big on truancy in high school and made up a ton of excuses for it too, though I was never daring enough to really do anything with my newfound free time. However, my enjoyment was dampened a bit because I had learned long before watching this about Broderick killing two people with his car and then getting away with it shortly after filming this, so watching him cockily get away with everything here felt a bit weird.",

Matthew Broderick played Ferris, Alan Ruck played Cameron, and Mia Sara played Sloane. It got a best performance by an Actor in a motion picture in 1987.  This movie was funny, and it was the perfect length.   \n\n\tSo, at the beginning of the movie Ferris is in bed playing sick.  His sister knew what he was up to.  Then after his parents left for work, he called his best friend.  They prank called the school saying they were Sloanes father because they wanted to get her out of school. They went out to lunch and drove around in Cameron's dad's car. When they were skipping school principal Rooney was trying to catch them and stop his shenanigans.  But he could never catch them, Ferris was too smart for the principal.  Cameron needed to get out of his shell and stop being scared of his dad, Ferris convinced Cameron to steal his dad's car. The movie ends and they didn't get caught. \n\nIt was funny when Ferris was on the parade float. While he was on the float, he was singing and dancing. His dad was in the building next to the parade float and didn't know it was Ferris. It was funny because the dad should know what his kid looked like. I liked that everyone started singing and dancing with Ferris. \n\nAnother scene I like was when they stole Cameron's dad's car and they put extra miles and it.  They were trying to roll the miles back so Cameron's dad couldn't catch him.  Cameron started beating up his dad's car because he was sick of his dad controlling him.  It was funny but cringe-worthy because he ruined the from bumper then it started rolling backwards and broke through the garage wall and fell about 30 feet.   \n\nI think you all should watch the movie, it is interesting. The movie is a perfect length, one hour and 13 minutes long and it took place in Chicago. This movie gives the lesson to not skip school to not get into trouble.",

I didn't know what the heck that meant and eventually found out who he was and watched the movie.\n\nThis is the movie where Matthew Broderick famously breaks the fourth wall. Making comments and giving looks directly to the audience. It's a funny gag, there's even an post-credits scene where he approaches the camera asking why the audience is /still/ there and tells them to go home. While I did watch this movie in my house, the line did get a couple chuckles out of me. The premise is incredibly simple: teen gets friends together, skips school, and causes shenanigans throughout the city while a skeptical principal (Jeffrey Jones) pursues him. Oh right! The dynamic between the principal as well as Bueller's sister (played by Dirty Dancing actress Jennifer Grey) and Ferris creates some of the funniest moments. It's a cat and mouse game, like Tom And Jerry, between them and is incredibly entertaining to watch.\n\nNow I know this will sound iffy, but Ferris Bueller is and can be a positive role model, just depends on how you look at it. Yes he cuts school and makes risky decisions throughout, but it's all in good fun. And for those of us like Cameron Fry, sometimes we need to just let loose and have fun every now and again. Like Bueller famously says to the camera: \"Life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is a comedic classic written and directed by the late 80's icon John Hughes. It's one of those movies that provides something for everyone and this is indeed a feel-good movie. While there's a little bit of language, it's not too bad.",

The development of the character of Ferrie's friend (I don't remember his name, oups) is awesome and you see that for his age, he has no pleasure and that is what Ferrie gives him. Pleasure. They just want to have fun before it is too late and we have fun with them. It is a strongly communicative film that makes the audience developed a sort of link with the young trio.

Alan Rucks character gets a very well realized character arc in this film and it feels very earned and you care about him, he works with Broderick very well and you feel like they really are friends.

It is not until the 3rd act that he becomes a 3 dimensional character, and we begin to understand him, and realize he is not the sociopath we might have assumed he is. While is seems he does all the things he does for his own pleasure, it becomes clear in the last 20 minutes he was really doing it for his friend. At the beginning of the movie, Cameron is timid, constantly worried, and unsure of himself.  We learn his parents argue, and his dad neglects him, and would rather work on his Ferrari instead of spend time with hi son. Throughout the movie, Ferris tries to boost his friends self-esteem, and by the end he has succeeded. His friend is a completely different person, and most of the major characters are, notably his sister. However, Ferris doesn't seem to change at all. He helps his friends become a better people, but in doing so, he isn't changing at all.",

Now 1st Off, I Admire John Hughes' Writing In \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) & Such, & Even Though I'm Not A Matthew Broderick Fan, But In THIS Flick, He's Actually Likeable & Funny; He Has Some Charm & Cleverness, 2 Things You Wouldn't Expect Out Of An Actor Like Him. Now With Broderick Aside, The Writing By Hughes Is Funny, Clever, & Full Of Both \"Holy Fuck!\" Moments & Incoming Surprises.\n\nSome Elements I Feel Must Have Inspired John Hughes To Write \"Home Alone\" (1990) A Few Years Later. Specifically In The Scenes Where We See The Traps Ferris Set Up At His House. The Film Uses 1 Breaking-The-4th-Wall Joke By Having Ferris Talking To The Audience & The Film Doesn't Let That Go Too Far To When It Becomes Annoying. Ferris' Sister, Jeanie Bueller, Played By The Gorgeous Jennifer Grey Of \"Dirty Dancing\" (1987), Kinda Reminds Me Of Candace From The Disney Show \"Phineas & Ferb\", Just By How She Tries To Deduce Her Brother's Lies Just As Much As His Principal, Edward Rooney, Played By Jeffery Jones, Is! And How Jeanie Learns Her Lesson To Not Care So Much About Ferris From The Ruffian At The Police Station, Quickly Becoming His Girlfriend, Haha, It's A Good Lesson For Siblings In Families To Not Worry About What Goes On In The Other's Life.\n\nAs A Whole, The Film Seems To Present Itself As The Jack-In-The-Box Of Teenage Road-Trip Comedies: There's Several Surprises Sprinkled In The Least-Expected Moments. Not As Deep As Something Like \"The Breakfast Club\", But \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" Has A Creative Story That Just Wants You To Come Along With Our Main Trio & Enjoy Their Day Off With Them. I'd Say This '80s Classic Is Definitely Worth 103 Minutes Of Your Time.",

This movie encapsulates the teenage dream, even 34 years after its release. Matthew Brodrick as Ferris Bueller, Mia Sara as his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, and Alan Ruck as his best friend Cameron Frye, are all talented and encapsulate their roles excellently, though they are over aged for these roles. Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney and Jennifer Grey as Jeanie Bueller both do fantastic jobs of epitomizing the insanity of stiff-necked individuals trying to catch a teenager in a lie that only hurts themselves. Ferris, Jeanie, and Rooney's plot lines are masterfully woven together in the end, leading to chapter development for Jeanie and Cameron, even over just a single day. Ferris asks big life questions, leading the audience down similar roads. Overall, this movie can be just about anything you want it to be? A comedy? Check! A fun movie leading to an existential crisis? Also check!",

            "content": "A film as beloved as this one has had so much said about it but I think what it comes down to is that this is an extremely entertaining diversion. It is hardly meaningful and it is not the meaningful paean about self discovery that some believe it to be but it features a great soundtrack, a genius central performance and some beautifully choreographed shots. Few films have made a city look as wonderful as this film makes Chicago appear and as they move through all of the famous tourist sites we realize that we are watching a very well packaged, glossy travelogue. All of this makes the film worth watching and when you want to relax and not put yourself through the emotional strain of Ship of Fools (1965) or Room at the Top (1959).\n\nSmug high school student Ferris Bueller, Matthew Broderick, regularly fakes being sick so he can take a day off school and spend his time with his girlfriend Sloane Peterson, Mia Sara, and emotionally traumatized best friend Cameron Frye, Alan Ruck. This angers his sister Jeanie, Jennifer Grey, who does not break the rules like he does and she wants to see him punished for his actions. Bueller maneuvers to get his girlfriend out of school by pretending to be her father and incurs the wrath of school principal Mr. Rooney, Jeffrey Jones, who tries to track him down throughout the day. Bueller has more of a struggle getting Frye to come with him as he is afraid of even leaving his house and as Bueller wants to use his father's Ferrari which he worries his father will learn about it takes a lot of cajoling to get him to tag along with them. They travel through Chicago and enjoy themselves but at the end of the day they are all almost caught out.\n\nThe fun of the film comes in seeing a figure, a teenager, who is usually in a position where authority figures like his parents and schoolteachers control him is able to manipulate the system to gain freedom. He is smug and taunts those around him about the way that he has succeeded but at heart he does love his girlfriend and best friend and just wants to show them a good time. This is how most teenagers feel and the idea that you could actually control your own life and have fun doing it is appealing to hormonal, angst filled people. The villains in the film are also appropriately caricatured as his parents are politically conservative pushovers and the school principal is the sort of stickler for the rules that we all dislike. His girlfriend is a little too perfect as she is one of those \n\u2018cool' girls that male screenwriters love but this is a minor complaint as Hughes has written female characters with far less depth who face even more abusive treatment from the men around them.\n\nThe one part of the film that I did not like was the relationship that Frye has with his father and it is implied that he is overbearing and controlling but the film applies too much meaning to the idea of defiance. The climactic scene in which he pushes his father's Ferrari through the glass window and out into a ravine annoyed me as the film presents destroying an object valuable to your parents as the correct response to feelings of anger and resentment towards them. To have had Frye actually talk to his father or properly discuss his feelings about him to set up why he is so angry at him and would go to such lengths to attract his attention. I assume that there were a few extra scenes cut out of the film that would have done more to make this scene more poignant and understandable. I wanted to get into this part of the film as Frye is enigmatic at the beginning of the film and we are invested in his coming out of his shell but when the film tries to develop his backstory it fails to put us in his mindset.\n\nYou really will love the experience of watching this film even though it is flawed in developing some of the characters.",

Secondly, in this film  the characters have so much depth and development especially Cameron who gets the most development in the film, he starts off as a person who worries about everything and with Feris and Sloane's help he changes into a more relaxed person who is ready for college [university]. Ferris and Sloane are also great characters in the film. Finally, the comedy in this film is one of the best in the 80s with some of best jokes and lines in film history. In conclusion l have always loved this film and always film it was one of the film I saw and thought yeah that was great. As I grow and will see some of the flaws I will always see past them as I think of this film as one of the best of all time.",

The film was directed by John Hughes, and stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller and Alan Ruck as Cameron Frye.\n\nThe story follows Ferris Bueller a teenager who decides to skip a day off school. The story I found to be very strong and really enjoyable, especially once you hit the second act of the film.\n\nIn most films about teenagers the actors never feel like teenagers, but luckily for Ferris Bueller's Day Off the actors actually feel like the\ncharacters their playing. The acting in my opinion was strong and very believable.\n\nThe characters are some of the most memorable that I've seen from a comedy in recent years, from how well they were portrayed to how much of a blast they were to watch on the big screen.\n\nThe cinematography was sound, with some very good shots of the characters and scenery, but nothing too spectacular.\n\nThe sets and costumes were also very strong, from Ferris Bueller's bedroom design to his and his friends iconic and stylish outfits.\n\nThe style of the film I personally really liked, from the coming of age feel to the fun and inventive fourth wall breaking. \n\nThe film did also have some really quotable and memorable dialogue, from both the students and teachers.  \n\nThe comedy in my opinion is some of the greatest ever put to film, from the great fourth wall braking to the extremely funny Jeffrey Jones as Ed Rooney.\n\nIn my opinion Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the most enjoyable films that I've ever seen, and I can't wait to watch it all over again.\n\nOver all I give it a\n9/10\n\n\"Anyone\"",

From admiring paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago to commandeering a parade float to perform in front of an almost magically absurd crowd - all while bending the laws of coincidence - this will be one day our three teenage heroes never forget.\n\nJohn Hughes is the ultimate progenitor of exploring teen angst in cinema and \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is just one more in a string of classic comedies (including the oft-overlooked \"Sixteen Candles\" and the legendary malcontent manifesto \"The Breakfast Club\") that stood head-and-shoulders above their contemporaries. Hughes was note-perfect at writing incisive dialogue suited to the varied styles of his teenage protagonists while penetrating the very heart of human nature at the same time. It helps that Hughes always had stellar casts to work with.\n\nThe fourth-wall-breaking performance of Matthew Broderick is one of the best the Eighties ever saw and Broderick's on screen chemistry with Alan Ruck is convincing enough to make the viewer believe these two have been playing off of each other since kindergarten. Jeffrey Jones is a deliciously devilish amalgamation of high school principles while Jennifer Grey does her part as Bueller's sister who simply wants to escape the shadow of her spotlight-stealing brother and find a little recognition of her own. Even Charlie Sheen is on point doing his best Judd Nelson impersonation. \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" is a great example of the kind of heartwarming mischievousness from a more innocent age that we will probably never witness again on the silver screen.",

It's a blast of fourth wall breaks, Chicago sight seeing, and gallivanting with your pals.\n\nJohn Hughes wrote and directed this pleasant trip with a nod to films like womanizing romance comedy films like Alfie (1966), which also broke the 4th wall to coming of age risque movies such as Risky Business (1983). It takes the romancing teenager with clever wit and poignant commentary on the social lives of suburban Americans. I found Cameron's monologue about his father's love to be even more biting than ever. Hughes had a knack for realistic dialogue from kids, while always trying to find the humor in odd situations. His direction goes from nice slow panning shots to blistering tracking shots and neat jump cuts between faces. This is Hughes on full steam ahead to nonsense and silly entertainment.\n\nMatthew Broderick was the man after this film. His effortless charm and easy going attitude as Ferris Bueller taught us all to relax and appreciate the finer things in life a bit more. He is cool personified, even while being a truant miscreant of the highest caliber.\n\nHis friends Cameron and Sloane are really interesting unto themselves. Alan Ruck is hilarious as the dour and sickly Cameron. His nervous gasps and incessant hollering about his father's demands is so charming and relatable that Ruck may often steal the show from Broderick, especially towards the second half of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. His big monologue ranting about his father's expectations, wishes, and car is something to behold. He demonstrates not only a comedic talent, but convincing dramatic appeal as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Mia Sara is pretty generic and dull as Sloane. She is certainly pretty, but seems so lifeless compared to the two main boys. While her acting is flat, Jennifer Grey's is so dynamic! Grey is very funny and sympathetic as Ferris' sister Jean. She gives passionate speeches and underhanded comments throughout that always make me smile. Her indignant moaning about Ferris getting away with everything is so funny to me still.\n\nEven Charlie Sheen makes a cameo in the police station putting on his best James Dean from Rebel Without a Cause to funny results. His snark and causal matter of fact delivery to Grey's character remains as funny and strange as ever.\n\nLastly, Jeffrey Jones is great as the stuffy principal, chasing down Ferris, with goofy results. While he is over the top, you could argue the whole movie takes on a life of its own with ridiculous bits that you will just have to go along with and believe. It's more about the adventure of spending time with your friends than just buying into the nihilism of caring that Ferris spews at you.\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is one of John Hughes' finest achievements, regardless of how well its themes, cast, and situations have aged. I think this will always be a fun movie despite the campy tone and too silly slap stick bits. It is great for an afternoon watch, so long as you are not rooting for Ferris to fail. Just go along with the ride and you'll have a good time.",

John Hughes created a lot of the teenage angst or coming of age films in the 80s and Ferris was quite possibly his greatest creation. Watching this on the big screen last night was a dream come true, but having a film like this remaining so timeless does not hurt. The film is full of heart and the charm of Matthew Broderick is what elevates this from becoming just your average teenage comedy. I wish they would make more fun and creative films like this, no one tackles such a fun concept without falling into cliches and crude jokes.

The script that tells of the acts of rebellion of Ferris Bueller is opposed to the depression of cameron, the pair, along with the girlfriend of Ferris embarks on a journey of fun, after they leave class, in search of amusement and to enjoy life, but between these intervals each one understands a little more about life and about oneself. John Hughes is a director who knows how to talk and broadcast the dramas and yearnings of youth like no one, always dressed in comedy, his films take all audiences and always preach the philosophy of total entertainment, from beginning to end (not stopping even in the credits) , but John also uses his communication skills to talk to his audience (even though the feature of the breakdown of the fourth wall is widely used here), John creates a film of three characters discovering themselves, but of an emphasis mainly on Cameron , he is the character who understands his purpose and makes the biggest break of rupture of the film, the whole movie is based on trying to enter his mind and understand his personality -Vide the scene of the pictures- he is the real protagonist of the film, and John deserves all our respect for including all this layer on the long and cover of fun and comedy. But in addition to that, the feature has a wonderful technical direction, camera angles and cuts of the film are surgical, in addition to those against flat and long plans, not to mention the richness of screen compositions and costumes, and the striking soundtrack, speaking in remarkable things, we can not forget Mattehew Broderick, who plays the role of his life, although all the actors are great in their roles. Lastly, \"Enjoying the Sweet Life\" is a film that transcends generations with fun, good humor and intelligence.",

How innocent, generous & upbeat cheerful he was. How he was smart enough to find a solution for every situation that had or could go wrong. I don't think there are any other teen comedies either in the 80's or beyond that has a character like this. Definitely not in the 90's or 2000's. \nLife, as Ferris famously remarks, moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around, you might miss it.

Not only is this possible John Hughes' funniest feature to date, but there's plenty of heart to be found underneath all the giggles.\n\nFerris, one of the biggest procrastinators in film history, decides to take a day off from school and suggests/forces his closest friends do the same.  What follows is just about the most ridiculously funny high school films to date.  Pulling your parents leg about being sick is one thing, but convincing the entire city of Chicago that you're nearly on your death bed when you're actually singing Twist and Shout in the middle of a parade?  That's another thing entirely.\n\nYes, seeing a principle go to the lengths that Ed Rooney does to take Ferris down is a bit silly.  But when you have a talent like Jeffrey Jones to work with, you have to take advantage of all the physical comedy chances you have.  But speaking of talent, no one could have played Ferris better than Matthew Broderick.  If you don't buy into Ferris breaking the fourth wall within the first minute or so of the film, than the entire story won't work.  But with Broderick's charismatic charm, you buy into every second of it.  \n\nIt's like a great 90's action film, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It knows that most parents wouldn't actually buy into Ferris' \"sickness\", or that he could impersonate a well-known Chicagoan to get into a restaurant, or even lead a parade, but the film exploits every one of these situations.  They take every chance they get in creating a ridiculously humorous moment.  \n\nIt's not going to blow your socks away with a realistically dramatic take on high school or real-life problems (though some are certainly touched upon), but it is a timeless tale of procrastination during youth, and the great lengths that one could go to make their day extraordinary.  The imagination is strong here.\n\n+So ridiculous\n\n+Only works if Broderick is as good as he is\n\n+Fast paced with another laugh just around the corner\n\n8.8/10",

Ferris is the quintessential popular kid who seems to always get what he wants.  He is hedonistic, charming, smart, and consistently does two things to manipulate others:  first, he tells people what they want to hear, and second, he makes and carries out elaborate plans to trick them.  Ferris begins this day by making his parents believe that he is sick.  This is something to which everyone can relate.  Ferris, however, takes it to the next level by making a contraption that will snore when his bedroom door is opened. This way, if his mom checks on him, she will think he is sound asleep.  This is only one of several schemes that he puts in motion to make others believe he is home sick.  After his family leaves the house he invites some friends to join him.  He convinces his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), who is a hypochondriac, to get out of bed and join him for the day.  Ferris then concocts a plan to get his girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school.  This is accomplished with a phone call to the school's dean of students claiming there has been a death in her family.  Sloane is a pretty girl that would never miss an opportunity to spend a day away from school with Ferris.  He then convinces Cameron to take Cameron's dad's stunning red Ferrari so they can travel to downtown Chicago in style.\n\nAfter the three friends arrive in downtown Chicago, they park the precious vehicle in a garage and begin their adventures.  They experience fine dining, professional baseball, and an art museum.  Ferris even sings in a parade.  While all of this is taking place, Ferris's jealous sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who knows that he is faking, is doing whatever it takes to make sure Ferris is caught and exposed as the lying faker that he is.  The dean of students at the school is also onto Ferris and will go to extremes to make sure Ferris gets to enjoy a fifth year of high school.  \n\nThis day off from school is not just fun and games.  The audience really gets to see the development of Cameron's character.  He is transformed by the end of the day.  Plus, the movie utilizes a style of acting in which the fourth wall is broken.  In other words, Ferris looks right at the camera and talks directly to the audience.  There is no separation, or wall, between the actor and audience.  This helps you feel like you are friends with Ferris Bueller and that you too are enjoying the day off with him, Cameron and Sloane.\n\nOverall the movie is lighthearted and enjoyable to watch.  As stated by Ferris Bueller himself,  \" Life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.\"",

Films like: Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Pretty in Pink, Home Alone, almost all the National Lampoon films, and The Breakfast Club. That and so many are just some of the  films he's wrote/directed for that have not only have been home names today but also resonated with a lot of people growing up in the mid 70's and 80's. And while he sadly took a dark path of terrible films to follow afterwards, i thought it be best to look at his more famous film to date: \" Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" Yet another film along with countless other well know films that i haven't gotten to see till now. And, a bit to my surprise, i was luck enough to enjoy the film for what it was: Classic 80's being young and enjoying life. Basically John Hughes being John Hughes. And yes while i did kind of mind some of the uncanny coincidences that did occur here and there and the already overused story line that countless other films payed homage to, these are just VERY cynical nitpicks that overall don't break the film at all. Because like i said, i was able to enjoy the premise a lot to just sit back and just enjoy John Hughes doing his thing. Great things such as: A very well done and surprisingly charismatic performance by the young Matthew Broderick before doing Godzilla 98 (yeah him in that was....awful.), a very simple but yet entertaining premise, good performances overall from the whole cast, great jokes both from the slapstick and constant fourth wall breaking, and was overall just a fun film to enjoy. And yes it is great, but the film then gives me a sense of sadness as to how John Hughes goes from making cult-classics for over 20 years and before passing made....Flubber and Baby's Day Out. *Sigh* Who knows for sure. Still a great film though.",

Like with The Breakfast Club (1985), Hughes has created a charming, and fun teen comedy that still holds up incredibly well today. One of my favourite films!",

Chicago never looked better thanks to it's beautiful skyline shots, it's incorporation of the great number of landmarks and (of course) the parade scene. Fun fact, this movie was one of the first films to incorporate an after credits scene and that scene in question, was the inspiration for the after credits scene in Deadpool (2016).

I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy because the humor was enjoyable and the main characters, very likeable. \n \nThroughout the film, Ferris Bueller is trying to make the best out of the last day of school he feels he can get away with skipping. He fakes sick, gets is best friend to help him get his girlfriend out of school, \"borrows\" a Ferrari, and attends a parade among other things, all the while dodging the pursuit of his principal and avoiding running across his parents, and bringing humor to the table. \n \nOne thing that really worked was how Ferris addressed the audience with humor. This breaking the fourth wall is a unique thing that really works in this film. Matthew Broderick's charm and the time he acts like a baby in front of his parents makes you like him right away. The misfortune of Principal Rooney throughout the movie also adds to the humor.  \n \nThe movie is worth the watch if you have the time. Expect an awesome performance from Matthew Broderick.",

It's actually amazing that I enjoy this film, because high school was not a happy-go-lucky time for me, but the brilliance of this movie is that the carefree Ferris really isn't the most important character in the film. It's the story of Cameron that really makes this movie shine, and made it an emotional touch-point for a generation. He is the change character, and the one that many people (like me) can connect with so closely. While I find Ferris' antics silly, and occasionally hilarious, the movie has heart because we see Cameron learning how to grow up. The other character who experiences growth in the film is Jeanie, and her story is also handled brilliantly. I like how Charlie Sheen actually teaches her the pointless nature of jealousy, and simultaneously teaches us as well. I could go on for hours just detailing all the things I love about this movie, because every single scene works for me. It has funny parts, it has dramatic parts, and it has emotional parts. The total package is a movie that I can watch any time and it actually makes me nostalgic for those days. I wonder if the movie would be as engaging for teens of this generation, or if so many of us connect with it merely because it was such a product of the 1980s. I'd recommend it to anyone because I love the movie, but I have a feeling only those of us who saw it when we were in high school will form that same emotional connection.",

With the help of his best friend played by Alan Ruck and his girlfriend who is played by Mia Sara, they plan the perfect day off full of activities. However, they have to stay alert, there are people out there that would like to see them in trouble such as the slightly crazy dean of students. Along the way the trio will learn all about the city of Chicago and about themselves.\n\nThis fantastic movie not only has everything you would expect from a funny movie and don't forget a little romance, but it also has many lessons that a growing teenager should have and others that are probably things (such as learning how to fake an illness to get out of school) that parent could do without. However, overall the good lessons far outweigh the bad ones making this movie a great influence for your young teen.

As for the jokes, the scene where Rooney is informed that Ferris is on line 2 (prompting him to have a facial expression that just screams \"Oh, crap\") and the scene where the nurse is about to say \"I'm the nurse to likes to f---\" but gets the door slammed in her face right before she can say the last word are both hilarious. As for writing, it's very quotable. Just look at the quotes that are on here. Finally, the plot. Ferris fakes sick to his parents, and as soon as they leave, he takes an eponymous day off.

I will admit, this film promotes skiving school way to much and little emphasis is put on the repocusions of doing so, however it is too busy giving us a glimpse of what life is actually about, that every child had nothing to fear, its a big bad world and all you have to do is just grab onto it and shake it for all its worth. Ferris decides to hatch a plan to skive off school one morning, after twisting his parents into his web of deciet, he then manages to enlist Cameron, his best friend and Sloane his girlfriend, to bunk off of school with him, so they can spend 1 day living it up, before school ends and their youth is spoiled. It's played totally tongue and cheek and all for the better, the cast is chalk full of 80's goodness but Matthew Broderick is clearly the captain of this ship. What i love about this film, is not its ability to be hilariously funny or even a non stop thrill ride, it actually has some deep and meaningful undertones running in its veins, The character of Cameron for example, so tortured by his fathers love for his car more than his own son, resonates with how bad parenting can effect a human. Also Ferris Bueller shows how mundaine and unexciting some teachers tend to teach their students, with monotone voices and patronising tones, while Ferris and co are out living life to the full, pulling pranks, looking at art and contimplating life in general. Their is an innocence about it that just charms the entire way through. It also has a Charlie Sheen cameo to die for. It is full on 80's cheese and completely of its time, but for people of that generation, it is pretty hard not to fall in love with Ferris Bueller.",

But here we're with him only for a day - precisely a day when he decides to skip school (again) and make a big day out of a potentially big day.\n\nBroderick was a really brilliant Bueller. He's as captivating, energic, spontaneous and sympathetic as demanded by the role. If you don't keep this movie in your heart after watching it, at least Bueller you will remember with some inner joy.\n\nDo you know when you want to say the most obvious thing because you think it's too important, but it's been said for ages? Ferris Bueller's Day Off has that challenge accepted. The point is simple: LIVE your life. Ok, but HOW can you make that be any good or fresh to audience? Bueller's got it on lock.\n\nTo bring out its message, the movie picks up some cool creative ideas. I point out Bueller's dialog with camera to establish a conversation with us and the film direction (paternal pamper, musical takes, road takes).\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off doesn't have a super-original message to give you. But it finds its own way to make it sound fresh enough for you to like it and keep it as a reference for its rank.",

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller\" has its moments, and most of the best ones are of its own making. The much greater number of moments that don't work are a mix of atonal original content and otiose memes of better films.\n\nAlmost immediately, Ferris sets the movie outside the bounds of realism by talking to the camera. The technique suits Matthew Broderick's characteristic sense of detachment from the process of acting, his ability to exist on screen without seeming to even try to act but without seeming at all natural either. The cold eyes and feces-eating grin that accompany his verbal asides, though, give the impression that something more is going on in the film than whimsy. There is a darkness-not exactly a darkness, but a kind of menacing quality to the movie, as though it were a prank, and the audience is forever suspended in the instant of dawning horror and appreciation. It as as if John Hughes and a real-life Ferris Bueller are out joyriding in our cars while we are trying to figure out what we are watching, and realizing that it is both a joke for us and a joke on us.\n\nThe laugh-out-loud bits are played fairly straight. Ben Stein's steady drone in front of catatonic students. Charlie Sheen's cameo in which \"drugs\" is an inevitable but perfectly-timed punchline. The cheery profanity of a seemingly old-fashioned school secretary. A glorious song and dance number in the middle of the movie fills the streets of Chicago with color, and the spectacle seems as rich with directorial intent as it is with pure exuberance. John Hughes' placement of WASP city fathers on one side of the street, the ethnic European element of the city in the center, and the black community on the other side is undoubtedly conscious, and is appropriate for Chicago. There is probably no attempt at a social message here; it is part of the movie's non-judgmental celebration of the Windy City, and to portray the city as integrated would have been false.\n\nA gawking fixation on Chicago adds to the sense that there is a movie going on beneath the movie, because there is no way that a kid like Ferris would choose this itinerary for his dream day. The Sears Tower? It's only for tourists. The Art Institute and its collection of 19th and 20th century masterpieces? Please. A black tie restaurant? I'd expect a real teenager to prefer deep-dish pizza and brats. Maybe the secret to understanding Ferris is that he's having the dream day that adults wish they had had, but only if they had known then what they know now.\n\nBut if Ferris is such a figure of fantasy, and so above the movie, why does Hughes burden him and his friends with the serious suburban anxieties that some people decades later derisively dub \"affluenza\"? Hughes had covered that ground very well in \"The Breakfast Club,\" a film whose kids are much more real. In this movie, with its cultivated sense of superiority and apathy, the periodic downshift produces whiplash and slows the pace to an intolerable crawl. Alan Ruck is a good actor, but his best friend character is designed to be a drag and succeeds at it better than intended. Mia Sara's idealized, sexualized girlfriend character is a drag, too, because she has so much less mold-breaking individuality than Ally Sheedy and Molly Ringwold had brought to their earlier collaborations with John Hughes and Matthew Broderick.\n\nYet \"Ferris Bueller\" prefigures 21st-century entertainment in a way that the thoroughly dated brat pack films do not. Its use of antihumor, wherein a joke is held in abeyance for a long time while anticipation builds, and in which the big payoff is often understated, paved the way for postmodern high school comedies like \"Napoleon Dynamite.\" This approach to humor is best exemplified by the additional content that plays during the movie's closing credits. Such stingers are rarely seen before \"Ferris Bueller\" but became a staple of the genre afterward. Instead of using 80s hits, the movie's musical cues are more timeless, like John Lennon and the theme from \"Star Wars.\" Frequently, though, its pop culture references feel arbitrary and meaningless. Why bring \"Alien\" or Wayne Newton into this? They're drawn from a hat, like a \"Family Guy\" joke or an internet gif. Like them, the uneven \"Ferris Bueller\" is sometimes funny, sometimes obnoxious, and sometimes just puzzling.",

The two of them come up with an elaborate plan to get Ferris's girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) out of school and in on their day of fun.  They need principle Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) to believe that Sloane's dad is picking her up from school so they take Cameron's father's precious Ferrari for transportation.  After they pick up Sloane they start their crazy fun filled day all the while, the principal Ed Rooney is determined to prove Ferris is faking his illness and Ferris's agitated sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) also has a goal to catch Ferris off guard.   The gang all enjoy their day off from school that is until they realize that there is a lot more mileage on the Ferrari than there should be and Cameron loses it.\n\n \n\nbucketlist\n\n \n\nFerris and his friends did so much, its crazy how they actually fit it all into just one work day.  Watching there were so many times where you thought they were definitely going to get caught because his parent's either saw him or were right there next to him.  The best scene in this film had to be when Ferris and Cameron set up to get Sloane out of school.  Getting principle Rooney to believe that it was actually her dad calling was genius, Cameron calling as the dad and using a fake voice to make it sound like him was just another clever trick that Ferris had up his sleeve to fool the Principle, not to mention they made sure that any number that he called was covered so he couldn't confirm that Ferris was lying.  After they get out of school they start their fun filled day that involved going to a museum, a high class restaurant, a baseball game, even watch a parade.  The restaurant scene was classic because it showed again how clever Ferris was as he convinced the host that he was someone that he wasn't.  Things get intense for them though when they decide to go home and they realize that the car has twice the miles on it that it did when they left.  That is when Cameron loses it and they have to figure out what to do to make it seem like today never happened.\n\nOverall I would give this film a B-.  I do believe that it was an amazing film and a classic but one thing just bothered me the whole movie, I really don't think that it would be possible to get everything that they did done in the time frame that they had.  Especially since they had to also drive around town eventual time would have caught up to them and some of the stuff they would not have been able to do.  Other than that it was a good movie and one worth watching.",

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"  While it's a great message, I don't think you need to be a school-dodging high school senior with money \"borrowing\" a 1961 Ferrari from a friend's Dad without the Dad knowing it and engaging in loads of other mischievous behavior (not that all mischief is a bad thing.)\nDespite all that, it was still enjoyable.",

            "content": "\"A high school wise guy is determined to have a day off from school, despite of what the principal thinks of that\" (IMDb). Yes, I'm talking about Director John Hughes greatest creation, Ferris Beuller's Day off. Bringing in over six million dollars during opening weekend, Ferris Beuller's Day Off dominated theaters. Since June 11, 1986 we still can't get enough of this humorous, relatable, and alluding film. With an enjoyed audience percentage of ninety two on Rotten Tomatoes, Ferris Beuller was THE movie.\n\"Teenaged Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a legend in his own time thanks to his uncanny skill at cutting classes and getting away with it\" (Rotten Tomatoes).  Ferris is not only the big man in school, a consistent ditcher, and sneaky. Ferris Beuller is hilarious. Between finessing his oblivious parents, annoying his sister, pressuring his pessimistic best friend, and getting under the principals skin. From the Economics teacher not recognizing his name, resulting in the famous line \" Beuller? Beuller?\" (IMDb). From stealing the Ferrari of his best friend's father, to getting it stolen by parking attendants. From his amazing lip- syncing rendition of \"Twist and Shout\" during a parade to running through backyards of the neighborhood to beat his parents home.  His humor, sarcasm, and witty comments made each scene ten times better. Ferris Beullers day off has you laughing from beginning to end. \nFerris Beullers day off is relatable to every teenager. Nina Darnton states that, \"Mr. Hughes is at his best in creating the nitty-gritty realism of the teen-age world, dealing with problems that really bother them: groups, parents, pressure, self-definition, much as Judy Blume does in her best-selling books\" (Darnton, New York Times). This film portrays the oblivious, push-over, fun loving parents. Mr. & Mrs. Beuller easily fell for Ferris's \"cough cough, I'm sick mommy\" scheme. A scheme we've all pulled on our parents yet didn't go on such an adventure as Ferris did. Ferris Beuller didn't exactly give into peer pressure. Ferris was the peer pressure. It's not every day your friend pressures you into taking your dads three hundred thousand dollar car to go on an adventure in Chicago. Cameron, the best friend, was seen as giving into peer pressure throughout his day with Ferris. Some saw that his decisions were solely based around Ferris, as others saw Cameron as finding himself through these decisions.  Self- definition is also a big pressure portrayed in this film.  Throughout this film, Cameron and Ferris are finding themselves through this adventure. Hoping this would be his final game of hooky; Ferris just wants to be relieved of all the pressures of school and finding himself after he graduates.  Ferris Beullers day off is not only humorous, but relatable for teenagers. We all just need to escape every once in a while.\nFerris Beullers Day Off is alluding and a little inspiring to us onlookers. Haflidason states, \"Matthew Broderick takes the type of day off that all of us aspire to but somehow never quite replicate in this famous 80s comedy\" (Haflidason, BBC). It's a movie that makes you think about your life, wishes, and regrets. Like Haflidason said, Ferris had a day we all fantasize over. Setting everything aside, he just wanted to feel alive this one last time with his best friend and beautiful girlfriend. Many viewer reviews agreed that not only teenagers but also adults could learn something from Ferris. Most of us teenagers are too busy studying, reading chapters, freaking out over exams, and drowning in energy drinks. The film alludes that everyone needs to live every now and then. A day from school to explore your local cities may be the little adventure you need to stay sane. Like Ferris himself said in the film, \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it\" (IMDb.)\n\tWhat is a great movie without Humor? Laughing from beginning to end, Ferris Beulllers Day Off was a crowd pleasing movie. Its humor may have played a big part in drawing the audience, but it's relatable scenarios won over the audience. Teenagers indulging worldwide will be able to relate to the pressures Ferris wanted to escape. Describing the day many wish they could live, Beuller alludes that we all stop, bask, and enjoy our lives. Given eight stars out of ten, Ferris Beullers Day Off was marvelous.",

            "content": "After watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off, my opinion of it is very similar to Groundhog Day. It's a good, well written fun comedy that doesn't need to be taken seriously. The story is straight forward and takes place within just 1 day, meaning that there is not much to take in. The film plays out with a good pace with it only slowing down slightly before it reaches the final lot of scenes. The film shouldn't be taken seriously with some over the top scenes, but that's the style John Hughes decides to showcase his story as the focused more on the teenagers rather than the parents. \nOther than the script, it is the selection of actors cast in the roles that keeps the film flowing. Matthew Broderick in one of his early roles creates one of his best roles and the lesser known Alan Ruck brings a fun character to his scenes. If i had to be disappointed in anyone's character then it would have to be Jennifer Grey. I'm not saying she was bad, but I just didn't really enjoy the character too much and felt some of her lines could have been toned down in performance. There is also a nice small appearance from Charlie Sheen that is quite ironic when knowing about his personal problems. However, I felt the highlight of the film belonged to Jeffrey Jones as the Principal. Some of the best scenes and lines were from his character and I would have loved more of him featured.\nFound in many favourite film lists, Ferris Bueller really does gives you a movie worth sitting back and enjoying.",

But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.\n\nMy problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.\n\nFirst let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.\n\nNow let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",

            "content": "I appreciate the irony in the fact that after this film, Matthew Broderick, as far as we knew, was the only one in this film who didn't get a day off, because everyone else in this film seemed to all but fall off the radar, which is surprising, considering the impact that this film had on a lot of young folks. Yeah, nothing says, \"coming-of-age film\" quite like skipping out on responsibilities, kids. Yeah, an education is pretty important in life, too, although I am all for youths embracing life in all of its glory, especially if their revelatory adventure makes Chicago look a little less scary. People, we all knew that John Hughes loved Chicago, but wow, this is about as much as love letter to Chicago as it is a love letter to youth spirit, which I suppose makes it the definitive John Hughes film. Not unlike youth, you've got to embrace this film while you can, because after this, Hughes took himself a break from coming-of-age films and started making movies about grown-ups and stuff. I can't believe Ferris Bueller went through all of the trouble rebelling against both the fourth wall and grown-ups, only for Hughes to end up rejecting youth films... although, in all fairness, he was 36 at the time of this film's release, and he was getting a little old to understand young people problems of the '80s. Well, at least he had enough of a grip to make a film that can be enjoyed by kids, grown-ups and Barbara Bush alike (Way to stay relevant for the Wellesley College kids, Barb), despite having problems beyond a questionable coming-of-age moral (Forget you, Pink Floyd, the kids do need an education).\r\n\r\nSaying hardly anything off the bat, then proceeding to give only so much exposition as it progresses, the film probably doesn't need to say much as an almost inconsequential young adult character piece, but developmental shortcomings make it a little difficult to get invested in, or even buy into characters, only so many of which are morally relatable. Storytelling is sharp enough, and acting is charismatic enough, for the characters to endear pretty thoroughly, although there's something a little sleazy about the most major ones, and that's, maybe not distancing, but a little obnoxious at times, in a manner that would be easier to get past if the characters were more fleshed out or, for that matter, organically juggled. While the film is, on the whole, minimalist as a character-driven affair, it will often bring in some layers to its cast and focus, only to find trouble in keeping up with it all, resulting in a certain focal unevenness which makes it even harder to get invested in the characters. Perhaps the film would be a little more even if it was tighter in its storytelling, being not especially overlong with its 102-minute runtime, but still with certain touches of filler that outstay their welcome and thin already uneven focus, which would, of course, feel tighter if this narrative carried more intrigue to justify its execution's length. There's simply not a whole lot to say with a story like this, and that's fine, considering the entertainment value of the idea's interpretation, yet the inspiration that backs this flick most every step of the way can carry the final product only so far. The film is fun, make no mistake, but it's not much outside of that, and when inspiration fails to meet the ambition which begets too much bloating for consistency in focus and pacing, it's hard to not be reminded of the limited potential here. With all that said, the film entertains pretty thoroughly, so much so that it borders on rewarding, and stands as worthy of certain recognition, even for its story.\r\n\r\nNo matter how inconsequential, this film's story concept is relatively solid, as far as comedic narratives are concerned, being colorful and even unique as a portrait on youths' somewhat reasonable, if a little convoluted mission to embrace life while there's still plenty of it, even if it's for only one day. This story is both refreshing and relatable, and that's respectable, as John Hughes seems to understand, even as writer, offering snappy, often even, for a young adult film, gutsy dialogue and lively humor, all behind memorable set pieces - such as unique fourth-wall breaks that give you insight into the mind of the titular character - and, of course, memorable characterization that, while focally uneven and sometimes a bit obnoxious in its intentional drawing of flaws, presents generally charming and distinguished characters. If nothing else brings color to the characters, it's the characters' portrayers, with standouts including a Jeffrey Jones who convinces as a clumsily bitter antagonist, and an Alan Ruck who convinces as a self-conscious voice of reason with his own charming faith in fun, while Matthew Broderick, in a breakout performance, truly drives the film with his butter-smooth charisma and slick energy. While his charm doesn't find its share of challenges in this cast of limited star power, but abundant color, Broderick more-or-less carries the film, which also owes much of its liveliness to style, even musical. Flaunting a trio of composers which includes Ira Newborn, Arthur Baker and John Robie, the film's score is diverse, yet consistently stylish and lively, with moments of borderline killer flare that joins a couple fun tunes in the unoriginal soundtrack in drawing you in almost as much as dynamic locations that paint a handsome and immersive portrait on the distinct setting of Chicago. The film even offers a fine deal of style that, quite frankly, perhaps would be as effectively lively if it wasn't so well-orchestrated by Hughes, as director, whose plays on the aforementioned musical and visual style, and even on Paul Hirsch's snappy editing, keep pacing brisk, and whose occasional thoughtful moments ought to immerse you into the thematic depth of this portrait on coming of age and achieving independence. It's hard to fully agree with a lot of the characters' actions, but the overall theme in this coming-of-age flick is surprisingly subtle and worthy, thus giving the film a heart to go with all of the fun that may not exactly be substantial to the point of seeing the final product transcend its natural shortcomings, but certainly make quite the memorable comedy classic.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the characters are a little underdeveloped, sometimes obnoxious, and occasionally unevenly handled, while storytelling proves to be repetitiously overdrawn enough for you to think about the inconsequentiality of the narrative concept that render the final product kind of underwhelming, but hardly so underwhelming that a unique and thematically worthy story, on the backs of clever scripting, charming performances, sharp style and colorful, when not thoughtful direction, fails to be enough to drive John Hughes' \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" as a classically fun, if near-inconsequential study on embracing life and youth.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

Matthew Broderick is great in the movie, he's a bit of an asshole but he's so likeable. Cameron and Sloan are also great in the movie and they all make a great group. Mr Rooney is also great, it's funny to see him try and catch Ferris and by the end it's just hillarious to see him fail. The film is also laugh out loud funny. I love the scene in the Art Gallery, it's so strange and I don't know why but I love it. The Ferrari is also amazing in the movie and by the end you do feel sad to see it go. I also love how stupid the parents are it's just great to see them get fooled. His sister is also great, the scene where she kicks Rooney in the face is really funny. Charlie Sheen is also in the film for one scene and he's absolutely hillarious he's a bit creepy but he's so funny and likeable. I also love Rooney's secretary, she's such an idiot and it's really funny to see her in scenes. John Hughes brilliantly directs the movie, the parade scene is a prime example of that. The parade scene is absolutely brilliant it's funny, entertaining and just fun, if it had been any shorter you would have felt like you missed out and if it was longer it would have been boring. The scene where Ferris runs home is also great and it has a brilliant use of slow motion. This film is an absolute classic and I love it, without a doubt in my top 20 favourite movies of all time.

But I think it also falls plague to the idea that it is harder for me to get into movies that were released a long time ago. This was from the 80s and I know it is a classic for many people.\n\nThe concept for the movie was great. Ferris Bueller literally is able to get away with almost anything he tries to pull off. For him he skips school for a day and he takes two of his friends with him. The antagonist is the principal who is trying to actually catch Ferris Bueller in the act. But Ferris Bueller has set up a plan so wonderful, that he is able to fool his parents, friends and the school teachers.\n\nWhile the movie was fun to watch, because who doesn't like the idea of a student who is able to get away with everything he is pulling off, but I can't say it was amazing. I did laugh a few times. And in general I was happy watching the film. But there wasn't anything that really stood out to me. I enjoyed it when he sang and danced in the parade to the song of twist and shout. That was awesome. But overall, I have to wonder how many more times I would ever watch this movie. Maybe one of my favorite parts of the entire film was recognizing Charlie Sheen who was playing a druggie in the movie. It was really cool seeing him outside of 2 1/2 men.\n\nSo overall it was a decent film to watch to pass the time, but it is not one I would ever buy or watch again more than once.",

Throughout the entire film, the sense of fun is never lost at any point, and that has everything to do with the young Broderick.  Everything about his performance is smirking and self-aware; the sheer number of times he breaks the fourth wall to address the audience is only made possible because of his natural charisma (also, this movie has one of the best stingers of all time).  You also have the principal, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who plays one of the more underrated movie villains; just because your movie is a comedy doesn't mean you can't have a quality villain, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off never forgets that.  The focus on the movie is always on the best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck), who is an interesting character to watch, because it is never completely clear how much responsibility lies on his shoulders; sometimes, he plays the victim, and sometimes he is the cause of his own demise.  It's always funny to see how pointless high school can sometimes be, and Ferris Bueller serves as a reminder that it is good for your personal mental health to call out for no reason every now and again.",

            "content": "\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" features Matthew Broderick as the titular character Ferris. On a school day where Ferris is supposed to take a test on a subject that frankly he doesn't care at all about he decides to fake an illness and go out and have fun with his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck). The three decide to go out in style by \"borrowing\" Mr. Frye's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 FT California Spyder convertible an proceed to explore the city, spending their day sightseeing, visiting attractions, spinning circles around the adults that would send them back to school. Meanwhile the school's Dean Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) tries to bust Forrest, as he is determined to expose him as a juvenile delinquent so he can hold him back a year.\n\nThere are two kinds of people that will leave the film, the first are the ones that will leave thinking that Ferris actually is just a juvenile delinquent and the second are the ones who will get swept up by the protagonist's charms. It's easy to see why you wouldn't enjoy the movie at first. Why does Ferris get to fool his parents and skip school while everyone else goes to class? Doesn't he know he's making his parents worry? What about the staff who are just trying to do their job? This kid's just trying to get his friends in trouble by stealing the car! someone catch up with this guy before he hurts someone for goodness sake! To those people, I say calm down for a second and really take a look at the movie. Ferris has a point early in the film when he comments on the test he is supposed to take that day. The test is about a subject that will have no bearings on his life whatsoever; it's useless information and even the teachers that are dispensing the lessons have no interest in it so why bother? Instead of staying at his desk all day and simply learning about life outside, Ferris actually goes outside and lives it. An example is at the Art Institute of Chicago where the trio go to admire some of the pieces on display. It's a beautiful sequence where the characters look at paintings and really analyze and appreciate them (it's done through a montage but you can clearly see Cameron inspecting \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" by Geirges Seurat). Set to the music of The Smiths, it's moving to see because of the combination of subject matter, music and cinematography. Sure the group get into a couple of situations where they trick adults but for the most part they're not causing any trouble at all. The reason why you're put off by Ferris' behaviour at first is because none of us were that cool. No one dared to skip school so they could go on an adventure and see everything there was to see out there. None of us had the beautiful and dedicated boyfriend/girlfriend that was ready to drop everything and go off on a crazy notion that we had, none of us had the guts to laugh at the authorities and not get caught. You're jealous of the guy but once you learn to just accept that and go along for the ride as his friend Cameron does, it's a heck of a lot of fun.\n\nThe film is extremely well written, with many quotable lines and memorable moments. This movie is so iconic that you've seen it parodied at least a dozen times and probably never even knew. Ever seen a movie where there's a car flying over a jump in slow motion? Ever seen a character fail miserably at something and have a musical note laugh at them, \"sad tuba\" style? Or even more iconic, ever hear that porno-sounding track \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello, while something awesome is going on? Check this movie out. You'll notice the scene where the Frye's car is flying and the scene where Dean Rooney gets busted at the arcade just as the game of Pacman next to him ends (with the iconic death rattle playing as he realizes how badly he's screwed up). As for the song with Yello, well you'll just have to see for yourself. The characters are iconic and you'll relate to them very well, be it because you want to be like Ferris or because you're seeing a part of yourself in the other characters around him. As the movie progresses his friends and his sisters get a new take on life and while you're sitting there appreciating the movie, you will too. I'm making it sound like the movie is very deep and thought provoking but really that material is a subtext in a very funny and lighthearted film. It's filled with clever one-liners, close calls and smart commentary on the way life treats teenagers. It's a treat to listen to.\n\nThere are a few moments of bad over-acting and at least one scene where the movie goes a bit too much into fantasy land but you won't really mind. Even if at first you didn't care for the film, give it another shot and particularly, pay attention to the scene where Jennifer Grey (playing Jeanie, Ferris' sister) is stuck at the police station. There's a nice exchange of dialogue there that will really turn you around on the whole \"juvenile delinquent\" thing and it's such a crowd pleaser that the material is sure to grow on you. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out and if you have the opportunity to see it for the first time when you're still in school it will really resonate with you. I can't recommend it highly enough. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 13, 2013)",

I really loathe people like him and I have a very hard time cheering for him which the film clearly wants to do. Alan Ruck's character Frye saves it from being a complete waste of time, especially in the latter half of the film. It's not enough for it to save it for me. There are a few laughs here and there but all in all, I don't understand the adoration this film has received.",

            "content": "Comedy is arguably the most difficult movie genre to get right. Finding a character or brand of humour that is going to mass appeal , and last an hour and a half, is no easy thing to do. But occaisonally the stars align and a film, and character, is born that will forever remain a timeless treat. Step forward Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\nFerris Bueller is arguably the greatest creation of writer/director John Hughes, the man who ruled the roost of '80s teen movies. Personified by Matthew Broderick, Beuller was the \"righteous dude\" whom everybody in high school loves and it's easy to see why. The character is such a likeable slacker that even though we ought to tut disapprovingly at him for fooling his parents into thinking he's ill so he can bunk off school, he does this so he can help out his best friend Cameron who's having a rough time. We all want a friend like Ferris.\nOut to catch Ferris is Mr Rooney, devious and slimy high school teacher. It's basically a rip off of Tom and Jerry with Ferris in the mouse role, continuously outsmarting Rooney. It doesn't descend to the cartoon violence levels of Hughes' Home Alone but the animation influence is felt.\nHughes has put together a flawless script for Ferris Bueller. It's full of proper characters, even those who only get a few lines you feel that you could paint a rich back history too. The dialogue is some of the best ever committed to celluloid and at times is extremely funny. The interplay between Ferris and Cameron, and the two with Ferris' girlfriend Sloane is pitch perfect.\nTo top it all off there's a street parade, dance sequence to The Beatles Twist and Shout, that is even better than it sounds.\nFerris Bueller is the crowning comedy moments of the 1980s.",

Featuring a great performance from Matthew Broderick, a funny script and great direction from John Hughes, and some oddly touching moments, this one has all the ingredients for a success. Luckily, it takes this ingredients and uses them wisely, ending up with a really good comedy. Though it may get a bit outlandish at times, it really captures the end of high school well and honestly just feels like a good time. It is an enjoyable little film that may not be entirely realistic, sure, but it surely delivers in the entertainment department and is a film that you wish would never end, unlike the end of high school, which cannot come soon enough for many. Overall, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic that I am ashamedly just getting around to, however, it was more than worth the wait as it delivered exactly what I was hoping for: a funny high school comedy with some killer writing and acting.",

But what sets this film part as another teen movie is not the premise of the film, but the actual character of Bueller and is influence on his little entourage of classmates and is entire school who hear about his 'illness'.\rFerris orchestrates several ways so as his day off goes smoothly, dummy in the bed, recorded message for the doorbell etc, but a persistent school principal (Jeffrey Jones) may just wreck that.\rThe day really consists of various places that Ferris has clearly wanted to visit, and a very memorable scene at a parade, which is just too enjoyable.\rAlan Ruck also stars as the worrying and depressive Cameron, Ferris' best friend but someone who has issues with his parents. Mia Sara plays Sloane, Ferris' girlfriend, who Ferris manages to get out of school.\rThe movie has all the vintage touches of Hughes, the in-your-face cinematography and the exaggerated moments of simple scenarios with pounding music to signify the scene.\rFerris continuously speaks directly to the camera, this is quite clever in that we see the influence and effect that he has on the other characters and the bigger, overall picture of what is being told, he is narrating the insecurities that teens face in their everyday lives, and what it means to be free, and also the simple case of not having everything doesn't necessarily make him unhappy.\rWhat I feel took the film down though was Hughes excessive use of his dramatised camera techniques, they just become annoying and didn't suit the style of the film at all, and the film could have benefited greatly without them.\rThe message within the film does do the whole feature justice though, dealing with problems head on and looking out for your friends couldn't be more heartfelt in this film. Something as simple as freedom for the youth couldn't be more important, and Matthew Broderick has the perfect face and charm to put across that message. Certainly not an amazing film, but the agenda that the film has is one of the upmost importance and is a nice deterrent from the typical teen films that we are now accustomed to, if you don't stop for a while and admire it, you might just miss it.",

It is rather what a middle age man with bad job would do on his day off. But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.\r My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.\r First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull, boring, slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example, take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief, they do not destroy anything, they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting, I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet, I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e.; watching baseball game , they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.\r Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most, I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.",

Ferris Bueller's Day Off is immensely fun and likable as both a comedy and a film. It is marred slightly by some of the sentimentality, but the story is engaging and the script is smart and funny. Hughes does a very admirable job directing, and the film also boasts some lovely cinematography and a catchy soundtrack. Then there is the acting, I liked all the performances in this movie. Matthew Broderick indeed plays an arrogant, spoiled and bratty sort of character, but he actually manages to give him some likability too. Alan Ruck is also excellent as his melancholy friend, and Mia Sara is gorgeous as his girlfriend. But it is Jeffrey Jones who almost steals the show as he suffers all those humiliations he goes through. In conclusion, I like it a lot and it is one of Hughes' best. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

As an adult I absolutely love it and find it so hilarious. Matthew Broderick (Godzilla) is so hilarious in the lead but the film's real MVP is Jennifer Grey ( Dirty Dancing) as his sister. She's hilariously negative and her seen with Charlie Sheen (Wraith) is everything. As well all know we just experience the best cut day ever and Broderick is wonderfully charasmatic. And don't let me forget Alan Ruck (Twister) as his worrisome, likable friend Cameron. All in all the film was deservedly a huge hit and is definitely a classic.4.5/5",

After all, who hasn't wanted to take a day off and simply enjoy their youth? I think all teens have felt this urge, and often have, or played sick for one more day to themselves. What, surely, will never have happened is something as complex and sophisticated as what Ferris Bueller decided to do.The film is fun and uses a tasteful comedy style, without good resources, able to delight the whole family. John Hughes assures a firm and intelligent direction, who guides the film with skill, combining a creative and intelligent story with a very well written and thought out sense of humor.The still young and inexperienced Matthew Broderick does a good job as the protagonist, and is already showing signs of the talent he will develop in mature works. He knew how to give his character a strong charisma, combined with a rebelliousness and stubbornness typical of a teenager who has been pampered too much. Mia Sara did an equally competent job, even though she's a more clich\u00e9 character: she's the pretty, popular girlfriend, who's obviously also one of the school's cheerleaders. We find characters like her in virtually every teen comedy! Personally, I didn't like Alan Ruck very much. The actor is good and does what he can, but the character is irritating with all his spoiled rich boy whining. However, it's not just Broderick that makes the movie worthwhile: Jeffrey Jones' incredible work also deserves applause. He gave life to the school principal, who wants to prove that Ferris Bueller is deliberately skipping classes, and at the expense of that, he goes through a series of hilarious situations where, of course, he suffers hard. It's an impressive work by this actor, which makes us laugh until we cry.Technically, it's a film that doesn't have any major demerits, but it also has little that stands out: it has good cinematography, an excellent soundtrack and a series of witty and well-written dialogues, but everything else is within the standard you would expect from a 80s comedy.",

Matthew Broderick's acting (playing as Ferris Bueller) is miraculous: he is always in the right tone, never acts too much, never misses any line ! Yet he an be a jackass sometimes or have a really dumb face but that's all. The rest of cast is iconic with the marvelous Mia Sara and the gorgeous Jennifer Grey.Coming from this kind of comedy movies I didn't expect the characters to evolve that way. If some don't change from start to end (as the principal or Bueller's girlfriend), others change a lot. It's hard to identify if this movie is rather for kids (surely not considering its vulgarity at some point) or teenagers (because some jokes are frankly childish). As an adult you may want to retain some few lessons.I was really skeptical when I understood that the movie wanted to make school look like a horrible boring and brain-washing prison but as the plot moved on I realized things were a bit deeper than that. Of course there are some major critics to the adults world but some other things are just unexcusable, like the fact that Ferris' parents admit they prefer him to his sister, that the police puts someone who is in theorical danger in custody, and that crashing a car is not supposed to be the best way to assume yourself.In conclusion there are some parts looking just like a 'Home Alone' movie and some others that are way more inspired and original.",
