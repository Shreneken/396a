            "content": "Out of MGM, The Asphalt Jungle is directed by John Huston and based on the novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett. It stars Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Teresa Celli, and in a minor but important role, Marilyn Monroe. Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa scores the music and Harold Rosson photographs it in black & white. Plot sees Erwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Jaffe) leave prison and quickly assemble a gang to execute a long in gestation jewellery heist. However, with suspicion rife and fate waiting to take a hand, the carefully constructed caper starts to come apart at the seams.John Huston liked a tough movie, having given film noir in America a jump start with The Maltese Falcon in 1941, he also that same year adapted W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra. Burnett also had on his CV crime classic stories Little Caesar & Scarface, so it's no surprise that Huston was drawn to The Asphalt Jungle. As it turned out, it was a match made in gritty urban heaven.The Asphalt Jungle was one of the first crime films to break with convention and tell the story from the actual side of the criminals. Where once it was the pursuing law officers or private detectives that were the heavy part of the plotting, now under Huston's crafty guidance we have a study in crime and a daring for us to empathise with a bunch of criminals, villains and anti-heroes. As a group the gang consists of very differing characters, and yet they have a common bond, for they each strive for a better life. Be it Hayden's luggish Dix, who dreams of buying back his father's horse ranch back in Kentucky, or Jaffe's Doc, who wants to retire to Mexico and surround himself with girls - it's greed and yearning that binds them all together - With alienation and bleakness, in true film noir traditions, featuring heavily as the plot (and gang) unravels.With gritty dialogue and atmospherically oozing a naturalistic feel, it's also no surprise to note that Huston's movie would go on to influence a ream of similar type films. Some good, some bad, but very few of them have been able to capture the suspense that is wrung out for the actual heist sequence in this. Fabulous in its authenticity, and with that out of the way, it then sets the decaying tone for the rest of the piece. Interesting to note that although we are now firmly in the lives of the \"gang\", including their respective women (Hagen, Monroe & Celli all shining in what is a very macho movie), we still know that the society outside of their circle is hardly nice either! This is stripped down brutalistic film noir. Merciless to its characters and thriving on ill fate, and closing with a finale that is as perfect as it gets, this is a top line entry in what is the most wonderful of film making styles. 9.5/10",

            "content": "I am a fan of film noir, owning many of them, and this one is right about at the top of the list and climbing each time I view it. It might even have passed Double Indemnity for the number one spot. It's that good.For anyone who has not seen it: the poster art and the video/DVD cover are both misleading. They usually feature Marilyn Monroe in publicizing this movie, but she only has a small role. Many times they feature Monroe, Jean Hagen and Sterling Hayden all together....and those three are never on screen at the same time. My point being: what you see on the outside is not what's on the inside.Hayden is the star of the film but Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern are not far behind. In fact, the more I watch this film, the more I see the latter two as the real stars here, and I especially have begun to appreciate the great acting by Calhern in here.Actually, everyone performs at a very high level. The diverse and interesting characters are really fun to watch, one of the big reasons I rate this film so high. Hayden, with his big body and tough demeanor, was perfect for film noir. He is a legitimate tough guy, nobody to fool with. Jaffe was fascinating as the little German \"doctor\" but until I got the DVD and put on the English subtitles, I never understood all his dialog, which is terrific, and \"Doc\" is my favorite character in this film. Kudos also go to James Whitmore and Marc Lawrence for great supporting role performances.The two women, Hagen and Monroe, also do their bits nicely. I never understood people who criticized Monroe's acting. I thought she was pretty good right from the start, with this film as an example. I also liked seeing her thin and in shape. This movie is a gritty, tough, no-nonsense crime story concerning a jewel robbery where things go wrong and eventually does everybody in. Actually, it isn't just a botched robbery that ruins some of them - it's character weakness, from greed to sexual lust.\"You reap what you sow\" could be a moral of this story.",

            "content": "The Asphalt Jungle (1950)One after another, the criminals in this metaphoric Asphalt Jungle meet their necessary demise. It isn't the jewel heist, functional and classic, that matters. It's the personalities that wind themselves up and then wind back down through the raspy knot where they intersect, and where they fall to unexpected side effects.What do we make of the clich\u00e9s here? The mastermind of the heist is not such a bad guy, the getaway driver is a sweetie who loves cats, the safecracker has a wife and young baby, the \"hooligan\" is a misplaced sentimentalist who only wants the old farm his family lost to bigger forces. In fact, these \"bad guys\" are really just you and me, and bigger forces are always out there ready to squash us. So conniving a little jewel theft is not going to hurt a soul, and the presumed victory over inconsequence is huge.Or would have been. Maybe it's not coincidence that the biggest impediment of all comes mostly from a duplicitous lawyer, and here we have a character actor, Louis Calhern, sharpened and amplified by director John Huston, a master at making the ordinary just acceptably larger than life. So the man has a cash flow problem, and his suffering and his hapless conniving is alone enough to recommend the film. The small, sad part of his wife, played by the ruefully cheerful Dorothy Tree, only twists the knife, reminding him, and us, of what this man could have had, ordinary happiness. But no one in the movie wants to be ordinary, Calhern has a young Marilyn Monroe, no less, for his diversion. Then there are the core contract players in the gang, including a sweaty Marc Lawrence as the fumbling lynchpin connecting them all. As the requisite hooligan, Sterling Hayden is convincing enough, but maybe it is the pathetic desperation of his sometimes girlfriend, played by Jean Hagen, that rips your heart out. At least until Hayden falls in the grass and the horses come to graze by his head, as if we have entered a dream, a thousand miles from from any asphalt or jungle, far far from tension and sorrow of any kind.Considered a major film noir, it can also be seen as a major ensemble heist film. Though the gloom is noir enough, it lacks what I think of as the core quality of noir--alienation-- though there is, at least, Hayden's sad listlessness. But it's a great movie with a plot that is useful for bringing out the vivid characters. Everyone talks about how the cast is perfect, and the cast really is perfect. And the cast is perfectly directed, which is a whole other wonder.",

            "content": "It took over 40 years until Goodfellas was made to make a film interesting and realistic about criminals as The Asphalt Jungle. The power in the characters that John Huston brings to life is so vivid and you root for them, yet you never forget they are criminals.Sam Jaffe, a cool and calculating planner, brings a scheme to big time lawyer Louis Calhern about a jewel robbery. Calhern is a criminal attorney who really does work both sides of the fence. But he's also got some high living expenses and a young mistress in the shape of Marilyn Monroe in the first film that got her notice. Jaffe needs three to help pull off the job, a safe cracker, a driver, and a strong arm guy, a 'hooligan' as he calls it. Calhern provides them in the persons of Anthony Caruso, James Whitmore, and Sterling Hayden.You wouldn't think it, but Jaffe and Hayden bond in this. The educated criminal mastermind and a man who might not have finished grade school. Jaffe sees in Hayden a reliable sort.Sterling Hayden did not think too much of most of the action/adventure stuff he did, but he liked The Asphalt Jungle as well he should. He's a country kid, his nickname is 'Dix' short for Dixie. His family owned a farm and bad luck hit them as it did so many in The Great Depression. Hayden turns to criminal enterprise because his skills for making an honest living are limited. His biggest accomplishment is having a B girl from a clip joint fall hard for him in the person of Jean Hagen. Both of their characterizations ring well and true, dare I say it, sterling performances.Of course after the job is done, fallible and corrupt human beings like bookmaker Marc Lawrence, corrupt police lieutenant Barry Kelley, strong arm man Brad Dexter, and Calhern himself bring the whole thing crashing down. One of the reasons you root so hard for the criminals to succeed is the magnificent and unheralded performance of John McIntire as the police commissioner. Imagine if Charles Laughton as Inspector Javert, had not gotten so tangled up in searching for Jean Valjean and rose to become the head of the Surete in France. You've got McIntire. I don't think any honest cop has been made so unpleasant on the screen before or since. At one point he's telling the press that he'll get Hayden and Hayden is a callous brute. The most callous person in the cast is McIntire and we go through 112 minutes of The Asphalt Jungle and know how very human Sterling Hayden is.Sam Jaffe got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to George Sanders in All About Eve. The film itself got three other nominations including for Huston as Best Director. It had the bad luck to run up against another classic film in All About Eve, in it's own way as cynical a film as The Asphalt Jungle.John Huston took a cast and got perfect performances out of the lot of them and The Asphalt Jungle holds up every bit over fifty years later. Should really be seen beside Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas to get a full appreciation for today's generation.",

            "content": "This is an amazing film and one that serious film buffs need to see. However, while it is clearly an example of Film Noir, it represents a very realistic style of Noir--lacking the dramatic excesses of some (such as KISS OF DEATH and its wheelchair scene) or super-snappy dialog (like DRAGNET). I actually like all three types of Noir films but when it comes to realism, this film ranks up there with HE WALKED BY NIGHT and T-MEN--and this is certainly good company.The movie is a step-by-step case study of a crime being organized, executed investigated and resolved. While it could have been shot documentary-style (like a few Noir films, such as NAKED CITY), it was handled like a traditional crime drama except that the focus tended to shift back and forth between the criminals and the police--though the focus tended to be on the criminals a bit more often. This really helped make the movie exciting and worked very well. What also helped the movie was the exceptional acting by mostly unknowns or long-time character actors. Good Noir usually does NOT star big names and having the film anchored by Sterling Hayden (who was amazing), Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern was an excellent move. To assist them were some other exceptional actors, such as James Whitmore and Marilyn Monroe (in a small but exceptional role).However, despite the amazing acting, the biggest star of the film was the taut script. From start to finish, it sparkled and abounded with realism and an unflinching message that crime doesn't ultimately pay. The total package is one of the best Noir films ever--only exceeded by a small number of movies (such as my favorite Noir, THE KILLERS). See this film!By the way, please take a look at the very amazing biography of Sterling Hayden on IMDb. I did and was totally blown away--what an amazing life he led. It all sounded so amazing that if they turned it into a film, many would think it was fiction!!",

            "content": "John Huston, one of the great film makers of all times, was at the top of his craft when he undertook the direction of \"The Asphalt Jungle\". The book by W.R. Barnett was brilliantly adapted by Mr. Huston and Ben Maddox and the result stunned everyone. In fact, the film has been so influential one sees parts of it in other movies of the genre. The magnificent cinematography created by Harold Rosson speaks by itself. The music score by Miklos Rozsa stays in the background and never interferes with the action.This is a film that looks as good today, as when it first was released. In fact, one discovers more nuances as one watches it again, when it's shown on cable. The cast of the film is one of its best assets going for \"The Asphalt Jungle\". Mr. Huston assembled some of the best talent working in the American cinema of that time.Sterling Hayden, as Dix, gives a tremendous performance. The excellent Louis Calhern, though, steals the picture with his take on Lon Emmerich, the man who finds he is broke and wants to be at the center of the caper, without risking anything. Marilyn Monroe has only two scenes in the movie, but she shines in them. Also Jean Hagen, an actress that should have gone far, but didn't, makes a valuable contribution with her Doll Conovan.The supporting cast is amazing. James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, Anthony Caruso, Brad Dexter, and the rest, play well together to give the film a seamless look.\"The Asphalt Jungle\" shows why John Huston was one of the most influential men in pictures. His films are a must see for all movie lovers and studied by his successors and people working today owe a lot to this master, who pioneered a style that stands as his legacy.",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for a good heist film, and three of the best I've ever seen were made around 1955/56 - 'Rififi', 'Bob le flambeur' and 'The Killing'. Now they are still three of the greatest crime thrillers ever made, but now that I've finally seen 'The Asphalt Jungle' it's obvious what source those movies were drawing on! Not that I'm saying they're rip offs, they're not, but they are kind of three (excellent) variations on Huston's theme. 'The Asphalt Jungle' must therefore be seen as the most influential crime movie of the modern era, and the blueprint for every subsequent caper movie ('The Anderson Tapes', 'Thief', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Score',etc.etc.) This superb film noir is almost impossible to fault. The script is first rate, John Huston's direction is inspired, Sterling Hayden - possibly America's most underrated actor - is fantastic as troubled ex-con Dix Handley, and the ensemble cast are all excellent, especially James Whitmore ('Them!'), Louis Calhern ('Notorious'), Sam Jaffe ('The Day The Earth Stood Still') and John McIntire ('Psycho'). The early role for Marilyn Monroe made a strong impact on a lot of people, but I was even more impressed by Jean Hagen as Doll. She is unforgettable and her scenes with Hayden are wonderful. Why did she never become a major star? This is a crime classic and brilliant entertainment. Highly recommended!",

            "review_title": "Excellent Crime Film, Leaving Troubling Questions",
            "content": "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE comes close to being the best film of the film noir style. A study of a complex, well planned jewelry robbery that is destroyed by double crosses it is a model for later films like THE KILLING, RIFIFI, TOPKAPI, and THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen, Sam Jaffe (whose sole mistake is giving into a weakness to watch pretty young girls dance for too long), Louis Calhern (whose death scene is shattering), Marc Lawrence, and Marilyn Monroe all did first rate work under John Huston's direction. For these reasons alone I recommend the film.But I can't avoid commenting on one irony that Huston (and his screenplay writers, including W. R. Burnett) may have intentionally included. John McIntyre plays the local Police Commissioner Hardy, who comes across as a hard-nosed S.O.B., fully pushing law and order as the safety of the community. He has tightened down on the town, making the plans for the robbery more difficult. When a policeman is shot in the escape of the thieves McIntyre goes ballistic, guaranteeing that the criminals are really going to be captured.And (no real revelation here) they are. But what is ironic is the smug, self-congratulatory way McIntyre tells the media about the triumph of the police and law and order over the criminals - which he fully takes credit for. This triumph involved several crooked cops beating up on at least one suspect. And when I say crooked, the one in charge of the beating knew about the robbery. That officer (Lt. Det. Ditrich - Barry Kelly) is seen standing just in back of McIntyre during the news conference! McIntyre, for all of his self-congratulating and self-publicity, is still a puppet himself of the very corruption he claims he is conquering.To me that moment near the conclusion of the film is one of the most realistic bits in all film noir. How successful can we be in conquering crime? How can we be when depend upon it by not asking too many questions that should be asked?",

            "review_title": "Another Sublime Noir",
            "content": "Coming at the end of the decade in 1950 - which effectively ended Hollywood's much cherished Golden Age - was MGM's THE ASPHALT JUNGLE. A superbly structured gritty crime drama it was one of the last of the great Noir thrillers. Produced for the studio by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a novel by W.R. Burnett it was beautifully written for the screen by Ben Maddow and John Huston and outstandingly directed by Huston. The assembled cast couldn't be better even down to the smallest parts such as Ray Teal turning up as a patrolling policeman. The picture is notable also for an early appearance of Marilyn Monroe as the kittenish ingenue of shady lawyer Louis Calhern. Stylishly photographed in stunning black & white by Harold Rosson THE ASPHALT JUNGLE has joined the ranks, alongside \"The Killers\" (1946) and \"Out Of The Past\" (1947), as the finest Noir ever made.An old time criminal Doc Redinschneider (Sam Jaffe) has just been released from prison and has devised a plan for the \"perfect\" caper (\"I could sell it on the open market for $100,000\"). He approaches a small time racing \"fixer\" Cobby (a brilliant Marc Lawrence) who in turn arranges with dishonest lawyer Alonzo Emmerich (Calhern) to finance the heist of a million dollar diamond haul from a major jewellery firm. Emmerich is also to act as a \"fence\" to offload the gems. Hired is expert safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), the humpback Gus (James Whitmore) as the driver and a small time hoodlum Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) as the group's strong arm. The robbery itself is a success (a riveting intense sequence) but things start to go terribly wrong. First Ciavelli is accidentally shot and then Emmerich, along with an accomplice (an impressive Brad Dexter) attempt a double cross which is thwarted by Dix after a shootout. With the loot now just so much junk Reidinschneider and Dix must go on the run. The movie culminates with Emmerich committing suicide, Redinschneider, Cobby and Gus being arrested and ends with the fatally wounded Dix making a dash out of the city to reach his family farm in the country.Performances are terrific! Hayden was never better and only came close to matching this portrayal six years later in Kubrick's brilliant \"The Killing\" (1956). Outstanding also is Sam Jaffe as the master criminal, Louis Calhern as the crooked lawyer, Marc Lawrence as the \"fixer\" (\"I always sweat when I count money - it's the way I am\") and John McIntire as the determined Police Commissioner. All things considered THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is probably the most perfectly cast film ever. The only minor disappointment is the sparse music score by the great Miklos Rozsa. There is a splendid dramatic main title and continues after the credits for a short while but then no more music is heard until the final six or seven minutes of the picture when there is a hectic rhythmic orchestral statement to accompany the mortally wounded Dix and his frantic drive to his family's farm. Then as he reaches home, collapses and lays dying in a pasture the music segues into a reflective melodic theme for the end title. The lack of a full score however is but a minor quibble and does little to alter the fact that THE ASPHALT JUNGLE remains an exercise in meticulous motion picture making.",

Well I was wrong, it's certainly a Golden Age film made with high production values, with all the right actors, direction, music and story the Golden Age had produced. The music especially links it back to Double Indemnity and of course Huston to The Maltese Falcon, Jaffe to Lost Horizon etc. It was simply a signpost to the type of films to come , the ones I avoid.It's gritty, as realistic as a gritty fantasy could be in 1950, as realistic as I want. The multi character interplay sticks in the mind, everyone's grafting and ready to dump on the next guy, apart from The Hooligan who dumb as he is really has a heart. It's Sam Jaffe's film though, his calculating but flawed dirty old man character was a classic perv-ormance, nowadays we would not have been spared the sleaze, but he walked a fine line successfully.And again, the sleazy relationship between Uncle Louis Calhern and young Marilyn Monroe was perfectly handled.All in all a marvellous film from the twilight years of the Golden Age.",

            "content": "Today, classic posters focus on the blonde beauty who only appears in the film for a brief minute, but this film is so much more. It is about desperation. It is about disappointment. It is about decent people sinking into amorality by aligning themselves with people of very low character. It is a character study. It is another example of how capers never succeed, even if you somehow manage to get away with it. It is also a master class in writing, directing and acting, with superb photography and editing, and a new wave view of post war realism that MGM's head man Louis B. Mayer begrudgingly had to allow to be done, even if he was still of the Andy Hardy school of thought of movie storytelling.The caper involves a desperate jewel heist, utilizing plot devices that would later be used in other jewel heist films, some more serious than the others, but all cleverly executed in their manner. You've got the struggling businessman (Louis Calhern), mistress on the side, ailing wife at home, bad deals making him nearly bankrupt, the crooked career criminal (Sterling Hayden) who wants one more heist to call it quits, shady doctor Sam Jaffe (even close-ups on him would make me never want to be treated by him under any circumstance), the hunchbacked James Whitmore, and interloper Brad Dexter, whose sudden presence makes the whole scheme seem to backfire when violence erupts. It isn't often the law who ruins it for these criminals; They often do it to themselves, like another later low budget caper \"Plunder Road\", leading them all to the path of destruction.As adopted from the novel by W.R. Burnett, the film (with a script by director John Huston and Ben Maddow) immediately draws you in with these desperate characters, people you know whom would never deal with each other in any other type of situation. Each party plays an important part, and if one of those parts messes up, they could all fall down like a house of cards. Individual detail is given to each of these characters to make them more than just your stereotypical criminal. Motivations are there for everyone, especially for Louis Calhern who had he not been nominated for an Oscar the same year for playing Oliver Wendell Holmes in \"The Magnificent Yankee\" certainly could have been nominated (in lead or supporting) for this. That is indeed Marilyn Monroe in one seductive sequence as his young mistress, and her brief coo'ing was enough to get attention to warrant stardom for her. Dorothy Tree is perfect as his ailing bedridden wife, certain he is up to something shady, but so desperate and clinging that she couldn't let him go under any circumstance.I call this the apex of the film noir genre, one of the last truly perfect examples of what made these type of films so riveting. It is the type of film that if you can experience your first time seeing on a big screen, it is highly recommended, because there are some films that need that large experience, and with an equally appreciative audience. Whatever city this is supposed to be is shaded with darkness from the start, and while you might be tempted to guess which city it is, aspects of the script fool you from the start. This is a film that gets more tense as it goes on, where each piece of the puzzle seems to fit nicely, but then another piece comes along that seems to go where previous pieces ended up. Even if these characters are low-life's (even the ones living the high life), there is even that desire to see at least one of them get away with their caper, but then, crime would pay, wouldn't it? Film reminds us that all criminals do pay somehow, even if there is some sort of sympathy for one of them.",

            "content": "\"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a classic \"film noire\" caper movie directed by the legendary John Houston. Except for the opening and closing scenes, the story takes place entirely at night.As in most films of this genre, there are no heroes or villains, only a collection of tragic losers who are trying to better themselves through one last big caper.Doc Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) has just been released from prison. He has plans for a major jewel heist but needs financial backing and a crew to assist him. He goes to a small time bookie named Cobby (Marc Lawrence) who in turn puts him in touch with money man Emmerich (Louis Calhern). Doc assembles his crew, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) a small time thug, a driver Gus (James Whitmore) and explosives man Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Carouso). But it seems that Emmerlich is broke what with his high living and young mistress Angela (Marily Monroe). So Cobb is convinced to back the job.Along the way we meet Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen) who carries a torch for Dix who doesn't really care. There's the corrupt cop Lt. Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and an unscrupulous private eye Bob Brannon (Brad Dexter) trying to get in on the action. While the caper seems to be going along nicely, several chance events occur which change the whole outlook of the event.Even though filming at the prestigious M-G-M, Huston wisely cast his film with largely (at the time) relative unknowns. Hayden is excellent as the doomed anti-hero Dix and Hagen superb as the tragic Doll. But it is veteran Sam Jaffe as the cultured, German-accented and very cool Doc who steals the picture. Marilyn Monroe on the verge of stardom (Why didn't M-G-M sign her?), is very good as the \"femme fatale\" of the piece.Also in the excellent cast are John McIntyre as the Police Commissioner, Don Haggerty and James Seay as a couple of detectives and Ray Teal as the policeman who causes grief for two of the escaping thieves. Watch for Strother Martin and Frank Cady (of TV's \"Petticoat Junction\")in the line-up sequence at the beginning.Huston made only one more film for M-G-M, \"The Red Badge of Courage\" (1951) which he blamed the studio for butchering. Nevertheless, he left us with another classic in \"The Asphalt Jungle.",

            "content": "It was only a few weeks ago that I described 'Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)' as the film that pioneered the traditional crime caper, carving a narrative mould that would continue to be reused in films of its sort for decades to come. While Jules Dassin's picture is undoubtedly the finest in a sub-genre affectionately known as \"the heist flick,\" I have now discovered that the concept stretches back at least another five years, to one of Hollywood's most revered adventure directors, John Huston. Revealing a seedy underbelly of society, overflowing with smarmy criminal figures and crooked authorities, the film is a potent film-noir thriller, employing dark, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, and a selection of suitably sordid characters, whose greed, obsession and violent temperaments ultimately lead to their own demise. The film's success would trigger a considerable boom in the popularity of heist thrillers, most notably in Crichton's 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951),' Dassin's 'Rififi (1955),' Mackendrick's 'The Ladykillers (1955)' and Kubrick's breakthrough picture, 'The Killing (1956),' which also starred Sterling Hayden.Recently-released criminal mastermind, Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), has, for the last seven years of his incarceration, protected the plans for the most ambitious and profitable heist of his \"distinguished\" career. He arrives in a dreary, smoggy, crime-ridden city, where low-lifes patrol the darkened streets and law officers, some honest and some crooked, do their best to control the escalating crime-rates. The Doc hires a diverse assortment of essential criminals to ensure the success of his caper \u0096 a \"boxman,\" or a safecracker (Anthony Caruso) with a young family, a \"top-notch\" getaway driver (James Whitmore) with a twisted back, and a small-time \"hooligan\" (Sterling Hayden) with a costly passion for horses. Also involved in the elaborate scheme is Cobby (Marc Lawrence), a sleazy, treacherous bookie, and Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern), a bankrupt professional businessman who agrees to finance the operation but houses plans for a disastrous double-crossing. The film's female protagonists come in the form of innocent Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen, prior to her career-defining performance in 'Singin' in the Rain (1952)') and an upcoming Marilyn Monroe as Emmerich's sexy, playful and naive young mistress.As was typical in film-noir films of the era, whose contents were dictated by the meddlesome Production/Hays Code, the ultimate moral of the story is that crime doesn't pay. Each of the thieves receive punishment for their involvement in the robbery, either through conviction or death, as does the fraudulent detective (Barry Kelley) whose corruption is described as a \"one in a hundred\" case. Nevertheless, Huston succeeds in creating a certain amount of empathy towards the criminals, sympathetically presenting the audience with each man's reasonable motivations towards breaking the law. By recruiting our support, Huston invariably places the audience in the shoes of the criminals, suggesting, as the perfect scheme begins to unravel, that our own fates lie in the balance. This evocation of realism is certainly complemented by Harold Rosson's gritty, documentary-like cinematography, and the heist sequence itself \u0096 while falling well short of Jules Dassin's breathless 30-minute counterpart \u0096 is tense, intriguing and authentic. As Huston himself explains in a pre-film introduction on the DVD release, each of his characters is immoral, largely unlikable and driven by a debilitating vice; however, despite this, or perhaps because of it, we can't take our eyes off them.",

Plenty of excellent characterization and tautly made , resulting one of the greatest crime movies of all time . The picture is well paced with an electric current that never let up . The movie has the thematic unity of 'Key Largo' , ' We were strangers' , ' Maltese Falcon' or ' The treasure of Sierra Madre' the John Huston's best . This thrilling story is stunningly scripted by Ben Maddow and the same John Huston from a W.R. Burnett novel ; letting the audience in early on what the outcome will be and increasing in power as they scheme the path closer to their destination . Both Director John Huston and ex-communist star Sterling Hayden were members of the Committee for the First Amendment, which stood against the blacklisting of alleged communists working in the film industry during the Red Scare . The main credit for this masterpiece must be shared among Sterling Hayden as a tough criminal , Louis Calhern as a mean lawyer and especially Sam Jaffe as an old ex-con . Furthermore , top-notch support cast , Jean Hagen as Doll Conovan , James Whitmore as Gus Minissi , John McIntire as Police Commissioner Hardy , Marc Lawrence as Cobby , Barry Kelley as Lt. Ditrich , Anthony Caruso as Ciavelli and debut of Strother Martin and Jack Warden. And of course a splendid bit by Marilyn Monroe as Angela , John Huston originally intended the role of Angela Phinlay for Lola Albright . The musical scoring by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa is magnificent , being perfectly attuned but extremely scant, occurring only for the main titles, continuing through the opening sequence up to the point where Handley enters the caf\u00e9, and then returns some 107 minutes later when Handley and Doll return to his boyhood farm , total scoring just under 6 minutesRating : Above average , this is one of John Huston's best films , a model of his kind , definitely a must see if you are aficionado to Noir Film .

            "content": "One of John Huston's all-time classics depicts a jewel robbery that the perpetrators see as the perfect heist. Huston gave \"The Asphalt Jungle\" a cast of lesser known actors, forcing the viewer to focus exclusively on the story. As for the cast, there was probably no better actor for the lead role than Sterling Hayden (a few years away from playing a psychotic general in \"Dr. Strangelove\"). His scowling face and guttural voice fit the character perfectly. You may have heard that Marilyn Monroe stars in the movie. She does, but only in a supporting role (she wasn't yet a star). Nonetheless, her character IS a hottie.As in many heist-themed movies, there's the planning and the execution. The execution actually goes by pretty quickly. Sure enough, the characters discover that there's more to come. Thanks to the editing and cinematography, the whole end sequence is one of the most intense in movie history.All in all, it's definitely a movie that I recommend. The rest of the cast includes Louis Calhern (the ambassador in \"Duck Soup\"), Jean Hagen (the cacophonous starlet in \"Singin' in the Rain\"), James Whitmore (the Miracle Gro guy), Sam Jaffe (the doctor in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\"), John McIntire (the sheriff in \"Psycho\"), Marc Lawrence (the hit-man in \"Foul Play\") and Brad Dexter (one of the Magnificent Seven).In conclusion, it's no skin off my asphalt.",

The movie has its roots in several great film noir projects, such as \"Double Indemnity\", \"The Killers\", \"Criss Cross\", and \"Out of the Past\". Its lasting impression over time is based upon its quality and its unprecedentedly brilliant use of the \"caper\" as a plot device. As stated in other comments, this film noir's influence can be seen in hundreds of disparate \"caper\" movies - \"Rififi\", \"A Simple Plan\", \"The Guns of Navarone\", \"The Usual Suspects\", and \"How to Steal a Million\", just to name a few. I will not give away the results of the \"caper\", but the film is truly superior in how it explores relationships and deception. This is one of John Huston's greatest works, and the script lays down the tension from the first moment and doesn't let up. Huston uses multiple closeups to literally drain the emotion out of the characters. Hayden, Calhern, Lawrence, Hagen, and Whitmore turn in superb performances with many memorable moments, but Sam Jaffe steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance as the brain behind the caper. Marilyn Monroe makes an indelible impression in a fairly brief but pivotal role.Please do not miss this - an easy 10 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "Film Noir in Full Force",
            "content": "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE epitomizes Film Noir. It's dark, grim and it's not afraid to show us seedy, down-and-out characters who are nevertheless complex and deeply human. This film has men and women who inhabit the underworld, that 'city under the city'. Most of their needs are spelled out, and the backgrounds are painted in memorable detail. We see little men like Cobby (the late Marc Lawrence in a sweaty, realistic performance) and Gus (James Whitmore); a woman with nothing but a romantic illusion to cling to (the great Jean Hagen as Doll); men whose lives have been crippled by crime and who persevere only through their own folly-laden dreams: Doc (who sets it all in motion, expertly played by Sam Jaffe) and Dix (Sterling Hayden). There is also family-man safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), whose motivations are understandable to us all and whose desperation is painful to watch at times. While Dix is often seen as the central protagonist in JUNGLE, he really shares that position with Alonzo Emmerich. Emmerich is a corrupt lawyer: a formerly wealthy, urbane man reduced to the same doomed schemes as his cohorts, men to whom he feels superior and whom he ultimately intends to double-cross. Emmerich is almost tragic in the Greek or Shakespearean mold: he has farther to fall than Dix and the rest, but he has already met the ground halfway as the film begins. He's broke, and no more debts can be called in to support the new scheme. Unlike the younger men, who could possibly take other paths, there is really nowhere for him to go but down. Emmerich's scenes--rendered immortal by Louis Calhern's performance, the greatest in the film--are the most interestingly complex. He pretends he is smarter than everyone else, but he knows that hubris has brought his life past the crisis point. He is painfully aware that neither the money from the stolen jewels, nor the foolish romantic escape with his mistress (Marilyn Monroe) will ever redeem him. The robbery sequence, around which the film ostensibly revolves, is very brief and anti-climactic. This is surely Huston's intention: it's all over in a few minutes and nobody actually gets what they want. The stolen jewels are brought to Emmerich and a violent scene leads to a foil of the rich man's double-crossing scheme. In the end, everyone can see that this particular gleaming treasure--like the gold dust in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE or the 'black bird' in THE MALTESE FALCON--is ultimately worthless: the jewels are too hot and no one dares fence them. So Doc ends up with most of them in his black bag. He begins pursuit of his dream of a tropical isle, surrounded with dancing girls and ends up in a roadside bar where he feeds nickels into a jukebox as a pretty teenager bops around for him. The waiting cops close in quickly, and all is over for Doc. Emmerich, too, is soon caught. The alibi plan with the mistress doesn't hold water. And the police make a direct connection to him and his dead henchman Brannom (Brad Dexter). Making short work of it, he goes into his private office and shoots himself in the head.Other characters meet their ends behind bars (Cobby and Gus) or with ironic justice (corrupt detective Barry Kelley, who tries to play both sides), or in death (Ciavelli). At the close of the film, we are left with a mortally wounded Dix, driving toward his dreamed-of horse farm. At his side is the faithful Doll, who knows the jig is up. Dix has never given up his illusions, where the other characters probably never believed their own. He dies, with poetic rightness, in a field surrounded by curious horses, as poor Doll is left to her own devices. The film, which opened on a dim stretch of urban asphalt, closes on a sunny rural vision.What makes THE ASPHALT JUNGLE a great Film Noir? The wide array of doomed characters and a persistent feeling of encroaching doom go a long way to take it in that direction. In this way, the film exemplifies the strong fatalism that is essential to Noir. Along the way, we hear some of the most intelligent, yet convincing dialog in all of Noir (by Huston and Ben Maddow) characters who sound real, who say what someone might actually say or be thinking. This realism is enhanced by the look of the film, starkly, yet vividly shot in black-and-white by Harold Rosson. It's worth noting that Rosson uses some sophisticated camera techniques, such as deep focus and and the extreme foregrounding of a single character. If, while watching, the viewer imagines a B-movie version of this story, with conventional camera work and a lackluster cast and script, the greatness of THE ASPHALT JUNGLE becomes even more evident. The consummate technical work and artistry involved elevate the film far above any genre or pulp limitations. Underlining the bleakness of Huston's vision right from the opening credits is the music score by Miklos Rozsa (who also scored CRISS CROSS) in a departure from from his scores for DOUBLE INDEMNITY and SPELLBOUND, Rozsa places his cues sparingly. The score only calls attention to itself under the main titles and during Dix's wild death ride. As for the robbery scene, Rozsa provides no music for it, and dialog is minimal. While it's far briefer, we can see this scene as the true precursor of the robbery scene in Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955), famed for its nearly complete silence. But John Huston himself may deserve the lion's share of credit for this film. Taking the advice of an older director he had known (possibly Josef Von Sternberg?), he directs each scene as if it were the most important one in the film. This gives every scene its own sense of urgency and keeps a consistent tone, making the film one long, tragic descent into doom.",

The plot isn't as intricate as some noirs, but feels plausible as it's played out by self-centred characters with broken dreams, all searching for a hopeful future from the big score. Multiple heist films released after this movie have used similar themes and plot devices.\"After all, crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavour\" is a great line spoken by Louis Calhern's character Emmerich and Huston presents many little moments that show what motivates each endeavour. The story is virtually all told from the criminal's perspective. The police are antagonists, either sanctimonious ones or as equally corrupt as the criminals.The unnamed midwestern city described by the movie's title is captured in an atmospheric way with great black and white cinematography that makes you feel you are in a corrupt place full of dark, self-driven characters who would do anything to obtain what they most desire. We have scenes on the streets, in bookies, diners, police stations, apartments and one grand house. Framing, focus and lighting are all perfect.The heist scene is wonderfully made and even though the movie is 70 years old it stands the test of time. Great attention is paid to the details of the robbery, whilst the tension and sense of danger feel very real. From watching this scene and others during the build-up you can see where the much used formula came from. The brains, the box-man, the muscle, money-man, the fence, etc.All performances work for what Huston was trying to achieve. Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, John McIntire, Marc Lawrence, Barry Kelley, Anthony Caruso and Marilyn Monroe are all perfect for their roles. The characters are not particularly likeable but they feel like real people and draw the audience into their world with incredibly natural performances. That being said Monroe is more than likely there for her physical presence than anything.The female characters are pretty hard done by, portrayed as troubled wives or love interests who's lives pretty much depend upon the whims of the male characters. This might be difficult to take by a modern audience, but it is an important to look back and see what attitudes were like and appreciate how much the world has changed.As the story unfolds, the level or drama and suspense increases. As we learn the fate of all characters involved it's hard not to feel some level of empathy due to the little glimpses we have had into their backgrounds. Some more so than others. A few come across as sad, slightly creepy middle-aged men who have pretty one-track minds about what they crave in life. Dix, the main protagonist is different. He is brutal and cold, but is ultimately searching for his own dream of escaping the Asphalt Jungle returning to the peaceful, bliss of his lost childhood. In relation to this the final shot is both ironic and haunting.",

No movie proves this better than Asphalt Jungle.This caper movie is one of my all time favorites and frankly the best of its genre. Its brilliance lies for me in the fact that no big name of the Hollywood acting community was involved \u0096 Monroe was small fries then. Instead John Huston worked with a cast of reliable, mostly very experienced character actors many people will know as \"supports\" from numerous other movies of the period. And many of those actors probably gave here the best performances of their lives. Everybody is cast dead right, this is what is so magnificent about Asphalt Jungle. The balance is perfect, the chemistry works all ways. Maybe just one miscast actor or actress would have spoiled the whole atmosphere. No one is overacting at any time, and there are many, many very moving moments as one can observe these characters struggling on the sidelines of urban society.One is always tempted to name an actress or an actor whose performance one liked best in a movie.

This film further benefits from a wonderfully rich rogues' gallery of colorful low-life hoodlums: Sterling Hayden as hard-nosed hooligan Dix Handley, Sam Jaffe as shrewd criminal mastermind Doc Erwin Riedenschneider, who has a fatal weakness for pretty young girls; Louis Calhern as slimy two-timing corrupt lawyer Alonzo D.

Peopled with gritty, believable character it's a study in greed and broken dreams on the one hand and love and camaraderie (even amongst thieves), on the other. Of the members of the criminal gang carrying out the heist, three wind up dead and the rest get caught and go to jail ample evidence that crime indeed doesn't pay.You suspect all the characters in the film know this and never convince the viewer that they're going to get away with it, which while giving the events a fatalistic turn, only make the film more compelling to watch.The ensemble acting is great. There's no star here big enough to get their name above the title but I wouldn't change a single role or performance. If I had to highlight any of the cast, I'd have to single out Sterling Hayden as the apparently cold-hearted heavy who, mollified by the love of an I won't say good woman and a childhood dream of taking back his parents' old farmstead. There are also great turns by Sam Jaffe as the jailbird mastermind who comes up with the idea for the job, Louis Calhern as the corrupt and broke scheming lawyer approached to bank-roll the operation and of course, as the DVD cover now makes plain, although she doesn't even make the first roll of title credits, Marilyn Monroe as the latter's young mistress. She only gets about three scenes but definitely makes an impression leaving no doubt that she could wreck any happily married home she chooses! Really, however, all the playing is great, which only further reinforces the realism of the piece, these are real people in desperate situations and you believe their stories completely.Naturally it's all down to great direction from John Huston. He rarely gives us an \"on the level\" camera angle and often employs the device of overlapping portraits of his characters, three deep at times, as they jostle for our attention. The dialogue is sharp and natural-sounding, while the handling of the large cast and their interrelated stories are expertly handled. He's clever too in the way he shows up their peccadilloes - notably Calhern and especially Jaffe's less than wholesome interest in young girls, which ultimately leads to both their downfalls.This, in summary then, is a must-see movie, as good as any this great director ever made. More than just a crime movie, it's a superb study of the human condition from multiple viewpoints.",

The black and white photography is stylish and atmospheric, the music is dramatic and sensitive to the visuals, the acting is terrific.Of course it helps to have a cast that includes Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe and Marilyn Monroe. Their characters populate the city's \"jungle\"--the dark underside where each denizen has his vice. The film suggests that its inhabitants are infected with an urban disease, being too far from the land. This is the antithesis of \"Spencer's Mountain\", for example, where goodness wins out, because their lives are grounded in the soil.John Huston's \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is one of the best examples of film noir and has significantly influenced many films that followed. Like \"The Maltese Falcon\", it explores the dreams of those who are always looking for the big score. The final scene is nearly perfect in its symbolism and execution. This is a film that can be watched many times and enjoyed for its literate writing.Note that each criminal has a slightly different motivation for the heist, revealing various personalities rather than simple bad guy types. And this film does not glorify crime as other films have done. Neither does it stick precisely to the film code's dictates regarding the portrayal of immoral acts. These men are fallible and all the more human for that.",

At the center of the story is a robbery carried out by a group of criminals who, regardless of social position and education essentially losers from the start. The film, which has a distinctly noir style seems natural in a vicious circle of crime in which criminals devour themselves. From the above it can be concluded that the characterization is very good. Taking into account characteristics such as loyalty or duplicity, this would be one of many good noir films.I can only conclude from the criminals in this film are not up, well-planned, robbery. In fact they are not explicitly negative characters. They are quite vulnerable. These are seen when things went wrong. Robbery in the film is on one hand a lifeline for criminals (who could not reach), and on the other side the redemption of the police. Fascinating is the way in which the director merged underground. Rogue and bully, rich and cheeky bookie, an ex-con with a brilliant plan of robbery and well-known lawyer who was left penniless. Each of the characters wants a sort of salvation.Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley is confident, fiery and arrogant bully who just wants to go home. Louis Calhern as Alonzo D. Emmerich is witty and resourceful lawyer, who used all means to get his hands on the spoils and with his mistress fled the country. Sam Jaffe as \"Doc\" Erwin Riedenschneider is a mastermind and a criminal who acts like he has all the cards up his sleeve. I have to mention Marilyn Monroe as a mistress. Well, beautiful and incredibly hot mistress.Everything seems pretty rotten but basically it is not. This movie is a balanced blend of action and reaction of the same character.",

            "content": "Characters are as harsh as their physical surroundings in this bleak story about a group of men who plan, then attempt to carry out, a jewel heist in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the late 1940s. It's a story of cheap booze, bookies, a corrupt police officer, and sleazy, desperate criminals.Dix (Sterling Hayden) is a smalltime gambler; he's tall, rarely smiles, and has a girlfriend named \"Doll\" (Jean Hagen). Cigar-smoking Doc (Sam Jaffe) is the group's brain; he's just out of prison, and has a weakness for pretty young girls. Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso) is a middle-aged man with a wife and sick baby. And Lon Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is the smooth-talking lawyer who functions as the group's respectable front man; he has a whiny wife and a voluptuous blonde girl-on-the-side named Angela (Marilyn Monroe). None of these characters or anyone else in the story is sympathetic. But they're all unique, with their own dreams, motivations, and flaws.Despite Doc's well-laid plans and the competence of the other players, unforeseen events, accidents, and bad luck make their robbery scheme fraught with peril. That \"stuff\" happens is not their fault. It's fate. And the story's outcome is a forceful reminder that much of what happens in life is random and to some extent meaningless. The film's message is thus highly existential.What makes the overall story interesting is that it is told from the POV of each of the criminal participants. We get to know these characters as individuals, and then watch them under pressure, as they react to unplanned events.Their individual predicaments make for good drama. And the film's noirish, high-contrast B&W lighting ups the drama even more. Most of the plot takes place at night, or in dimly lit, rundown, seedy back-rooms. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" has an oppressive, claustrophobic, rat-in-a-maze feel to it.Casting and acting are fine. I especially liked the performance of Louis Calhern. Arguably, the best element of the film is the cinematography. Those stark visuals in some scenes are just terrific. My only complaints, both minor, are that the script has several characters too many, and the film lacks appropriate background music.Although visually bleak and dreary, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a high quality film with a thoughtful story about desperate people living on the underbelly of society. The script is good, and the direction from John Huston is excellent.",

            "content": "John Huston's classic heist movie is a fascinating study of how a group of criminals work together to plan, execute and deal with the aftermath of a major jewellery robbery. The action depicted is uncompromisingly realistic, full of suspense and unusually for its time, told from the perspective of the criminals. Its greatest strength, however, is the way in which it establishes and develops the story's characters providing the audience with information about their backgrounds, their motivations and their weaknesses. The acting performances and the screenplay are consistently good and together further enhance the quality and power of the characterisations and also the authenticity of the interactions between the various personalities involved.When Doc Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is released from prison. he's already formulated a plan for a jewellery heist and contacts a bookie called Cobby (Marc Lawrence) so that the necessary funding ($50,000) can be arranged. This involves Cobby's contact, a corrupt and very successful lawyer named Alonzo D Emmerich (Louis Calhern). Emmerich is impressed with the plan and agrees to provide the funding and to arrange for the jewels to be fenced. It emerges later, however, that he's actually broke due to the fact that he's got a very expensive mistress called Angela Phinlay (Marilyn Monroe) and together with private detective, Bob Brannom (Brad Dexter), he plans to double cross Doc and keep the stolen jewels for himself.Cobby eventually supplies the $50,000 himself and Doc and he recruit safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), tough guy Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore). The robbery is carried out but when the gang get interrupted by a night-watchman, Ciavelli is accidentally shot and is then taken to his home where he subsequently dies.Doc and Dix go to meet Emmerich as planned but soon realise his treacherous intentions and this leads to an exchange of shots between Dix and Brannom which leaves Brannom dead and Dix injured. Emmerich disposes of Brannom's body but when it's later found with evidence on it which links Brannom to the lawyer, Emmerich knows that the game is up. Doc and Dix initially go into hiding but soon come to recognise that their entire plan is doomed to failure.It's particularly striking that regardless of which side of the law that they're on, there's little to distinguish between the standards of morality and integrity shown by the characters that populate \"The Asphalt Jungle\". The story features a lawyer, a police detective, a caf\u00e9 owner and a private detective who are all dangerously corrupt and a thug who is an inherently decent man with aspirations to return to horse farming. Ciavelli takes a professional pride in his work and is a committed family man and Doc is an intelligent, well mannered man with a genuine talent for thorough and methodical planning.Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern provide the stand out performances and Marilyn Monroe makes a great impact in her minor role. The movie's top class standards of cinematography and direction were also justifiably recognised by both Harold Rosson and John Huston being nominated for Academy Awards for their respective contributions.",

But he needs the usual men of experience: the safe-cracker, the driver, etc. Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Jean Hagen, and Marilyn Monroe costar in this film noir, that has been hailed as one of the best of its kind. I saw it almost 20 years ago and for some reason I remember not liking it much. Normally any story of criminals on the run come to no good (end) and there's nothing to like about them and nothing (thank goodness) to relate to. Maybe that's why I didn't like it, and I was young\u0085 But seeing it today, I recognize all the elements that come together in this story of people gone bad. After all, it's the story of people that make any movie interesting and worth watching. Instead of just taking them at face value and shooting at each other, we are allowed into their private worlds. One man speaks of his wife and little girl. One man longs for his youth and his horse, wanting to go home again. Jean Hagen is a standout as she takes in Sterling Hayden and falls in love with him. She was Oscar-nominated for \"Singin' in the Rain\" but I think she's just as good if not better here. Marilyn Monroe is memorable in three short scenes and holds her own against real pros. And, Sam Jaffe and Sterling Hayden are good too, but perhaps the biggest impression on the viewers is Louis Calhern, who embodies and conveys his character's eccentricities so well. He's so subdued yet so intense and desperate. He always seems to be picture perfect \u2013 well dressed, in control, calm, when really it's bottled up. The whole production has the John Huston touch and it really packs a wallop. All the key parts are here to make this a must-see film noir. But in fact it's the story of people and choices and wrong turns that makes this transcend all other heist movies.",

With that financial backing, Doc hires his crew: safecracker Louis Ciavelli (played by Anthony Caruso), driver Gus (played by James Whitmore) and hooligan Dix Handley (played by Sterling Hayden). \"The Asphalt Jungle\", based on W.R. Burnett's book, helped set the mold for numerous imitations and variations on the heist theme.This forerunner commendably doesn't waste time showing us how grand the burglary is, or how brilliant the masterminds and craftsmen behind it are--modesty I wish some copycats would have learned. This movie is best in the burglary sequence (I especially liked watching them slide under the detection of the sensory alarm) and the proceeding outcomes of the characters. Director John Huston and cinematographer Harold Rosson show added discernment by using noir style, for which they got Oscar nominations.Jaffe's genial performance, as a German with a penchant for young girls, landed him an Oscar nod, too. The ensemble cast includes the nubile Marilyn Monroe in an early bit part. I liked the addition of contrasting cops: Ditrich who's on the take (played by Barry Kelley) and the harsh commissioner Hardy (played by John McIntire). I couldn't accept, however, Doll (played by Jean Hagen) as being just a neurotic hopelessly in love with Dix. The character should have been further developed, or removed, as she wasn't vital to the story (failure in adaptation, I suspect).The performance, or character, that impinged the most was Calhern's morose turn; because there was no attempt to pass his character off as something he wasn't. This is where the movie falls to a common error of crime genre; for example, Hayden's character is made into a sort of honorable thug--more intelligent than the stereotype would suggest--as displayed in IMDb comments, some viewers still thought the character was a dolt. He's similar to Russell Crowe's character in \"L.A. Confidential\". Crowe pulled it off; nobody did here.",

You almost have to pity all these criminals, while the only one you really learn to loathe in this bunch is the police officer Dietrich, the one corrupt policeman, almost a worse brute than any of the gangsters. Professor Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe in one of his best roles ever) is an angel and perfect gentleman in comparison. Even Louis Calhern as the motor of the plot, because of his bankruptcy and need of money, has his very human traits and is the only one to live up to his full responsibility - by escaping it, but he had nothing else to do. Also Sterling Hayden makes one of his best performances ever, and that is no small matter, since he was always outstandingly excellent. A special laurel must go to Jean Hagen as Doll Conovan, the warmest and most human heart. This is definitely one of John Huston's best films ever, perhaps the very best, mostly because of its overwhelming consistency in holding on to strict obejctivity to the very bitter end, without one moment abandoning the focus on the red thread of the human factor, which must be considered as the main theme of the film, in spite of all its massive criminality of very noir elements, turning the film almost darker than black in its towering capacity of massive noir.",

It has influenced countless films of the same nature which have come out subsequently. While watching the film, I couldn't help but get constantly reminded of Kubrick's 'The Killing', not only because of Sterling Hayden's presence, but also because of the similarities in the screenplay and the narrative structure. However in spite of the surface-level similarities between the two films, they feel very different because of the tone set by the respective directors and their attitude towards the characters in the films. Kubrick in 'The Killing' presents a dark and uncompromising setting while staying distant and judgmental towards his characters. Huston on the other hand is a lot more sympathetic towards his characters, even though he still underlines that the world, the city and the system which envelopes these characters are unrelenting as ever thereby retaining the quintessential cynicism of post WWII noir films. The characters in 'The Asphalt Jungle' are low-time crooks who are simply trying to survive and their quest for survival leads them to criminal activities. Huston never condones the crime, but he certainly makes us understand the criminals, where they come from, their motivations and most importantly their weaknesses and sources of fragility. As a part of a film-noir double feature, 'The Asphalt Jungle' could be chosen as the more heartfelt and humane companion piece to Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon'.The cinematography has the noir-ish visual elements of prominent shadows and the interplay between light and dark textures. But there is much more naturalism in Huston's staging and direction of scenes compared to some of his earlier works. He uses quite a lot of long unbroken takes and the camera lingers on images and makes gentle movements. The acting is solid from everyone.Certainly Recommended.",

I just saw in on the TCM channel. At almost two hours, it is quite the gripping story. Well-acted, shot beautifully in black and white. It tells of a group of crooks who just take pulling off jobs as part of life. This was not Marilyn Monroe's first film, but it was her first role of any note, and she was already a fine actress in her early 20s.  A film noir that I think is better than the much-praised CHINATOWN. some SPOILERS follow, please read no further if you want to remain surprised.Sam Jaffe plays a German who just gets out of 7 years in prison, all the while completing his plans for a big jewelery heist. He needs a safe-cracker, a driver, and a \"hooligan\" who is the tough guy in case a security guard or cop shows up during the heist. It is well-planned and looks like they will get away with it, but a series of little things eventually derails each one.The famous lawyer who was going to help them fence the jewelry tried to cheat them, his man was shot, cops get wise, lawyer shoots himself in his office.  A guard shows up at the robbery, in a struggle his gun falls to the floor and discharges, wounding the safe-cracker, who does not recover. The driver is ratted out and ends up in jail. The German found a taxi driver to take him to Cleveland with the jewels but, during the 2 or 3 minutes he lingered at a food joint to watch a young girl dance, two cops noticed him through the window, waited, and arrested him.

            "content": "It's a subversive movie in a conformist decade. Asphalt Jungle stands the conventional business enterprise on its head. Instead of portraying law-abiding people acting cooperatively and intelligently to advance a profit-making venture, John Huston & Co. show professional criminals acting intelligently and cooperatively for ill-gotten gains. Not that this is so unusual. Other gangster films going as far back as Cagney's Public Enemy have made similar points. Jungle, however, goes two steps further.First, unlike other crime films from that era, it thoroughly humanizes the culprits. Each gang member, including double-crosser Louis Calhern, acts on recognizably human motives, and though each has a fatal weakness, all are treated in subtly sympathetic fashion by director-co- writer Huston. The evolving bond between Sterling Hayden's muscle and Sam Jaffe's brain is especially affecting -- ditto, Louis Calhern's genuine regard for both wife and mistress. Moreover, the bank heist develops from a raw criminal undertaking into an model of professional expertise, encouraging viewers at the same time to root for its success. On the other hand, law enforcement is treated in unusually cynical fashion. The one overtly brutal character, Barry Kelley's corrupt cop, is clearly dislikable, while John McIntyre's voice of official rectitude is so harshly self-righteous that viewers are likely repelled. As a result, the respectable overworld becomes not so much an opponent of the underworld as its grim and unfeeling seed bed.The movie has many fine touches. Except for attorney Calhern's plush surroundings, the sets are appropriately seedy. The cast is outstanding, as Calhern again shows his capacity for tragic dimensions, while Monroe again proves her flair for kittenish seduction, even as Marc Lawrence (Cobby) faces sudden unemployment as a victim of the Hollywood blacklist. Two scenes are especially worth savoring. Seldom has culture clash been more tantalizingly displayed than in Sam Jaffe's ogling of teenage jitterbug Helene Stanley, his old world intellectualism lost amidst the sensual gyrations of her new world exuberance. The fit is perfect, and the impression is that he gladly gives up his freedom for one tawdry glimpse of earthly delight.The final scene is an oddly moving mixture of pathos and misogyny. Across the horsey fields of Kentntucky, the love- lorn Jean Hagen chases after a dying Hayden as he chases after the dreams of his lost youth, oblivious to her emotional train-wreck. Rarely has a movie treated such a vulnerable victim with such casual indifference. In fact, her punishment may be the most painful of all. Everybody, of course, ends up a loser as the production code of the time dictated and Huston agreeably underscores.This caper film set the style for those to follow, most notably Kubrick's The Killing. Amidst the de-politicized 1950's, this genre comes about as close to a political statement as can be found. Daring people are shown organizing themselves outside the law for collective gain, their emotions and motives thoroughly humanized. And if their goals never get beyond the basely mercenary, they at least establish eye-opening bonds beyond the conventional hypocrisy of the day. As a result, their combined skills demonstrate the powerful potential of collective action among ordinary and not so ordinary people, and therein lies the subtle message of a darn good movie.",

There's a small vocal minority who claim it's both boring and overrated while a large number of people claim it should be very high up the IMDb's top 250 movies chart . I'm somewhere in the middle . It's by no means a bad movie but other classic not dissimilar movies like WHITE HEAT aren't in the top 250 so why should this one be ? Huston has certainly hired an impressive cast with pride of place going to Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley . Most people will forever remember Hayden for his role in THE GODFATHER but everyone seems to forget that he had a very pronounced physical presence in his earlier films , unlike some actors better known for playing gangsters you certainly could believe that a Hayden character was physically able to kill someone . We also get to see an early role by Marilyn Monroe The plot itself is both exciting and intriguing once it gets going but that's the problem with every heist movie - The formuliac structure . The first third is spent introducing the characters and planning , the middle third with the robbery itself and the final third taken up with double cross , triple cross and rough justice being served and THE ASPHALT JUNGLE plays out in exactly the same manner , almost certainly better than many of the films that followed it but it's not the masterpiece many people claim it is",

            "content": "This is a fantastic crime movie and the audience, through brilliant directing by none other than John Huston, is pretty much led into backing the criminals. The cast is superb: Sterling Hayden was never better. He was a decorated war hero, and at 6' 6\" could be menacing (in real life, he served as a decorated commando in Greece and Yugoslavia and really did kill people with his bare hands). Sam Jaffe won awards for his portrayal of the master criminal/planner and he is certainly good but I think Hayden has a dimension to his character that is beyond Jaffe's. Louis Calhern, usually MGM's Mr. Debonair, is also splendid as an oily and odious, double-dealing lawyer, who finances the heist. His performance here indicates that he could have provided MGM with much more, had it ever asked for more than the suave and sophisticated, debonair man he usually played. Huston does a superb job in directing him out of his usual role. Also terrific are Jean Hagen, Hayden's love interest (and it is a compelling one); Marilyn Monroe, who shows she really can act; and James Whitmore.In a sense, these \"bad guys\" are just caught up in the problems of the city and American civilization in the 50's (\"The Asphalt Jungle\"), trying to make a go of the bad cards they have been dealt and there is little difference between the \"good guys\" and the bad guys, especially with one cop being a rogue. Terrific, no nonsense script. This film won many major awards but Hayden never got the recognition for his performance that he deserved. He, not Jaffe, in my opinion, held the movie together, just as he physically in the movie, held Jaffe and moved the \"little man\" around.A great film noire; full of \"dark scenes\", duplicity, corruption, and wasted and unfilled dreams. Perhaps John Huston's greatest movie and that's saying a lot!",

            "content": "John Huston's 1950 movie adaptation of W.R. Burnett's excellent crime novel The Asphalt Jungle is one of the director's better efforts. It falls just a little short of his absolute best; awfully downbeat, full of people who are unhappy, unfulfilled in one way or another or simply unwilling or unable to make an honest living, it's an impressive achievement and yet a hard movie to love. Then again, I suppose it wasn't the director's intention to make a lovable movie. It's a Wonderful Life it's not. More like It's a Terrible Life.A bunch of criminals of varying degrees of psychopathy pool their talents for a big heist in the jewelry district of an unnamed mid-western city. If they pull the massive undertaking off some of them will be set for life. The mastermind is a German immigrant known as Doc. A small, unprepossessing man, he's a brilliant strategist of crime; had he lived his life differently one can easily imagine him as a field marshal. He hooks up with an assortment of mostly minor criminals, his deal bankrolled by a prominent lawyer, who, though still living large is in reality broke and desperate, a fact he for obvious reasons keeps from his partners in crime. One of the most prominent members of this motley crew is Dix, the \"muscle guy\", who, though huge, tough talking and no nonsense on the outside has an introspective side that consists of a code of honor and a love of horses. He's a farm boy from Kentucky adrift in a cold, northern city where he feels like a stranger. Doc takes a liking to Dix, as he senses the man's personal qualities beneath his brusque exterior, and indeed these two are atypical of the general run of criminals we see in the film, as each is somewhat of an aristocrat.A corrupt policeman figures prominently in the story, and indeed the police don't come off well at all in the film. They are portrayed as either corrupt or cold blooded. The criminals, for all their flaws, have a humanity to them, and a measure of loyalty to one another. We get to know the various members of this criminal gang as the movie progresses. Their dialog is good, unfancy, not too stylized, without the wisecracking one often finds in crime pictures from the 30's. The film is starkly photographed, and while the product of a major studio, it doesn't particularly look like a Hollywood movie.There's no need to spoil this one by giving away the ending, or even its last part. I'll simply say that things don't go according to plan and leave it at that. Too many variables, loose cannons and the like. Director Huston and screenwriter Ben Maddow don't shrink from unpleasantness; and not just the unpleasantness of crime but of everyday life. This is an unflattering picture of America, and I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the State department held up its worldwide release, as it presents America in a nasty light and might, as the saying goes, send the wrong message. It's an impressive movie just the same. There's a feeling for the working poor, society's outcasts, the square pegs who can never seem to find the right holes to fit in, that comes from people who know real life inside out. I can't find much wrong with it except maybe that it doesn't give much in the way of pleasure. Marilyn Monroe has a small part, which perks things up a bit. Louis Calhern, as the lawyer at the end of his tether, is excellent, and he underplays his part skillfully, letting the dialog and the camera do the heavy lifting. Sterling Hayden, as Dix, the hoodlum with a sentimental streak, is nearly as good. He'd been a minor, pretty boy leading man for several years prior to making this picture, which enabled him to reinvent himself as an urban tough guy. Sam Jaffe comes off as convincingly European as Doc, a man who, like Dix, seems to have one foot in a dream world. James Whitmore, Anthony Caruso and John McIntrye are all fine in smaller roles. Only Marc Lawrence seems out of place. His performance as the cowardly bookie is good, but it belongs in a different film, and seems to come from another era. Jean Hagen does nicely in her underwritten role as Hayden's (shall we say) woman friend. The ending is calculated, for sure, and yet haunting none the less. Huston gets the viewer where he wants him. He has things to say, and like all good directors he shows us rather than tells us what it is. A brilliant film, moving and sad. It's not for children, and unlikely to become a holiday favorite.",

            "content": "THE FILM: 1950. John Huston isn't exactly \"hot stuff\". His new project has no big name actors, and a plot that could have depressed anyone. It is about a bank robbery, and it's after effects. Not exactly box-office gold. Another problem. Star Sterling Hayden was a communist, and both him and Huston are on The Committee for the First Amendment. It seemed as if the studio just wanted to see what would happen. Good thing Huston pulled it off.THE PLOT: \"Doc\" Riedenschnieder has just been released from prison. He is considered one of the foremost criminal masterminds of the time.Immediately after his release he is itching to pull of another heist, his last. Then he plans to retire to Mexico, he recruits heavy Dix. It's a Jewellery store robbery, and he knows he can do it, he just needs someone who will be able to sell the Jewels after the Robbery. He turns to Emmerich, a rich family man, who runs little things on the side, like having an affair with a beautiful blonde.Unfortunately for Doc, Emmerich plans to double-cross him after the heist, and Doc knows it, but he goes on anyways. He recruits some other men, and at the same time Dix finds himself in a relationship with a woman whom he doesn't love, but who is devoted to him. SPOILERS. The heist doesn't come off the way Doc planned and he is faced with multiple double crosses and the cops on his trail. In other words, it's a typical Noir.THE CRITICISM:John Huston was born for Noir. He defined the genre with The Maltese Falcon, and his sharp wit and attention to detail was a perfect match to that film's sharp and direct dialog. Here he works in the genre, but not in the tradition of films like The Big Sleep or Falcon, where there is some happiness. No, here no one is happy. They are greedy and selfish, and perhaps only Jean Hagen is the only non-cynical character, yet even she has an unhealthy selfish desire to nurture, to love Dix.There is no hope in The Asphalt Jungle, it is one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. It is also one of the most realistic films ever to come out of Hollywood. The gritty, hopeless city presented here could be any major city in the US. New York, Los Angeles, Miami, it could be set in any of those. These characters have been rotting from the inside out, and their insatiable greed and lust can only lead to their destruction.Yet you feel sorrow, you want them to have some kind of happy ending, and that is one thing that these people will never have. That brings me to the performances, uniformly excellent. Huston had a great knack for getting great performances out of actors, and this is no exception. Hayden has always been a unique actor. On his face is etched the pain and suffering of thirty odd years in the crime racket. You get the sense that he is running on fumes.Hagen is, as I mentioned above terrific, she is one-minded in her obsession with Dix. Louis Calhern is slimy and, despite his good-guy act, he is rotting from the inside. His affair with Marilyn Monroe is just a way for him to embrace his true slimy nature. When he is questioned by the police, you can see him desperately trying to get himself out of the situation, lying until he can lie no more.Also good is Sam Jaffe as Doc and James Whitmore. The film barely has a score, which may be due to artistic intent or laziness, but the lack of score reinforces the gritty reality of the film. The cinematography is amazing, delving in the shadows and murky depths that define Noir.And finally the direction. As I mentioned above, Huston keeps it realistic, with little to no artistic flourishes, and it works completely. Huston was the perfect match for the material, and it certainly pays off.The Asphalt Jungle, 1950, Starring: Sterling Hayden, Jean Hagen and Louis Calhern Directed by John Huston 9.5/10 (A)(This is part of an ongoing project to watch and review every John Huston movie, you can find this and other reviews at http://everyjohnhustonmovie.blogspot.ca/)",

            "content": "This is one real classic and great heist movie. It has all the typical genre elements present and a great, oh so important, dark and gritty atmosphere. This is crime/film-noir at its very best!\"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a quite typical heist movie with all the formulaic characters and elements present in it. I however really like the approach of this movie on its story. It provides us a view in the dark violent criminal underworld of the '50's and it chooses to not really have a main character. Instead the story focuses on all of the major players that are involved in the heist; before, during and after. It makes every plot line and character just as engaging and interesting as the other. It makes \"The Asphalt Jungle\" a consistently powerful crime/film-noir that is filled with all the necessary elements, such as backstabbing characters and honor amongst thieves. Combine that with a perfectly dark and gritty atmosphere and the end result is one of the most consistent and engaging heist movies ever created, if not the best of all time.The story is told really well. Instead of having only fast paced action sequences, the movie maintains a steady pace during its entire running time. It doesn't make one moment slow or the other fast, it instead is a very consistent movie that thanks to its steady pace doesn't ever have any boring or too slow moments, like often is the case with movies from the same period. Also the fact that it focuses on more than one storyline or character, makes the movie even more interesting to follow. Due to this, every event and character in the movie becomes just as interesting and engaging as the other. The formulaic screenplay is made really interesting and powerful thanks to John Huston his refreshing directing and take on the story. He makes the story look more exciting, tense and engaging than it was on paper. It makes the character introductions, the heist itself and its aftermath work all extremely well and the one just as powerful and interesting as the other. It's certainly one of the most consistently great movies I have ever seen.Like you would expect from a genre movie like this, the atmosphere plays a very important role for the movie. This particular movie does have a great atmosphere. It's deliciously dark and gritty and has some great cinematography and use of light, done by Harold Rosson, who was one of the very best cinematographers of his period. The musical score by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa is also wonderful, though its unfortunately not often enough present in the movie.Film-noir's always are very straight-forward and have a certain feel of realism. The movie is not only realistic due to it's atmosphere but it's also mainly very realistic, due to its character treatment, dialog and well cast actors.The acting in this movie is great. The actors in this movie are by no means some of the greatest that ever lived but they all suite their roles extremely well. Especially Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley is fantastic. Very raw and tough. Also really well cast were Sam Jaffe, Louis Calhern and Jean Hagen. Marilyn Monroe is also really good in this movie. She doesn't play a very large role but her presence is big and impressive enough to leave a lasting impression.Impressive, realistic, gritty heist movie in typical film-noir style brilliantly directed by John Huston. An absolute must-see for the fans of the genre.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The Asphalt Jungle (1950) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a group of robbers, hand-offs, murder, betrayal and a determined detective out to get to the bottom of what, whom and how. Can the thieves escape with their loot, or will they stall for dames and allow the coppers to catch-up to them and bring them to justice?This movie is directed by legend John Huston (Chinatown) and stars Sterling Hayden (The Godfather), Jean Hagen (Adam's Rib), Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot), James Whitmore (The Shawshank Redemption), Sam Jaffe (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and John McIntire (Psycho).The settings, era, props, attire and look are perfect. The sound effects and background music are also very good. The cast delivers outstanding performances, and their body language and demeanor were brilliant. There are great camera angles and use of lighting in this as well. The initial \"sweet kid\" kiss was painful to watch, and Marilyn was a smoke show. The wife subplot is sad, and the overall plot is well paced and unfolds perfectly. The ending and outcome of each character also fits the genre and movies from this era.Overall, this is a well-done depiction of the criminal underworld during this era. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend it. Asphalt Jungle is definitely a classic.",

With old world urbanity and an implied first rate education, he could easily be a tenured professor at Heidelburg. But occasionally, another side of him surfaces. When he speaks of killing a cop being as being a \"bad rap\", and suggesting to Emmerich that he contact the insurance company for a ransom to buy back the jewelry, ( a plot point in the much later heist film \"Heat\"), he seems to have spent most of his life in crime. Of course , there have been many similar characters in movies, but what makes him unique is his obvious predilection for young girls. In the most memorable scene, he dallies too long at a roadhouse because he wants to watch a nubile girl jitterbugging to a jukebox, and is subsequently nabbed by the cops. This psychosexual enigma, expertly delineated by Sam Jaffe, bears a closer look as one of cinema's most intriguing characters. Contrast this character with Emmerich, the corrupt defense attorney. He too is fascinated with much younger women, but he realizes his lusts with a vapid mistress in her 20's. Hardly a unique situation, of course, but Doc's voyeurism and Emmerich's lechery both lead to their downfall.",

Burnett (Little Caesar, High Sierra), it's directed by John Huston (Maltese Falcon, Key Largo) and features a score by Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa who would win 3 Oscars from 17 nominations for his film contributions. The film also has a great ensemble cast including; Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, Brad Dexter and Marilyn Monroe in one of her first roles. With a collaboration such as this, it hardly seems surprising that they made such an effective film, but there are many examples where such combinations did not succeed.Here we have a diverse group of men, coming together to commit a major heist with considerable planning and preparation to avoid any snags, but of course few such endeavors ever seem to go as planned, especially in movies. The planning is the responsibility of \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Jaffe), who seems more like a professor than a man who has just been released from jail. The muscle is supplied by Dix (Hayden), a more complex man than appearances might suggest who has both dreams and problems of his own. The financing comes from a desperate and corrupt lawyer named Emmerich (Louis Calhern). We also have the hunchbacked driver Gus Minissi (Whitmore), as well as a safe cracker and the groups go-between a bookie, all with stories of their own.In a fairly limited role as Emmerich's much younger other woman we have Marilyn, while Hagen plays the girl in Dix's life who just happens to go by the name Doll.It is the films atmosphere and style particularly, including but not limited to the cinematography and the score, that mark this film distinctly as Noir, and not just a run of the mill Noir but one of genres best examples. The films writing and performances also contribute to creating a true classic.

            "review_title": "Strong film noir heist film",
            "content": "Directed by John Huston, this noir heist film is strong and well-balanced. The main characters in the caper are well-developed - the brain, an older German-American guy who has just gotten out of prison (Sam Jaffe), the safecracker with a wife and little baby (Anthony Caruso), the driver, a hunchbacked diner owner (James Whitmore), and the southern-fried muscleman (Sterling Hayden). They are brought together by a bookie (Marc Lawrence), and plan to fence the jewels they steal to a rich lawyer (Louis Calhern).To describe what happens would be to spoil the film, but suffice to say that even the best laid plans are fraught with peril, and unexpected events. I appreciated how Huston spent the time developing the characters and kept the story tight, without resorting to excess violence or plot twists. You still get the usual sorts of things - snappy dialogue, tense standoffs, double-crosses, etc - but it all feels intelligent. There are extended periods in the film without any background music, which I found refreshing. Each scene contributes to the story, and there is a spare feeling to the visuals, both of which make it feel authentic.There is also a human element in the relationship Caruso has with his wife (Teresa Celli), and in Whitmore standing up to comments about his deformity. It's a small moment in the movie, but it's quietly powerful when he says with dignity, \"What I carry on my back, I was born with it. I didn't grow it myself.\" Also humanizing are the separate dreams Jaffe and Hayden have of running away from it all afterwards (Jaffe to Mexico to be in the warm weather and 'young girls', ok, ugh; Hayden to re-purchase his family farm in Kentucky). Everyone has a weakness, a flaw, but at the same time, a positive attribute. Jaffe is smart and a gentleman criminal, but he's also a pervert. Hayden is tough and the opposite of greedy, but he's also a compulsive gambler (and loser) at the horse races.Huston also shows us bad police behavior - pushing a witness to make a false ID, accepting a payoff from the bookie, and using their muscle when under pressure to make arrests. I loved how this was balanced by a little segment with the police radio from the commissioner (John McIntire), who flicks the calls of distress on one by one, and then points out: \"People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped. And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year. And that's not exceptional, that's usual. It's the same in every city of the modern world. But suppose we had no police force, good or bad. Suppose we had...just silence. Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer. The battle's finished. The jungle wins. The predatory beasts take over. Think about it.\"As a side bonus to all of this, you get Marilyn Monroe in a small role as Calhern's mistress. She was just 24, and this film, along with \"All About Eve\" from the same year, were the ones that started generating serious attention for her. Her performance is uneven at best, but when she turns on the charm with Calhern, or asks one of the cops \"Do I have to talk to him? Couldn't I just talk to you?\", her face so naturally assuming the look of a little girl, she's electric.There's also a wonderful dance sequence from a young girl (Helene Stanley) in a diner, who cuts loose in a very charming way after given a bunch of change for the jukebox. What a fun moment that is, maybe my favorite in the entire film, and how it fit into the plot and Jaffe's proclivities is very clever. My only small criticism is with Sterling Hayden, who got top billing, but just didn't resonate with me. I think it was something about the way he spoke, which seemed too 'heavy', if that makes any sense. Jean Hagen as his girlfriend was just average too. Calhern is brilliant as the shady lawyer, and the rest of the cast turn in solid performances. I considered a slightly higher rating, since you can so clearly see the effect this film had on others which would follow (Rififi from 1955 comes immediately to mind). Solid film.",

            "review_title": "Don't Look for Tarzan and Jane Here",
            "content": "Lately, I've been watching so many mediocre and, yes, really bad films that I needed to sit down and write out a short list of the essential elements in the making of a good movie. Even after many viewings, this movie actually improves with each look. No, they don't make them like this anymore. Here is the brief list that I composed:1. Good writing: In this case, the screenplay by Ben Maddow and John Huston, the director, provides outstanding dialogue that is both lean and powerful. Almost every word has a purpose, revealing important information about each character or explaining the background as well as the action that is to follow.2. Careful casting and a successful delivery by very talented actors: Without exception, every member of this cast has an important contribution to the overall success of the product. As a viewer, I sense that they are energized by each other as a team and inspired by the excellent material that they are delivering to us.3. Direction: Having written the script so conscientiously with Maddow, John Huston deserves a second commendation as director. He was responsible for bringing together the various components, including all of the different people mentioned in the credits, in order to create one seamless product. The technical skills behind the effective use of the camera and the muted lighting, which creates a general sense of gloom, should never be taken for granted.This is by no means the jungle of Tarzan and Jane. This is a jungle inhabited by flawed human beings who are doomed to self-destruction from the very start. Although the extremely bleak opening scenes are of the City of Cincinnati, I did not hear its actual name mentioned even once during the film. As Chief Hardy (John McIntire) states in his ending monologue, it would be unfair to single out one particular American city because the locale could have been any number of cities of its size in the US at the time. The fact that Doc asks the taxi driver to drive him to Cleveland is another hint at the film's locale.As to the superb acting in this film, Louis Calhern especially stands out as Emmerich, the sleazy lawyer who is bankrupt not only financially but also morally and spiritually. As disagreeable as this character is, Calhern's stellar performance allows the viewer to witness the humiliation of a man who was once regarded as \"respectable\" by his community. His own adoring, bed-ridden wife, adeptly played by Dorothy Tree, seems to be in total denial of the true extent of his corruption. To me, Calhern brilliantly conveys the ruin of a man once highly esteemed but suddenly reduced to the lowest depth of utter disgrace.The acting accolades could go on and on, including James Whitmore as the disabled getaway man who is simmering internally with violent rage, Jean Hagen as Doll, the devoted but very lost and lonely girlfriend of Dix (Sterling Hayden), and Mark Lawrence as Cobby, the small-time criminal who finds himself way over his head, possibly for the first time in his slimy life. No review should omit the work of Sterling Hayden as Dix, the \"hick hooligan\" with the exploding inner rage of a man who despises his fate, having been thrust into a hostile, urban world that he never wanted but where he nevertheless must struggle to survive by means of criminal activity, the only way that he knows. Then there is Sam Jaffe as Doc, the sophisticated mastermind of the caper who is very smart but not smart enough to delay his plan to a time when he is no longer a recently released, radioactive ex-con. \"Oh, the girls in Mexico!\" he exclaims to his newest set of associates. Within the overall sense of doom and gloom we realize early that he will never make it to his perceived paradise and must instead settle for the fleeting, seductive 1950 jitterbug dance of a small town Ohio teenager at a roadside jukebox. More misery awaits yet another pathetic inhabitant of the human jungle. And what about Marilyn Monroe, who literally lights up the screen, albeit briefly, in an otherwise dark, drab, and depressing world?Other reviewers have mentioned the absence of music, especially during the caper itself. How else would we hear the early sounds of the police sirens in the distance that so ominously announce approaching doom? The most important music surges at the end when Dix, the urban misfit, finally comes home to the horse country of Kentucky, surrounded at last by a group of magnificent, inquisitive creatures in a peaceful, pastoral scene that dramatically contrasts the ugliness and alienation of the asphalt jungle that he so despised.",

            "content": "Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is a career criminal who's just gotten out of jail. But he has a plan for a major heist that he's been nurturing for a long time. With the help of shady lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) and antsy bookie Cobby (Marc Lawrence), he assembles his team: Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), a safecracker, Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), the getaway driver, and \"Dix\" Handley (Sterling Hayden), who will be used for muscle. The heist doesn't exactly go off without a hitch, and things only keep unravelling from there.This picture is held in high regard as one of *the* great noir / heist films, and this viewer can see why. It sets a template that many other pictures have followed, and itself has been remade three times under different titles. This viewer is partial to this type of story, as it's always proved fascinating to watch a team being assembled for a mission or crime, with each member picked for their particular skills. Here, we get the set-up for the crime, the execution, and the extended aftermath.What plays a large part in the overall impact is the entertainment value of the characters. \"Dix\" gets the most character development, and a tough guy role like this is a natural for the stoic Hayden, who actually grins and bears it for *days* while suffering from a gunshot wound! Jaffe is a standout as the genial old criminal mastermind, who likewise handles crisis situations without losing his head. The superb supporting cast also includes an adorable Jean Hagen as our leading mans' gal pal, John McIntire as the police commissioner, Barry Kelley as a corrupt detective, Brad Dexter as Emmerichs' strong-arm man, and none other than budding starlet Marilyn Monroe as Emmerichs' girlfriend & alibi.This is as good a story about characters sealing their fate through their flaws & ambitions as one will ever see. Emmerich in particular is quite interesting, considering the pickle he's in and his weaselly attempt at conniving his way out of it. He also has one of the best lines when he says that \"crime is merely a left-handed form of human endeavour\".Occasionally amusing, this is mostly a sober, poignant tale with a very affecting ending.Co-scripted (from a novel by W.R. Burnett) and directed by master filmmaker John Huston, a man with a truly impressive filmmaking resume that spanned four decades.10 out of 10.",

The story was adapted from a novel by W.R. Burnett. The screenplay credits go to John Huston and Ben Maddow. Huston also directed the film. The music was created by Miklos Rozsa while the director of photography was Harold Rosson.It has an outstanding cast including Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagan, James Whitmore, Barry Kelley and John McIntire.Supporting cast include: Sam Jaffe, Marc Lawrence, Brad Dexter, Anthony Caruso and Marilyn Monroe.Sam Jaffe is the brains behind the \"heist\" concept and sells the plan to Louis Calhern.

Also, Sterling Hayden could have been a good guy if circumstances had not undermined him early on. The police were also human figures. And finally we see the true beauty that was Marilyn Monroe.

            "content": "The film focuses around Hayden's character, but also gives a lot of time for characterization to many of the other characters. That's one area where it has a lot of charm. This film features the classic \"heist\" of course, but truly focuses more on the relationships of the characters, which is where it gets its \"noir\" aspects. Hayden and Hagen's characters have a particularly intriguing relationship. Hagen is great in a very non-\"fatale\" role -- more reminiscent of the characters that Claire Trevor played for many years. Calhern is at his best here, absolutely convincing us he's the type of pathetic man who would attempt a double-cross. Also features an early cameo by Marilyn Monroe, very attractive here and in a suitable role.p.s. additional comments 10/5/07:This is one of John Huston's best films, admirable for excellent performances and a nearly perfect economy of storytelling. There are many interesting angles to cover when looking at this film \u0096 each character could almost be the star of his or her own movie, right down to minor ones like the cop Ditrich (Barry Kelley) and desperately needy but sweet glamour girl Angela (Marilyn Monroe). In fact in the end the main thing I take from this film, other than the pleasure of the heist and its tragic consequences, is this sense that each character has his or her own great weakness but also great potential, so that in the end the tragedy of the dissolving caper is heightened enormously by these contradicting motives and desires. For example I just love the resolution for Dr. Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), taken to prison because he spent a few extra minutes watching a teenage girl shake her hips to the jukebox. And it's absolutely delicious to watch the transition that Louis Calhern affects (as the bankroller/traitor Lon Emmerich) after his accomplice is easily dispatched by \"hooligan\" Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden). Hayden is thought of by many, perhaps even among his admirers, as a one-note performer. But he plays that one note so well that when the role is right, as it is here, he's absolutely the best thing in the movie. I really like his chemistry with Jean Hagen, who plays a kind of girlfriend of his. I find it intriguing how so many people dismiss him by using the word \"hooligan\" as a kind of generic sobriquet\u0085 also Emmerich's accomplice calls him a \"hick.\" The only characters who treat Dix as an individual instead of a type are Doll (Hagen), Gus (James Whitemore) and Reidenschneider. It was the doctor's idea to involve Dix in the heist, and it's clear he was impressed with Dix's candor and pride when humiliated by the small-time hustler \u0096 He sees Dix right away as someone who will not tolerate foul play and enlists him to help ensure that Emmerich will pay. The upper-class characters speak very derisively about Dix whenever he's not around, almost portraying him in an inhuman way. And then most surprising (and to me, pleasing) of all even the Police Commissioner (John McIntyre) speaks about him in a way that is totally dehumanizing. He gives a long speech towards the very end which sounds very impressive but is thoroughly stupid if you think about it \u0096 basically the whole point of his speech is that we shouldn't complain about corrupt policemen because we'd be a lot worse off if there were no police at all. As if no middle ground exists! Huston actually subverts the direct effect of this speech by having the Commish immediately disparage Dix as a person, saying he is a \"hooligan\" (there's that word again) and that he has \"no feelings, no emotions\", something that we the audience know to be completely untrue and which is starkly contradicted by the very next scene. The amount of depth that this type of writing brings to the story is impossible to exaggerate. This film was also somewhat revolutionary in the deliberately relaxed and low-key style of the heist itself, which significantly occurs at about the half-way point in the film and is visually stylized in a way similar to silent film. Rosza's score is pretty unobtrusive throughout the bulk of the film, but even that is silenced for this memorable caper. The subversive speech by the commissioner is really not an anomaly in this film \u0096 it's a closing statement of the film's thesis. I'm sure that some moralists in 1950 would have condemned the film for romanticizing ruthless outlaws. But this perspective would only apply to someone who thinks anything other than fire and brimstone moralizing about crime is romantic. The film does not aggrandize the criminals; it humanizes them. The prominent character flaws for each character do not act, as they do in so many \"gangster\" films, as a barrier to separate us from the criminal element \u0096 in fact quite the opposite. These people are not, as the commish would have us believe, only a sum total of their violent and anti-social behavior. Nor is their crime itself the sum total or product of their personalities \u0096 I think this is why Huston so carefully de-emphasized their emotions and desires during the heist. Most heist movies before \"Asphalt Jungle\" would show us the flaws in the characters and then show at the climactic heist how their weaknesses led to failure. But this film was different in that it allowed for a separation between the criminal and the crime, just as there is a difference between say a Janitor and a pile of garbage. Crime is just their job, a means to an end (\"the left handed form of human endeavor,\" as one character aptly puts it) \u0096 their downfall is the direct product of their human frailties, and not directly related to the crime itself.",

Getting a small gang together with a backer to put up money and arrange for a fence is no problem and soon the job approaches. However when the time comes to pull the caper things are not what they seem; a double-cross in planned and things get messed up in the mix. Soon the gang are trying to get out from under the cops (clean and dirty) and other players.Although it will seem tame by those raised on Reservoir Dogs, Killing Zoe and similar films, Asphalt Jungle stands up today as a tough and classy heist movie. The plot is the standard \"job gone wrong\" fare but it is classy, patient and enjoyable. I would have liked it to be a bit shorter and slicker but it is still good, taking its time with each character to plot the collapse of the gang. Despite not being as graphic or as tight as, say, Reservoir Dogs the film is still tough and gritty. The dialogue is where it is at most of the time but the direction also helps \u0096 lots of atmosphere in the lighting and lots of tension produced by Huston's tight direction.The cast is far from being starry but are still very impressive. The ever-underrated Hayden is typically strong although he has been better in other films. He is tough and imposing and he makes a big impact in one of the main roles. Jaffe is good and the criminals are well rounded out by Calhern, Whitmore and a few others. McIntire is good as the Commissioner but Kelley is better as the corrupt cop. Monroe has a minor role but she isn't worth tuning in for to be honest.Overall a classy and professional heist movie that has stood the test of time really well. It may not be as shocking or fast as modern versions but it is still tough and engaging. The direction is strong and the cast make up for a lack of star power by turning in strong genre performances.",

Can't say there's an appealing character in the bunch, nor any major star, both of which are unusual and brave choices. The film is a perfect example of the right director paired with the right film. Other films, such as \"Freud,\" were not quite suited to the talents of this marvelous director.I will take issue with a couple of things. I did glance at the other comments, so I know I'm in murky waters here. I always thought Sterling Hayden was a terrible actor. He did nothing in this film to convince me otherwise. His line readings are all the same - barked - right along with his facial expression. Perhaps he was supposed to be a sympathetic character but for me, he wasn't. He was, however, pathetic, so he was successful there. I found Jean Hagen a bit too overwrought. In the midst of the restrained performances of Louis Calhern and Sam Jaffe, she seemed out of place. That couple did not work for me.The rest of the cast, however, is sensational. The film contains an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe, who pays Emmerich's mistress. She is super gorgeous. One of my favorite parts of the film occurs when one of the detectives is sent to interrogate her about her alibi. When he returns, John McIntyre asks, \"Was she convincing?\" \"Oh, yes, sir, she convinced me very much,\" he answers.The Asphalt Jungle is a great example of film noir in the hands of a master.",

This is the archetypal gangster film which paved the way for the forthcoming films of this league to come. \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) by Quentin Tarantino, \"Face\" (1997) by Antonia Bird, \"Ni Pour Ni Contre (Bien Au Contraire\" (2003) by C\u00e9dric Klapisch, Jean Pierre Melville's cold detective films (who used to be a great admirer of the film) owe John Huston's sparkling black diamond a great deal. This giant in American cinema left canonical works in some cinematographic genres, our present film for the detective genre, \"the Maltese Falcon\" (1941) for the film noir, \"the Treasure of Sierra Madre\" (1948) for the western. It will probably surprise some if I write that in the fifties the Young Turks of \"les Cahiers Du Cin\u00e9ma\" excluded him from the Pantheon of the greatest filmmakers. Andr\u00e9 Bazin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut called him \"a shirker\"!A doctor \"Doc\" Riedenschneider who's just been released from prison decides to commit a break-in with the help of a bunch of ruffians and an unscrupulous lawyer Emmerich to finance the affair. In reality, he's ruined. Of course, things won't go as planned and everything will go unravel after the job. This kind of story could only seduce Huston who surely saw it as an opportunity to develop his set of themes centered on failure. Even when he makes his plans, Riedenschneider's affair is bound to fail. Apart from this, Huston shrouded his film with a sultry, sticky atmosphere. Black and white scenery help to give the film its pernicious charm. Huston perfectly succeeds in recreating a town tangled up in bribery, gangster attacks and the police has trouble to maintain law and order. I particularly enjoy the sequence when the police head in front of the journalists turns on the radios which reveal bad news revolving around gangster attacks.Needless to add that all the actors live up to their respective characters. Their delineation is so strong that they nearly count more than the plot itself. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a must-have in your DVD collection if you want to include some John Huston gems in it.",

True, a little bit of astute editing would help the pace no end. Some tedious reminiscences about his early life in Kentucky by not-so Sterling Hayden could go for a start, even though this is tied in with the way overlong, drawn-out concluding scenes. They need trimming too. Script and director also let us down earlier in the movie in an exactly similar fashion when they telegraph how Sam Jaffe will be captured and then proceed to show us what they've already told us. Credibility is also strained when McIntyre's police commissioner emerges as a comic figure. This was no doubt intentional, but it's a distraction nonetheless. Fortunately, Monroe's role though not over-large, is certainly memorable. Back in 1950, M-G-M didn't consider Marilyn important enough to even mention in the Press Book or on the poster art. When the film was re-issued in 1954, however, Marilyn was suddenly promoted to above-the-title billing. In fact, the film took twice as much money on re-issue than it did on original release.",

            "content": "John Huston directed this film two years after making KEY LARGO (1948) and one year before THE African QUEEN (1951). The film is chiefly of importance for the sizzling performance of the young Marilyn Munroe in a supporting role as the mistress of Louis Calhern, whom she kisses in the film, despite his prickly moustache, with a good deal of ardour, despite his being zillions of years older than her and certainly being one of the least kissable screen actors of his day. Munroe's affectation of jaw-dropping naivet\u00e9 and simple-mindedness is shockingly convincing, as all her dumb blonde characteristics always were in films. She really stands out in this film despite still being an unknown actress. The script of this film is brilliant, and the dialogue is crisp and effective at all times. Everyone in the film except for the Police Commissioner (a lone, honest figure in a sea of sewage), and a pathetic girl who is in love with Sterling Hayden without his noticing, is amoral, corrupt, vicious, avaricious, violent, unfeeling, dishonest, double-crossing or triple-crossing, selfish, egotistical, greedy, and despicable in every way. One wonders why anyone wants to make films about such people, but then it is done every day to great popular acclaim, which says a lot about humanity. The film is, therefore, truly about a jungle. All the beasts of prey are on the loose and eating each other. Huston was always a talented director, and he makes this film compelling and fascinating to watch, a bit like a visit to the Reptile House in the zoo. Huston was a sadistic personality who liked to watch people suffer, and here he has an entire cast to torment, so he must have been very happy. (At least no one cuts off her nipples with scissors, as Julie Harris did in REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE (1967), which is a relief, and also no horses are tortured as in THE MISFITS (1961), and the masochistic Montgomery Clift was not in the cast for Huston to hospitalize and then visit afterwards with flowers as he liked to do, or a masochistic James Agee to drive to a premature heart attack.) Sam Jaffe does an excellent job of playing a brilliant criminal who has just been released after seven years 'behind the walls' in prison, and immediately plans an ingenious heist. He dresses impeccably and affects the airs of a gentleman. His performance is truly remarkable, especially the scene where he loses all track of time because he becomes entranced with a young girl doing the jitterbug to a juke box, with tragic results. The film is littered with rich irony, much of it very subtle indeed. In a way, it is an intellectual work, though unquestionably a study in evil which ends up apologizing for much of it. As Louis Calhern says in a sober reflective moment: 'Crime is really just a left-handed form of human endeavour.' I fear this moral relativism is at the basis of this entire film, and seems to have been accepted by writers, producer, and director. In other words, this film is rotten at its heart.",

            "content": "I was thinking about my summary line quote as it applied to the principal characters, and was struck by the way Sterling Hayden's Dix Handley came out of the picture. His vice, if you can call it that, was playing the small time hooligan with a desire to make it back home to reacquire the family horse farm. Yet in parting company with Doc Reidenschneider (Sam Jaffe), he didn't want any part of the stolen loot. There was something almost admirable about that and it puzzled me for the remainder of the story.Many reviewers here call this picture an exceptional example of film noir, and it has those elements to be sure, but I see it more as a caper film, one of the earliest of the genre that would eventually give rise to such modern day flicks as \"Inside Man\" and the 'Ocean' films. Today, the writing and cinematography produces a much slicker product, but it's hard to replace the kind of gritty realism found in Fifties era filmmaking done in stark black and white, especially with characters who exhibit varying shades of gray. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) would be the best example of that here, a respectable lawyer and citizen on the outside, and a two-timing, conniving crook on the inside.Say, remember that scene when the cops came calling on Emmerich after Brannom's (Brad Dexter) body was fished out of the river. They produced the list of 'clients' that Brannom was strong arming for his boss, but to my thinking, that flimsy piece of paper would have been unreadable after hitting the drink. Ever see a handwritten note after it's gotten wet? As great as all the characters were in the film, wouldn't it have been cool if Strother Martin had more to do here than just show up for the police lineup at the beginning of the picture? And when all was said and done, Marilyn Monroe wasn't on screen for that much longer considering the fact that you see her prominently positioned in promotional pieces for the film. I have to admit, watching her kiss old Emmerich was a little jarring, but probably not as bad as planting one on Sam Giancana a decade later. Seeing a slim Marilyn in this early role was also an interesting contrast to her more full bodied look in 1953's \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and 1959's \"Some Like it Hot\".Anyway, this is one of those movies all serious cinema fans should get to see at least one time. Director John Huston gets terrific performances out of his players, as the characters slowly unravel due to the old double cross and unintended consequences. With no disrespect to southpaws, it's a masterful treatment of 'crime as the left handed form of human endeavor'.",

            "content": "Marilyn Monroe lights up the screen in The Asphalt Jungle. Unfortunately she's only on the screen for around five minutes. And the rest of the film disappoints. It's a simple heist film. We see the plotting of the caper, we see the caper take place, we see the aftermath. None of this is particularly interesting. The caper is meticulously planned. All that planning doesn't make for much entertainment, you really wish the film would hurry itself along to some action. Then the action comes and just as quickly goes. The execution of the caper has its moments, there is some tension and drama. But afterwards the drama drains away as we just wait for each conspirator to meet his fate. The caper was not executed perfectly, there were some problems. And even more problems await our burglars. Their little caper seems to have fallen apart. And the movie falls apart too.For a heist film there is very little excitement to be had here. The whole thing is very dry. Sterling Hayden plays Dix, the member of the gang the film ends up focusing on most of all. And Hayden is dry as dry can be, there is no personality or life in the role. In playing Doc, who masterminds the heist, Sam Jaffe is a little more interesting. But he, like everyone else in the film, is encumbered with some rather lousy dialogue. Everything is clipped and clunky and highly unnatural. The third key player is Louis Calhern, playing a lawyer who agrees to finance the caper even though he is actually completely broke. This of course ends up causing all kinds of complications. At least this character brings Monroe into the picture, playing his young mistress. Monroe adds a little spark into the proceedings but it's not nearly enough to salvage the film. The whole last half of the film plods along with a sense of inevitability to it. It turns into a 1950s morality play, look at what happens to dastardly criminals. The one detective we meet in the film is totally corrupt. But that doesn't stop the police commissioner from late on in the film launching into a ridiculously preachy speech about how wonderful the police are. By this point in the film you might be stifling yawns. The film really drags as it heads for the finish. The Asphalt Jungle is a highly regarded film but honestly it is hard to see why. There is very little entertainment on offer in this incredibly overrated film.",

A movie that surely influenced Stanley Kubrick (the Killing, which came 6 years later feels so similar, and not just for the common presence of Sterling Hayden), and ultimately directors like Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.Solid plot. Good set up, introducing the main characters, the plan...and then we see how it unfolds.From the word go Huston creates a seedy, moody, fatalistic atmosphere. The use of black & white goes a long way to creating this atmosphere.However, while the pacing and focus is spot-on for the first 60% of the movie, it does feel like it drifts a bit towards the end. Too many unnecessary detours, or lingering on certain scenes.Solid performances all round. Interesting to note the appearance of an early-career Marilyn Monroe, in a not-insignificant, but not major, supporting role.",

The theme behind works well today, the bleak city, a group of assorted criminals and fringe characters, trying to survive.James Whitmore as \"Gus Minissi\" is the first character we are introduced to, he runs a down and out caf\u00e9, helps Dix (Sterling Hayden) hide his gun when he comes in to hide after a robbery. He tells Dix to ...\"watch out for the happiness boys\"...(cops).The sets are believable and dreary. Sam Jaffe as \"Doc Reidenschneider\", a man who wants to plan his final jewel heist so he may live in Mexico to chase the pretty girls and live out his few remaining years.Louis Calhern as crooked attorney Alonzo (\"Lon\") Emmerich. Marilyn Monroe in a small bit part as his mistress Angela. The part of Emmerich's wife is well portrayed also by Dorothy Tree, ...\"oh Lon, can't we just stay home and play casino\"..., she begs him for some attention as he goes out to see his mistress, or plan yet another heist Sterling Hayden, as a guy just trying to get back to his farm in Kentucky, if he can only just get money to get back there. His father died, and his favorite coal black mare died. There is a sadness to this, the desperation. Jean Hagen as \"Doll Canavan\", a woman who works a cheesy clip joints just to make a dollar.Overall the characters here assemble a perfect cast. The American noir landscape at this time was stark, there was little future for any of these characters. This art of this film-making is lost.Having recently watched a noir imitation \"The Black Dahlia\" just reminds us how actors today cannot recreate the indelible era and feelings of the 1940's and 1950's. This is a must see, directed by John Huston. 10/10.",

            "content": "Spoilers. I don't know if this would have the same impact on a viewer watching it for the first time on TV today because this sort of caper movie has been imitated so many times in the years since 1950. There have been a thousand variations it. And they're easy to dream up because the formula has an almost mechanical quality to it. A bunch of people of different backgrounds and personalities are thrown together to endure a common ordeal.It goes back farther than \"Stagecoach,\" itself ripped off from De Maupassant. But what makes this special is the very neat way the changes are rung, and the way the settings and actions are illuminated. Everybody has a tragic weakness, except maybe the Police Commissioner played by John MacIntyre, a snarling self-righteous bore. (Maybe that's a weakness.) \"Bear down harder\" on the underworld, he orders a corrupt cop; \"Bust 'em up! Tear out the phones!\" Dix, the \"hooligan\", is played by Sterling Hayden. Whatever happened to him? He had a bit of talent but threw it away and never joined the Mt. Rushmore ranks of giant he-men like Wayne and Mitchum. I remember reading an ad he had placed in a San Francisco newspaper: \"Wanted: a crew to man and woman my yacht. Come along and have a Baltic Ball. No experience necessary.\" Can you believe it? His autobiographical book, \"Wanderer,\" the name of that yacht, is actually fairly well written, engrossing even. He also wrote one or two seafaring novels later in life, when his recognition quotient had already been spent. In this film, one of the burglars is a family man with a sick kid. Another is the pavid and perspiring financier and so forth. The most interesting is Sam Jaffe as Doc Riemenschneider, contintentally polite, intelligent, eminently pragmatic, just out from \"behind ze valls,\" with a penchant for teenaged girls. When informed that his socially and politically prominent backer has just killed himself rather than be tried and jailed, he muses, \"I vunder vy he did such a thing. He vouldn't have gotten more than two years.\" The next most interesting character is that prominent venture capitalist, Mister Emmerich, Louis Calhern, who does very nicely by the part. A financially exhausted weakling he is finally found out. (The cops beat a confession out of one of the participants -- nice touch.) Calhern is relaxing on his couch, his \"niece\" Marilyn Monroe curled in his lap, and he's smoking a cigarette and wearing a distracted look as the police begin pounding on his door. \"Who can that be at this time of night?\" asks Marilyn. \"Uncle Lon, I'm afraid.\" Calhern doesn't even glance at her but continues puffing serenely until he rises in a leisurely way and goes to answer the destiny waiting for him on the other side of the door. There are simply too many good things about this movie to go on at length about them. I will mention one. After a brief introduction, there is a shot of a smoggy city street with a gallery on the right, starkly empty, like a de Chirico painting, everything slightly off kilter. Dix is in long shot walking towards the camera. A police car cruises slowly down a cross street and Dix moves quickly behind one of the posts and waits there until the car disappears. An adumbration of things to come, that smog, that bleak urban void. In 1950 the crooks couldn't get away with it, so they all die or wind up in jail. At the end, the bleeding Dix is again wandering off alone into the Kentucky blue grass he once called home. He dies in long shot. (Imagine that! No close up. No last words in the arms of the lady who loves him: \"Looks like I sprung a leak, Baby. We'll -- we'll have to postpone that retirement to Cancun.\") Instead, his beloved horses surround him and nudge his corpse curiously. This is a crime movie with four shooting deaths. Know how many shots are fired on screen? Three. Today the ordinance they'd use in filming those deaths would fill an armory, and the bodies would be reduced to shreds. This was Huston's last crime film, and he moved on to other things, but few of them were better than his effort here.",

Emmerich (Louis Calhern) fence the jewels and then the half million that they can get for the million dollars worth of jewels will be split among them.Dix (Sterling Hayden) is described as a crude hooligan, yet he strikes up a friendship with the erudite worldy Doc. Also when a clip joint Dix robbed causes one of his female friends to become homeless, he gives her a shelter for the night and a couple of dollars. Gus feeds homeless cats and stands up for those less fortunate because of his deformed back and how it has always made him feel like an outcast. Louie is crazy about his wife and child.

It does indeed seem to be a \"left handed form of human endeavor\" to all of them.And yet there are a couple of double crosses in the film, although what makes the whole heist start to fall apart are more a couple of weird occurrences than anything else.I guess the only off-putting scene to me was when John McIntire, as police commissioner Hardy, has to seguey into a \"Crime Does Not Pay\" style monologue about the importance of the police in keeping order.

            "review_title": "Huston's Jungle",
            "content": "I must take points for creativity and style away from Jules Dassin for his heist film \"Rififi\" (1955), since I had no idea when I first saw that movie how liberally Dassin borrowed from John Huston's \"The Asphalt Jungle,\" released five years earlier.Not only is the heist sequence itself in \"Rififi\" reminiscent of the heist sequence in \"Jungle,\" but the entire tone and theme of Dassin's film is lifted in whole from Huston's picture. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" stands apart from other films in the crime/thriller genre that enjoyed a boom in Hollywood's post-war years, because Huston sets out to humanize his criminals. The characters that pepper his film are not the hard-boiled smooth operators that normally appear in films of this sort, but rather are a batch of very flawed men who, for one reason or another, latch on to a big-time jewelry heist as a last resort. If I had to pick a theme for \"The Asphalt Jungle,\" it would be the theme of middle-aged male desperation.The commentary on the DVD for this film is virtually worthless (as happens far too frequently on DVD commentary tracks, the speaker spends all of his time telling you what a great film \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is without ever getting around to telling you why), but one point that did strike me was the suggestion that World War II was responsible for making the transition from average citizen to underworld criminal easier, because it blurred moral boundaries, and that's definitely present in Huston's film. These guys are dads, husbands and boyfriends; they have jobs, at least one is a prominent citizen. They have people who depend on them: kids, wives, lovers. But they're also criminals, and they don't seem to have any moral qualms about being so. This more than anything is the most scathing critique \"Jungle\" makes about post-war American life, and it had to be a bitter and even shocking pill for audiences at the time to swallow.The film's visual style doesn't strike one as overly fancy at a first viewing, but watching it again I was struck more by Huston's mise-en-scene. The opening shots show Sterling Hayden's character walking through an unnamed Midwestern city at dawn---it literally looks bombed out and deserted, hardly a coincidence on Huston's part I'm sure. Huston is fond of claustrophobic compositions: characters' faces are frequently trapped in the frame in extreme close ups. He's also fond of depth of field; there's always some sort of background action competing for attention with what's going on in the foreground. Sometimes I think his style is a bit too grandiose and obvious, like he's trying too hard to create the kind of compositions film classes will study later on, but mostly it's a striking film.As for the acting, Sam Jaffe walked away with the film's only acting nomination granted by the Academy, playing the mastermind of the jewelry heist, but in my mind it's Louis Calhern who gives the best performance, as a high-society social figure desperately trying to hang on to his standard of living despite bankruptcy and an invalid wife. Sterling Hayden is not as good in his role as the small-time thug, though he has some sweet moments with both girlfriend Jean Hagen and Jaffe. James Whitmore shines in a small role as Hayden's friend and driver of the getaway car. There's a fascinating moment involving him, a cat and a rude customer that is just one example of how Huston adds little brush strokes of humanity and idiosyncrasy to these characters. And Marilyn Monroe has a couple of scenes, doing a horrible job with them as usual. I really admire \"The Asphalt Jungle\" without loving it. I always feel that way about John Huston's movies, I think because his approach to creating a visual style is ever so slightly academic---his films feel very studied. But it is a fine film, and should not be missed by anyone interested in the evolution of post-war cinema.Grade: A-",

While this method of film-making was all the rage in the forties and fifties; it's now all but fizzled out, and all we get nowadays, if anything, is the largely inferior style of 'neo-noir'. However, it's always good to get the chance to see a true classic of the style, and that is certainly what this film is. After contributing massively to the success of the style in 1941 with the classic 'The Maltese Falcon', Huston would prove nine years later that film noir was still his sub-genre. The film is a multi-layered crime spectacle, that works as much from it's plot as it does from the motivations of it's characters. That's the way to a great crime movie - it must have enough plot to ensure that the film remains thrilling, while at the same time it must have enough character to make sure that the audience doesn't become bored. The Asphalt Jungle could be a blueprint for this idea.The film is spectacularly well put together throughout, and it aptly shows the immense talent of it's director and all of the stars. While the cast isn't made up of big names, they all perform to their best and the result is an ensemble cast that are all assured enough in what they're doing to do it well. The Asphalt Jungle is one of those great classic films that work as a result of the acting, and not because of any special effects are shocking plot developments. It's just the sort of movie that modern cinema could use more of. John Huston's direction is flawless and the story moves in a way that is constantly inventive and interesting because of this. The film noir style is most famous for it's foreboding atmosphere and dark character actions, and this entry into the style has more than it's fair share of both. The film breathes a sort of cool that is far more subtle than the cool shown by modern day directors such as Quentin Tarantino, and is much more cool for that reason.

He said it was \"Full of Nasty Ugly People Doing Nasty Ugly Things\". He's right of course, but that was the intent. John Huston had been working at Warner Brothers for years and they first made their reputation making hard boiled gangster pictures that were full of ugly people doing ugly things. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" was a departure for MGM and also a harbinger of things to come. It's full of good stuff, from a wonderful cast of recognizable character actors, (some of them in small roles). If you watch a lot of 50's and 60's TV, you'll recognize virtually the entire cast, many of whom were just breaking into Hollywood at the time, James Whitmore, John McIntyre, Anthony Caruso, Brad Dexter, Ray Teal- even Gene Evans and Strother Martin are in there somewhere, according to the cast listing. There are lots of close-ups, often with the main action going on behind the face, and a lot of nice touches like the horse player winding up among the horses. It's clearly a very influential film.\tIt's also a long, dreary, sad ride. The characters, except Jaffe, who is a fatalist, have a desperate air to them.

This is often described as the first \"caper film\" but it lacks the charm and fun of a good caper film, in which the characters are clever and confident. it's a crime film but lacks the over the top performances of something like the same year's \"White Heat\".

Sterling Hayden, the first-billed star of the film, equivocally the leading man among the motley crew, is not the brain, but a trustworthy hooligan, suitably amplifying his simplistic kindheartedness by exposing himself to his girl friend (the moderately-used Jean Hagen) of his stroke of bad luck and his humble-but-never-realized dream (which Huston cleverly opts as the heart-rending culmination) under the veneer of his stalwart physique.Sam Jaffe, who acquired his one and only Oscar nomination (the film altogether got 4 nominations including a BEST DIRECTOR for Huston) for the role of Doc, the constantly behind- the-wall mastermind, has another sort of fatalistic empathy through his non-violent, genteel policy which is simply the otherness for a perpetrator, he is a born leader, who welds a collection of gifted offenders into a real team, the only thing he misses it luck. Louis Calhern, the paymaster and the fence, ostensibly well-off, but bankrupted, is the major mis-step of the heist, Calhern's commonly understated performance finds the right place as he is juggling between his wife and his trophy mistress (a 24-year-old Monroe, whose striking sheen cannot be overlooked even in such a minor role). The film is feasibly an agitprop of police department, although the coppers are neither over- beautified nor disparaging represented (unlike the present mockery trend), it emits a pertinent point-of-view of their functions and liabilities, Huston is the torchbearer of the American neorealism, and I hope this assertion can stand its ground.",

Emmerich, aka 'Uncle Lon' for Marilyn Monroe.This sentence summarizes the very spirit that conducts thieves' actions and alone elevates caper films as probably the most defining of all the crime sub-genres: it's all about finding justifications for selfish actions. Indeed, the basis for crime is less vileness than selfishness, call it greed, personal accomplishment, money, it's always egos talking. A criminal is naturally selfish and the vileness is only the consequence of a visceral absence of empathy.This is why \"honor among thieves\" works as an oxymoron, honor is by essence deprived from anything money-oriented or egotistical, therefore even the most meticulously set-up and ingenuously constructed plan, is meant to fail sooner or later, a criminal can't get over his true nature, which implies the lack of honor. Take all the classic dramatic heist movies (I won't list them to avoid spoilers), they ALL fail, it's not a golden rule, but otherwise, it would contradict the very essence of crime (getting money for noble cause is hardly what motivates gangsters and thieves when they steal jewels).Now, how can this doom be such an obligatory element without providing a sense of predictability? Simply because it's never about heists, it's all about characters, Melville knew that, Kubrick did and before them, Huston. The element of failure is the only redeeming quality a criminal can afford, without it, there couldn't become sympathetic antiheroes. A gangster can only inspire by the way he tries to rise himself above his condition with morality and principles, only be betrayed by less ethical persons, villains within villain plot-wise. The big sister of failure is a notion always cherished by the film-noir genre: fatality. So, it's not surprising that the greatest caper films belong to the noir genre and that \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a landmark since there is no heist film that you can't connect with it. It's not surprising either that it's precisely John Huston who introduced all the formulas of the perfect-crime-that-ultimately-fails, since most of his films dealt directly or indirectly with failures and losers: \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", \"The Misfits\", \"The Night of the Iguana\" ... Huston had a unique ability to provide an extraordinarily tragic dimension to low-life characters. Emmerich's quote foreshadows a treachery, even more saddening, because it's caused by the greed of one person, and worsened when the intermediary, Cobby, the weakling bookie played by Mark Lawrence, rats about the heist.Still, and this is what transcends \"The Asphalt Jungle\" into a gripping masterpiece of realism, is that it never falls in the trap of Manichaeism, Huston's writing and directing provides to each character a human touch inviting us to feel some sympathy. Emmerich is the most heart breaking because he only betrays the team by necessity not by personal greed, what's more; encouraged by a unscrupulous detective played by Brad Dexter. Emmerich is broke after having wasted money by loaning money and make a sweet kid played by Marilyn Monroe -in one of her first roles, as the doll face who'd call hum 'Uncle Lon'- feel like a man, who still 'had it', whatever it was. Her unforgettable alibi couldn't fool the cops. Unable to get his money back, and to match his reputation, he was doom. They all were.In this film so rich of distinct personalities, the one who managed to get himself an Oscar nomination, the great character actor Sam Jaffe as Erwin 'Doc' Riedenschneider, dreamed of Mexico, a paradise of sun and pretty girls, a benign and comprehensible appetite that would cause his demise. He who was the mastermind, anticipating Emmerich's double-cross and every single detail, let a small weakness cause his demise. Starting from his very choice of intermediary, Cobby as the one whose lack of honor made him put the deathblow when threatened by a corrupt officer, he resigned himself to give all the names: Louis Ciavelli, the safe-cracker (Anthony Caruso), Gus, the hunchbacked getaway driver (James Whitmore in a remarkable performance), 'Doc', and the pillar of the film: Sterling Hayden as Dix Handley.Sterling Hayden, with his gravelly voice and sensual lower-lip, embodies all the torment that can ravage the heart of a hooligan, the bad-conscience in a good heart. Heart is important because it commands love and empathy, therefore principles and honor, elements that lacked in Cobby, the snitch, who didn't even have enough love to his own self-esteem to shut his mouth. And the tragedy of men like Gus, Dix, Louis and Doc is that they were no less criminal than Cobby, Emmerich or his detective, but they somewhat conveyed the idea of 'honor among thieves', that a man should respect his word, and their doom is that we were ahead of them, anticipating the human factor.Naturally, beyond these existential undertones, the film features a long heist sequence, with no score, no special effects, and an almost documentary-like value that probably remind of Melville's \"Cercle Rouge\", but these ten minutes still foreshadowed the tragedy. After all the precautions taken to avoid the alarm, the explosion caused by the soup (nitro-glycerine) activated other alarms, and cause the intervention of a cop who wounded Ciavelli in an almost tragicomic way. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is about a failure to come, and John Huston transcends the failure by making a film not about a heist, but about characters.Dix wanted the money to buy back the farm of horses lost by his family during the Depression in Kentucky, that's what meant to him the most \u0085 he'll end up surrounded by horses (a scene mirrored in another Melville's masterpiece \"Le Doulos\"), dead while he could have escaped the Police with enough money to live with his girl (Jean Hagen). That's not bad luck, but simply the ironic expression of fatality, the stuff the greatest caper and noir films are made of",

            "content": "I am willing to try all the films in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and this was one from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director John Huston (The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King). Basically Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Bedknobs and Broomsticks' Oscar nominated Sam Jaffe) has been recently released from prison, and he is already planning the next great robbery in a jewellery. He begins by gathering a crack team of criminals to assist him, including tough guy Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), bar owner and driver Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), and family man and safe-cracker Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso). Then the robbery plan is put in motion starting with how things will play out on the night, and the Doc turns to financial backer Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern) to help pay for everything they will need for the robbery. So it comes to the night, and everything goes according to plan, they manage to get away with the jewels with only one being wounded. The next day Doc wants Emmerich to buy the jewels, but he doesn't have the money to pay them, and he did try to convince them he can look after them until he can pay. Slowly each member of the robbery team are double crossing each other as the police begin their enquiries, with alibis and whereabouts not all matching, and one by one, each will be eventually caught or killed. Also starring Jean Hagen as Doll Conovan, John McIntire as Police Commissioner Hardy, Marc Lawrence as Cobby, Barry Kelley as Lt. Ditrich, Teresa Celli as Maria Ciavelli, a slowly rising Marilyn Monroe as Angela Phinlay, William 'Wee Willie' Davis as Timmons, Dorothy Tree as May Emmerich, Brad Dexter as Bob Brannom and John Maxwell as Dr. Swanson. All the performances are perfect, Jaffe stands out as the robbery mastermind, Hagen is a great husky moll, and Monroe is beautiful with her not very blonde hair and timid character, an important role for her. As for the film itself, there is enough action and some good thrills to keep you hooked, it is described as the film that inspires all heist movies, and I can see why, a great near film noir crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay.

One of my favorite films. I attended east it movie a lot of times. One of managing John Huston's best works. It is rare we find a written (of Ben Maddow and John Huston) as exquisite as this \u0097 pays attention to the dialogs. In a scene, Sam Jaffe says: \"The crime is a missed form of the human\" effort. The characters are excellent:: Doc, mentor of the plan, only wants to contain with \"key of gold\" its career; Dix, a big, strong man and not very intelligent; Emmerich, experienced, intelligent subject and bad luck; Doll, the pretty and unhappy girl, despised by its dear Dix; Gus, owner of the bar, is always prepared to collaborate with its friends; commissary Hardy, an implacable policeman; Louis, an undecided criminal between the family and the crime; Angela, the lover, ignorant and faithful girl; and May, wife of Emmerich, a very ingenuous woman. The cast is correct, with prominence for veteran Sam Jaffe, Sterling Hayden with its tired face, and Louis Calhern interpreting with excellence lawyer Emmerich. I believe that Marilyn Monroe and Brad Dexter just leave the tone when compared with the rest of the cast. The wonderful illumination should be highlighted in black-and-white of Harold Rosson \u0097 a director of photography that marked time. Perhaps the only scene that I not find very good it is the one of the policeman that is killed by the attackers when they are leaving the bank \u0097 in the rest of the film we see the director it to demonstrate an unquestionable talent. The idyllic end, chosen by Huston, doesn't deteriorate this classic policeman, to the opposite, it only enlarges it. To see and to review always.",

            "review_title": "The 110 minutes Marilyn Monroe isn't on the screen are excellent too",
            "content": "With a merely serviceable heist caper at the fore, The Asphalt Jungle could easily be just another standard '50s noir offering: worth watching, but lacking enough original angles to make it stand apart from the glut of noir films lovers of classic black-and-whites have undoubtedly consumed. However, with some great character actors in the fold and a nice set of twists leading to the climax, this film manages to edge its way ahead of many of its contemporaries.The set-up is very simple: Sam Jaffe's Doc (who steals the show), enlists a group of skilled thugs to pull off a heist, which of course goes awry when the plan is foiled by an unexpected security officer, and gets further complicated by the scheming machinations of the caper's financier. Variations of this formula are noir keystones, but Huston injects fresh energy into his casting and execution, which elevates The Asphalt Jungle into the ranks of the better films of the genre.Of course, one of the major selling points for classic film fans is an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe, which is a bit deceptive. (If you note the stills at the top of this IMDb entry, you'll see that Monroe appears in almost all of them). However, Monroe's presence in the film is limited to a pair of scenes and nearly as few minutes, so Marilyn completists won't find much here to supply their fix. But Monroe does excel in this role, and despite her limited screen time, she is certainly breathtaking every time we see her, easily outshining her experienced co-stars by sheer magnetic personality alone. Her more-than-slightly creepy relationship with Louis Calhern's Emmerich (who appears to be about thrice her age) adds an unsettling element to his character, which actually works in the film's favor as the series of double-crosses begin to unfold.Strangely, the weakest link in the cast is the first billed. Sterling Hayden's essay of Dix, the thug with solid-brass honor and brains to match his brawn, is so flat and one-dimensional, it's surprising his name in the film wasn't \"Hood # 2\". I'm not very familiar with Hayden's work, but it's a bit odd that he chose to play this character so brick-faced. While I'm aware that he's supposed to be an intimidating fellow who could shut most men down with a mere glance, the detail and nuance Huston fleshes the character out with as the film goes forward reveals that there is indeed a soul beneath the stony exterior. Hayden never channels that, so even when he's waxing nostalgic about his life as a young farm boy riding horses with his grandpa, he still looks like he's thinking about punching the horse (and maybe grandpa too). To be fair, Dix's most important role in the film is as the heavy who supplies the mettle to Doc's soft-spoken demeanor, and in that capacity, he plays an excellent intimidator.The Asphalt Jungle is certainly not the best offering in the abundant classic noir mold, but it has a lot of heart, and enough clever turns to make it an excellent way to spend a rainy afternoon. Flawed, but still highly recommended.",

All of this was fairly interesting as the plot was intricate and complemented with nice cinematography. Marilyn Monroe has a brief appears in her early days.

Soon the wheels are causing a serious hazard for other road users!What elevates 'The Asphalt Jungle' to the highest echelon of the genre is director, John Huston's astute observation and acute eye for detail, right down to Jean Hagen's false lashes and smudgy eye liner, following a performance of the water works. His penchant for precision and subtlety, personified when a man's fate is decided by the duration of a jazz record.The characters are both clearly defined and starkly contrasting. Louis Calhern is superficially suave and sophisticated, but no more than a promiscuous, penniless pauper in reality, plotting to pot ALL the spoils. His scheme to branch out leaves sick wife (Dorothy Tree) rooted to her bed and being taken for a sap. Sour and dour small time hoodlum, Sterling Hayden, becomes the muscle, the blood and guts of the operation. As the climax approaches the muscle and guts remain largely in tact but the red stuff has gone alarmingly AWOL. A crooked private dick, who wants much more than just a slice of the action and some cynical police corruption are amongst the extra ingredients.It's an arduous trek through abrasive territory, but 'The Asphalt Jungle' remains a landmark noir, which has more than stood the test of time, being justifiably embraced and revered by aficionados of the genre.",

But as Truffaut once said of Renoir, flawed films are often more satisfying than perfect ones - Huston's deterministic vision is narrow and narrowly expressed.

The decade got off running with John Huston's THE ASPHALT JUNGLE in 1950, and ended splendidly as Jack Hawkins' League of Gentlemen assault a downtown London bank, with RIFIFI, the original THE LADYKILLERS, and Stanley Kubrick's THE KILLING sandwiched in between. What made these pictures stand out -and stand the test of time- was that none of these crooks were intended to be matinee idol friendly....well, maybe Hawkins was the exception.In THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, the biggest star affiliated with the project was its director. Huston recently had a pair of hits with KEY LARGO and his Oscar winning THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE -both with Humphrey Bogart. But with THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, Huston decided to forgo Bogie or John Garfield or James Cagney, and instead allow established character actors to shoulder the burden of carrying the film. He cast wayward actor Sterling Hayden in the top billed role of muscleman Dix Handley. Rounding out the remainder was Louis Calhern, Sam Jaffe, James Whitmore, Jean Hagen, and a young starlet getting her start in the industry: Marilyn Monroe.THE ASPHALT JUNGLE takes place in an unnamed Midwest city, where Dix is picked up by the cops for robbery. A native Kentuckian, crime wasn't in his DNA, but he hopes to make a score big enough for him to buy back the family farm, which was lost during the Depression. At the same time Dix is standing in a police lineup -next to an unbilled Strother Martin- a veteran criminal named Doc Riedenschneider (Jaffe) is released from prison after serving a seven year stretch.Before being imprisoned, Doc had been in the process of meticulous planning an elaborate bank robbery. Now that he's out of the big house, he's ready to pick up where he left off, but he doesn't have the funds to mount such an operation. Doc gets in touch with Cobby, a known associate who, in turn, suggests crooked lawyer Alonzo D'Emmerich (Calhern).",

Their main mistake is making a deal with crooked businessman, Alonzo Emmerich(..a sly Louis Calhern whose balance of desperation and treachery is quite impressive as the elegant, affluent world he has always known is in ruin seeking a way to remain in his class through any means possible)who is juggling bad financial decisions such as attending to the needs and desires of his high- maintenance play-pretty(Marilyn Monroe)whose young enough to be his granddaughter and an ill bedridden wife who only wants his time. Jean Hagen has a plum part as a lonely and miserable down-on-her-luck woman who becomes a quiet item with Dix, both needing someone to cling to due to a cruel world that has treated them unkindly. I've seen a ton of caper films modeled after the successful robbery that falls apart at the seems due to a ripple effects of circumstances, such as a gun hitting the floor, going off, and plugging Louis, or Emmerich's plan to kill Doc and his team and take the stolen diamonds, or the money supplier, the weaselly, weak turncoat Cobby(Marc Lawrence, wonderful as the two-faced scoundrel who sweats easily). I think the real star is director John Huston and cinematographer Harold Rosson's eye-popping B&W photography and abilities to capture the fascinating faces of a first-rate cast. Jaffe's scene, where it appears he's about to get away, only to become transfixed with a \"beautiful young girl\" dancing to a tune on a jukebox, or Hayden's unflinching, unwavering goal to make it home to Kentucky, about bled out from a nasty bullet wound, are truly memorable set-pieces. Monroe is va-va-voom, as gorgeous and good-looking as the photography. The use of shadow/night and how characters are presented/framed, these astounding visual touches enhance the rather straight-forward plot. The complications that ensue will probably seem familiar because of how often they were used in others films in the same vein as \"The Asphalt Jungle\".",

As directed by John Huston, it comes across as the kind of crime melodrama you might expect from a studio like Warner Bros. rather than MGM.And Huston has picked a perfect cast for all of the roles in this character-driven crime melodrama--beginning with his three top players, LOUIS CALHERN, STERLING HAYDEN and SAM JAFFE. Each delivers a forceful, completely believable performance that ranks among their best screen work. Calhern manages to inject sympathy into his characterization of a greedy man turning to crime to ward off bankruptcy; Hayden is the hooligan who dreams of returning to his country hick roots and passion for horses; and Jaffe is the extremely well organized ex-con who has an insight into people's strength and weaknesses but is eventually trapped because of his own selfish interest in a young woman that allows police time to track him down.All of them meet their fate in a series of plot turns that are fascinating to watch as the well planned heist eventually goes wrong. MARC LAWRENCE does a stand-out job as a man who sweats when he has to handle money and JEAN HAGEN does an exceptional job as Hayden's girlfriend who just wants to be with him until the end. A winsome looking MARILYN MONROE shines briefly as Calhern's mistress in a role that made fans sit up and take notice. Even at this early stage, the camera clearly loved her mixture of innocence and sexuality.The tension is sustained throughout, even though the Miklos Rozsa score is seldom underscoring the most suspenseful moments. Instead, it's the camera-work and forceful performances that hold center stage throughout and keep the crime caper riveting to watch.Summing up: One of the best heist films you're ever likely to see.

I would argue that he's only fooling himself.When Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) was released from prison he went straight to the city to get financial backing for a lucrative caper. He had an airtight plan to rob a jewelry store. The take would be a million dollars in jewels that he could fence for about $500,000. He only needed $50,000 to hire the right men to execute the plan.He first went to Cobby (Marc Lawrence), a mid-level illegal parlor owner. He ran a betting racket. Cobby didn't have the funds to finance such a job so he put Doc in touch with a bigger hustler named Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern). He was a known fat cat who dabbled in illegal enterprises. Emmerich didn't have the funds available, but he promised Doc a bigger payday than if he went the traditional fence route.Eventually, Doc got the money and the men needed to do the job. He had a driver, Gus (James Whitmore), a safe cracker, Louis (Anthony Caruso), and muscle, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), who got top billing in the movie credits.If the job went without a hitch we wouldn't have a movie. There were several hiccups for Doc and his crew which included unforeseen incidents, accidents, and plain ol' double crossing. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (which we now know of as the concrete jungle) is a good movie. The criminals are of varying types, but they could be looked upon as the protagonists. They were easy to root for. They weren't vicious or violent for the most part and they were good at their craft. Sometimes we appreciate a quality craftsman even if their craft happens to be illegal.",

To bankroll it he goes to lawyer Louis Calhern who has more front than the boardwalk at Atlantic City but in reality hasn't got change of a match so HE comes up with his own plan to keep the jewels boosted by Jaffe, Hayden, Anthony Caruso and James Whitmore, and light out for the territory.

I have seen this a few times and am more enlightened with each viewing.This is a story of a jewel heist put together by a bunch of misfits who through the film get to be understandable and even likable, though one knows they are all doomed from the get go. Sterling Hayden, in the lead by a narrow margin, is a sociopathic one note (or grunt) ex con who is incapable of feeling, one thinks, see how it treats the gorgeous Jean Hagen,but an insight into his character comes when he talks of his love of horses on the farm in which he grew up. This accounts for his addiction to the ponies today, he keeps betting and losing. And stealing to feed his habit.Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern play gang members also and their characters are fully developed, both have a thing for younger women. Louis Calherns' \"niece\" ( and I can hear this nudge-nudge wink-wink subterfuge being specifically put in the movie for the Hayes Office along with a tongue-in-cheek speech made by the Police Commissioner about corrupt cops - imagine 1 in a 100 is corrupt? - hold the sirens!) In jokes to get around the restrictions.A thinner Marilyn Monroe in an early appearance lights up the screen. Star quality all the way. Even when everyone is going down she wants to know if she still gets her free trip, precious.All are worth watching however as a sympathy and compassion are developed for the little bit of back stories we get. The end is uplifting, Dix finally with his beloved horses, Emmerlich realizing he does love his bed-ridden wife. Schneider delaying his escape to watch a young girl gyrate and being captured - this scene was a little too overstated, we already got the picture with the cops staring in the window. Explicating it all was over the top. One of my few criticisms and oh yes that door in the wall when the jewellery store is broken into, right beside the hole that was created. An architectural foobar for the collection.A great front-runner for the many heist movies that were to follow. Beautiful bleak sterile black and white shots full of empty streets and an edge of desperation. 8 out of 10. A must see for the fans of The Maestro Huston and of film noirs in general.",

            "content": "\"The Asphalt Jungle\"\u00a0was not the first film noir to tell its story from the viewpoint of the criminals; \"Double Indemnity\"; for example, had done the same thing a number of years earlier. The\u00a0film does, however, point the way to the future in one respect. It is an early example of a \"heist movie\", that sub-genre of the crime film which deals with the planning, commission and aftermath of a robbery. It is sometimes referred to as a \"caper film\", but that is not a description I would use as I have always associated that term with films like \"The Italian Job\" or the recent \"Ocean's\" franchise which take a much more light-hearted view of the subject than John Huston does here. The action takes place in a Midwestern\u00a0city, probably Chicago. A criminal mastermind named Erwin Riedenschneider is released from prison and immediately sets about planning his next exploit, a jewel robbery. We see how he goes about obtaining the necessary finance from a lawyer named Alonzo Emmerich, via a bookie\u00a0named Cobby, and then recruits the three men who will help him carry out the crime, a professional\u00a0safecracker, a getaway driver and a \"hooligan\". (The word \"hooligan\" would seem to have a wider meaning in the United States that it does in Britain, where it means a young thug or vandal. In this film it means the robbers' strong-arm man who in Britain would be referred to as a \"heavy\"). \u00a0As one might expect of a film made in the days of the Production Code, which forbade film-makers from romanticising crime and from showing the criminals getting away with it, the robbery ends in failure with all of the gang either dead or under arrest. Unlike some crime dramas from this period, however, (such as \"White Heat\"), \"The Asphalt Jungle\"does not really romanticise the police either. The most prominent police officer, Lieutenant Ditrich, is as corrupt as Emmerich, taking bribes to protect Cobby whose bookmaking business is illegal. Moreover, Huston attempts to show the criminals not just as faceless villains but as individuals in their own right, not all of them wholly despicable. Today by far the best known name among the cast would be Marilyn Monroe, but in 1950 she was a little-known young actress and her name did not even appear on the posters. Although her role, that of Emmerich's beautiful young mistress Angela, is a relatively minor one, she makes enough of an impression to allow the discerning viewer to spot an upcoming star in the making. It is interesting to note that in this film, and in some of her other early serious dramas, Monroe speaks with a quite different voice, deeper in tone and less breathless, than the one which she was to use in the comedies which were to become her stock- in-trade during the later part of her career. There is a good performance from Louis Calhern\u00a0(previously best known to me as Julius Caesar in the 1953 production of Shakespeare's play) as the corrupt, cowardly Emmerich, an intelligent, educated man gone to the bad, but the two best contributions probably come from Sam Jaffe as Riedenschneider and Sterling Hayden as the \"hooligan\" Dix Handley. Riedenschneider's name and accent clearly mark him out as a foreigner, probably a German. Like Emmerich he is a clearly intelligent man with some formal education- his nickname is \"Doc\"- who has ended up on the wrong side of the\u00a0law, but unlike Emmerich, who tries unsuccessfully to double-cross his associates, has a certain code of honour. He dislikes violence, for example, and always refuses to carry a gun. I wondered if his Christian name was borrowed from the German General Rommel, another honourable man who nevertheless ended up on the wrong side. (Audiences in 1950, only five years after the end of the war, would have been more alive to such references than modern ones). Dix Handley, whose real name is William, is another man known by a nickname; \"Dix\" is probably derived from \"Dixie\" in a reference to his Southern origins. Dix is motivated by an honourable ambition, that of buying back the family farm in Kentucky that his father lost during the\u00a0Great Depression. His gambling addiction, however, means that Dix has not been able to raise the necessary cash through honest means, so has turned to crime in desperation. Unlike Riedenschneider Dix is capable of violence, but his tenderness towards his girlfriend Doll suggests a softer side to his nature. The film was nominated for four\u00a0Academy Awards, including \"Best Director\" for Huston, \"Best Supporting Actor\" for Jaffe and \"Best Adapted Screenplay\", quite an achievement at a time when film noir was not always appreciated as much as it is today. The fourth nomination was for \"Best Cinematography, Black and White\", and the visual look of the film is certainly impressive, conjuring up a vision of a bleak urban wasteland, the \"asphalt jungle\" of the title, a wasteland whose physical barrenness hints at the moral barrenness of the men who inhabit it. The film might have lost out in all four categories to \"All About Eve\", the Big Film of the year, but it remains a powerful and impressive example of the noir style, one of the best in this particular genre. 8/10",

            "content": "To gain a full appreciation of film noir, you'll have to see 'The Asphalt Jungle' at least once. The John Huston-directed thriller is considered an archetype of the hard-boiled crime genre and has been imitated several times, including as a western.'The Asphalt Jungle' was made in the thick of Hollywood's Production Code, which placed firm limits on content. Considering the restrictions that Huston and co-writer Ben Maddow had to deal with, 'Jungle' is eye-catching in how it moves against the grain of crime films from its era. Huston and Maddow wrote a faithful adaptation of W.R. Burnett's bestselling novel that treats its criminals with an unusual sensitivity as they try to restore order in their confused lives.'Jungle' centers on a gem heist plotted by 'Doc' Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), an aging German crook who has been released from prison. Riedenschneider, who is itching to make one final score and ease into retirement, has spent his days in jail planning out a robbery that would net thousands of dollars for himself and his cohorts. In the film's unnamed city (allusions are made to Cincinnati), he gains help from Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), a heavy who is wanted by police and lives with his friend Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen); Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), a hunchbacked restaurant owner who covers for Dix; and Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), a locksmith who has a knack for cracking safes.Riedenschneider is a meticulous schemer who seems to have everything in place to become a rich man. But he and his colleagues reveal their fatal flaws as matters develop. Riedenschneider, for instance, will forget everything when he sees a good-looking woman and Dix is crazed by his family's loss of their Kentucky horse breeding farm. The story further intertwines with Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern), a once-wealthy businessman who becomes an intermediary for selling off the gems. Marilyn Monroe gives an early career appearance as Angela Phinlay, Emmerich's lover who is cohabiting with his sick wife May (Dorothy Tree). John McIntire (as the police commissioner), Marc Lawrence, Barry Kelley, Teresa Celli (as Louis's wife), and Brad Dexter fill supporting roles in a large cast.Dix and Doll gradually become the focal characters of 'Jungle' as the Kentuckian tries to correct past mistakes and buy his family's farm that was lost years ago. At 6' 5\", Sterling Hayden is a physically dominating man on screen yet softened by Dix's feelings of misgiving. Jean Hagen, who later cemented her reputation in 'Singin' in the Rain,' is perhaps the most effective and sympathetic character of all; as a true friend, she supports Dix every step of the way while her affection is mostly ignored.Huston, as he so often achieved in fifty years of directing, gets strong performances from most of his cast. The leads, especially Hayden, Hagen, Jaffe, and Calhern, give sincere efforts and heighten the story's drama. Nearly two hours long, 'Jungle' moves at a steady pace, devoting the first 45 minutes to Doc's planning of the heist and the last hour to its aftermath. There are simply too many characters for them to be developed thoroughly, but Huston and Maddow succeed in giving them depth on screen. The film's ending is satisfying, if fairly predictable under Production Code restraints.'Jungle,' with its progressive script and very good performances, was nominated for four Oscars, including Jaffe for best actor and Huston for best director. It's nowadays regarded as a classic in film circles, although there are detractors, including myself. While above average for its time, much of the dialogue is clich\u00e9d and many of the conventions are all too familiar for its era. What gives 'Jungle' added life is its take on the criminal psyche, which was usually a subject of malign in Hollywood. Huston and Maddow succeed in making the felons sympathetic by relating to their inner conflicts.'The Asphalt Jungle' has received an acceptable DVD release as part of a five-disc, boxed set from Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment. 'Film Noir Classic Collection,' which includes 'Murder, My Sweet' and 'Gun Crazy,' offers 'Jungle' with a short introductory clip of Huston; a commentary track with film scholar Dr. Drew Casper and excerpts of an interview with James Whitmore; and the theatrical trailer. French dubbing is included with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.'Jungle' is well-presented visually and soundwise. The transfer keeps a sharp contrast between light and dark shades, which helps to preserve the look that is so important in noir films. Sound is fully balanced with clear dialogue and distinct sound effects.Drew Casper, who holds the Hitchcock film chair at USC, gives a commentary that is informative but top-heavy on facts we'd get from an encyclopedia or a Google search. Casper devotes much time to discussing Huston, MGM (particularly Louis B. Mayer's fall from grace), and film noir as a style, which is helpful but overlooks what is happening on screen. He also tends to get wound up on certain elements of the film that I, at least, don't find quite as impressive. The disc jacket plugs his commentary 'with co-star James Whitmore,' but the track only excerpts an older interview of Whitmore at appropriate points.Though not a perfect film and its disc presentation could've been a little more rounded, the Warner/Turner release of 'Jungle' is certainly worth hunting down. Self-proclaimed 'experts' of film noir shouldn't be caught dead without having seen it and the film is likely to entertain anyone with an interest in crime.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.rovingreviewer.blogspot.com",

            "content": "One of John Huston's best pictures, this has the same lean, willowy muscularity of \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Fat City\", whose milieu it shares, (that of hardened men and women existing on the fringes of society), and as a heist movie is comparable to Dassin's \"Rififi\" and Kubrick's \"The Killing\". Doc Riedenschneider, 'The Professor' (Sam Jaffe), comes out of prison with a scheme for the perfect heist; all he needs is to be bankrolled. His path takes him first to the nervous, sweaty stoolie Cobby, (Marc Lawerence) and then to Emmerich, (Louis Calhern), a duplicitous lawyer known for funding such capers. But Emmerich is bankrupt and plans to double-cross the professor. Instantly we can see the downward spiral from the crime itself, (alarms that inexplicably go off), to the falling out among thieves.There isn't a wasted moment in this superbly directed, written, (adapted by Huston and Ben Maddows from the W R Burnett novel, the movie is full of the slang of the criminal underworld), photographed (by Harold Rosson), and acted film. It hinges on four superlative performances. Sterling Hayden's instinctive lug, a 'hooligan', hired for his ability to act tough in a tight situation. Sam Jaffe as the German professor, a cultured little career criminal on one last job. Louis Calhern as Emmerich, a magnificent piece of acting that he has almost certainly never bettered. Emmerich is a man who has had it all, wife, mistress, (a kittenish Marilyn Monroe), several homes and has blown them all. He is on his way out and knows it; he has nothing to lose. And best of all, perhaps, Marc Lawerence as the small-time bookie in way over his head. His performance is probably the definitive 'schmo' in crime pictures and one of the finest by a supporting actor in all of American movies.",

He plans one last heist before retiring. However he needs funds and backing. He finds his way to Alonzo D. Emmerich played by Louis Calhern, a powerful but crooked lawyer who unbeknown to everyone is almost broke. He agrees to bankroll the plan but also schemes to double cross all involved. A web of characters is revealed including strong-arm man, Dix Handley, played by Sterling Hayden. The robbery takes place, but bad luck brings the whole enterprise undone. The weakness of many of the protagonists is exposed, but loyalty and honour is found in some surprising places.Throughout the story, the forces of law and order led by John McIntyre as Commissioner Hardy close in on the lawbreakers. But Hardy also has to deal with corruption within the ranks of the police force. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" has a superb script. Much of the credit for this belongs to W. R. Burnett's novel. It is surprising how much of the dialogue came straight from the book. There are slight differences in the story, but the movie is very much as Burnett wrote it. To give the film its due, the dialogue plays better than it reads, it has a pattern and rhythm that works very well on the screen, testimony to the shadings Huston and company brought to it.It would be hard to find a film with a more perfect cast. There are a number of career best performances in this film. Although Sterling Hayden was never an actor of great range, he was born to play Dix Handley. Handley is tough and dangerous but guided by a personal code of honour \u2013 he gains sympathy as a man forced by circumstances onto a path of crime.All the characters shine in their roles but it is Louis Calhern who steals the movie. As crooked lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich he projects power and menace on the one hand and great weakness on the other. The scene where he attempts to double cross Dix and Doc is mesmerizing as his bluster and confidence wilts under their disbelieving gaze. The betrayal of his bedridden wife is also painful to watch as he plans to flee with stolen gems and his mistress \u2013 he feels guilt over his deceit but is too weak to stop. Sam Jaffe was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor \u2013 he was good, but Louis Calhern was better.Marilyn Monroe in an early role gives the film added piquancy. She plays Emmerich's mistress Angela. \"Consorting with a woman young enough to be his granddaughter\", exhorts a disgusted Commissioner Hardy. The scene where Emmerich kisses her passionately is wince-inducing to say the least. It was a minor part for her, but she is stunning in her few scenes.With classy black and white photography, and location work instead of studio sets, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is gritty and immediate. It had a big influence on crime films of the 1950's but none of its imitators ever came close to surpassing the original.",

Naturally time has passed by some of it but much still remains impactful.The writing steers clear of being flat and expository but the movie aims to be so subtle at times its 'cleverness' slips below even the most perceptive eye or ear. It's also rather unattending towards its characters as it makes a mix of them and then throws the viewer in the middle to try and keep up with them. Still, despite his flaws, there is no question the most intresting is Sterling Hayden. He's utterly irreplaceable and belongs on any short list of the most authenticity tough guys in the movies. But while when you want a mean glare or just someone to stand and look intimidating there's no one better as an actor he's very wooden and actually mediocre at best.Final comments: John Huston's was a quite talented director who unfortunately turned into a hack. Some parts of this film like the in camera lighting is quite stylish but other aspects like those flat shots of backs bring it down a notch.",

            "content": "Just less than ten years after helping giving birth to the film noir genre with The Maltese Falcon, John Huston crafted another masterpiece with The Asphalt Jungle and took the genre to new heights.Genius criminal Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (amusingly played by Sam Jaffe) comes out of prison and already has a plan to pull off a caper on an insurance company. He just needs a few partners and a fence. This gets him involved with two-bit hooligan Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and greedy, double-crossing fence Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern).Like all John Huston movies, The Asphalt Jungle has smart plot twists, likable, rounded characters and cool dialogue. It's hard not to enjoy this movie since it seems to be trying so effortlessly to please the viewer.As an ensemble movie, the whole is bigger than the parts. But special praise is due to Sterling Hayden for his sympathetic performance as a small-time criminal who dreams of going back to his old family ranch; Sam Jaffe for playing one of the funniest and smartest criminals in cinema; and Louis Calhern for playing a ruthless fence trying to get out of bankruptcy through betrayal. Few villains are as cool as he was in this movie.Finally, Miklos Rozsa's scarcely-used (just at the start and at the end) but powerful score deserves a mention for the way it quickly sets up the atmosphere of doom the characters will soon find themselves in. It's this combination of good writing, cool performance and music that makes The Asphalt Jungle a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Huston is always worthwhile for me, and this is the second of his films that changes before my eyes, the first being my rewatch of Maltese Falcon.In both films actors get together to stage a crime story that is our film, actors in the sense of having to hide their identity from the world and often from each other. Both times the center of attention is some ritual shibboleth, a black enameled bird or here a diamond heist, merely the device, the jukebox that gathers dancers together. Falcon wasn't already a noir, though in retrospect we lump it with that group\u2014 its charm was that the actors would recognize and quote each other's role in the music.In Falcon it was a matter of shifting the view from the magician's trick to the wink of performance. Here it is the opposite, a matter of moving the eyes from how the trick is staged to the vanishing act. The heist here is the staging of that vanishing act, the opportunity for players to come together around a plan to bare themselves\u2014one is bankrupt, another fresh out of prison wants one last job before hitting Mexico, another dreams of his father's farm in Kentucky. It matters see that an ominous pall hangs above the whole thing, an existential 'last job' before everyone can attain their idea of peace in the world.Then a gun backfires and the thing slowly falls apart before our eyes. That's when it starts to become a noir, it was not before, and actually helps throw a great deal of light into what noir actually is, not so much a style that suddenly enters the picture but a worldview that emerges in the players. This worldview is on the surface one of weary fatigue and failure, a bit deeper one of losing narrative control and succumbing to hallucination.In particular I am captivated by two scenes here with a very dreamlike air that I want to lift from the film and bring into focus, the fates reserved for the last two members of the gang.One shows the weary old conman who masterminded the story, the author, who stops on the road for one last drink, and there unexpected beauty steals into him, a young girl dancing. The girl's dance is by itself worth the entire film, a marvel\u2014juvenile, spontaneous, naive, true.It's how he holds her in his eyes though for those brief moments by the jukebox that makes it rocket, truly one of the most ecstatic moments in film. Knowing that this whole scene is the old man's dream of Mexico that tauntingly manifests before him, a beautiful girl dancing, knowing at the same time that it reveals in him something that goes beyond sex, a more genuine truth worth staying for, which the girl embodies, the spontaneous capacity for dance that suddenly fills the room, becoming the music for the joy of it.And second is the Kentucky boy's journey back to the farm of childhood, dying on the road and suggestively slipping to that place without ever arriving. It's more simple than the other because he is a more simple soul, but it is the same evocative arriving before oneself.Noir Meter: 3/4",

            "content": "John Huston directs a slick heist movie with well characterised slimeballs but a singular lack of depth or breadth to it's more sympathetic characters.Surprisingly the director fails to raise a single outstanding performance from any cast member although Louis Calhern gives a decently crisp and convincing enough portrayal of the ultimate crook of the piece.A very early appearance from Monroe adds sparkle but the depiction of all the female characters suffers from the same fate as Sterling Hayden's anti-hero protagonist: they all only have one moving part to them.Some of the minor criminals have more meat in their depictions than most of the major players and all of the females.The opening act proceeds along quite nicely, in an almost documentary style, making introductions to the characters that will become embroiled in the schemes later in the picture.The presentation of the various police officers, and of the police in general, is interesting in it's overall treatment but lacking in original or memorable detailing or exaggerated effect.The filming of the \"job\" itself is well done and well played by the actors but the writing requires certain plot mechanics to begin inserting themselves in obvious conceits and conveniences from this stage onward.I liked the showdown with Calhern's top crook character, Alonzo D. Emmerich; as Sterling Hayden says, \"thank God I jumped\"! John Huston shows more of his ability at setting up a scene to shoot, as with the jewellery shop heist sequences itself, than he manages in most of the rest of the film.Some nice cinematography of street scenes, night time locations, and following characters through dim corridors highlights the vision depicted in 'The Asphalt Jungle'.The sound design is well constructed, low key, and befitting the lean style of the drama and the overly lean characters. I was impressed with the audio quality where characters were moving through the scene independently.On balance this is a fine and historically important film which helped to originate the modern heist genre and has a hint of documentary style semi-noir notes in it's tone; which however features a disappointing turn from sometime actor Sterling Hayden whose main contribution is his undoubted physicality, thin character writing, plus transparent plot driving devices, and a director who is surprisingly unsure of how best to use his cast.I rate a strong 6/10 and I'm sure that there is much better work from both Hayden and Huston, I surmise that the two may have had an unproductive creative relationship on this film.I recommend to fans of crime films and 50's hard-boiled drama. I'm not effusive in my praise but this is a really good film in my opinion and well worth watching for anyone with an appreciation for films more than 40 years old.",

            "content": "The Asphalt Jungle (1950) :Short Review -A fine Double Cross between honest and dishonest criminals but slightly unexplored. The double cross theme made it's way through The Asphalt Jungle as if the entire theme didn't deserve some other treatment. I mean there were many films made on similar theme but mostly all of them had positivity around their endings but The Asphalt Jungle has a face off between honest criminals and dishonest ones. Afterall 'The Truth' is expected to win and so does the cops but ain't it contrary to the lead hero formula in hiest films? Well, it's getting interesting. A noir film made to explore double cross between goons somehow traps its own formula in opposite directions, yeah that's definitely interesting. The Asphalt Jungle has gripping story which ultimately kills the potential of climax being something new. We all know the criminals are gonna end up either dead or behind the bars, that's too mainstream man. Talking about the negative factors here, The Asphalt Jungle could have had better entracte portion and more thrilling of course but it doesn't happen. Poor me. There are couple of charcaters in the film who aren't elaborated. The relationship between Dix and Doll isn't vivid and wise enough to understand. Now coming to the positive sides, the Great performances by Sterling Hayden and Sam Jeffe. These 2 somehow gets the sympathy for their characters because they are honest ones while Loius Calhern, Jean Hagen, Marc Lawrence, James Whitmore, Barry Kelly, Anthony Caruso, Teresa Celli and Marilyn Monroe (cameo role) are strictly average. I was expecting too much from John Huston and may be that's why the film looked underwhelming in the second half to me. If it had exploration of the characters done little more than it had actually done then i guess scenerio would have been different. Nevertheless, The Asphalt Jungle is a brilliant dark noir and possibly the pioneer of many films with double cross theme.RATING - 7/10*",

The reviewer went on to say that had he seen it at the time he might of enjoyed it more, but after seeing so many clever heist films, like Ocean's Eleven, this one lacked a sense of humor. I'd have to agree wholeheartedly. I as well have been spoiled by clever heist films. 'The Lavender Hill Mob' or 'Big Deal on Madonna Street' are just so much fun, I found 'The Asphalt Jungle' hard to sit through. It took itself too seriously. The surprises are not that surprising and the one or two twists that should grab you get lost upon delivery, as the viewer is apathetic towards the cause. I've heard this was one of the trendsetting caper films, and if so kudos to John Huston for creating a genre. Beyond that I'd say take it or leave it. Rating : 18 out of 40",

            "review_title": "Heady realism makes up for lack of suspense in iconic director's very well-acted noir",
            "content": "Right away you realize that Asphalt Jungle is no \"B\" list noir. After all, the director is the iconic director John Huston, noted for classic films such as The Maltese Falcon or Treasure of Sierra Madre. The film is about a jewel heist gone bad-it's very much an ensemble piece with a group of strong actors. It's not so much a character study but rather a chronicle of the machinations of these small-time criminals. Nonetheless there's something distinctive about these characters, especially the \"brains\" behind the operation, \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffee), an elderly convict recently paroled and eager to score one last big heist.\nWe're immediately drawn to the \"Doc\" character, as he's a real fish out of water, in comparison to the gang he recruits. How is he able to navigate through a world much tougher than he and come out ahead? That's what we want to see. Doc hooks up with a bookie named Cobby (Marc Lawrence), a colorful Runyonesque character who assists him in putting together his \"mission impossible\" team, also acting as paymaster.\nUltimately the team is assembled consisting of Louie (Anthony Caruso), the safecracker; Gus (James Whitmore), the getaway driver who works behind the counter in a diner during the day, and the \"brawn\" of the team, Dix (Sterling Hayden), who dreams of regaining the horse farm his family lost years ago. Also in the mix is an additional \"intellectual\" character, Emmerich (Louis Cathern), an attorney, who is supposed to bankroll the operation but really has gone bankrupt and plans on double-crossing Doc.\nThe weak part of the script are the roles for the three women here, two of whom are like afterthoughts. Doll (Jean Hagen), Dix's ex-girlfriend, who stays with him early on and later assists in the getaway as well as Emmerich's mistress, Angela (in one of Marilyn Monroe's early roles) playing what basically amounts to the \"dumb blonde.\" Emmerich's wife, May (Dorothy Tree) has a better part (albeit a short one), as the lonely, bedridden outcast from her husband's affections.\nHuston's theme is not only \"crime doesn't pay,\" but the banality of the criminal life. When the gang uses nitroglycerine to blow open the safe they are trying to crack during the heist, that sets off multiple alarms in the neighborhood. Rushing to leave, they encounter a night watchmen whom they knock out but his gun falls to the ground and accidentally goes off, striking Louie the safecracker, eventually leading to his demise.\nWhile Doc cleans out the safe of jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, when they go back and see Emmerich, he admits that he's bankrupt and doesn't have the $50,000 he promised he would obtain to bankroll the operation. Now again the banality of their life of crime takes another dark turn, when the private detective Emmerich had hired, Brannom (Brad Dexter) attempts to steal the loot, only to be gunned down by Dix. The new plan hatched up by Doc, is for Emmerich to approach the insurance companies and offer the jewels for 25% of their value.\nWhat happens next I wouldn't call necessarily \"suspenseful\"; rather, it's interesting. Police Lieutenant Ditritch (Barry Kelley), who had been pressured earlier by the hard-ass Police Commissioner Hardy (John McIntire), for not keeping tabs on Doc and for the increasing crime rate in his precinct in general, beats up Cobby who confesses his involvement in the scheme and also gives up Emmerich. Angela is forced by the police to retract the previous alibi she provided for Emmerich, who then promptly commits suicide.\nThe fates of Doc and Dix are addressed at film's end. Again the theme of the banality of crime rears its ugly head-Doc hires a cabdriver to drive him all the way to Cleveland (presumably from Cincinnati where the narrative takes place) but is side-tracked long enough to leer at a dancing teenager in a bar, which allows two cops passing by to notice and arrest him. No big shootout, nothing extraordinarily suspenseful-simply a heady verisimilitude! Dix, earlier shot by Brannom, is brought to a doctor by Doll, receives a blood transfusion but leaves without seeking further treatment. He dies in the middle of the field of the former family farm surrounded by horses.\nDix's death is the fitting low-key ending for this low-key but highly realistic noir. You'll get your money's worth viewing top notch acting and appreciating a sophisticated script, chronicling the collapse of a decidedly small-time criminal enterprise.",

            "content": "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? John Huston knows, and here he proves it yet again. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is at once a gripping crime drama, a shadowy film noir, and a multiple-character study. It starts out with images of Dix (Sterling Hayden), having just done another hold-up, racing through an empty part of town, in and around corners, to a little place where he can drop off his gun. Gorgeous lighting, the picture of a man on the run. But the running's not over yet.Bit by bit, we're introduced to a big cast of characters. Criminal genius Doc (Sam Jaffe) is just out of jail, there's Cobby, the bookie organizer, Lon Emmerich, the crooked lawyer, Ditrich, the crooked cop, and Gus and Louis and Doll and more. Everybody wants something, and they know just how they're gonna get it: the biggest heist the Middle West has ever seen, with a take as big as half a mil. Jaffe's Doc is a home run. He's got both hubris and pathos at the same time. You love the man- you can't help yourself- even though you know he's nothing but a crook, like all the rest. But he's an old man, and all he wants is to be around the Mexican girls in Mexico City, so he's okay. Plus, he takes a shine to Dix, who just wants to be back on the farm with his father's black colt. Dix may be a hooligan and a brute, but he tries to take care of Doll, and he may be stubborn, but he comes by everything naturally. I didn't want to like Dix- I know I didn't look favorably at Hayden in \"The Killing\" or \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but here he's got this sympathetic idiocy, even if he is a hood.The plan is next to perfect. But crime doesn't pay- it's an incontrovertible fact of the movies (at least under the Production Code), and this wouldn't be the same gritty, low-down, inherently pessimistic film if they all got away with it. There is no honor among thieves, as Emmerich proves- and his PI friend Brannom reinforces the point. These are the respectable characters, with licenses and all, but they're still grimier and more despicable than the convicted criminals who populate the rest of the cast. Emmerich still gets your sympathy, because he's got a sick wife whom (despite the Marilyn Monroe he keeps as a mistress) he truly loves, and he's broke and desperate. Brannom, however, is just a jerk. He ruins the whole deal, especially by getting killed. His body turning up in the river is one of the first tip-offs to the cops, connecting it all with Emmerich and breaking down all the careful planning. Brannom is the greedy, honorless human element that Doc couldn't plan for.Well, Louis gets it on the night of the job, shot in the belly by a security guard's errant gun. Burglar alarms go off for no reason and soon the coppers are hot on their trail. Ditrich, even on Cobby's pay, has got his supervisor breathing down his neck, so he roughs Cobby up until he spills the beans. So we have Doc and Dix hiding out together, eventually going their separate ways. Dix has a bullet wound from Brannom, which is slowly killing him. (He doesn't trust doctors so he dresses it himself.) Doll wants to go with him. He doesn't want her to. She does. Emmerich blows his brains out when he's about to be arrested. This scene is done with a master's touch. You think you can tell what's coming, but you're not sure. Emmerich gets away from the police for a moment to go to his study and write out a note apologizing to his wife. Then he tears up the note, opening up a desk drawer whose contents are obscured by his head. The viewer is briefly distracted, we hear a bang, and the torn-up shreds of the note are swept off the table. It's really shocking.The end comes soon but you grieve for the characters as it does. Doc meets a fellow German who's a taxi driver, and asks him for a ride to Cleveland. They stop in a little diner and Doc gives a teenage girl plenty of nickels so she can dance for a while before his eyes, and before the eyes of the watching police. Time runs out, Doc and the hackie must leave, and the cops accost them as they do. I think Doc knew what was coming. Then Dix arrives at his farm and, with Doll close behind, he slumps down into a field and dies, his beloved horses nuzzling his head. The end, and a powerful end. From beginning to end we see Dix's slow migration from the dark asphalt jungle that is this anonymous, placeless city back to the bucolic countryside of his youth. He is a vessel through which the currents of nature flow. He is a blank slate of a hooligan onto whom we project our care and emotion. Oh, Dix. We hardly knew ye.In the final analysis, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is all in the title. It's about a sad and dirty city, brimming with corruption and huddled masses yearning to breathe free. A few of them do more than yearn- they act. But it's a dead end: action leads only to the grave and to the slammer. Don't watch it unless you're willing to care for the little B&W people gracing the screen for a two hours' traffic, then disappearing into the air around you. It's a movie that's both ethereal and very, very real.",

The Killers was written by Ernest Hemingway and TAJ was directed by John Huston...what could be better? In both, great stars including Sterling Hayden and(the not-yet star) Marilyn Monroe, great stories, great tension build-up, and the very best chiaroscuro effect through the use of B&W film in high contrast. Just outstanding visuals, also crucial to the best noir.As most know the film and the story from other reviews, I would like to briefly state what makes great noir, in my opinion. The best noirs develop story tension to an achingly painful level and sustain it throughout, even to the viewer's great discomfort, as TAJ did so well. They build the strength of the main character at the expense of the weak even as they detail the strong one's march toward inevitable destruction we all know is coming but hope against it all the same. The weak and unfortunate fall one by one by the wayside as the story progresses, giving us hope that the protagonist will prevail even if he is unredeemable but, he seldom if ever does. And, even if he does, he is typically severely damaged goods forever after and often hardly even alive, so is it really prevailing if he lives but is a mere shadow of his former and powerful self? Then, there is the \"gal\"....the one so good that it is hard to believe she can love a man so bad or, the one that is worse than the bad man, playing him treacherously all along for her gain only....no in-between types to confuse the issue of goodness v. badness. These films were made in the morality board days of film-making, and noir got around it in the only way they could....making strong characters very strong and weak characters very weak, and letting the character's looks and glances, but not words, carry the subtle sexual nuances that could not be pinned down as \"morally bad\" enough to censor. The challenge to make great films under those very oppressive circumstances make their accomplishments even that much more impressive.TAJ had all these necessary ingredients for great noir and just the right characters in it......the gal, the brain, the muscle, the weak loser crook trying to look like a big shot, the great and loyal wheel man, the double-crosser, the crooked cop, the crooked private eye, the honest cop....they all were here in spades and made for the best crime noir film made, or at least tied for the award, in my opinion.See TAJ, and see the best of the best crime noir. Also see Sterling Hayden and the great Elijah Cook in The Killing, another terrific noir caper just about as good as this one.",

There is even a point where I feel like I can comprehend what is just around the corner from what is being filmed.Jaffe's Doc Riedenschneider becomes a very charming character, a German man with a great penchant for seeing right through people, as he organizes this job in a very professional and steady manner. Sterling Hayden, in his usual mediocrity, plays a hardened and unhappy thug from Kentucky with gambling trouble who sees the job as a way to bankroll his dream of buying back the horse farm that he lost in the Great Depression. A hunchbacked Italian diner owner is hired as the getaway driver, Anthony Caruso plays a professional safecracker and loyal family man, and Marc Lawrence plays a bookie functioning as the mediator.In a taut 11-minute heist sequence, the criminals confidently carry out the heist in a patient and calm manner. Caruso climbs down into a manhole, pounds his way through a brick wall, climbs the basement stairs to the jewelry store, deactivates the door's alarm and lets in the other thieves, and then heads to the main safe. With care, he slides flat on his back under the electric-eye system, picks the gate's lock, drills holes into the safe's door, gingerly opens a corked bottle of nitroglycerin, and sets off a charge on the jewelry store safe. This is not all technical stuff, as the script is spiced up with some streetwise poetry, such as when they refer to the nitroglycerin as \"the soup.\" And it takes talent to build upon a heist the way The Asphalt Jungle does. As the crooks do all of this, it seems well-planned just as Doc's arrangement of the operation is impressive, really a clever way of building his character. But, though I won't give anything away, we realize despite the thieves' mindsets of desperation and instinct after the heist goes down that these are not wise or reasonable men, or at least that is not the state of mind in which they have operated recently.On the whole, this well-made, hard-boiled crime flick is quite good, and every male character is fashioned well through the actors, script and direction. The females, however, are not granted the same justice. Jean Hagen is a silly token weakling woman for the male character with whom she is coupled to boss her around. And thus my gripe with John Huston. The Asphalt Jungle, yes, is about hardened male criminals, and it is a male bonding picture, neither of which are bad, but there's a difference between a film like The Godfather in which the women \"know their place\" in the depicted traditional hierarchy and film like The Asphalt Jungle in which the only female characters---Marilyn Monroe's blonde squeaky bimbo who one could say ultimately screws things up for one character, Jean Hagen's lapdog of a blindly loyal and submissive quasi-girlfriend of Sterling Hayden's and Teresa Celli, an Italian housewife who only begins to take guff from another male character---are subjugated only because the filmmakers have decided for them to be.There is great instant camaraderie between Sam Jaffe's ideological German mastermind and Sterling Hayden's compulsive Kentucky roughneck. Again, terrific depiction of male bonding, but couldn't there have at least been some depth to the female stick figures squeezed in just for the patronizing reason that the macho realm of the story seems a little dry and insulated without them? The reasons I am blaming Huston for this and not the writers are because I have not read W.R. Burnett's original novel and because Huston, as the director and co- screenwriter, he had every ability to flesh out these wasted women. Nonetheless, The Asphalt Jungle is a decent and entertaining noir that set the standards that Jules Dassin's Rififi would totally shatter only five years later.",

In this relationship, were she is more a daughter from him than his women, she become famous.

She looks all the time a little bit afraid - because its a mens world were she is - (and not her own world). A very good Huston picture and Monroe meets him again, when they would make \"The Misfits\".In the first scene -where she is lying at the couch, the men looks from the top to her - this is traditional in all the scenes with her in this film - men always above!!! Its not feminism picture and she take only a part in this mens world. But as always, Monroe makes of this small part a great event - so her acting is more important than the complete film is.

Sam Jaffe is cool-headed and convincing as the brains behind the operation, while a ragtag cast of backup anti-heroes pay the price as the whole thing slowly starts to unravel. A young Marilyn Monroe makes several scant appearances as nothing more than eye candy, still so green she can barely keep from looking straight into the cameras. It's noteworthy that very few characters are as black and white as the film stock, a trademark of the genre, even if their motivations are ultimately sinister and selfish. A worthwhile slant on the heist picture that's crammed full of smoke and atmosphere, it expertly balances several different faces and pays off each story, most with especially dark consequences. Quite good, but not great, it creates some new conventions while bowing to many others.",

TAJ doesn't fully deserve the wild praise it's been getting from many reviewers on this site.Why is this ? Hard to say. Perhaps it's because the characters in Rififi are more focused and better developed, therefore easier to empathize with. The only really enjoyable actor in TAJ is Louis Calhern. His performance is genuinely subtle. Sam Jaffe isn't bad, but he's slightly one-note. His fixation on pin-ups is simplistic and basically unconvincing. Jules Dassin, as C\u00e9sar \"le Milanais\", was more plausible. Sterling Hayden doesn't act in any of his films. He just is, and he's always the same, although with undoubted presence. The girls were over-the-top. The slangy dialogue is over-wrought, and sounds badly dated.Still, it's worth a watch. I watched it maybe 6 or 7 years ago, and again tonight. All I remembered was Doc's girl obsession, and Dix's final meeting with the horses in the paddock at the end. I was surprised by how good Calhern was, second time around.",

            "review_title": "Credit where credit is due",
            "content": "Let's give credit where credit is due: this is one of the most expertly produced classic film noirs ever made. John Huston, who got his start at no-nonsense Warner Bros. in the 1930s, had all the lavish studio resources of the MGM dream factory at hand when he made this spectacularly staged B&W film in 1950. Most impressive of all is the contribution of long-time studio staff cinematographer Harold Rosson, whose deep-shadow lighting and the use of camera, particularly in low- angle looking up at the faces of the criminals framed in foreground and background, gives the film a look rarely seen before or after in this genre. The ensemble casting has often been cited: Louis Calhern, the suave and corrupt attorney; Marc Lawrence, the squeamish pock-marked bookie; Sam Jaffe, the elegant, cool-headed master-mind with a surprising flaw; Marilyn Monroe as the baby-faced mistress; Sterling Hayden as the homicidal killer with a dream; Jean Hagen as his loving but not too smart girl-friend. They are all perfect. Perhaps the unsung hero of all of this is the man least remembered, the writer W.R. Burnett whose novel was the source of Huston's screenplay with Ben Maddow. Burnett, who wrote the original book, the screenplay or both of many crime classics including this film, Scarface and High Sierra, had an amazing talent for humanizing society's criminals, managing to make us sympathize and understand the most unsavory characters. No better example of this is the character Hayden plays. This film undoubtedly influenced Stanley Kubrick--not only in the way the story is told, but in its startling photography.",

Lastly, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" may not be voted as the best heist film in the world but it can surely be considered best heist film ever produced by a Hollywood studio.There are not many who would protest when somebody reveals that Jules Dassin's Rififi can rightly be called one of the best heist film ever made in the world.",

            "review_title": "\"It's a matter of temperament\"",
            "content": "All cinema, whether it be funny or serious, exciting or atmospheric, light-hearted or gritty, should be an experience of some sort, and one which draws the audience into its world. The set of stylings known as film noir are often analysed for their amoral subversiveness, their vivid and often quotable dialogue, and their chiaroscuro lighting amongst other things. However, if properly put together, a good film noir will also draw the audience into the experience of that world of loose ethics, dark interiors and overwhelming pessimism. The Asphalt Jungle is a pretty fine example.Director John Huston made quite a few of the best-known and most highly regarded film noirs, and it is in the noirs that his strengths as a director seem to shine through strongest. In The Asphalt Jungle we first encounter Sam Jaffe, a modest yet fully culpable criminal, in a narrow and dimly-lit corridor, the camera tracking along behind him. From that point on the whole visual scheme of the picture is based on narrowness and movement in depth. Almost every shot has one character looming in the foreground, while someone else is in the background, often with an open door or window behind them to give an even more distant vanishing point. This effectively presents us with both a close-up and a mid-shot simultaneously, something often done with the advantage of widescreen, but which Huston did all the time in fullscreen. The closeness of foreground and background figures and the massive depth of the image help to create this feeling of being in a tunnel. The camera is often still, with the only movement being pans and tilts. This means that, if for example the camera is at the level of someone seated, when they stand up the camera tilts back so that they appear to be standing over us. The effect is palpably disconcerting, but also gives us a feeling of being within the action, as if the characters were right in our faces and the walls were all around us.The effect that these actors have upon us is a powerful one, because they portray extremely colourful and disturbing characters, but do so in a very understated and believable manner. Sterling Hayden gives what is probably his career best, displaying menace in a way that seems very over-the-top because it is so powerful, and yet is really composed of very small gestures and inflections. The glare he gives the witness in the ID parade scene is genuinely intimidating. Louis Calhern gives a typically steady performance. As the only member of the gang not a hardened criminal, he is in some ways a gateway for the audience into empathising with the gangsters, and he neatly handles the important job of making us understand his motivations and feel his concerns. The other great player here is Sam Jaffe. It's nice to see Jaffe in a (relatively) normal and human role rather than one that takes advantage of his small and wizened appearance. He plays the heist's sophisticated mastermind with a casualness that makes him passable as an ordinary citizen, and yet the love for money and young women that drives him to darker deeds is also noticeably close to the surface.The final facet that makes The Asphalt Jungle such a compelling picture for audiences is that, despite all its pessimism, it is in fact not entirely a bombardment of cynicism. The thuggish Hayden's cherished childhood memory of horse riding, Calhern's love for his bedridden wife, James Whitmore's endurance of taunts about his disability \u2013 these things all serve to give the picture a touch of the bittersweet. Granted, it has no true moments of happiness or peace, but it is the suggestion that these characters could have enjoyed happier lives gives The Asphalt Jungle a sense of tragedy which holds our interest and gives some meaning to the story as it unfolds before us.",

Dix, does not like foreigners but impresses the German doctor while Doll, his woman, pines for his love and affection which he doles out in very small quantities. He was similar to the character Roy Earle in Burnett's High Sierra. Like Earle, Dix also longs for the pastoral world of his childhood which is now gone.Another character, Emmerich, a lawyer who has a thing for young women is the closest to a villain in the book. But his relationship with his ageing wife and his desperate attempts to salvage his finances and life evokes some sympathy. Characterization is one of the novels strong points. Burnett assembles a bunch of doomed and desperate men and women from various walks of American life and throw them together.

The acting is first rate considering that everyone is playing stock characters and the storytelling is very sharp even though you know where it's all going.  The second the safe-cracker starts fretting about his baby kid during a meeting discussing the job, you know he's gonna be the first to get it - though it's still a bit of a sad surprise when he does and his death sets up one of the best jokes in the film.As befits a noir, everyone is tainted in this film.  The hero is a petty crook who's a cheap and convenient hire for gang of more ambitious thieves, `financed' by a spineless lawyer who is planning to double cross them.  But Huston invests each of them with some level of honesty and vulnerability that eventually catches up with them.  By contrast, the Police Commissioner is never given a moment of kindness for us to relate to.  Instead he gives a gives a truly bizarre speech where he shows reporters that people to him are a squawking gibberish of numbers that come out of box when he flips a switch.  Compared to that (or the spectacle of his cruel, self-righteous satisfaction arresting Emmerich and intimidating his mistress) even the sordid shootout over the briefcase seems like a deeply touching human drama, esp. when Dix cries out `Are you a man, or what? Trying to gyp and double-cross with no guts for it. What's inside of you? What's keeping you alive?'  Latter in the film, a country doctor with the same near-mechanical manner as the Commissioner matter-of-factly notes that Dix hasn't got enough blood in him to keep a chicken alive.  Like the Commissioner's earlier claim that Dix is a person `without human feeling or mercy,' it's obvious that the doctor's words reflect more on himself than Dix.  One could go on about all the great scenes in this film, but the whole thing is so well put together.  The acting is fantastic, the photography is exquisitely ominous, the pacing and direction of the story are very tight. Not sure if I prefer Asphalt Jungle to Melville's work or Dassin's `Riffifi.'  Might have to see it a few more times.  (It definitely makes Mann's `Heat' look too sentimental and high gloss to be sincere.)",

Jaffe's character makes it very clear that he could have got away had he not given in to a certain weakness, while Sterling Hayden's character is stuck in childhood trauma.

This realistic, documentary-like, urban heist film has amazing cinematography where the deeper shadows help hide the night.",

            "content": "Back in Film Noir's heyday, films released in this style were considered B-movies. Not in this case. Fresh off his Oscar win for The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Director John Huston took the helm of The Asphalt Jungle. The budget may not have been high, but the cast; sharp dialog and film technique used by Huston is top notch.TAJ is a caper noir movie. The entire film is shot from the thieves' point of view. Sterling Hayden plays Dix Handley, a real scary bastard. When he shouts \"Don't bone me!\" to a bookie at the beginning of the movie you can understand why he was hired as the \"muscle.\" Hayden is a mainstay in film noir and he's excellent here. He doesn't seem all that bright. All he seems to care about is the old ranch he grew up on back in his childhood. Between losing money on the ponies and apparently committing small crimes, he and his burger-flipping friend (played by James Whitmore) are hired to help your usual assortment of caper crooks knock over a jewelry store. The heist is great. Shot without music and in real time, Huston not only makes you feel like you're there but you feel like you've just learned how to rob a jewelry store! The great film heist in Rififi was clearly influenced by Asphalt.The movie also features an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe in just her seventh film. She never looked better.Hayden is probably best known by modern film viewers as the scary bastard of a police officer in The Godfather. Can anyone forget Hayden being shot by Michael? His gruesome face twitching while choking on blood will stay with me forever.Without a doubt, The Asphalt Jungle is a classic. I'm trying not to give away too much of the film, because it's worth the rental. TAJ inspired many heist films including Rififi, The Ladykillers, Odds Against Tomorrow and Hayden's The Killing.\"He hasn't got enough blood left in him to keep a chicken alive.\"",

A jewelry store heist planned by professional thieves goes wrong almost from the get-go, hope draining quicker than corpusles from a leaky crook (Sterling Hayden).The absence of realities, replaced by pure fictions (an honest Commissioner {McIntire} who gets results and makes a great speech {\"silence\"}, a Doll {Hagen} not \"dyed and vicious\" who refuses a hot diamond and Dix letting dirty dog Dex get the jump) only boslters the movie's anti-crime message, but unlike the more mundane drama Naked-City (48), the likeable characters and director Huston's psycho-analytical camera (Rosson) in tell of what makes bad guys tick, marks TAJ the Majal of all crime-dramas (#ItsNotNoirAndThatsOK). Budding beauty Monroe acts in support as the guileless goomar to Calhern's greedy lawyer assigned to move the swag, yet has disingenuously been made the movie's motif in present-day DVD box designs because sex sells. But Angela is a fine portrayal, one of the legendary Marilyn's best (\"I almost bought a white {swimsuit} but it wasn't extreme enough .. oh Uncle Lon!\"), proving again that while one actor can't save a bad film, a good one will raise the quality of performance for all concerned (Some-Like-It-Hot The-Misfits). Even so, it is Hagen's luckless Doll who lights the Jungle and makes us root for the robbers. This one clearly falls into the CCC category, criminal cop chase, yet, it's character developments are so many, so engrossing (mastermind Doc's {Jaffe} juke-girl scene is a marvel) that Jungle has carved out its own special standing. Runs long (112m), never drags, ends off the asphalt (4/4).",

Huston keeps you in the moment worrying about whether a cop will appear to shake someone down or if something will go wrong. In a world with corrupt cops, greedy elites, desperate men, helpless women, and double crosses all over, The Asphalt Jungle is a brutal environment to reside in all its moody atmosphere. Writers John Huston, Ben Maddow, and W.R. Burnett is all about the nihilism of the crime world. The job doesn't matter as it's all about how ruthless and unforgiving criminals can be when a big payday is involved.\n\nHarold Rosson's cinematography captures nighttime heists and perilous journeys into the dark of the Midwest cityscape. George Boemler's editing is steady and kept me engaged within each moment of this mysterious film noir for 112 minutes. Mikklos Rozsa's score is excellent with a boisterous style adding to Rosson's bold noir aesthetic. \n\nSterling Hayden is a deep voiced and hard edged hooligan or a violent heavy for the gang named Dix Handley. You like Hayden's tough guy act with his dreams of getting back his family farm and horses as he tries to get a quick buck. Jean Hagen is sweet and fun as Doll Conovan, who is hopelessly in love with Hayden. \n\nFurthermore, Louis Calhern is the ruthless and greedy wealthy financial backer Emmerich. He's great at portraying nonchalant and remorseless. James Whitmore is cool and calm as the rough diner owner and getaway driver with a penchant for feeding cats. Sam Jaffe is incredible as the intellectual Doc Erwin R. with his heavy German accent and pleasant manner. I loved his whimsical love of younger women and zeal for robbery.\n\nJohn McIntire is excellent as the gung ho Police Commissioner Hardy who makes all the excuses we've heard before for Barry Kelley's corrupt Lieutenant Ditrich. Marc Lawrence's cowardly Cobby and money dealer is super entertaining to watch squirm under pressure. Anthony Caruso is fun as the safe cracker or boxman named Louis Ciavelli. Teresa Celli is wonderful as Caruso's very Italian wife Maria Ciavelli. \n\nMarilyn Monroe makes her cute debut with like a single minute of screen time as Angela Phinlay. She's beautiful and fun as Emmerich's side girl with her own plans. You feel bad for her as Angela has no agency. If you want to watch The Asphalt Jungle just for Marilyn Monroe, then don't as she's barely involved. But she is lovely as ever in the midst of a fantastic film noir.\n\nIn conclusion, The Asphalt Jungle is one of John Huston's most riveting and intriguing pictures with phenomenal acting all around. It's cool and dark with that bleak Huston style.",

The way Dix treats Doll is painful to watch, not a critique but a warning. The safecracking isn't the one in Rififi, but that's the script and no deal. Sterling Hayden is Sterling Hayden. There are some continuity issues with cuts.\n\nBut all the performances are excellent. It's hard to pick out a few, but I'd mention Louis Calhern, James Whitmore, Marc Lawrence, and Brad Dexter in his small role. Noirs are often set in NY or LA, so it's nice to see another city with a different profile.\n\nI can't give it 5 stars because of the howling error after the safecracker breaks through the wall and there's the indented stairwell to the left, after seeing a clear passage just before. And a less serious one but still, when Gus turns the music up at the start when Dix walks in, he turns the dial down, as he does again after the cops leave when he actually turns it down.",

As a heist noir, the film is decent but far from pulse-pounding for most of the runtime and is particularly weak in establishing and maintaining some of its characters (the film lacks a central figure to orient around and instead focuses on the larger group) even though it is supposed to be heavily character-driven; Calhern's Emmerich is meant to be complex but comes off as inconsistent, at times effortlessly suave in the face of tangible danger but then reduced to a stuttering wreck at the thought of a double-cross. I am really not a fan of Hayden in this role, he plays like a caricature of the prototypical tough hood in classic Hollywood, even considering his humanist final conclusion. But it's not all rough-and-tumble; Jaffe's mastermind 'Doc', wielding a heavy Teutonic accent, is a competent and composed mentor figure, and his final scene paying forward a jukebox run, getting lost in the moment before being collared as a result of his nostalgic benevolence, is one of the highlights of the production. There are moments when the film seems solid and can create suspense or emotional involvement (there are some interesting close-proximity shots that are well-integrated, and notable neorealist elements as well), but for the large segments this can't help but feel like it's a bit lackluster and iffy for Huston, where the high points end up highlighting the flaws.

            "content": "Directed by John Huston, this noir heist film is strong and well-balanced.  The main characters in the caper are well-developed - the brain, an older German-American guy who has just gotten out of prison (Sam Jaffe), the safecracker with a wife and little baby (Anthony Caruso), the driver, a hunchbacked diner owner (James Whitmore), and the southern-fried muscleman (Sterling Hayden).   They are brought together by a bookie (Marc Lawrence), and plan to fence the jewels they steal to a rich lawyer (Louis Calhern).\n\nTo describe what happens would be to spoil the film, but suffice to say that even the best laid plans are fraught with peril, and unexpected events.  I appreciated how Huston spent the time developing the characters and kept the story tight, without resorting to excess violence or plot twists.  You still get the usual sorts of things - snappy dialogue, tense standoffs, double-crosses, etc - but it all feels intelligent.  There are extended periods in the film without any background music, which I found refreshing.  Each scene contributes to the story, and there is a spare feeling to the visuals, both of which make it feel authentic.\n\nThere is also a human element in the relationship Caruso has with his wife (Teresa Celli), and in Whitmore standing up to comments about his deformity.  It's a small moment in the movie, but it's quietly powerful when he says with dignity, \"What I carry on my back, I was born with it.  I didn't grow it myself.\"  Also humanizing are the separate dreams Jaffe and Hayden have of running away from it all afterwards (Jaffe to Mexico to be in the warm weather and 'young girls', ok, ugh; Hayden to re-purchase his family farm in Kentucky).  Everyone has a weakness, a flaw, but at the same time, a positive attribute.  Jaffe is smart and a gentleman criminal, but he's also a pervert.  Hayden is tough and the opposite of greedy, but he's also a compulsive gambler (and loser) at the horse races.\n\nHuston also shows us bad police behavior - pushing a witness to make a false ID, accepting a payoff from the bookie, and using their muscle when under pressure to make arrests.  I loved how this was balanced by a little segment with the police radio from the commissioner (John McIntire), who flicks the calls of distress on one by one, and then points out: \"People are being cheated, robbed, murdered, raped.  And that goes on 24 hours a day, every day in the year.  And that's not exceptional, that's usual.  It's the same in every city of the modern world.  But suppose we had no police force, good or bad.  Suppose we had...just silence.  Nobody to listen. Nobody to answer.  The battle's finished.  The jungle wins.  The predatory beasts take over.  Think about it.\"\n\nAs a side bonus to all of this, you get Marilyn Monroe in a small role as Calhern's mistress.  She was just 24, and this film, along with \"All About Eve\" from the same year, were the ones that started generating serious attention for her.  Her performance is uneven at best, but when she turns on the charm with Calhern, or asks one of the cops \"Do I have to talk to him? Couldn't I just talk to you?\", her face so naturally assuming the look of a little girl, she's electric.\n\nThere's also a wonderful dance sequence from a young girl (Helene Stanley) in a diner, who cuts loose in a very charming way after given a bunch of change for the jukebox.  What a fun moment that is, maybe my favorite in the entire film, and how it fit into the plot and Jaffe's proclivities is very clever.  \n\nMy only small criticism is with Sterling Hayden, who got top billing, but just didn't resonate with me.  I think it was something about the way he spoke, which seemed too 'heavy', if that makes any sense.  Jean Hagen as his girlfriend was just average too.  Calhern is brilliant as the shady lawyer, and the rest of the cast turn in solid performances.  I considered a slightly higher rating, since you can so clearly see the effect this film had on others which would follow (Rififi from 1955 comes immediately to mind).  Solid film.",

More than a film noir film about a jewel heist, this movie is about how random chance is unpredictable and it's generally something you have no control over. We may have everything planned to the letter, but we can't stop chaos, no matter our preparations. The commissioner in the film makes a good point that even if we do have some crooked cops it would be awful if there were no cops, because then there would be no one to reach out to the cries for help that come in every minute to them. Dix is a very strange character, honor-bound yet ruthless, and rural bred yet he forces himself to live in the city until it's too late for him to be happy. One of the characters mentioned that crime is just the left side of human endeavors, but really when it comes down to it, honest work will bring you more happiness than any ill-gotten gain ever could. Film starts out a little slow, but it picks up traction and it has beautiful cinematography with a great philosophical plot.",

Huston does a fantastic job here, paying great attention to the smaller details. However, the characters are also the biggest flaw -- there's simply too many of them and not enough time to get to know them as well as you should, leading the whole thing to be less affecting than it could have been.

As soon as I was able to understand son of the ways a story's themes looked forward to building my personal collection of my favorite movie my library of VHS began to command an increasing amount of space in my living room. I was able to gain the ability to watch my favorite movies anytime I wished. That means of collecting movies was soon to be affected for the better by advances in technology. I was able to begin replacing films already in my collection on tape and acquire additions films on DVD.one of the most useful of the new features was the addition of special features that included such things as deleted scenes, alternate endings a blooper reel and perhaps a filmmaker's commentary. Added material provided in A Criterion Collection release is frequently tantamount to an academic consideration of the film. The latest release I received for preview is an iconic example of one of my favorite genres, film noir. 'The Asphalt Jungle,' directed and co-written by one of the legendary filmmakers in film history, John Huston. Whenever Mr. Huston committed to taking on, a film he focused all of his considerable talents to the project.In almost every instance the movie formed by his rare and wonderful abilities of this preeminent auteur it inevitably becomes synonymous with the epitome of the genre it represents. The quality of this movie is undisputed universally hailed for its taut narrative, groundbreaking directorial style and incredibly intense performances. One of the most important aspects of this film was how it helped redefined the technical tools available to the advanced filmmaker. At least since the thirties, one of the perennial favorite types of movies in America has been the crime thriller. There were several examples where the protagonist, the anti-hero as it were, concentrated on the criminal. The usual point of view taken by these stories provided the point of view held by the authorities. 'The Asphalt' drew the audience behind the eyes watching the events on old from their perspective. This groundbreaking technique would influence generations of filmmakers including such luminaries as Sam Peckinpah and Quentin Tarantino and others that formed a coterie of filmmakers devoted to depicting violence in exceptionally graphic reality. Considering the movie was produced during a time when government and religious groups enforced various codes restricting the content of movies. Such things as 'The Hayes Code' weren't 'officially' in place to impose censorship but their hold over the industry was sufficiently intense to be effective.\n\nErwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) just released from prison after serving seven years of his sentence. Doc's well-earned reputation in criminal circles was a mastermind, a person who is capable of the most intricately involved plans to help ensure the success of any criminal enterprise. Directly after regaining his freedom Doc's first order of business was to visit a bookie, Cobby (Marc Lawrence), who resides somewhere in a Midwest City presumed by many to be Cincinnati. The touches such as leaving out the precise location allow us a story to assume a ubiquitous nature allowing the events to unfold as if they occurred in almost any city in America. The purpose of the visit is to have a low-level criminal introduce Doc to a high profile lawyer, Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern), to kick a much more elaborate and lucrative plan. Emmerich listening with undivided attention as the recently released convict begins to lay out some of the details of his plan. Doc has a scheme that will yield a score of over $1 million in precious gems and jewelry. To execute this plan, you need to state a $50,000 to secure the services of several experts; a safecracker/box man, a driver any third party described as a hooligan. If the listening to these details Emmerich agrees to bankroll the operation with one prerequisite, you'll be the one to dispose of the turning the stones into money, not one of the many fences would perform this task. One example of the genius that made Mr. Huston's influential and innovative filmmakers in history was how he treated the planning stage for the heist. The scene of this type would normally be just a brief moment of exposition sole purpose is to provide the audience with the broad brushstrokes what is about to happen. In the hands of a master craftsman such as Mr. Houston, it takes on a much deeper meaning.\n\nFirst, however, the team had to be assembled. The first one Doc hires are the 'box man,' professional, safe cracker Louie Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso). We then help doc obtain the services of the getaway driver, Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), the personification of a man with twisted intention physically made manifest by being a hunchback. Finally, the last member of the gang is brought in, the hooligan and all around tough guy ideal to handle unexpected situations that might arise. This position is assumed by, Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), the general thug with numerous criminal associations. Only after the entire team has been assembled the stock gathers them around to relate the details of his plan. This is one of many spots in the film what happens it defies the expectations of the audience. Traditional brief overview of the crime replaced with a finely detailed account of the actual plan. The scene takes over 11 minutes of time during which Doc proves his credentials for the title of Mastermind. He covers the details of the crime's execution in minute detail. This is how Mr. Houston allows his screenplay to soar above the mundane storytelling of the most film. By supplying such details, the audience receives a much clearer understanding of Doc's contribution to the crime. Audience members might understandably expect the scene to progress as we have witnessed so many times; \"we enter the building gaining access to the safe. The safe cracker bypasses the locks and opens the safe. We emptied the content and leave, the speeding array in the car provided by the driver. To handle any unforeseen circumstances that might arise, the hooligan stands ready to strong arm theoretically of the problem.\n\nBy going into such extraordinary detail into the planning stage of the crime, the audience receives a greater understanding of the depth of strategy and the importance of tactics and pulling off a major heist. Doc takes on the persona of a general as seen in almost any World War II as he briefs his senior officers before a major operation. One of the many subliminal themes brought out by the story is the universal nature of being so well-prepared for any inherently dangerous activity. This is one of the most fundamental somatic aspects of a film noir movie. The sense of moral ambiguity is achieved by demonstrating that the criminals utilize most of the pre-operation planning that the military and civil authorities employ on a routine basis. A considerable portion of the film's brilliance is how the moral ambiguity that is part of the very definition of film noir's depiction in such a realistic setting with unprecedented attention to the minutest details. Many stories have been the about the term 'mastermind' improperly utilizing the term or underestimating its overall importance progression of character development.\n\nThis is one of a fascinating crime I have ever seen in the event the seeing it many times over the years I'm still able to find something fresh and different each time experience the movie. This is not something that you watch casually, looking up to catch glimpses while busy with something else. The film demands and deserves your full attention. Every individual frame is essential to the overall crafting of the movie is necessary to relate the story at hand completely. This advice will not be difficult to act upon; the perfection of the film's artistry is inspiring. As always this presentation as part of the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release schedule, the movie can finally be seen and fully appreciated a technical environment that exceeds anything the grandest theater from sixty years ago could boost. For those that own a home theater receiver capable of emulating some different audio environments try either the mono theater of a moderately large venue. I found that the best way to listen to this movie is to enhance the natural reverberation found in those great palaces of cinematic entertainment.\nbullet\tAudio Commentary From 2004 by Film Historian Drew Casper, Featuring Archival Recordings of Actor James Whitmore.\nbullet\tPlanes of Chaos, A 1983 Documentary About Actor Sterling Hayden\nbullet\tNew Interviews with Film Noir Historian Eddie Muller and Cinematographer John Bailey\nbullet\tArchival Footage of Writer-Director John Huston Discussing the Film.\nbullet\tEpisodes of the Television Program City Limits From 1979 Featuring Huston\nbullet\tAudio Excerpts of and Archival Interview with Huston\nbullet\tTrailer\nbullet\tPlus: Essay by Critic Geoffrey O'Brien",

One of my biggest complaints is that this movie takes WAY too long to get us to the robbery. In fact, I must confess that I fell asleep the first 3 times I tried starting The Asphalt Jungle. I've been spoiled by modern heist movies (like Ocean's Eleven,) and so I've grown accustomed to a much more interesting method of organizing the team and preparing for the job. Here it was a lot of talking, and very little of that conversation was good for character development or even setting up the crime. However the movie turns on a dime once the heist happens. The actual robbery itself isn't all that complex, and most modern movie-goers would call it downright dull, but the fallout from that crime is what makes the movie worth watching. I know, based on the Hollywood code of the time, that no one was getting away with the crime but watching the slow downfall of the team is extremely interesting. It's great to see how the different vices of the characters play a part in their demise. I enjoyed most of the acting performances, and it was fun to see some familiar faces early in their careers. I don't think I'll ever seek out The Asphalt Jungle again, but I did appreciate what it did in that second half, and I am happy that it laid the groundwork that made some of our modern heist films a reality.",

Doc has a plan for a jewlery heist that involves a driver, a safecracker and a hooligan. After reaching an agrement with the lawyer, Emmerich, Doc uses his bookie to find the men for the job. Sterling Hayden plays Dix Handley who is hemorrhaging money from betting on horses that he gets from robbing banks.

This alerts the police, and when Dix punches a security cop, he drops the gun and shoots the safecracker in the gut as they are leaving. Now they police are after them, but things are still going okay. Emmerich the attorney has hired an private detective to collect on his debts because he too, like Dix, is flat broke.

Sterling Hayden, the first-billed star of the film, equivocally the leading man among the motley crew, is not the brain, but a trustworthy hooligan, suitably amplifying his simplistic kindheartedness by exposing himself to his girl friend (the moderately-used Jean Hagen) of his stroke of bad luck and his humble-but-never-realized dream (which Huston cleverly opts as the heart-rending culmination) under the veneer of his stalwart physique.\n\nSam Jaffe, who acquired his one and only Oscar nomination (the film altogether got 4 nominations including a BEST DIRECTOR for Huston) for the role of Doc, the constantly behind-the-wall mastermind, has another sort of fatalistic empathy through his non-violent, genteel policy which is simply the otherness for a perpetrator, he is a born leader, who welds a collection of gifted offenders into a real team, the only thing he misses it luck. Louis Calhern, the paymaster and the fence, ostensibly well-off, but bankrupted, is the major mis-step of the heist, Calhern\u00e2(TM)s commonly understated performance finds the right place as he is juggling between his wife and his trophy mistress (a 24-year-old Monroe, whose striking sheen cannot be overlooked even in such a minor role). \n\nThe film is feasibly an agitprop of police department, although the coppers are neither over-beautified nor disparaging represented (unlike the present mockery trend), it emits a pertinent point-of-view of their functions and liabilities, Huston is the torchbearer of the American neorealism, and I hope this assertion can stand its ground.",

The noir is about a group of men, including Sterling Hayden as a hoodlum, planning and accomplishing a jewel robbery. Like, \"Beat the Devil\" and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" it is not great, but moderately well made. Maybe the most compelling sequence is where Erwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider, the mastermind behind robbery, is enchanted by a young girl, while he is trying to escape with a taxi driver. I also admired the performance of Louis Calhern, who recites the best quote of the film: \"After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor.\" Sterling Hayden is his usual self; however he does not always fair well as a man possessed with (Tarkovsky's?) nostalgia. I don't think he was ever that kind actor; being able to display dense emotions genuinely, nevertheless he was affective to a certain extent. So, \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a good noir. It doesn't reach the heights of \"The Maltese Falcon,\" nor does any other film of John Huston.",

Although it was necessary to let the audience in on the heist as if they were participating in it, there was just a lot of exposition; just talking and more talking. I could've probably not paid attention to any of it and then just came back when the heist comes about. The only really important part was when Emmerich talks about what he's going to do since he's in debt. Some of it was interesting, but it was boring at times. The depiction of the actual heist was well done, as it was enjoyable and had some tense moments, and the movie just got better from there for many reasons. The acting isn't great, with a few exceptions; Sterling Hayden, as he did in The Killing and Dr. Strangelove, plays the same character. I thought the guy who played Cobby wasn't that good. I thought Sam Jaffe did a good job at playing the Doc (even though in the beginning his accent got a little too heavy at times), James Whitmore did good, and honestly, I don't get the big deal about Marilyn Monroe in this movie. Yeah, this was one of her first big movies, but she wasn't in it very much, and even when she was her acting wasn't great. Although I did think she did a pretty good job during the testifying scene, if she was anyone else, I wouldn't have paid much attention to her. That part was good acting, but not great. She had some growing up to do. The ending was alright. I'll give the film credit for making the audience care about the criminals getting away with it, but then you get mixed up because you end up wanting the police to catch them, but at the same time you still want the criminals to get away with it, so props to this film for that. In addition, great black and white cinematography. This is my second John Huston film (after Treasure of the Sierra Madre; which I loved) and it was a good film noir that's worth watching.",

Amazingly, the movie somehow lives up to its name. The 1950 black and white film is set on an unnamed Midwest city - smoggy and foreboding. The streets might be lifeless and dull, but you sense the bustling of lawbreakers on the hidden corners.\n\nThe movie follows a heist - from the meticulous planning to the erroneous aftermath. Just got out of prison, Doc Riedenschneider, a small man with a heavy German accent, has a \"foolproof\" plan in stealing some jewels. But his plan won't come into fruition without funding and abled bodied men with certain skills. But of course, adding humans to the equation does not make that plan foolproof anymore. Honor among thieves? Pssh, not in this story, bud.\n\nWhat I loved about \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is that it is a great ensemble movie. Today, we're spoiled with character actors, but back then, Hollywood was about its stars. There is no real lead actor in the film. The talented cast is in service of the story. There are a couple of good performances. I liked Sam Jaffe as the German mastermind and Loius Calhem as the double-crossing Emmerich. But perhaps my favorite is Marilyn Monroe. She is in a very minor role, but damn, she is the paragon of a scene stealer.\n\nPerhaps the star of the film is the man behind the camera. Director John Huston composes a textured film, with characters caught up in their own flaws. I also like the way he frames his shots and paints a visual play of shadows (a film noir signature). I also liked its nitty-gritty story - where not one character is portrayed in good light. I just find these kind of tales so robust and fascinating. (I recommend Dashiell Hammett's lean novel Red Harvest, which I devoured last year). \"The Asphalt Jungle\" is a great movie. It's rough on the surface, but lays out one smooth ride. This caper is a keeper.",

Sam Jaffe is cool-headed and convincing as the brains behind the operation, while a ragtag cast of backup anti-heroes pay the price as the whole thing slowly starts to unravel. A young Marilyn Monroe makes several scant appearances as nothing more than eye candy, still so green she can barely keep from looking straight into the cameras. It's noteworthy that very few characters are as black and white as the film stock, a trademark of the genre, even if their motivations are ultimately sinister and selfish. A worthwhile slant on the heist picture that's crammed full of smoke and atmosphere, it expertly balances several different faces and pays off each story, most with especially dark consequences. Quite good, but not great, it creates some new conventions while bowing to many others.",

This lends the film an incredible realism as compared to films released prior to 1950.  Also noticeable is the way in which the camera is employed.  Tilted angles, extreme high and low shots, imperceptible lighting all add to the dreariness portrayed in a decaying urban society.  The cinematography for the film is incredible.  The film is constantly bathed in darkness, adding a shadowy layer to the film, giving the city a life of its own.

This endless darkness further ensconces the audience within the city and helps to reinforce the themes the script focuses on.\n\nThe array of themes and issues dealt with in the script are endless, themes facing urban society in the late 1940's as well as contemporary society.  Human fallibility, a rising and unfettered criminal faction, greed and corruption, a burgeoning urban decay coupled with a declining morality are all some of the issues or themes touched on by the film.  It's a credit to the adaptation by John Huston and Ben Maddow that they were able to pack so much into their script.\n\nWith a professional ensemble cast that serves the film quite well (the use of no stars emphasizes the anonymity of life in the city) it is a minor role which stands out within this film.

Two things stand out to me particularly in regards to Marilyn here (please note that I actually studied Marilyn for a semester while at USC so I have more knowledge than most regarding this icon).  Her very first scene involves her sitting in her \"uncle's\" lap (Alonzo Emmerich played by Louis Calhern) as he pulls her in for a kiss.

Her body changed drastically over the next decade as she became the feminine ideal of the 1950's and it is striking just how much change that body underwent.  It's almost as if she was two completely different woman.\n\nI know this isn't everyone's cup of tea but the film is worth just to see Marilyn at such a young age, before fame wrecked her.

It turns out that Calhern is broke and keen to doublecross the gang by taking the jewels and fleeing to Mexico.  He's got an apartment set up for mistress Marilyn Monroe while his ill wife pines away for his company.  Calhern is the biggest heel in the picture, although things really unravel due to the unfortunate but pragmatic relationship between one of the gang and a corrupt cop being squeezed by the police commissioner.  The commissioner himself gets the final word, telling us that the cops are the only thing standing between ordinary people and the predators of the (asphalt) jungle.  In the end, I didn't have that sense of existential collapse that you find in Rififi or the works of Jean-Pierre Melville, the bittersweet feeling of predictable loss; instead we get a more matter-of-fact rendering that nevertheless is revealing in its portrayal of the human condition.",

Great performances from the cast too-- especially Sterling Hayden as the tough guy and the dumb blonde Marilyn Monroe. The cinematography is excellent here, and it's probably another reason why it's considered such a classic.

The film lacks a powerful female, which is a little unusual for noir, Jean Hagen and Marilyn Monroe (in her first noticeable role) doing their best to make an impact in this man's film.  It's a movie sprinkled with excellent performances though, and the stand outs are Jaffe's turn as 'Doc', the brains of the outfit with his quick tongue and somewhat sinister fatal flaw for 'young girls', and of course the bubbling, verging on psychotic, brute force of 'Dix' - another unforgettable Sterling Hayden turn.",

This is a rare look into the lives of many charismatic individuals. What unveils is possibly Huston's best work.\n\nA jewelry heist is formulated and sprung into action by  an eccentric ex-con played by Sam Jaffe and among others ensnared in the mix is the ever dominating Sterling Hayden. Although he shares the spotlight with Jaffe and Louis Calhern, he shines as bright as ever. Hayden went on to start the crucial chain of events that we saw unfold in Dr. Strangelove and he also gave potent performances in such classics as The Godfather and The Killing. He is a giant leading actor and therefore dominating the screen seems to come easy for the actor. Many of his scenes are him showing his strength but also confessing his depth (he speaks of retiring to his deceased father's land, full of horses and mainly peace). \n\nThe story is expertly led by Huston in the director's seat and it packs a punch that not only leaves a mark but it is also strategically placed. This is not a shoot 'em up crime thriller, it has a brain and offers a distinct human side to crime noir. I absolutely love the final closing scenes, they really captivate the art of the time and the brilliance of the entire film concept. The creativity, overall details, and  especially the final frames make this a landmark film.

            "content": "Huston's 1950 Noir about a jewel heist is an incredibly captivating film. Normally when I hear a film described as being about a heist, my mind immediately turns to the myriad examples of bad films centered around a them. For example: Entrapment, The Heist, The Score, Soul Plane \nHowever, much like he in the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, he creates fully realized characters that allow this film to soar high above it's heist film cohorts. \n\nThe film centers around a million dollar jewel heist. Sam Jaffe plays Doc Erwin, a criminal mastermind who has been released from prison and is planning another big score. Through a local bookie, he pulls together a group of criminals to get the job done. While the above could summarize many different films, I assure you there is nothing like The Asphalt Jungle. \n\nThe film utilizes the POV of the criminals to tell the story. Yet, unlike Reservoir Dogs which some people have equated this film with, this isn't just an hour and a half full of slick dialogue. While they may partake in criminal activities, Huston gives us the people behind the criminal actions. A fantastic Sterling Hayden desires to get money not so he can fund more criminal endeavors, he wants to buy back his families farm that he lost in the Great Depression. The safe cracker Louis wants to support his wife and his kids. Huston does an incredible job of letting the viewer empathize with these characters by letting us see their lives away from planning and executing the job. Huston shows the audience that crime isn't always driven by malice, crime is sometimes just a part of life. Louis Calhern sums this notion up best in the film when he states: \"After all, crime is only... a left-handed form of human endeavor...\"\nWhile Huston doesn't vilify the criminals, he doesn't deify the cops either. For the most part they are crooked and although they exclaim that they do not want to let the \"beasts rule the jungle\", they often stand shoulder to shoulder with the brutes. \n\nIt is a simply marvelous & thought-provoking film. If Huston keeps this up he will keep moving up on my list of astounding directors.",

I'm not a huge fan of John Huston, this being the first film I've \"connected to\" in certain way. Forget \"The Treasure of Serra Madre\" or \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"The Asphalt Jungle\" had a certain amount of pressure riding on you through-out the entire running time. Maybe it's because of the threads that pop up, pieces of the characters that are mentioned, or even the history of how certain stories started that are left in the dark that give this film real substance. \n\nFrom the beginning you understand that the story has to be about a failed attempt at a robbery yet to happen. Even if you've read the synopsis, every character is working on a different level, though they're all working on the same job. The character interactions were far less melodramatic than one would think; even though there's a fair share of that particular quality one expects in a film-noir. \n\nAs I said above, I'm not really a fan of John Huston, but he does seem to have an advanced knowledge of film growth; whether it be directing, acting, photography, writing. Watching one of his films I can't help but think he had to tone down his directing method by maybe 15 years. Does that make sense? He seems to have an edgier quality that wasn't going to be widely accepted by the movie-going population, so he maybe took it back and even 'dumbed' down some of the characters and stories for people to understand that they were just watching a movie. There's a difference between real life and movies, no doubt. But back in the day, there was even a greater amount of separation between the movies and real life. I know little about John Huston and his directing method, but it's something I think about everytime I see one of his films. \n\nOf all the great things I have to say about this film, there were still traditional heist trappings. That could be because I've seen so many of these type of films that were made after 1950, that finally when I got to this one, nothing was as truly surprising as it should have been. There's only so many ways you can go with a heist film. There are different kinds of stories in this genre though, but this one isn't about the risky job, or planning, this is about the characters and how they function before and after the job. The actual robbery itself lasted about 5 minutes; which really surprised me. I have to say though that the 30 minute robbery scene in \"Rififi\" was so full of suspense that I could hardly stand it. \"The Asphalt Jungle\" digs out a different kind of suspense, something that's more in touch with emotion and down to earth, something that is a little more relatable. And that's why it was so exciting to watch.",

Granted the story is nothing mind boggling and that is fine as all the other areas of the movie are rock solid. Sterling Hayden pulls a great role as the \"hoodlum\" who lives on the edge and is the main reason why Asphalt Jungle keeps such a tight grip over the viewer through the movie. \n\nEven if the story is rather basic for its genre, I liked it wholly and the way the plot twist is introduced was fantastic. No need for bangs and whisles, the twist is known early on but still when presented, it is emotion raising and intense. The ending is also very memorable and overall the movie leaves an totally satisfied feeling. The Asphalt Jungle is worthy of all the praise it gets and is definetly among the top heist movies ever made.",

A group of people head down that tempting road of easy money, the big payday, and seal their fates against the most powerful gang in the city: the police.  Doc (Jaffe) gets out of prison and goes right back to what he's best at: big heists.  He plays the most interesting and layered character of the film and also comes through with fine acting.  Doc is a foreigner (German) and goes about his business with a discrete professionalism.  Dix (Hayden) has amazing presence and all that jazz, but his portrayal of the 'hooligan' in this pic is one dimensional and off key.  He goes through the whole movie with a look on his face like something smells funny.  By the end he becomes the main character by default, and it is the most likable because he's an honorable man who happens to be a thief. There is a bookie, a corrupt lawyer, a corrupt cop, and a couple others to round out the group.  Huston succeeds in making them all seem human and vulnerable each in their own way.  There are no angels and no demons, but people whose individual plights are made understandable.\r\n\r\nThis is the type of story that I am not drawn to only because you know how it will end.  It takes away the necessary uncertainty a good tale needs.  No, this is a morality play and fairly well done at that.  But it never delivered  anything I didn't expect.  \r\n\r\nMarilyn Monroe plays a bit player in the works and I gotta say she is a knock out.  Maybe that isn't the most erudite observation for a review, but it's true. \r\n\r\nAs I stated the main star is the story, and not even that in that it is a straightforward predictable tale, but in the way that various people who aren't rotten at heart might fall into a bad habit of robbery.  After all I think we all secretly want to plan an immaculate bank job and have a stash of diamonds or a suitcase of bills about.  Huston does evoke our sympathies on the human dimension of not just the thieves, but also the cops.  This is the essence of the film.",

            "content": "\"Crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavor.\"\n\nA criminal named Erwin \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe) is just out of prison with a brilliant plan for a million-dollar jewelry heist he's had in his mind for some years now. Funded by crooked attorney Emmerich (Louis Calhern), Riedenschneider recruits three men for the job, among them is Louis (Anthony Caruso) a professional at cracking safes; Gus (James Whitmore) a hunchbacked bartender as the getaway driver; and Dix (Sterling Hayden) as a strong-arm man to help with the caper. Dix is an impoverished hood who sees the caper as a means to finance his dream of owning a horse farm. Also a bookie named Cobby (Marc Lawrence) acts as Emmerich's go-between. The heist is pulled off successfully, but an alert night watchman shoots Louis. Angry that the bookie didn't let him in on the caper, a corrupt cop (Barry Kelley) beats the bookie into becoming a fink, confessing and fingering the other criminals involved. From here, the painstakingly planned crime falls apart quickly with each member of the gang proving to have his own fatal weakness and each contributing to his own downfall.\n\nLike John Huston's directorial debut, The Maltese Falcon (1941), inventing the film noir genre, he invents the caper/heist genre with The Asphalt Jungle. Much imitated, unlike the many films made after this one, it is less concerned with the plan or the brilliant heist. Instead it is more character driven, exploring deception, relationships and human weaknesses. Like The Maltese Falcon before it, there isn't a whole lot of action in the film allowing the cast the opportunity to fully develop their characters. The cast credits read out like a who\u00e2(TM)s who of great, talented character actors like Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Sam Jaffe (who got an Oscar nomination for playing the mastermind of the heist), and James Whitmore. Also worth mentioning, making her \"big break\" in the film is Marilyn Monroe in an excellent star-making bit performance as Emmerich's lusty \"niece\". She\u00e2(TM)s only in the film for a few minutes total but as is evident of the movie poster, she sure made an impression on audiences. John Huston is at his best with his great direction and gets the most out of his cast and the script, he co-wrote with Ben Maddow. Beautifully shot in ominous black and white photography by Oscar nominated Harold Rosson. Influencing many subsequent films such as Jules Dassin's Rififi (1955), Stanley Kubrick's The Killing (1956) (also starring Sterling Hayden in a very similar role), Ocean's Eleven (1960) as well as Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), The Asphalt Jungle is a classic of the caper film subgenre as well as the film noir genre. And considering it was one of the first films to be told [realistically] through the point of view of the criminals, one can see it\u00e2(TM)s influence reach to gangster films like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction. The Asphalt Jungle is an essential piece of cinema and comes highly recommended to movie fans that love crime films. 10/10",

The film also has a great ensemble cast including; Sterling Hayden, Louis Calhern, Jean Hagen, James Whitmore, Sam Jaffe, Brad Dexter and Marilyn Monroe in one of her first roles. With a collaboration such as this, it hardly seems surprising that they made such an effective film, but there are many examples where such combinations did not succeed.\r\n\r\nHere we have a diverse group of men, coming together to commit a major heist with considerable planning and preparation to avoid any snags, but of course few such endeavors ever seem to go as planned, especially in movies. The planning is the responsibility of \"Doc\" Riedenschneider (Jaffe), who seems more like a professor than a man who has just been released from jail. The muscle is supplied by Dix (Hayden), a more complex man than appearances might suggest who has both dreams and problems of his own. The financing comes from a desperate and corrupt lawyer named Emmerich (Louis Calhern). We also have the hunchbacked driver Gus Minissi (Whitmore), as well as a safecracker and the groups go-between a bookie, all with stories of their own.\r\n\r\nIn a fairly limited role as Emmerich\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much younger other woman we have Marilyn, while Hagen plays the girl in Dix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life who just happens to go by the name Doll. \r\n\r\nIt is the films atmosphere and style particularly, including but not limited to the cinematography and the score, that mark this film distinctly as Noir, and not just a run of the mill Noir but one of genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best examples.

            "content": "I always get this one mixed up with [i]Blackboard Jungle[/i] in my head.  Mostly, they are very different movies.  Somebody in here--I'm not going to go searching through all the people to find out who it is--was in both.  There is violence.  They're both in glorious black and white.  And that's pretty much what they have in common.  While there are a lot of deaths and injuries in this one, none of them are inflicted by Jamie Farr with a flagpole.  So that's different, too.  Though, contrary to what Wikipedia seems to think, [i]Blackboard Jungle[/i] is not a documentary.  Which means neither of them are.  Then again, a lot of movies with nothing in common aren't documentaries.  Also, in [i]The Asphalt Jungle[/i], Sam Jaffe unironically refers to the jewel theft as a caper.  So that's fun.\r\n\r\nDix Handley (Sterling Hayden) and Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Jaffe) have both just gotten out of prison.  Neither of them seem terribly suited to anything but a life of crime, though Dix says he's only trying to build up enough of a bankroll to buy back the old family farm in the bluegrass country.  They hook up with Alonzo D. Emmerich (Louis Calhern), who sets them up to steal all the jewels out of a safe in what I'm pretty sure is a bank.  Emmerich plans to \"hide\" the jewels for them until they can be sold off and then screw them over, running off with the jewels himself.  Things do not go as planned for anyone.  Oh, the robbery goes off okay, except for a couple of things.  One, the explosion involved in blowing the door off the main safe sets off alarms all up and down the block, bringing in cops a-plenty.  Two, in one of the [i]stupidest[/i] accidents of noir, they get interrupted on their way out by the night watchmen.  One of them slugs him, the watchman drops his gun, the gun goes off, and Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso) is hit by the stray bullet.  Thing go downhill from there.\r\n\r\nDix is really a tragic character.  It simply does not occur to him that he can't just take over the family farm through a life of crime.  Obviously, he cannot think that anyone would track him down, which is just silly.  Anyone who knows the slightest bit about his history would know exactly how much he wants to go back.  Even if they didn't, they couldn't think it improbable that he might return to his old stomping grounds.  If I did something horrible and was on the lam, it wouldn't be unreasonable to check out my mom's house.  True, Dix doesn't live there anymore, and his family hasn't in some time, but my mother's property isn't as big as the farm he's running off to.  I also do not have the same kind of long-term love for it.  And, of course, we weren't driven off.\r\n\r\nI also find Doc fascinating.  He's clearly a very intelligent man.  I think perhaps some of his trouble is that he's a foreigner, and a German especially, in a time that doesn't really trust them.  The film was made in 1950, a time when Germans were not held in the highest of regard, and Doc was in prison for some time.  He might well have been a German Jew at that.  It's entirely possible that the reason he turned to crime is that he coudln't do anything else when he got to the US.  Dix is a petty thug.  Doc is a clear-thinking, intelligent man trapped in an unfortunate situation, albeit pretty much of his own volition.  One does wonder what else could have been done with that clever mind, and I rather suppose he spends some of the movie thinking about it, too.\r\n\r\nI would not say this is such a great noir as all that.  Oh, it's not bad.  But someone's saying it's as great as [i]Double Indemnity[/i], one of the greatest noir of all time.  It just isn't.  It's not bad, again.  I just can't fathom it comparing with, oh, [i]The Maltese Falcon[/i].  Even [i]Double Indemnity[/i], come to that, which is an excellent film.  I can see why this is one of those films everyone's heard of.  It's an interesting film, anyway.  I'm glad I've seen it.  You'll notice I say that a lot, and it is quite often true.  A good thing, too; imagine how tedious all of this would be if I weren't so often glad to have seen movies.  But the best noir ever made?  I wouldn't even put it in the top twenty-five.",

            "content": "'The Asphalt Jungle' is a seminal piece of post-war (1950) social realism which harks back to some of the more cosy clich\u00e9s of the pre-war era. It focuses on the commission of a crime: Doc (Sam Jaffe) is freshly released from prison, a dapper, intelligent, little old bloke, and the man with the plan to carry out an audacious jewel robbery - he needs a team, and he needs finance for the operation. We watch the criminal underworld at work as the plan falls into place, the team assembles, and they set about this major theft, intent on changing their lives.\n\nThis is the stuff that dreams are made of - that one, big payday which will change your life. Only the criminal underworld has no honour, and there are double-crosses to worry about, and while get-rich-quick is the objective, the participants all have their own psychological conflicts and contradictions.\n\nJohn Huston's film presents itself as a naturalistic, almost documentary account. He uses a linear, easy-to-follow narrative - no special effects, no flashbacks, just a simple storyline stripped to the basics. We follow the logic of Doc's plan, enter the lives of the players, understand their hopes and dreams, recognise their flaws. Shot in black and white, Huston employs a film noir style without pushing it to extremes - this is more grimy urban realism than noir. He creates an atmosphere of reality without it ever being truly authentic.\n\nThere are plenty of images of bleak, windswept, city streets - some anonymous urban sprawl of concrete and asphalt which contrasts with the dreams of all the participants. They want out, want sun, sea, rural tranquillity, somewhere they are not just rats in the race.\n\nSignificantly, there are no moral judgements made in the film. The financier of the scheme, Emmerich (Louis Calhern), is a corrupt lawyer with a sickly wife and an expensive mistress (Marilyn Monroe, making her debut). Dix (Sterling Hayden) is a big farm boy who simply wants enough money to get the family farm out of hock, and he has the muscle and gun to make sure nobody stands in his way. Doc (Jaffe received an Oscar nomination) is a nice little old bloke who surely deserves a quiet retirement because, after all, nobody's really going to get hurt in this caper?\n\nAnd the policemen, meanwhile, are evidently quite capable of either blatant corruption or instrumental evasion of the law - they'll happily take bribes, they're unselfconsciously brutal and not averse to planting evidence. The audience is left to decide who are the bad guys and who are the good.\n\nThere is, however, one major moral question suggested without ever being directly posed. This is 1950, and huge sections of the audience will have been caught up in the war effort, either in uniform, in the factories, or waiting for loved ones to return. While British films of this era can make disparaging allusions to the wartime profiteers and black market criminals, 'The Asphalt Jungle' is coy on the subject. Except that Huston makes clear that all the criminals - and probably all the policemen - evaded wartime service because they were in prison, on the run, or unfit for the military.\n\nSeen at the time as a gritty, 'hard-boiled' epic, it can appear a little coy by today's standards. Nevertheless, it presents an America stripped of glamour - Monroe's cameo role is the exception - a post-war society with no obvious direction or values, a city populated by people with obvious, materialistic concerns. This is a world in which the individual is alienated from society, a world where might is right, a world in which people can be allowed occasional acts of decency or humanity, but a world in which the individual is too flawed and too self-centred ever to be guided by moral principles.\n\nThe DVD offers acceptable picture quality - a bit aged and worn in places, a bit dated in others. The soundtrack, while mono, is crisp but unsophisticated. And there are some entertaining extras - a brief piece by Huston, a scholarly commentary, and cast reminiscences.\n\nAn entertaining film, a must-watch for students of the cinema or those fascinated by the crime genre, and a film which, though it will continue to date, has a gripping enough storyline to keep you engaged.",

The film's somewhat adaptive film noir styling is striking and suitable, if a bit heavy-handed at times.

            "content": "Having just been paroled, a legendary burglar played by Sam Jaffe with a perfect film noir criminal mastermind's name, Doc Riedenschneider, with funding from a tragic crooked lawyer, gathers a small assembly of career street crooks in the Midwest for a big jewel heist.\n\nThe film encompasses subject matter to which I am definitely partial, but it is particularly joyous for me to see because it was partially shot in my home town of Cincinnati, and there are particular shots in which I can tell that I am looking at a moving document of my city in 1950. There is even a point where I feel like I can comprehend what is just around the corner from what is being filmed.\n\nJaffe's Doc Riedenschneider becomes a very charming character, a German man with a great penchant for seeing right through people, as he organizes this job in a very professional and steady manner. Sterling Hayden, in his usual mediocrity, plays a hardened and unhappy thug from Kentucky with gambling trouble who sees the job as a way to bankroll his dream of buying back the horse farm that he lost in the Great Depression. A hunchbacked Italian diner owner is hired as the getaway driver, Anthony Caruso plays a professional safecracker and loyal family man, and Marc Lawrence plays a bookie functioning as the mediator.\n\nIn a taut 11-minute heist sequence, the criminals confidently carry out the heist in a patient and calm manner. Caruso climbs down into a manhole, pounds his way through a brick wall, climbs the basement stairs to the jewelry store, deactivates the door's alarm and lets in the other thieves, and then heads to the main safe. With care, he slides flat on his back under the electric-eye system, picks the gate's lock, drills holes into the safe's door, gingerly opens a corked bottle of nitroglycerin, and sets off a charge on the jewelry store safe. This is not all technical stuff, as the script is spiced up with some streetwise poetry, such as when they refer to the nitroglycerin as \"the soup.\" And it takes talent to build upon a heist the way The Asphalt Jungle does. As the crooks do all of this, it seems well-planned just as Doc's arrangement of the operation is impressive, really a clever way of building his character. But, though I won't give anything away, we realize despite the thieves' mindsets of desperation and instinct after the heist goes down that these are not wise or reasonable men, or at least that is not the state of mind in which they have operated recently.\n\nOn the whole, this well-made, hard-boiled crime flick is quite good, and every male character is fashioned well through the actors, script and direction. The females, however, are not granted the same justice. Jean Hagen is a silly token weakling woman for the male character with whom she is coupled to boss her around. And thus my gripe with John Huston. The Asphalt Jungle, yes, is about hardened male criminals, and it is a male bonding picture, neither of which are bad, but there's a difference between a film like The Godfather in which the women \"know their place\" in the depicted traditional hierarchy and film like The Asphalt Jungle in which the only female characters---Marilyn Monroe's blonde squeaky bimbo who one could say ultimately screws things up for one character, Jean Hagen's lapdog of a blindly loyal and submissive quasi-girlfriend of Sterling Hayden's and Teresa Celli, an Italian housewife who only begins to take guff from another male character---are subjugated only because the filmmakers have decided for them to be.\n\nThere is great instant camaraderie between Sam Jaffe's ideological German mastermind and Sterling Hayden's compulsive Kentucky roughneck. Again, terrific depiction of male bonding, but couldn't there have at least been some depth to the female stick figures squeezed in just for the patronizing reason that the macho realm of the story seems a little dry and insulated without them? The reasons I am blaming Huston for this and not the writers are because I have not read W.R. Burnett's original novel and because Huston, as the director and co- screenwriter, he had every ability to flesh out these wasted women. Nonetheless, The Asphalt Jungle is a decent and entertaining noir that set the standards that Jules Dassin's Rififi would totally shatter only five years later.",

This truly remarkable film noir from the brilliant John Huston is so well made and put together that it's hard to find many faults - if any - that take away from the film. Each character is so interesting to take a close look at. From their vices and motives, each distinguishes themselves throughout the story. Doc was easily my favorite character as the performance by Sam Jaffe gives the character an unmistakable sense of realism. Sterling Hayden, one of the more underrated actors of the time, gives a rock solid performance as the brawn behind the operation. The ONLY fault I can find is that for a film whose title refers to a city and the way that it can be a jungle it really lacked that kind of environmental sense it could have achieved to push the film over the edge. I would have loved to see Huston tackle filming in a real city like Jules Dassin did two years earlier in the tremendous film The Naked City. Either way though, this film has a fantastic and gripping crime plot full of all your noir necessities and outstanding performances and directing. A must see.",

The film does not give in to the tough bravado that film noir sometimes indulged in. It is an acute examination of human failing, and that is ultimately what makes the tone so bittersweet. This is epitomised by Sam Jaffe being caught because he dallied too long to watch a pretty young girl dancing. He knows he would have escaped had he left when he first intended, but you sense that he senses he would have made the same mistake anyway - if not in that bar with that girl, then with another. Likewsie Louis Calhern. The scene in which he forgives his weak-willed mistress as she is confessing to the police is beautifully and delicately played. Of all John Huston films, this gets closest to his view of life. Life is a left-handed form of endeavour and this film shows why.",

(DUH!) In my defence, the rendering of her on the poster/DVD cover looks absolutely NOTHING like her and she is only about 24 at the time. John Huston was a great director (and actor) and this film is very good despite the frequent moralizing and one dimensional characters who pop up every so often who prevent it from being a true classic like 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre'. Anyhow, being the granddaddy of all the caper flicks ever made, I was willing to overlook all the clich\u00c3\u00a9s and enjoy it (although Stanley Kubrick's 'The Killing' is a much more artfully crafted film and Dassin's 'Rififi' has much more interesting cast of crooks.)

[b]The Asphalt Jungle [/b]is very famous, directed by John Huston (\"Prizzi's Honor\"), nominated for four Oscars, but I couldn't get into it. It's very well done. The cinematography is gorgeous, but I just didn't care about any of the characters, or even the story really. Maybe because this is a heist film instead of a detective story. And I don't always enjoy a heist. But at least all of the women weren't evil. So that's a plus. But at the same time, there wasn't a femme fatale.\n\nI enjoyed [b]Kiss Me Deadly[/b] a bit more. Possibly because it was so strange. Detective Mike Hammer picks up a scantily clad female hitchhiker. She asks him to remember her if she doesn't make it. So when their car is overtaken, leaving her dead and him unconscious, he sets out to unravel the mystery. Though I can't say I really liked any of the characters in this film, either, I was at least intrigued by their stories. And the ending is very bizarre.\n\n[b]Akeelah and the Bee[/b] is a pretty much by-the-numbers drama about a girl from a poor urban neighborhood who tries to win the National Spelling Bee. And though I could see every plot point coming from a mile off, I still enjoyed it. Keke Palmer (\"Medea's Family Reunion\") is super precious as Akeelah and Lawrence Fishburne (\"Bobby\") keeps the teacher role from becoming terribly cliched. This would be excellent family viewing.\n\nThough Darren Aronofsky (\"Requiem for a Dream\")'s [b]The Fountain[/b] totally tanked at the box office, I was immediately drawn into it visually. Then I found myself emotionally invested in the story as well. Though I'm not sure exactly which parts were meant to be story and which parts were real life, it didn't matter. Hugh Jackman (\"Happy Feet\") totally sells every minute of each story. And did I mention the stunning visuals?",

Similar to Double Indemnity in that what seems like a perfect plan unravels because of circumstances out of their control combined with weakness of character, The Asphalt Jungle is also the blueprint for the modern heist movie. Noir had evolved from the affected and literary roots of Huston's debut, and it resembles the contemporary crime film far more in its grittier style and more naturalistic characters and dialogue. Sterling Hayden is the pick of the cast of comparatively little known character actors, and the straightforward honour and dignity of a man who is assumed to be nothing more than a violent street thug contrasts both with the obsequious and double dealing face of respectability played by Louis Calhern and the corruption of the dirty cop who breaks the case. On the down side, the female characters are a little weak and the ending feels more anti-climactic than bleak and so I personally prefer the convoluted plotting and punchy firecracker dialogue of earlier Noirs, but for those used to more realism in their tough guy street dramas, this is a great starting point.",

            "content": "[img]http://members.tripod.com/~alleysplace/Gifs5/MoviePoster10.gif[/img]\n \nThe Asphalt Jungle is about a major heist that goes wrong, and the reasons that it goes wrong are plentiful and ranging. This film makes many psychological and sociological observations as to the faults of the very foundations of crimes such as burglary and murder. One reason the heist is unsuccessful is that a stool pidgeon squealed to save his own hide, another is that a man gets greedy and tries to take all the jewels for himself. Heists and other crimes involving more than one person never work because the crimes themselves are based on selfishness, greed, and the compromising of morals. If that's your crime in the first place, then how can one ever trust who you're working with? If they were willing to commit one act for their own and undeserved good, what says that they wouldn't go even further against his partners in crime? This movie says, among other messages, that one cannot ever trust a crime partner or truly believe that they can get away with a crime. And Huston does not present this idea in a preachy way. He conveys these ideals in a fashion that makes complete sense. But quality messages like these aren't enough to make a great film, and The Asphalt Jungle stumbles in a few areas. Most importantly, no emotional weight is attached to anything in the movie. The main character, Dix, isn't a complete enough character to get the viewer engaged in the film. The viewer hardly gets to know anything about him, and this is also true about the rest of the characters. When there is hardly any emotional involvement with the characters in the movie, that makes it boring. The Asphalt Jungle heaps on the boring, not only because of the characters, but the plot is also conveyed in such a fashion that one would think that the director himself isn't very interested in his own story, either. It's nice to have a social statement, but it's even better if you present it in an environment with fully developed characters and a more interesting plot. The Asphalt Jungle is the first John Huston movie I've seen and given less than a 10/10, and I hope it's the last. I love Huston for his ability to complete involve the viewer in the story and take them on an emotional rollercoaster ride, but that important trademark seems to be sorely missing in this film. I hope that it's carried out through the majority of the films by John Huston that I still have to see.",

There is nothing new here it's a typical heist [url=\"http://www.adsrve.com/linkredirect.php?h=20,27783664,rottentomatoes.com,0\"]film[/url] with the same old stuff that is in all of them. The problem is all of the twists in hear you can see coming from a mile away. Everyone also raves about Sterling Hayden's performance in this as well. I think it's the worse performance I have ever seen him give! His character just seems so flat to me. Although everyone else in it is fine. Marilyn Monroe is barely in this so if you are watching it for her don't! She has about 5 minutes of screen time. Maybe I would have liked this more had I not seen so many better heist film's over the years.",

            "content": "[color=black]Asphalt Jungle. It's a 1950's Film Noir piece, and has all of the cliche's you'd expect. This is the story of a couple of joe's who are smalltime San Francisco hooligans. There is a crooked cop, a bookie, and a plan to take diamonds with the assistance of a recently released convict with a German accent, and lust for all women. Marilyn Monroe makes her big debut, by saying more than four lines in this movie. Sterling Hayden plays a big mook with a gambling problem. He owes big time. James Whitemore, who looks surprisingly like my ex-husband Dean, is a soda jerk and all around hoodlum. A codger is used as a front to cover diamond stealing expenses, then is going to be ripping the diamonds off of the bad guys. There are only bad guys. [/color][color=black]Every character has something crooked about him or her except for the long suffering bedridden gimpy wife of the guy fronting the cash. [/color]\n[color=black]There is a full ensemble cast, and no one person stands out as the star. The direction is really the focus of this film. The story is a bit out there, with a lot of colloquialisms, and it is much longer than I expected it would be. The photography is stunning, with great long angles, rack focus play, and a lot of shadow work. Negative space is almost picasso-like..turning simple buildings into caves and walls. As a director's piece, it's brilliant. As a film for a story, it's not so great. The characters are hard to identify with, and that makes it a bit difficult to find a protagonist at all. The didactic pontification done by the police chief both at the beginning and in the end of the film is a bit over the top. Unlike Double Indemnity, one of my all time favorite films, I didn't feel attached to the story or the people portrayed. It was just motion wall paper. the one thing I did note, Marilyn Monroe's acting was just J-lo like... flat with sex appeal as the only purpose. I guess her presence always put her as a hero of mine, but her abilities as a thespian had a lot of holes. This movie made her a cartoon character out of hustler, and nothing more. [/color]\n---- \n[color=#000000]Mamet's Spartan, starring Val Kilmer and Bill Macy, with a big appearance by Ed O'Neill, in his full Popeye Doyle style acting. [/color]\n \n[color=#000000]Spartan is a film about some Secret Service agents keeping track of a presidential candidate or incumbant's daughter. There is never any mention of the actual job of the guarded family. In full Mamet fashion, the dialog is full of repeating lines, metered dialogue, and curious wordings. The way Mamet has decided to use the language of the world is completely unique. He colors pronouns, he dances around phrases, he calls back full conversations in three or four syllables. It's fascinating use of English.[/color]\n[color=#000000]The story involves a kidnapped girl, who was under the supervision of the Secret Service. Val Kilmer plays a retired marine gunnery sargeant, who now works special programs, including the training of special recruits. It was hard not to see him as Batman in this. He played his character that way. It's not easy to figure out what the characters' realties are, but there is enough to keep you riveted and asking yourself, \"okay, what now?\" That kind of story is fascinating to watch. It was, at times, a little over my head. I readily admit that there were spots where I had no clue what was going on, and it would have been great to have Columbo or someone appear and fill me in. The kidnapping leads to sex slavery, and the people involved let the world think that the kidnapped gal was killed. It was all twists, and wildness. Bill Macy is a very creepy character. You're never really sure what he does, until the end, and I'll not be doing the spoiler thing.[/color]",

It's a wonder she didn't kill herself.
