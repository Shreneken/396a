This is a film that like a vintage wine gets better with age.Of course, the right elements were put together in this venture under Mr. Hamer's direction, which is probably the best tribute one could say about the film.Louis Mazzini, the young man who should have inherited a noble title that is lost as her mother elopes with an Italian tenor and she is disinherited. Louis is determined to regain what's due to him, by whatever means possible. Things go well for him, but he commits a mistake in entering an illicit romance with the calculating Sibella, while at the same time falling in love with the radiant Edith D'Ascoyne, the young widow.Dennis Price gives a smart account of Louis Mazzini. He is a delight to watch as he keeps scratching off dead relatives from behind the picture frame. Alec Guinness portrays eight D'Ascoynes with an unusual panache. Best of all is Lady Agatha who encounters 'turbulence' while flying in a balloon. Valerie Hobson makes an impression with her Edith and Joan Greenwood is at her best as Sibella.This is a film to treasure.",

            "content": "As much as I loved The Ladykillers, Kind Hearts and Coronets is my personal favourite of the Ealing comedies. One might argue that the narration is overused, I would say the narration added to the darkness, wit and charm of this superb film. The cinematography is crisp and smooth, and the score is great. Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script, that is funny, dark and has bite. The story slips smoothly between dastardly deaths in the guise of a self-satisfied memoir, and is gripping while moving along at a good pace, and the direction is secure. But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson, but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small, they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall, superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

True, one or two are barely given time to register before Dennis Price dispatches them (Lady Agatha would have been interesting as a fully rounded character), but those which are developed - Henry, the photography enthusiast in particular, are cleverly played and memorable.  Price also does well in his role.  The ladies - Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson - are excellent.  The great strength of this film is in its black humour, and of course in its delicious twist ending.  I can't bear to think of it remade with a 2000's gloss.",

What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable, impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social \"superior.\" The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour, is a shining example of \"British humour\" at its best. It is subtle, clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliant entertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much better than this.",

            "content": "This fine film is an example of Ealing at its very best, with a superlative script and acting of a very high standard. In watching, one is once more all too sadly aware of the difference in quality between British films of this era and today; there can't have been in recent times a screenplay as cleverly comic, economical and incisive as this is. The level of wit is high, and perfectly suitable for a black comedy such as this. Certain lines and scenes linger agreeably in the memory; the part where Price, in his droll narration, slips into verse, is wonderful, as is the \"fight\" he has with a lower-class rival; \"I'm not going to drawn into a scuffle with you!\"The element of class satire is strong, and while one is shown the lethargy and complacency of the upper classes through the amusing parade of Alec Guinness' characters, Price's corrupt plans are never condemned as such. His character, vigorous and witty, and the clever tool of narration, which in its tone draws in the viewer almost as a confidant. Similarly, but to an even more effective degree than in \"Whisky Galore!\" (1948) and \"The League of Gentlemen\" (1959), the viewer is made sympathetic to wrong-doings. The stunningly executed plot and dialogue are finely put across indeed by all of the actors. In the main role, Price refines and defines the cad Mancini perfectly; it really is a great performance, making the character more than memorable. Alec Guinness is great in his 8 roles, making a distinctive actorly mark in all of them. It says a lot that in a career as formidable as Guinness', in TV, film and theatre, his contribution to this film particularly stands out. The two ladies are impeccably played by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood, who contrast quite perfectly; Hobson as rich and strait-laced if certainly beautiful, and Greenwood as the distinctively seductive childhood friend. Price's \"juggling\" of his two women is wonderfully arch and amusing. The film's ending should be noted as quite ingenious and wonderfully in keeping with the film's overall wit.In the context even of Ealing, a studio adept at clever comedies, this is an extra-special film. Along with the films of this era of Powell and Pressburger and Carol Reed, this film makes one nostalgic for the days when British film was both distinctively British and universal in its qualities. Wonderfully funny and compelling, this film is one of my few favourites of all and overwhelmingly recommended.Rating:- *****/*****",

            "content": "Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.Before I saw this film, I had seen The Mouse That Roared and was spellbound by Peter Sellars and how he played the roles of so many people in that little movie (ranging from the hero to the prime minister to even the queen). I did not realize until later that Alec Guinness had done an equally masterful job about a decade earlier with this movie.Although not quite my favorite Ealing film starring him, it is certainly among my favorites. It is the story of a serial killer who you find yourself rooting for to get away with the crimes! Unlike some sicko, the main character has some understandable motivation for killing off several extended family members in order to obtain the family fortune. And when he kills several of these people, you find yourself wanting him to kill them as well! Now that takes amazing writing and acting to pull that off!! So see this charming little comedy. It has come on Turner Classic Movies several times lately, but if you can find the video, rent it!",

It's the same thing here where a young man never forgot that his mother had been slighted by the family for supposedly marrying beneath her.When she dies in poverty, he, as a young man, decides to do something about it. How he goes about bumping off the family members is memorable in itself. It just goes to show you that class distinctions could possibly drive anyone up the walls.What makes this film so good is the ironic twists that we see occurring between our gentleman friend and the two ladies of his life. How fate deals with him in the end is just hysterically too good.Kudos to Alec Guiness for the variety of parts he assumed.",

            "review_title": "\"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.\"",
            "content": "There's more than a touch of Oscar Wilde in this film. There is irony and elegant decadence, both in the visuals and in the script. The narrator, Louis Mazzini (Price), has murdered several people who stand between him and the title to which he feels entitled. Invited to go on a hunt with one of his victims-to-be he agrees to stroll along but refuses to carry a shotgun because he is opposed to blood sports. The protagonist is supercilious, snotty, and a complete egotist who is happy that one of his benefactors dies a natural death since it makes it unnecessary to kill him. It's so uncomfortable to murder someone with whom one has not had disagreements.What also strikes me is the resemblance to Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\", both in its structure and execution. Of course the movie lacks all of Nabokov's poetry (\"Light of my life. Fire of my loins\") but so does everything else ever written.Yet there are some isomorphic qualities in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\" aside from the elegant irony and the snobbishness of the narrator. Humbert Humbert is guilty not just of killing Quilty but of ruining the youth of an adolescent girl and he comments on his own perversity with the kind of distant amusement that Price's narrator does. Price's own debaucheries amuses him. At a wedding, he congratulates the groom whose virginal bride he seduced the evening before: \"You're a lucky man. Take my word for it.\" And, like Humbert, he feels nothing but contempt for people with \"suburban ways\". He's fastidious in his wardrobe and grooming. And if Humbert's love for Lolita was real, it was rarely expressed without being undercut by irony. (\"I was a pentapod monster.\") Similarly, Price has one real engine driving him -- a genuine desire to revenge the humiliation and death of his beloved mother -- although it's only brought up seriously once or twice. Both Price, as Mazzini, and Humbert Humbert are always showing off and quoting poetry. (Price's final quote, \"How happy could I be with either, Were t' other dear charmer away!\" is from Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera.\") The movie is extremely funny. The acting is superb all around, with Guiness being the splashiest performer in his five roles. But Price could not be improved upon. The way he manhandles his drunken rival Lionel, throwing him to the floor, then brushing his hands as if they'd been dirtied. And his improvised sample of the Matabele language (\"colloquial rendering of course\").The director has all of this down just pat. It's a very British movie. The understatement is almost overstated. Only two of the murdered people die on screen -- one peacefully. I cannot see an American remake of this without a lot of on screen blood and violence which, in my humble opinion, would drain the story of much of its humor.I will give just one example of what I mean, out of many possible. One of the men standing between Price and his title of Duke of Chalfont is played by Guiness as an amateur photography enthusiast who keeps a stash of sherry and whiskey in his windowless woodshed, in which he develops his prints. Guiness also hides some whiskey there, his wife being a \"prig\". Price substitutes an explosive for the kerosene in the lamp of the darkroom. Later, Price, Guiness, and Guiness's wife (Hobson) are having tea and Guiness decides to rush off to the woodshed to \"develop\" some film, leaving Price and Hobson carrying on a civilized conversation. About one hundred yards behind the couple is a stone wall behind which is the shed. Some time passes while Price and Hobson trade decorous Victorian observations on photography and so forth. During this exchange we hear a slight \"thud\". A few moments later a wisp of white smoke appears from behind the stone wall, roughly in the vicinity of the woodshed. The smoke increases and becomes a billow, at which point Price comments that \"someone must be burning leaves in the garden.\" Try as I might, I can't imagine a modern remake of this particular scene without a long suspenseful and explicit demonstration of Guiness going into the shed, striking a match, lighting the lamp, and having it explode in his face. There would follow an exterior shot of the shed being blown apart by a fireball, the stones flying through the air, the shrieks of Hobson and Price at their tea. It would simply be a different movie and not nearly as good.Man, this is funny. See it quick before they remake it and ruin it, as they did recently with Ealing's \"The Ladykillers.\"",

            "content": "Though it had been producing films since the 1930s, it wasn't until 1949 that Ealing Studios finally commenced its golden period. In was in this year that they released the first batch of their most entertaining comedies, including Alexander Mackendrick's 'Whisky Galore! (1949),' Henry Cornelius' 'Passport to Pimlico (1940),' Charles Frend's 'A Run for Your Money (1949)' {a little-known gem of which I'm very fond} and, of course, Robert Hamer's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949),' which launched Alec Guinness into a successful career with the studio. Easily one of the darkest comedies of its era, Hamer's film was loosely adapted from the novel \"Israel Rank,\" by Roy Horniman \u0096 among other changes, the main character was renamed from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini, to avoid any perceived anti-Semitism so soon after World War Two. The title itself was derived from an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, which reads, in part: \"Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.\" The films of Ealing Studios can often be characterised as good-natured, down-to-earth comedy offerings, light-hearted in tone and always steering towards the attainment of community betterment; characters typically conclude the film having learned a valuable lesson, and the ending is usually most ideal for all concerned. Later films such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951)' and especially 'The Ladykillers (1955)' returned to the murky themes of Hamer's film, but they couldn't avoid reinforcing the age-old adage that \"crime doesn't pay,\" whereas this comedy leaves ample room for the possibility of our killer escaping scot-free {however, for audiences across the Atlantic, the Production Code dictated that this ambiguity be removed}. Likely influenced by Charles Chaplin's 'Monsieur Verdoux (1947)' \u0096 a \"comedy of murders\" \u0096 Hamer unwaveringly filled his film to the brim with dark themes, dry wit and bitter irony, finding a hilariously suave and classy serial killer in actor Dennis Price, whose unflinching murderous plight attains a twisted sense of empathy through the maltreatment of his mother's memory at the hands of the D'Ascoyne family.I've often remarked that Alec Guinness never plays the same role twice, his character changing unrecognisably from picture to picture. In the case of this film, he virtually changes from scene to scene, portraying all eight heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont with uproarious charisma and versatility. It helps that most of Guinness' creations, merely targets for the conniving Louis Mazzini, are wholly unlikable or frustratingly senile, though there's certainly a pang of regret when the amiable photography hobbyist is murdered, and the manner in which The Duke is dispatched is shocking in its sheer cold-bloodedness. Perhaps a single complaint is that the murders of Lady Agatha and the General were skipped over much too quickly, and I would have enjoyed a more in-depth examination of the mechanics of the crime. The final act of the film is swathed in a healthy dose of irony, as Mazzini is arrested and charged for the one murder he didn't commit, his fate sealed and then rescued by his jilted mistress, Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who alone guesses the truth about what he has done.",

            "content": "When possible Duke Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price)'s mother dies, she leaves him a dying wish of being buried in his aristocratic family's plot who have shunned her all her life, he sets about getting it done. Imagine his fury and dismay when they say no. He sets about getting revenge, as well as winning the heart of the mercenary woman he loves through murdering each of the eight d'Ascoyne family members that stand between him and a title, riches, and everything that he feels he deserves.Wearing the Ealing black comedy streak on its sleeve and gleefully black, Kind Hearts and Coronets has got to be one of the funniest films about murder to be made. Much of this owes kudos to Alec Guinness' fantastic performance, a true tour-de-force in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend d'Ascoyne with commendable diversity, changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things, which Guinness then continued to deliver.That said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back. However, his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge, as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on post-war Britain, where the gold digging (played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood) women were everywhere and to some people, rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical, giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.For those who don't want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear \u0096 Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer's ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted. You really can't get much better, or much intelligent than this.",

            "content": "Robert Hamer's 1949 film \"Kind Hearts & Coronets\" is the epitome of British humor, from start to finish. Louis Mazzini (Price) is a descendant of the D'Ascoyne family, a family of royals, but unfortunately his mother has been disowned by the family for taking up with and marrying Louis Mazzini Sr., an Italian singer whom the family highly disapproves of. When Mazzini Sr. meets an untimely death early in young Louis' life, he sees his mother struggle to give him everything he needs, so after she dies, he vows revenge. He decides that he will get his birthright and become the Duke of Chalfont, except he has to get through the eight people ahead of him (all members of the D'Ascoyne family are played by Alec Guinness) who are in line for the title. Meanwhile, while he is calculating how he is going to commit cold-blooded murder to knock off each heir, he carries on a sort of double affair with Sibella (Greenwood), a woman who he has been enamored with since they were children and is now married to a former classmate of theirs, and Edith (Hobson), the young widow of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs that Louis offs. The story is told in flashbacks as Louis sits in a jail cell, awaiting his execution and writing his memoirs.This was one of the most clever and wickedly funny films I had seen in a long time. I honestly had no idea what to expect from it when I started watching; I only knew that it was an IMDb Top 250 film and it starred Alec Guinness. I didn't have a clue that it was going to turn out to be one of the greatest examples of British comedy I've seen this side of Monty Python. The gags in the film are so dry and subtle (at one point, Louis causes an explosion that means the demise of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs, yet when it goes off while he and the heir's wife are sitting in the garden having tea, neither of them even flinch, and she doesn't notice something is wrong until she actually turns around and sees the plumes of black smoke) and the theme so dark that it could theoretically be easy to forget that one is actually watching a comedy. There are no sight gags, double takes or high hilarity present, which makes this film all the more appealing, because it elicited huge laughs without stooping to typical elements of comedy.I thought that Guinness was going to be the breakout guy in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\", and believe me, it's certainly noteworthy to see him dressed in drag as Lady Agatha, but the real star of the film was the fantastic Dennis Price. He plays Louis with the slick charm of a Rex Harrison, but it is clear that his heart and temperament is far more nefarious than anything Harrison could drum up, even when he was plotting to kill his wife in \"Unfaithfully Yours\". When he utters lines like \"The next morning I went out shooting with Ethelred - or rather, to watch Ethelred shooting; for my principles will not allow me to take a direct part in blood sports\" when he has not only already killed several, but is planning on killing Ethelred himself, his aplomb yet sincere delivery is comic gold.I really enjoyed \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" and sincerely hope that even though it seems to be slipping more and more to the bottom of the IMDb Top 250 list after an initial strong appearance, its placement on the list will make more people seek it out. Frankly, I had never heard of the film before seeing it appear on the list, and I consider myself to be fairly adequate in my knowledge of classic film. And you'd be hard pressed to find a better classic film comedy than this one; it is ahead of its time in its clever wickedness. I would be willing to bet the Coen Brothers are fans of this film. 8/10 --Shelly",

The talented Sir Alec plays eight, count 'em eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family. These folks stand between Dennis Price and his quest for the title of Duke of Chalfont.Seems as though Price's mother was read out of the family when she married an Italian music teacher. She never forgot who she was and brought her son up to never forget as well.Price's supercilious narration which sets the tone for the film as he describes his various acts of murder tell as much about him as it does about the various people of the D'Ascoyne family. He's probably a bigger snob than all of the people he's killing.When you think about it, what is Price doing that Richard III didn't do to gain a throne in Shakespeare's adaption of his story? Interesting how we can be amused at Price bumping off his relations and be horrified at Laurence Olivier doing the same in his Richard III film. Then, that's black comedy.Alec Guinness was given great acclaim for essaying those many roles. My favorite has always been that doddering old fool of a clergyman whom we are told is in the proper profession.Kind Hearts and Coronets is set during Edwardian Britain when class and stature meant far more than they do now. It's a great tribute to the skill of the players and the writers that audiences today, even American audiences can enjoy it set in a world that is unimaginable to us. Besides Guinness and Price, Joan Greenwood as the femme fatale and Valerie Hobson as the widow of one of the Alec Guinnesses do some of their best screen work here.",

STRANGELOVE is a truly black comedy, ending in the destruction of the planet, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is a moral tale in spite of its theme of cold-blooded revenge.The \"for instances\" of irony go on forever in this film. Here are a few: Sibella rejects Louis for being too poor and marries the rich Lionel. Ultimately both she and Lionel turn in despair to the prosperous Louis for support.As Young D'Ascoyne indifferently deprives Louis of his position at the shop, so Louis coolly goes on to replace Young D'Ascoyne at the bank.The two members of the D'Ascoyne family who suffer the most emotional distress by Louis's murders (Edith and The Banker) are the two who do the most to give him aid and comfort.The Reverend Henry, in spite of being a Christian minister, lives in an atmosphere of luxury and pleasure to excess. His very reputation provides an excuse for his poisoning and its resultant cover-up.The Admiral's sheer inaccessibility protects him from Louis but dooms him all the same. Even a man standing beside him can't get through his thick skull in time to save him. He drowns at the salute with a life preserver bobbing nearby.The General praises the fame of the Russians for their caviar, forgetting that they were also infamous for their bombs.Lady Agatha is a crusader for women's rights, but it's her own equality with men as an heir to the Dukedom of Chalfond that marks her for elimination. Her willingness to martyr herself in one cause (women's suffrage and freeborn equality) gives Louis the opportunity to kill her for its exact opposite (patriarchy and inherited rights.) The cruel and judgmental Duke is caught and sentenced to death in a mantrap set by his own orders, and executed with his own weapon.Edith marries Louis as a show of faith in his innocence even though he turned her into a widow once before and will do so again if he's hanged.The eager executioner loses his opportunity to hang a nobleman because his inflated sense of occasion delays the proceedings.Lastly, Louis escapes the noose only to hang himself seven times over when years of meticulous planning are undone by a moment of forgetfulness.The more you watch this movie, the more details emerge each time. They don't write scripts this brilliant anymore.",

            "content": "The best and most loved of the Ealing Comedies is also the darkest. Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as \"that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters.\" That said, it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini, the charming, urbane serial killer, who really steals the show.The film opens in prison, with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne, Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that, his last night, he is completing his memoirs, which act as a framing device for the rest of the film, as well as allowing for a dry, witty narration from Mazzini himself.Kind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue, with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords, being tried by his peers.I suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII, after the Beverage reforms, and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly, Louis is presented with such sympathy, and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.You could regard it as a form of social commentary but, frankly, why bother? It's just glorious fun and, despite a certain English post-war feel, surprisingly modern and anarchic \u0096 there can be few films, even today, which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty, for instance, when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying \"furthermore, I am not naturally callous\".Of course, everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force \u0096 playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family; from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne (presumable unready for the fate that awaits him), the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality, few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors \u0096 Denis Price, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.This remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy, but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful, heart-warming tale of multiple murder. 9\u00bd / 10",

            "content": "It's a rare film, even among the good ones, that moves faster the second time you see it. Yet this is but one of the many virtues of this brilliant Ealing comedy, a brutally dark satire of the English upper class that sails along on gossamer wings.The film is best known for Alec Guinness's performance in eight separate roles, all of them members of the D'Ascoyne family, a rare duchy in which succession was possible from the female as well as male sides. Thus, when one D'Ascoyne woman is disowned from the family for marrying an Italian singer named Mazzini, she still retains the power of succession, as does her son Louis, provided the other D'Ascoynes die without issue. A grown Louis, smarting at his mother's treatment and his own lowly position in life, sets out to improve his station by exterminating his kin.Watching this film, it becomes clear pretty early that the central performance is not Guinness's but Dennis Price as Louis. Price not only has to carry the story with his acting and droll narration, but give us a figure we can both sympathize with and be horrified by. An earlier reviewer likened him to Richard III, but even those of us who enjoy Gloucester's skullduggery are glad to see him undone in the end. Louis Mazzini is unique in that we don't want him to fail, even when his victims (like the gentle parson and the henpecked photography buff Henry) are not so deserving of his homicidal attentions. It's a marvelously perverse treatment, done up in a very lighthearted way, and Price in his urbane Basil Rathbone underdog fashion carries the ball for all of us.By the end of the film, there's more upended Guinnesses to be found here than in a Dublin tavern, yet \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" is not merely a British version of the much inferior \"Arsenic And Old Lace.\" As Louis rises while his kinspeople fall, he finds himself having to choose between two lovely ladies, one a D'Ascoyne widow (Valerie Hobson) of high principles to which Louis aspires, the other a childhood chum (Joan Greenwood) who shares the darker impulses which got him where he is. There's a good deal of real dramatic and romantic tension in how Louis juggles his affections, along with some more killer comedy.Greenwood is especially remarkable, with lush bedroom eyes, a voice like a dipso courtesan, and a talent for drawing big laughs from her character's selfish pronouncements. She's so monstrous at times, teasing out Louis's early expressions of desire and taunting him about his aspirations for dukedom (\"Maybe pigs will fly\"), yet as the tale unfolds and she finds herself on the outside of Louis's bright future, we find ourselves pulled as much by her desperate, dark measures as we have been by Louis's. The two, as they agree, are made for each other.Like I said, this movie moves faster the second time you see it, because once you know what's cooking, the sly script and ace delivery makes a more positive impression, and make you a more receptive viewer. In that way, I wish the film had given us another 15 minutes, rounded itself out to two full hours, and given us more of the other Guinness D'Ascoynes, like the General (Guinness's best character with his gravelly voice and tales of bloody debacles) and Lady Agatha. What we get is sometimes a tad too neatly handled, and detracts slightly from the overall greatness.There's a casual brutality to this film that's a wonder for its time, and renders \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" timeless. Yet we also have in Louis Mazzini a character to pull for, and an ending that does not disappoint either in cleverness or fun. Give \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" a chance, and you may well walk away realizing the Pythons didn't only not invent merry black comedies, they didn't even perfect them.",

            "content": "As I've said on all my Ealing movie reviews, I watched these cause the plots looked interesting but I'm still unsure on how to judge the movies. I'm not one to dismiss them as 'old' and therefore 'boring'; at the same time I don't just jump on the bandwagon saying they're classics just because they've got that reputation and a lot of people without even judging for themselves assume they're great.To quote to further my point - \"A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.\" -Mark Twain So, watching this with an open mind, I really enjoyed it. Yes you have to realise it's not a modern movie so the kind of themes and scenes presented are different from the packaged elements of modern Hollywood, but that makes postwar British cinema very refreshing viewing. I think the use of the term 'comedy' is misleading because it most likely refers to it in the classic literary sense from Shakespeare and Greek theatre (probably in the early 20th century people were a bit better read than today so these terms would still have meaning to them) which refers to a story with happy ending and farcial plot and wit rather than obvious jokes like in the modern sense but even these movies have some funny scenes. Also the humour and premise is black comedy and subtle so look for something modern if you need laugh-out-loud movies.'Kind Hearts and Coronets' When I first came across this the plot looked so unique I knew I just had to see it at least once, although I've rewatched it many times since. I do find Guinness's 8 roles are over-hyped because most of them have few lines and the distinctions between a few of them are non-existent though it's still a novelty and a brave act to pull off in a movie. For me, Mazzini's 'bad guy' characterisation is the most appealing element of the movie, with a characterisation that makes even a criminal charming and someone to empathise with a little (and for me some visual appeal). The unique premises of who we see him murder next and the wit and black humour makes it a treasure of a film that I'm glad was made and is still available and enjoyed. One of my most beloved films for definite. Definitely worth one watch just to see something different.",

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Corrents is in a sense an extrapolation of Jane Austin's satire of the English aristocracy. Where Austin gives the reader a sarcastic insight into their ways of life, Kind Hearts and Correnets kills the English aristocracy off, as if to symbolise their slow demise within modernity. But, as this film illustrates the aristocracy has methods of survival via its never ending line of descendants ready to take on hereditary titles. Ironically, the survival of the dukedom in this film is due to the actual banished heir to that title murdering his relatives who stand in his way. If you like, this is an illustration of how there will always be an aristocracy of sorts, in the form of rulers in all types of societies, as illustrated in George Orwell's Animal Farm. This is because as the famous psychologist Erich Fromm says, as a conservative society we have a 'fear of freedom' and depend on being subordinates of rulers, like children to their parents. In Kind Hearts and Correnets we see an example of this when the duke performs his paternalistic duty for his dependant proletariat.The irony is that the lead actor, Dennis Price, in Kind Hearts and Corerenets is a descendant of minor aristocracy, himself deprived of his title due to the paternalistic line being directed away from him. In this case he plays the part of the denounced heir superbly. Meanwhile Valery Hobson shines out as a beautiful, elegant lady, which could be less to do with acting skills and more about playing herself.As for Sir Alec Guiness, it goes without saying that he steals the film, with his range of acting talents, here some of them showcased in all the characters he plays.In the case of the screenplay, it is wittily directed, well paced, entertaining, and never for a second boring. This permits a distraction for the viewer, and the overlooking of the minor flaw of how there were no accusations pointed towards the lead character which are to the viewer easily detectable given that he was present at most of the murders of his arosticratic relatives.Overall, an ageless classic.",

            "content": "Many people now days seem to have forgotten how Alec Guinness started out his career once. He was a quite successful comedy actor and appeared in several genre movies, often as the leading man. This sort of all changed after he won an Oscar for his serious role in \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\". Ever since people tend to mostly remember him for his serious roles, which makes his comical appearances and talents perhaps unfortunately a bit under-appreciated.In this movie he plays no less than 8 different roles, which are all members of the same family. Sounds Eddy Murphy like but it's of course done with lots of class and talent. He seamlessly plays all of the different character with great professionally involved but never without a comical touch, without ever making the movie feel ridicules.This was also actually one of his first movie roles and it seems amazing that he already scored so many big parts early on in his career. It shows what talent he had and how many great directors were already confident enough with his skills to offer him a great part in their productions.But it's of course not just Alec Guinness which makes this movie a great, amusing watch. I must say that all of the acting is simply great within the movie. It features some classy British acting, from mostly some unknown actors involved. Especially also Dennis Price knows to impress as the leading man of the movie.But it above all is also a greatly written movie. It features a nice concept, that serves perfectly as one to bring some good entertainment to the screen. It's a very amusing movie, mostly through its story. But it's also well constructed all. It's also a story that provides the movie with lots of pace, which also helps to make this movie better to watch now days than some of the other genre movies from the same era.The movie is being a comedy but it's a quite dark and subtle one. The humor and comedy doesn't ever get exaggerated and it relies often more on its clever writing than any of the movie its visuals or actors physics.A fine amusing movie to watch, that got made very well and with some great actors involved.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Also, there is a great performance from Valerie Hobson as the widowed Edith D'Ascoyne.

            "content": "Sitting in his cell with an 8am death sentence awaiting him, Louis Mazzini decides to write his story to last after he is gone. His story starts with his mother marrying outside of her class by going with an Italian singer (who dies on Louis' birth). With her money all gone, Mrs Mazzini decides to appeal to her relatives in the D'Ascoyne family \u0096 who reject her without reply. With her birthright denied she schools her son in her family tree in the hope that he will someday gain his inheritance. When she dies suddenly, her only wish is to be buried in the family plot \u0096 a wish that is denied, enraging Louis. Selecting the living members of the D'Ascoyne family, Louis decides to kill them one by one in revenge.It is a shame that this film has slowly started to be lost to modern audiences and is not as highly regarded by younger viewers as it is by older ones (look at the voting history for IMDb \u0096 not proof but an indication). The reason for this in my mind is that this is not a rip-roaringly hilarious comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles but one that is dark, clever and wonderfully droll. The script is dripping in humour but it is the drip of bile and blood \u0096 a very cruel humour that is as deadly as an assassin. The plot is pretty simple and it's main thrust works very well. The only bum note is Louis' relationship with Sibella, which serves to slow the film down a little bit and take away from the slick pace that it manages to have for most of it's scenes. For audiences who expect a comedy to have them laughing every 30 seconds, this film will be an enigma \u0096 where are the laughs they will shout, where is the comedy? It is likely that those that would say this would be unlikely to come to such an 'old' film but it is sad that they will likely not have the patience to see the beauty in the film. To me the humour of the film seeps from every pore \u0096 it is in the droll dialogue and in the absurdities of the characters.Of course this film would not have been so good were it not for two fantastic performances from two actors who totally 'got' the film's sense of humour and deliver their characters absolutely spot on to make the humour work. Although he is naturally overlooked in favour of his co-star, Price is great (and also plays more than one character). He has to carry the less showy side of the film (ie his plot with Sibella) but his delivery is great both in performance and in his droll narration. He could have played it up for laughs but, as I say, he understood the humour and delivered accordingly. Guinness is simply brilliant. Some of his roles are very small (the Admiral for example) and others are rather ordinary but others are wonderfully absurd and he delivers them perfectly. His Parson is my favourite character as he is the most obviously absurd and enjoyable. His delivery of them all is great \u0096 very different characters even if most of them do look unmistakably like Guinness himself.Overall this is a marvelously classy film that will still be a great film no matter how much the tastes of a modern audience plummet below the patience that the film requires to enjoy it. The script is darkly humorous \u0096 dripping in dark humour throughout (albeit with few actual laugh-out-loud moments). The two leads are wonderful and their performances show a real understanding of the film's aims. It is sad that this is not shown more on television \u0096 a fact that may be due to the use of the n-word several times in the final 10 minutes rather than anything else.",

One of the last in the series, The Ladykillers, was foolishly remade by the Coen Brothers (starring Tom Hanks) and it stank. The original films had a dark humor, moral ambiguity, ingenious plots and great dialog. The best in the series was Kind Hearts and Coronets - made almost at the start of the cycle.The stars are Dennis Price as Mazzini Jr. whose deceased mother was a member of the D'Ascoyne film before being disowned for marrying an Italian opera singer. Alec Guiness plays the eight surviving D'Ascoyne's (including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne) whose deaths could lead Mazzini to becoming Duke of Chalfont castle. Kind Hearts is a wonderfully black comedy about how Mazzini disposes of his relatives one by one in order to avenge his mother and become rich in the process. The greatest thing to note is the witty upper-class dialog. Dennis Price has the right mixture of believability and sleaziness while Guiness gives a tour-de-force of colorful performances.Kind Hearts is a very good introduction to Ealing comedies. Other good entries would be The Lavender Hill Mob (more cockney humor), The Ladykillers (which was actually funny unlike the remake) and The Man in the White Suit. All three star Alec Guiness.

            "content": "KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is one of those classics that never ages, even after repeated viewings. The rags-to-riches tale of Louis D'Ascoyne (Dennis Price), who ascends from lowly shop-worker to the dukedom through a series of brutal murders, is told in low-key fashion, as Louis spends his last night on earth prior to his execution. Price's soft-voiced, understated method of delivery makes the film sound as if murder is a normal occurrence; the kind of thing anyone might do if they wanted to acquire power. But this is director Robert Hamer's point; in an unequal world dedicated to privilege and high birth, even the most mild-mannered personality might be tempted to step the wrong side of the tracks.With consciously shadowy photography (by Douglas Slocombe) and ingenious set-designs (William Kelner), Hamer's film created a claustrophobic world, in which the lower middle classes (represented by Louis) are doomed to live in over-stuffed living-rooms and work in fusty shops, while the upper classes live in high ceilinged, paneled castles full of dusty furniture. No one, it seems, enjoys any real comfort. Hence the only way to survive is to adopt the \"every person for themselves\" philosophy, which is precisely what Louis decides to do. The film is very much of its time, released and shot in the post-war era, when aristocratic privilege seemed an anachronism, redolent of a bygone age.Price's performance contrasts starkly with that of Joan Greenwood's Sibella - whose honeyed tones suggest willing connivance in his schemes yet turn out to be nothing more than a facade. Like Louis, she is out for what she can get and will employ every stratagem at her disposal to achieve it.At the film's center stands Alec Guinness, in a virtuoso performance of eight different roles. Some of them are no more than cameos, but his portrayal of Young Henry as an open-hearted, basically kind person stands out in a corrupt world. Sadly Henry lacks the guile and the nous to survive, and he is soon dispatched to a better place, much to Louis' mock-regret.The film ends with a classic cameo by Arthur Lowe (later to become a household name in the television series DAD'S ARMY) as a reporter who unwittingly seals Louis' fate, proving beyond doubt that it's best to remain silent about one's past if one wants to survive.",

This tension is continually highlighted by the plot. An example of this is the scene where Louis Mazzini is sitting drinking tea with Edith D'Ascoyne in the garden, and calmly continues their conversation as smoke begins to appear behind her in the distance, from the hut where her husband is being incinerated.The other chief delight for me is the language. Every word of the dialogue and narration is precise, conveying neither more nor less that it ought. The examples given on the \"Memorable Quotes\" section are by no means all that could have been chosen. Lines like those can of course only be delivered by actors who are completely familiar with the English language at its most refined, and who have the composure to speak them as they were meant to be spoken.

I agree with the other comment - it's totally under-appreciated. Except by those who've seen it.",

Many of us remember him fondly in the role that won him as Oscar: Col. Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai. But, this fourth film he appeared in has always been in my mind as one of his greatest roles.The main character in this film, the serial killer, was played by Dennis Price, himself a very interesting character. He was very high born and expected to go into the military or the church. He chose acting, and had several good roles befitting his status. But life sometimes takes and awkward turn and he ended up making grade Z films for Jesus Franco, the Spanish Roger Corman. This stands as his greatest role.The actions after Price succeeded to the Dukedom was most fascinating and ultimately hilarious, as it was not the murders that would prove his undoing.An outstanding film that does stand the test of time with excellent performances by both Guinness and Price and Joan Greenwood.",

This is a fantastic comedy with some witty dialogue (particularly from the main character), and one actor playing all members of one family (probably one of the first actors to play more than one character in a film). Basically Louis (Dennis Price) is in prison (you know why later) writing memoirs of his recent exploits. His mother died, but she was rejected as part of the D'Ascoyne family for running off with an opera singer, so Louis gets no fortune and cannot be Duke. So he decides to start a revenge for himself and his mother by killing all the D'Ascoynes'. He would get to know them all first, and then eventually find ways to kill them and make it look accidental. All members are played by the great Sir Alec Guinness, they are The Banker, The Parson, The General, The Admiral, Young Ascoyne, Young Henry, Lady Agatha, and of course The Duke. Along the way, there is also a romance with ex-D'Ascoyne wife Edith (Valerie Hobson), as well as his real interest Sibella (Joan Greenwood). He almost gets what he should, but is found innocent for a crime he didn't commit (killing a friend), and the ending is classic. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film. Sir Alec Guinness was number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 11 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Films.

I cannot think of a weak link in the film. The casting was beautifully judged down to the most minor character. The leads are, though, just about perfect. For my money, it is the best of Dennis Price's film work (though his Jeeves on television in the 60's was good, too). Guinness was splendid and well supported by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood.

            "content": "Years and years before Tarantino was a gleam in his father's eye, a sumptuous and delightfully dark British comedy demonstrated that revenge, indeed, was a dish best served cold. And speaking of dish, I savored like a gourmet every bit of \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". Movies like this are the kind of experiences that can be equaled to a diner in a fancy restaurant where every sip of wine, every bite of meal, from the appetizers to the dessert, plays like a carnival of sensations in your taste buds. I can't exactly pinpoint in which department Robert Hamer's movie most succeeded, but it is a combination of many factors that movies seldom achieve. It starts with the story, the title derives from an excerpt from Alfred Tennyson's poem: \"Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.\" The story features the spectacular ascension of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, a young man of common birth but not so common lineage. His mother is a Noble but due to her marriage with an opera singer and her self-inflicted exile from the Family, she made herself a Persona-Non-Grata. Louis grew fatherless and all her mother's efforts to reconnect with her family or get a job for Louis met with rejection. She doesn't even get the privilege to be interred in the family vault. Meanwhile Louis proposes Sibella, a childhood friend, for marriage but only gets cruel mockeries about his rank and then-job as a draper's assistant.For newly orphaned and love-stricken Louis, these are two rejections too many and the starting point of one of the most elaborate and perfectly oiled schemes ever concocted in a film, all in pure British refinery. Holding the D'Ascoyne family as primarily responsible for all the troubles that affected his life, he decides to take his revenge and kill each member of the family to get his way to the Dukedom: eight D'Ascoyne and so many different ways to kill that you'd come to regret the Edwardian era and the bursts of stylish creativity it could inspire even in the deadliest actions. Poisoning, explosions, arrows and even plain bullets are so many weapons used by a cold and meticulous mastermind. There is something in Louis that evokes the patient efficiency of the Jackal.And more than the story, there's the storytelling. When the film opens, we actually see Louis in the night preceding his execution. He's referred to as the Duke and the executioner seems rather impressed and nervous. At first, we take it for granted that Louis was a Duke from the start, even his manners and the way he addresses a snoring cop shows that this is man cautious about his social status. But then the flashback, as narrated by his memoirs, reveals his past, and we understand that what we saw first is only the proof of his success. And this is how the narration works, it either precedes our comprehension or completes it, sometimes, what we hear and what we see effectively overlap, sometimes, narration adds to the visual enjoyment, sometimes, visuals have a literate level of appreciation. And some other times, it is just funny as hell.There's a moment in the film where Louis has just prepared an explosion to one of his targets and while he's talking about his victim's future to his soon-to-be-widowed wife, in the midst of the discussion, there's a sort of 'poof' sound. He probably heard it but he continues talking and so does the wife while you can seem a thick cloud of smoke in the background. This is pure gold of hilarity, something of comic books and cartoon levels, and yet it fits in this refined social study on the Edwardian mentalities. And of course, the comedic masterstroke remains the little gimmick the film is celebrated for: the casting of Alec Guinness in the roles of each D'Ascoyne member. Not only that, but the director even found a way to compile six different characters in the same frame, and it's refreshing to have a director try such stunts in the 40's. And I thought that Sellers was a genius and Guinness was unrecognizable in \"Ladykillers\", this is nothing compared to what Guinness achieved, especially since he's convincing in every role.Naturally, it would be unfair to associate the film's success with Guinness' talent only, there's no actor who proved unworthy, and certainly not Dennis Price, a face I found myself surprised not to know. It is sad that the actor's fate didn't match the prestige of such a debut, but he couldn't have a better lifetime role. This is one of the greatest British antiheroes that the story tactfully manages to prove sympathetic through some pivotal scenes, ethical moves and ironic twist of fates. Yet, as perfectionist as he is, the man has a weakness\u0085 \"cherchez la femme!\" Joanne Greenwood as the luscious mousy Sibella and Valerie Hobson as the dignified Edith are two pawns in the same game and provides clever complications, proving that the film didn't just take its \"serial killing\" plot for granted. The women also contribute to the ambiguity of the ending, one I dare not to spoil, except to say that it was the perfect note to conclude such a masterpiece.And masterpiece is the word for I've rarely encountered films where the story, the writing, the acting, the storytelling, the directing created such a delightful combination. The film is in the Top 10 Greatest British Movies of All-Time and for reasons, and after discovering \"Ladykillers\", another gem of Ealing Studios, I'm looking forward to discovering all these titles I've heard about such as \"The Man in the White Suit\" and \"The Lavender Hill Mob\". There's something so irresistible about these films, but I doubt they will ever equal the experience of \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". I hope I'm wrong.",

Alec Guinness gives a wonderful performance, playing all 8 members of the d'Ascoigne family, murdered by Dennis Price as the black sheep claimant to the ducal title.  The writing is incredibly witty throughout, making full use of classic English understatement.  One of my favourites is of Guinness as a boring army general, perpetually replaying his battles at his club.  As he is brought a jar of caviar he stops his recitation to remark, \"Used to get a lot of this stuff in the Crimea.  One thing the Russkies do really well.\" Whereupon he sticks a knife in the jar and a bomb hidden inside blows him to smithereens.  The writers assume the viewer will realize that historically, bombs were the other thing the Russkies used to do really well, but I begin to wonder if young viewers today, with less knowledge of history, would get the full flavour of the joke.Dennis Price has a difficult task facing off against Guinness in so many scenes, but he does a fine job.  His voice, reciting the history of his terrible crimes against his own family, is smooth and untroubled throughout, blandly describing the unfortunate death of each d'Ascoigne, and even a few bystanders.  When his first murder takes place, he also kills off a young lady with whom the snobby Ascoigne d'Ascoigne is having a dirty weekend: \"I was sorry about the girl, but I consoled myself with the thought that she had presumably already undergone 'a fate worse than death.'\"  Such an elegant way of using the old expression that meant \"to lose one's virginity outside marriage\", and such a wickedly funny way of excusing the inexcusable.",

It also features an entertaining, if morbid, story-line and some quietly witty dialogue and other touches. It is also creative in taking the quaint yet widespread pre-occupation with titles and the peerage, and turning it on its head.All of the humor is of the driest, most \"British\" and often ironical kind, and indeed some of it is so underplayed that you don't catch it all in one viewing. Likewise, in the lead role Dennis Price is consistently restrained and even distant, and it's easy to wonder whether a somewhat less cool performance might have made the movie even better. On the other hand, too broad of a performance clearly would not have worked at all.Guinness, while always careful not to stretch a character or a scene too far, provides his characters with identifiable and usually interesting personalities. The variety helps out the movie by adding a dimension that's not always there in the major characters.The feature is generally satisfying, and always interesting, because of its refined and often ironically elegant style. At the same time, for much of the time it remains curiously unaffecting, since there is often little reason to care about the characters, other than for their entertainment value.

            "content": "Having not seen this film in many years, I re-visited it after seeing the musical version based upon the original book, \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder\". Like this film version, the victims are all played by one man (film: Alec Guennis; stage: Jefferson Mays), and the leading character (Dennis Price in the film) is so suave and dapper that who could believe that he was really in the league of Tod Slaughter? Having been banished from his legacy of being part of a wealthy family because his mother married a commoner, Price seeks revenge in the most sinister of ways, and as a result, the body count increases. While the musical version utilizes farce to visualize the killings, the film is much more subtle in how it is done. In fact, you are hardly aware throughout most of the film that you are watching a comedy, and when you do laugh, they come out of irony rather than the silliness which makes the Broadway musical a genuine crowd pleaser.Alec Guennis could flip pancakes while reading the telephone book and make you laugh. Here, he's a variety of character, male and female, imperious and charming, yet each of them ends up with the same fate. Price makes his demon cousin so likable that you can't blame him for seeking at least some sort of retribution. There's no doubt in my mind that Guennis's one drag character certainly didn't look like a woman at all, yet there's poetry in the way Price dispatches of her, and there's irony in what finally catches the law up to him. British beauties Joan Greenwood and Valarie Hobson are both excellent eye candy and charmingly comic as they find themselves dragged into Price's web. Yes, the plot is certainly amoral, but when done with such droll charm and subtle sparkle through the eye of the killer, you can't help but find yourself mesmerized by the whole package.",

It is one of those old Black and Whites which at first glance you think is going to be another typical piece of 1940s British cinema. This opinion could not be further from the truth. In the 1940s, the majority of British Film released was heavy Drama, and Wartime films, things like Kind Hearts were entirely neglected. So I feel it is a nice break from your average piece of 40s film. There are so many little things about this film which combine to make it one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The naration of the lead is brilliant, and without it I feel the film would lose marks. I love the calm, collected and often hilarious way in which he goes through his story and all the terrible things he has done. The picture is totally charming, the cinematography and direction seems to capture the feel of what is supposed to be going on perfectly. I love the fact that the director often manages to give the film a look of charming and happy innocene, whilst the protagonist is in the process of some terrible deed. One particular scene sprigns to mind as the scene in which Henry D'Ascoyne dies. I love how our Hero sits calmy in the idyllic English countryside with his murder victims wife, calmly taking afternoon tea, and when he sees smoke from the explosion he makes some comment about burning leaves. Brilliant.The trial in the House Of Lords is one of my favourite scenes from the film, I again love the collectedness of the protagonist as he sits through his trial. I also really enjoy seeing the House of Lords being used as it should be, not ruined by these awful modernists. The film is awesome. The story is great, a man low down in the sucssesion trying to become Duke. What more could you want? It's a comedy, so I didn't expect well defined characthers and a finely tuned story, so was surprised to get one.The ending of the film is possibly one of the greatest and funniest film endings I have ever seen.

His performances in Lavender Hill Mob, The Man in the White Suit, Oliver Twist (1948), and The Bridge on the River Kwai are pretty much unmatched by anyone... except himself as eight characters in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Mind you, Dennis Price deserves plaudits for his towering performance and he too plays more than one character (he also plays his father). Their acting alone would have made watching this film indispensable to anyone who cares even slightly about films. But there are other treasures to it: There is a most enjoyable and eloquent use of the English language with possibly the quirkiest and cleverest dialogue I have ever chanced upon; wonderful diction by all (though in smaller parts, Joan Greenwood with her throaty voice and beautiful Valerie Hobson with her polished accent are too lovable for words); the satire of English aristocracy, its self-preserving immunity and its murderous values; the volatility of fate; and the most successful, witty, and intelligent twist ending I have ever seen. To cap it all, Director Robert Hamer is in his best form ever. The performances he extracts from his ensemble and his use of the camera are top drawer.

            "review_title": "If you look up the Great Droll British Satire in the dictionary...",
            "content": "One of the things I noticed on my first watch of Robert Hamer's Kind Hearts and Coronets (from the studio that later brought you The Ladykillers), is that it aims and achieves for much more than it could have. This could have been just a silly comedy about an ambitious man trying to reach his way to the top of the Duke-dom - specifically with the D'Ascoyne family, all played by Alec Guinness by the way - and it might have some edge to it but would be more about the funny make-up and outfits that Guinness puts on. But what makes it more is that there is a real film here, and attention is paid to supporting characters - especially the women, and another man named Lionel who will prove to be a big part of the plot - and it has the underlying air of a film noir: a criminal, the dames in his life, and narration leading the viewer along on the way.At the same time, Kind Hearts is a raucous satire of the upper class and nobility, and what it means to have privilege and status in society. Dennis Price plays Louis as a man who is nearly always with the utmost, upright character. He may be half Italian and half the son of an Italian singer (who, as we learn, dropped dead of a heart attack before he really knew him), but everything in his actions as he goes one by one in killing most of the D'Ascoynes is that of a complete gentlemen. If he wasn't so fervent about rising to the top in his calculating and homicidal manner, he might make for a great (if strict) teacher of manners for school-boys... which is part of the point: this is a society that prides manners, good speaking, poise, fashionable dress, and even Price's accent is just right. If he had the bad luck of being raised Cockney, he'd never make it through the front door of the Duke's home.Guinness is a performer-genius, and this is one of the films that shows that with riotous effect. Some of the characters may not even get much screen time, like the Admiral who goes down with the ship by going Port instead of Starbord (not one of Louis' victims, but what a way to go), or the Lady D'Ascoyne, who meets maybe the funniest end as she flies over the people promoting Women's rights in a hot air balloon (it shouldn't be funny, promoting women's rights, but when it's Guinness in a dress waving to the public, I'm sorry, I lost it). Maybe my favorite of his creations is the religious man, The Parson, who is one of the older figures, slow and yet loving to ramble and drag things along about the D'Ascoyne legacy in the church he works at, and watch as he is under no impression of fakery listening to Louis reciting some obscure language. Guinness may not look like it, but he's having the time of his life with these roles, going so far as to change his height when necessary, and it's surprising to see what he'll show up as next.In the more straightforward part of the story, this too is solid and goes along with the satirical part, if a little more leaning towards a conventional story. There's the two women in his life - one of them, a D'Ascoyne wife (soon to be ex), is actually admirable and attractive to Louis. It's interesting to see how our (anti)hero sees other people and actually does have respect for them (the one member of the family who dies of stroke he admits \"glad\" to have not had to kill), perhaps because they share the same upstanding manner of him, or have a sense of dignity in his warped perspective. Hobson is Edith, the (ex)D'Ascoyne, and is a pleasure to see on screen opposite Louis. The other woman is one who fancies him more than he does her, Sibella (Greenwood), maybe more of the 'femme fatale' of the story. She may have some level of dignity, but it's below Louis' standards, whatever those they may be. How she comes around at the end, however, is one of the more clever twists in all movies. I mean, ever.So much of Kind Hearts and Coronets is based upon the droll manner that becomes English society, specifically the 'noble' class, or even those who may be closer to \"working\" like the Photographer who imbibes in secret in his development room. In some ways this would make a good double feature with Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, also about a murderous character we grow to kinda love while also about class, but perhaps an even better comparison is with The Rules of the Game by Renoir. Deep down this is cunning, savage work on how for centuries the British have seen themselves, and I have to think this could only be done, at least this way, from the UK. We all know Royalty gets it way too good, they're up at the top, so a movie like this is practically necessary - a beautiful, cynical, and a dastardly tonic for everyone not of royalty, and right after WW2 to boot (though, who knows, maybe they love it as well, if only in secret).A lot of this is funny, but even if it's not it's captivating stuff. Even the \"Villain Monologue\" trope is not only acceptable but riveting.",

            "content": "This classic Ealing Comedy opens with protagonist Louis Mazzini, the Tenth Duke of Chalfont, in the condemned man's cell; as he awaits his execution he writes his memoirs and in doing so tell us how he came to be there.He tells how his mother was disowned by her family, the D'Ascoynes; heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont, for marrying and an Italian singer. When they refuse him a position at the family bank he is forced to work in a clothes shop then when they refuse to let his mother be interred in the family vault he vows revenge\u0085 he will kill the eight D'Ascoyne's between himself and the dukedom. Meanwhile he proposes to his childhood sweetheart Sibella but is rejected in favour of a wealthier suitor. His first opportunity comes when Ascoyne D'Ascoyne comes into the shop to buy something for his girlfriend. Louis overhears him saying where they will be going for a few days; he goes there too and kills Ascoyne and the poor girl. He is quick to give his condolences to the family and soon is offered the post at the bank that he had been rejected for earlier. That doesn't stop his plans though and soon other D'Ascoynes are dead and he is getting closer to his ultimate goal. While all this is going on another dilemma arises; he has been carrying on an affair with Sibella but has fallen for Edith, the widow of Henry D'Ascoyne; a far more suitable match for a future duke. Inevitably the police eventually catch up with him\u0085 but not for a death he had thought about.There are a lot of great Ealing Comedies but I think this is my favourite. The comedy is fairly dark but there are plenty of laughs to be had. This is largely down to Alec Guinness's brilliant performance as no less than eight members of the D'Ascoyne family; both young and old, even including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne. Dennis Price is also great as Louis; his performance is such that it is easy to sympathise with this mass murderer as he coolly works his way to the Dukedom. His character isn't too likable though; he does have an affair with Sibella then, as he gets closer to the Dukedom, he decides she really isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are impressive too; most notably Joan Greenwood who plays Sibella; a character who proves to be surprisingly devious in the end. Overall I'd strongly recommend this to anybody who likes their comedy dark; it may be an old film but it still feels surprisingly fresh\u0085 possibly because it was set forty years in the past when it was made.",

Its the one where Alec Guinness plays the eight D'Ascoynes who Dennis Price, as the ultimate Machiavellian usurper Louis Mazzini, coolly, humorously and charmingly knocks off in order to ascend to a Dukedom.This film has to have one of the most amazing scripts ever filmed. Guinness, wonderful as ever, is truly great but Price is perhaps even better. Ealing gave Price the role of a lifetime as Mazzini, and Price responded with the performance of a lifetime. His voice-over is just, ahem, \"priceless\". Joan Greenwood plays the selfish, sexy Sibella who Price romances while also courting the elegant widow Edith D'Ascoyne (Valerie Hobson) of one of his unfortunate victims.Everyone please see this film!

            "content": "For my American ears, it's the painstaking politeness that's most notable in this British comedy of manners. At times, Mazzini seems close to asking permission just to breathe among the wealthy and titled. In fact, I suspect that was a big attraction for many Brits (& Americans), watching all those high-and-mighty D'Ascoyne's get bumped off in humorous fashion.The clever screenplay makes the most of Price's icy, clipped demeanor. In fact, looking back over the narrative, it's surprising how much Mazzini changes. At first, he's really sympathetic for being cut out of the snobbish family and watching his mother suffer as a result. But slowly, as he executes his vengeful scheme, he becomes more cold-blooded and even dislikable. This appears a neglected facet of the movie as a whole.What an inspiration having Guiness play all the D'Ascoyne offshoots. That way we avoid feeling guilty over each demise since it's so obviously tongue-in-cheek. On the other hand, I suspect the more realistic dispatch of the duke himself was done in order to emotionally justify Mazzini's eventual execution.Overall, the movie remains a marvel of astute craftsmanship, while Greenwood's coy little vixen remains a masterpiece of feminine amorality\u2014and catch those dress-up hats deployed like battleships on her head. At the same time, her various transgressions go unpunished by movie's end, something unthinkable in American cinema of the time. Anyway, as a comedy, the film may be as brittle as they come. Nonetheless, it remains even 60-years later a brilliant one-of-a-kind.",

Price, a genuine war hero in World War II, had a career that lasted for nearly 30 years, during which he played comic and serious roles with consummate skill.  No one could portray the arch, sophisticated rogue better than Price, as is evident not only in \"Kind Hearts\" but in another of my favorite comedies of the period \"The Naked Truth\" (1957, where he plays the elegant but sleazy tabloid editor/blackmailer, opposite the likes of Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, and Peggy Mount. He was very funny in a small role as the \"gentleman con man\" in Sellers' great hit of 1962, \"The Wrong Arm of the Law.\"   And for dramatic intensity one can point to his role of Major Charlie Scott in the gripping regimental drama, \"The Tunes of Glory.\" (1960).  So three cheers for Price as that charming rogue, \"Louis Mazzini,\" in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets.\"",

One by one he bumps off the eight people whose bloodlines stand between him and the Dukedom, but a female admirer begins to suspect his schemes.Arguably the best of the great Ealing comedies, and one of the greatest black comedies ever made, this is a mannered, twisted, delicious peach of a film. As a piece of simple melodrama it would be entertaining enough, but its wit and satirical bite - Oscar Wilde meets Agatha Christie - elevates it to a near masterpiece. Price is unforgettable as the dastardly yet lovable Louis Mazzini; a man whose moral double-standards are both admirable and detestable. His smooth, measured delivery of some of the best British film dialogue ever written is a sheer delight. The rest of the cast are equally to be treasured, especially Greenwood as the vain, preening Sibella, whose hideous self-absorption is matched only by the ugliness of her hats. This movie is most famous however for Guinness' incredible Star Turn as the unfortunate D'Ascoynes - eight of them (a dandy, a banker, a photographer, a parson, a suffragette, a general, an admiral and a duke) - all of whom Price gleefully murders. Guinness is both amazing and amazingly funny; my favourite is the doddery old vicar (\"Sir, the port is with you.\"), but it's Price's movie all the way. Brilliantly written by Hamer and John Dighton (very loosely based on Roy Horniman's novel Israel Rank, with a title from Tennyson's Lady Clara Vere De Vere), with tremendous photography by Douglas Slocombe, this is an absolute gem of a picture, polished to perfection.",

            "content": "A man, who's mother was disowned by their aristocratic family, embarks on a campaign of bloody revenge.I think this is one of the best British films and funniest comedies I've ever seen. It has a strong plot, incredibly funny dialogue, great visuals and a number of superb performances.Considering it came out of Ealing studios in 1949, it's themes are jet black, touching on revenge, blackmail, infidelity, murder and death in general. The class system comes under intense satire with its caricatures embodied by a variety of performances. Moral codes are subverted and there is a strong sense of sexuality underlying many scenes. Most of this is done in the most dignified British way of course.The story has a dark and amusing premise with events unfolding in a series of quite sadistic interactions between Louis Mazzini and the members of the D'Ascoyne family. Most of it is narrated by Mazzini as he awaits the hangman's noose.We quickly learn that Mazzini isn't your typical movie protagonist. He is hell-bent on killing everyone who stands between him and succession to the title Duke of Chalfont. This ambition is so strong he is devoid of any conscience and even takes pleasure in most of it. He is almost a relic from the Middle Ages of feudal Britain, played with ice-cold contempt and hilarious wit by Dennis Price.The great Sir Alec Guinness gives fantastic support by co-staring in nine separate roles as various members of the D'Ascoyne family. His performances, along with the costumes and makeup work to make the concept plausible.Another notable performance is that of Joan Greenwood as Sibella, who is the very definition of the proverb 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. It's not what she says, it's what she doesn't say with a look in her eyes that communicates to the audience exactly what she's thinking at crucial points in the story.What makes Kind Hearts And Coronets special is the dialogue. Everything said both in narration and conversation between characters is beautifully written. Characters speak very elegantly but what they say is layered with dark cynicism and brilliant irony. If you appreciate humour on display, you should find it prolifically funny throughout its running time. If the humour is not to your taste, it could be a long 106 minutes of posh, upper class English banter. I say this because comedy as always is a very subjective genre.From a technical perspective, I think it has strong examples of cinematography and editing. From the outset there are excellently composed shots with atmospheric lighting. There are many beautiful landscapes of the English countryside and great transitions between scenes.It all ends in the most ironic and atypical way for a movie made in an era where strict moral codes were usually observed during filmmaking. The last few seconds and final image for me are an all time classic sequence.A word of warning that some of the dialogue is a product of its time. In particular I refer to a use of the racist version of the nursery rhyme \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\" and a follow-up use of that same slur in the next sentence of dialogue. Take heart in knowing that societies have moved on since then with modern writers and audiences knowing it to be offensive and unacceptable. However, this probably feels more significant than it should in a movie centred around mass-murder.",

The Ladykillers from the same team later provided more in the way of slapstick.

This involves the murder of eight Alec Guinness's which is taken to with gusto, and with some success. It was the urbane Dennis Price's finest performance, the one for which he'll be remembered, and coquettish Joan Greenwood played her heart out too. As for Guinness, his various performances have gone down in film history, although most of the collection were merely walk on parts. The plot and dialogue was incessantly erudite, witty and thought-provoking, the entire film sparkles with ingenuity. The attention to detail was total, and the elegant photography of it all by Douglas Slocombe was too. The American end version was interesting but unnecessary as the ultimate retribution was clear and clearly impending. The nword used was unnecessary but normal as part of the then popular children's rhyme and simply reflects back to us a time when white people could use that word unthinkingly; nowadays lovely premeditated obscenity and profanity is the accepted norm for all. The scheming Greenwood suggesting the possibility of the two dependent miracles to the scheming Price in the interview room are the money shots for me, it's the mesmerising logical culmination of the intelligent script.Imho it's almost perfect in every department and really beyond all criticism as completely in a league of its own as a unique work of Art.",

            "content": "In the decade after WW-II, Ealing Studios (UK) produced many droll comedies, several starring Guinness; \"KH&C\" is probably its most famous (and blackest) comedy. It's a delightful satire on the British emphasis of class, class deference, & appropriate ritual manners with class, etc., set around the beginning of the 20th century, just after the Victorian era.Dennis Price has the lead role as Louis Mazzini, a VERY distant heir to the Dukedom of Chalmont, inherited through the D'Ascoyne family line. His mother, a D'Ascoyne, married an Italian singer for love and not status and, for that reason, was disinherited, disowned.Louis has scarcely even a remote chance of inheriting the title--there are a dozen D'Ascoynes ahead of his position of inheritance.BUT, some accidents happen; Louis becomes sufficiently ticked off by some of the D'Ascoyne haughtiness that he starts doing away with many of those standing between him and the title.Alec Guinness, certainly one of the great actors of all times, plays eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family (one a female) varying in age from maybe 35 to 90. His changes of voice, facial expression, posture, movements, etc., so perfectly fit each character he's incredible.Dennis Price in the lead role (Louis Mazzini) was excellent and holds everything together: whether as a lad of 16, a ladies' underwear salesman at 25, or an upwardly climbing society member, he fit his roles precisely. A very young Joan Greenwood was a great vamp. \"KH&C\" is called a \"black comedy.\" While that's true, I think the emphasis should be on the comedy rather than the black. No scenes of murder are seen, only their build-up and consequences.This film was made in the late '40s, long before awareness about racial stereotypes arose. Thus its nonchalant use of the original child's rhyme \"Eeenie, meenie, meinnie mow.........\" rhyme is a sign of what was acceptable in those times, NOT of now.Out of 10 stars, I'd give it 9 3/4. A must see movie, a classic.P.S. -- We saw the Criterion Collection DVD which gave the world-wide ending rather than the original version made for the USA which, in those years, was governed by the Hays Code; this code prohibited ANY hint of receiving a benefit from committing a crime. The non-USA ending is FAR more preferable.ALSO, if you have optional subtitles available for the hearing impaired (as in the Criterion version), consider using them.

He is pushed over the edge when he has a run-in with one of his distant relatives and loses his job, and for revenge he ends up causing the relative a fatal boat accident that has the effect of embarrassing the relative after death. Then he gets the idea of wiping out the rest of his relatives until he can get the noble title himself, though in doing so, his intentions do not go unnoticed.Alec Guinness plays each relative, so it tends to soften the idea of their being murdered (you see the same person again and again), and the killings are done in clever ways, which has the same effect.

Along with Price's remarkable performance Alec Guiness is also outstanding playing no less than nine separate character (all members of the noble family).

Tell her that I have gone to avenge her wrongs, and will return only as the messenger of punishment and death.'The aria by Don Octavio from Mozart's Don Giovanni which plays over the opening titles and during the early scene sets the tone for the film perfectly. By providing a subtle accompaniment to a sequence of events that occur prior to the birth of the narrator \u2013 Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini, first viewed from behind in a prison cell whilst awaiting death by hanging \u2013 it recalls Don Giovanni's ultimate fate for his refusal to repent of his past sins.The story of the immediate past of Louis's parents unfolds in the film's unhurried, languid manner and provides the main reason as to just why he set out as he did to avenge his dead mother, an erstwhile member of the titled D'Ascoyne family: she was ostracised for having had the temerity to put love before a life of rank and privilege and married an opera singer. The more the story unfolds, the more the protagonist Dennis Price seems to cast aside the role of being simply the harbinger of death and becomes more the principal: having made the fateful step upon the path of revenge he seems to grow in worldly power and malevolent influence as he draws nearer to his ultimate goal of becoming the tenth Duke of Chalfont, with the result that he reveals himself to be more and more truly a member of the D'Ascoyne family, in manner and in character, one that he presumed to despise so much.Price is magnificent. His mellifluous and studied voice with its pitch, flourishes and aspirated delivery is a joy to listen to, ideally suited to the film's first person narrative and its Edwardian appeal. He gives a performance of such refined charm and genteel good manners that the listener becomes inevitably and completely entranced, happily paying little or no heed to the contrasting nature of his murderous and vengeful behaviour. Always ready with either a bon mot or an anecdote, has there ever been a wittier, more humorous or more sympathetic villain? Kind Hearts and Coronets simply drips with irony, understatement, drollness and humour of a deliciously dark kind \u2013 which is due in no small part to the brilliance of the screenplay. The director (and co-writer) Robert Hamer had his finger on the pulse of the late Victorian/Edwardian era to such an extent one would feel that he was plucked directly from either one of its garden parties or its many cricket matches. His use of the period language and his awareness of that era's social nuances combine effortlessly and flawlessly to describe that carefree time, so soon to vanish, enjoyed between the turn of the 20th century and the start of the First World War. Based upon the novel 'Israel Rank' by Roy Horniman, the film is enacted by a cast who unite to confer a series of excellent performances upon the audience. From Alec Guiness's superb turn as successively ill-fated members of the D'Ascoyne family \u2013 done away with by either good fortune or in inventive manner \u2013 to the inimitable portrayals by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood of womanhood, both sacred and profane, and those minor but no less important roles of Miles Malleson, Clive Morton and Audrey Fildes amongst others, all of whom deserve praise for work that can still be appreciated for its sheer craftsmanship more than half a century after its inception. Kind hearts and Coronets is simply a tour- de- force.",

It is an Ealing comedy unlike their other offerings.So how could this movie, released in in 1949 and obviously in black and white, have entertained me to the extent that I can still class it as one of my all time favourites? Answer:... this is near perfect cinema. The art of making a black comedy is a tough area of film and one that has produced more duds than successes. There are no laughs as such, yet you know that this is a comedy from the start, despite it being dark, moody and serious. To be able to turn the topic of jealousy and death into comedy is an amazing feat and it is not until you realise that Alex Guinness is playing multiple parts that you fully understand that this is not your typical film.I wont give anything away, but I urge you to watch and enjoy this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably one of the nastiest movies ever made. And there's hardly an ounce of onscreen violence in it. I first saw this flick as a child, and although I liked it, I was probably too young to understand it fully. Well, now I do. It's brilliant. Dennis Price as the vengeful, amoral (yet, in his own way, strangely moral) Louis Mazzini turns in a fantastic, beautiful, even sympathetic performance. (Would you believe *sympathetic?*) He is complemented--though not overshadowed--by the inimitable Alec Guinness in eight roles as members of the D'Ascoyne family. And Joan Greenwood is every bit Price's conniving equal as Sibella. I should also mention that the script is mind-boggling. It's all nasty stuff covered up by Victorian gentility. Scathing attack on nobility, too. Also on folks who seem to miss the point about art (like Guinness' portrayal of the priest).I'm running out of ways to express my enjoyment of the film, but I'd like to make a final point. I read a comment allegedly attributed to Lindsay Anderson that indicated the movie's visuals didn't live up to the screenplay. Just want to respectfully disagree. I believe the visuals were perfectly suited to the film, as they framed the action perfectly, called attention to the comic moments without creating any distractions (via camera or otherwise) and provided clean, clear visuals. In other words, a perfect appearance for a nearly perfect comedy. The strong editing also helped. So, while this is not a visually innovative film on the level of, say, \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Battleship Potemkin,\" it doesn't need to be...nor should it be. The sum of its parts makes a thoroughly delectable whole.How many stars are we allowed to give it? :-)Simon",

Quirkily funny at times too.More than just a crime drama, the movie also pokes fun at England's class and peerage system.

            "content": "I decided to look up this little British movie with the strange title, ranked very high on the all-time British movie list. I didn't have to look very far, my public library has the DVD, and a superb DVD it is. The picture is amazingly nice for a 50+ year old movie, and has an interesting 'extra' which chronicles the film career of Sir Alec Guinness, who early in his attemps was told, 'You'll never make it as an actor.'  I watched it, fully expecting it to be overrated, as many other classic B&W movies are, but boy was I in for a surprise. 'Kind Hearts and Coronets', a dark comedy of revenge and murder, is one of the better movies I've seen in recent months, regardless of age or genre. All the actors create memorable characters, but it is Guinness, playing all eight characters of the doomed D'Ascoyne family, from a naive 24-year-old to a minister in his 80s, plus one woman, that gives the most memorable performance. That alone would make this movie worth watching, but it is much more. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet should give it a try, a true classic comedy.The rest of my comments contain some SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, please read no further, under penalty of possible disillusionment.The movie starts with Luis Mazzini in his prison cell, preparing to be executed the next morning at 8AM, and beginning to write his memoirs, in case anyone would want to read then. The movie is then told as a flashback. One potential D'Ascoyne heir to the Dukeship, a woman, married an Italian tenor who died young but left a son, Luis Mazzini, potential heir if everyone between him and the current Duke were to die. Angered when his mum died and her remains were denied burial in the D'Ascoyne family cemetary, he became obsessed with revenge. he had a plan, and a family tree pasted to the rear of a picture hanging on his bedroom wall.  As heirs died, he would gleefully cross them off. Not to leave too much to chance, he decided that killing them off would be appropriate. Alec Guinness played each of the seven heirs to be eliminated, plus the Duke, each uniquely. The first came when the man and his sweetie were on a boat, tied, in a canal, Luis untied the boat right at 2PM, when the overflow would suck them over a dam to their death. The next, he bought photographic equipment to attract the photo buff, gained his confidence, substituted petrol for paraffin, and had tea with the wife as her husband burned to death in his darkroom. He had just killed his bosses son, then got a raise and new position, and also decided to court the deceased son's widow, the pretty and sophisticated Edith. Meanwhile, his first love had married someone who she later confided was the most boring man in all of Europe, so began sneaking to Luis's apartment for discrete affairs.The next D'Ascoyne to go down was the old minister, slipping poison into his sherry. Then, an arrow to the hot air ballon of Lady D'Ascoyne did her in. An Admiral went down with his ship, saving Luis the trouble of rubbing him out. To a General, he sent a bomb in the caviar. Then Luis' boss, a D'Ascoyne also, made Luis partner, then died shortly after, eliminating the need for another murder. Now only the Duke remained. In a visit there, he led the Duke into a 'man trap', then shot his with his own gun before running for help, claiming that an intruder run off earlier had returned.\nSo, with everyone else gone, Luis Mazzini became rightful heir, had his coronation as Duke at the elegant castle, the widow Edith had finally accepted his proposal, and surely the spurned lover, Sibella, would cause trouble. Especially after her own husband Lionel, bankrupt, turned up dead after Luis, also his banker, refused to extend another loan. An uninvited guest at his coronation was from Scotland Yard, Luis was arrested for Lionel's murder. At trial, he was to his surprise found guilty, partly because Sibella testified that there was no suicide note. The spurned lover now had her revenge, and Luis who got away with six murders, now was destined to be executed for one that he did not commit. Lionel really did kill himself with the large knife to the chest.Sibella visited Luis the night before his scheduled execution. They spoke in 'code', about a possible miracle, maybe a suicide note would show up, maybe somehow Edith would die and Luis could then be reunited properly with Sibella. The next morning, as Luis is being led out of his cell, having written his complete memoirs overnight, explaining everything we see during the movie, a guard shows up hurrying to say, 'Wait, a suicide note was found, the execution is put on hold.' Shortly we see Luis exit the prison, a heavy metal gate closing behind him, a small crowd is cheering his release, and two carriages wait, to the right, his wife Edith, and to the left, his former lover Sibella. As his mind is working frantically to come up with the best solution, a reporter approaches him, 'Duke Mazzini, the newspaper wants to know if you will write your memoires?' Luis' expression changes, the view switches to the table in his recently vacated cell, his completed tell-all memoirs on the table, and he cannot get to them. All he can speak is, 'My memoirs!'

            "review_title": "Masterful British film of a dark, sophisticated comedy with crime and subtle satire",
            "content": "\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a dark and sophisticated comedy and crime film that is packed with subtle satire. It is based on a 1907 book by English novelist and playwright Roy Horniman (1874-1930). The novel was \"Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal.\" This is a masterful production with an outstanding cast of principal players - Alec Guinness, Dennis Price, Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson.The title for the film comes from a line in an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, \"Lady Clara Vere de Vere.\" Hobson's Edith introduces it when she says to Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, \"Was Lord Tennyson far from the mark when he wrote, 'Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood?'\" Translated, that means it's better to be a good person than to have stature and wealth.The film has a clever way of playing the story out. Guinness and/or Price narrate the background from the memoirs that Louis has just finished writing while in prison, and this goes from one flashback to another. With such a cunning way of storytelling - and the known plot of Louis setting out to knock off his relatives, it's quite easy to miss the subtlety of the satire. One imagines Louis to be a cold and calculating criminal, who is out to revenge the D'Ascoyne's terrible treatment of his mother. Yet, one can see a love for his mother, and his charm not only seems disarming, but appears genuine in dealing with most others - i.e., common folks. Having worked and scraped in the trades and common society, he doesn't look down on real people or the tenants of the dukedom he inherits. So, this person who would acquire a title and position by crime would turn out to be a much better person toward most of society than are those whom he would knock off. Could there be such a thing as a soft-hearted psychopath? Maybe justice will work out for all in the end.This film is considered by many to be Alex Guinness's tour de force in cinema. It was early in his film career, and the great Guinness would go on to make many more outstanding films. While he made a name for himself in England and then the U.S. for his sophisticated comedy, he excelled as well in some later dramatic roles. That includes his Oscar-winning performance in one of the greatest war movies ever made, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" of 1957. He was somewhat reintroduced to younger generations who may remember him most as Obi-Wan Kenobi from the \"Star Wars\" trilogy.Guinness's eight roles in this film are a masterful achievement; and for many years, he stood as the unquestioned king of the hill for multiple roles in a single movie. Over the years, various actors have tried films in which they played multiple roles. But the only really successful one after Guinness has been Peter Sellers in two huge film successes. He played three roles each in \"The Mouse that Roared\" of 1959 and \"Dr. Strangelove\" of 1964. While some actors have sought films with multiple roles in the 21st century, there hasn't been a major film made with a single player having more than eight roles. A 2012 film, \"Cloud Atlas,\" had two dozen actors playing multiple roles - some playing half a dozen roles including stars Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.While Guinness gets the accolades for his multiple roles here, Dennis Price turns in an excellent role as Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini. Price had several good films early in his career, but after a couple of flops, he began boozing. He appeared in many films and on TV, including some smash British comedies. But he never got lead roles and with his drinking his last years were spent in horror flicks and other lesser films. He was just 58 when he died after suffering a hip fracture. Various sources report his death due to heart failure or cirrhosis of the liver.The two female leads are very good - Valerie Hobson as Edith and Joan greenwood as Sibella. Greenwood was just 66 when she died of a heart attack. Hobson lived to be 81, but she quite films just five years after this one - at age 37, and married British politician John Profumo in 1954. The trivia section under Hobson's biography on IMDB has some interesting details about the sex scandal that Profumo was part of in 1963.Here are some favorite lines from this film. For more witty dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the film.Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"Even my lamented master, the great Mr. Barry himself, never had the privilege of hanging a duke.\"Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"Yes, I intend to retire. After using this silken rope - never again be content with hemp.\"Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"The last execution of a duke in this country was badly bungled. But that was in the old days of the ax, of course.\"Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, \"No, I forgot. You're pledged to Lionel. I behaved like a cad that night.\" Sibella, \"I liked you when you behaved like a cad.\"Edith D'Ascoyne, \"But I have often felt that the attitude of my husband's family has failed to move with the times. That they think too much of the rights of the nobility and too little of its duties. The very honesty of your behavior would appear to me to prove them wrong.\"Louis, \"The D'Ascoynes certainly appear to have accorded with the tradition of the landed gentry, and sent the fool of the family into the church. \"Sibella, \"Louis, I think I've married the most boring man in London.\" Louis, \"In England.\" Sibella, \"In Europe.\"Sibella, after kissing Louis and backing away, \"What am I doing?\" Louis, \"You know very well. You're playing with fire.\"",

The brilliant Alec Guinness, who has given so many great performances outside of Star Wars, superbly plays 8 roles and dies 8 times. It's not like modern comedies at all, but Kind Hearts and Coronets doesn't feel dated. It's not your typical laugh out loud comedy. It's conveyed in a very dry, detached way, but it's very funny in an incredibly dark way. Admittedly, there are times when you don't know whether you're meant to laugh or not but it still has loads of genuinely funny moments. This is a film which actually manages to make murder funny, but what's most impressive about it, aside from the great performances, is the social commentary. The main character is pretty despicable, yet he is sympathetic and the moment where he confronts the last victim and explains his motives is actually very moving as well as blackly comic. This is an excellent mix of drama and humour, and it is easily one of the darkest comedies ever made. The fact that it manages to make such dark material so entertaining and do so in such a clever way solidifies the film's position as one of the definitive Ealing comedies.9/10",

Now that there are attempts at reviving the Ealing studios again, one hopes that at least some of the magic seen in this film will be recaptured.Alec Guinness' performance is a tour de force. There are many touted as being great actors today, but very few of them can pull of playing eight different types of people in the same film. Entirely convincing as an old woman, a dyspeptic lord, a pleasant young man. Guinness was indeed a master. He had the knack of becoming the part he was playing, so that one forgot that one was watching Alec Guinness.The plot is fairly straightforward and moves at the right pace, with never a boring moment. The camera work is similarly exact, with the gloom of London houses and the emptiness of old manors coming through quite well. Most of the film is shot indoors, and it is remarkable that the scenes are as one would imagine them to be. A classic!",

            "content": "Instead of the usual warm comedy, contemporary setting and familiar cast of lower-middle class worthies, 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' is set in the 1860s and shot through with pitch black humor and biting satire on both the moribund upper class and the grasping venality of the suburban middle class.A waspishly poised Dennis Price plays Louis Mazzini whose mother was cast out from the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family for marrying an Italian opera singer. After her death and a series of provocations from his estranged relatives - mainly their refusal to let her be buried at Chalfont in the D'Ascoyne family crypt, Louis embarks on a plan to murder his way into his inheritance, knocking off eight D'Ascoyne heirs (all played with great relish by Alec Guinness) one by one, in a series of wonderfully absurd set pieces - even polishing off one of his kinsmen, a windy general, by putting dynamite in his caviar. Louis only finds his match in his childhood sweetheart from the suburbs, the vulgar and scheming Sibella. Matters get complicated when he falls in love with Hobson, the widow of one of his victims. But after Price ascends to the dukedom and marries Hobson, fate catches up and something startling ensues.In this delicious little satire on Edwardian manners and morals, the sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film. He scores an eightfold tour de force as every member \u2013 young, old, male, female \u2013 of the D'Ascoyne clan, adding an additional masterstroke to the ruthlessly pitched satire about British imperialism backfiring on itself. He's aptly matched by Dennis Price as the Byronic anti-hero, who coolly undertakes a monstrous scheme of killing off all his kinfolk in order to succeed to the family coronet.But don't let this obvious admiration for the leads obscure the fact that the picture itself is a sparkling, devilishly cutting jest. Robert Hamer's poised direction chimes perfectly with his Edwardian setting. He directs the script as a story being narrated as the recollections of a candid scoundrel - the Wildean wit of Price's voice-over an unfailing delight - and the whole development of the scoundrel's calculated career - in this case, of civilized murder - is described in the finest spirit of Gallic wit. Such a story of unmitigated contempt for the fundamental laws or society could only be tolerable when played as a spoof - a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor and device.The result, Kind Hearts and Coronets, is one of those films that can be seen repeatedly and still offer surprises. As a combination of rollicking black humor and satirical pokes at the English upper crust, nothing else comes close.",

As a young man, Sibella refuses his proposal of marriage to such a poor man. Then he is fired from his lowly job as a draper's assistant after an altercation with Ascoyne D'Ascoyne. He decides to take the title of the Duke of D'Ascoyne by killing all other heirs in front of him.The movie is best known for Alec Guinness who plays all the D'Ascoyne heirs, 8 characters in total. One of my pet peeves has always been overly long unnecessary narration. The problem here is the long low energy narration that acts as Louis' inner voice. It takes away all the tension.

The comedy is all the blacker because each ghastly crime is quaintly executed with a self-mocking delicacy.The performances are exquisite - Joan Greenwood's darkly seductive Sibella makes audiences fully understand why the hero is led astray. The dialogue both aspires to poetry and is the very definition of wit. As with the plays of Wilde and Shaw, the comedy does not date. The film's structure is as Byzantine and elegant as the murders themselves.The integrity of the drama almost causes us to miss the tour-de-force eight role performance of Alec Guiness forging a gem-like collection of bitter-sweet satires on the English character.Historically, the film is one of the series of quality comedies emerging from the British Ealing Studios. However, in true character it is unlike all the others, possessing the one-off quality of genius. It appears to juggles irreconcilable contradictions. It is a comedy with an outrageous plot; yet the drama is compelling and credible. It is a stagey production, based on mannered dialogue; yet it is a genuine classic of pure cinematic.This film is one of the few I can watch again and again - in the way I can listen repeatedly to musical perfection.

            "content": "\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a truly remarkable dark comedy that not only boasts a legendary eight part performance by Sir Alec Guinness, but explores a plot that we idealistic Westerners would never dare touch. This film dares to address a widely ignored fact: that adversity does not always make us stronger, better people, but can make us petty, vindictive, bitter, and completely devoid of basic morals.Our film's antihero is verbose, narcissistic Louis Manzzini (Dennis Price), who is awaiting his own execution for the murders of eight members of the d'Ascoyne family. That's the \"what\" of the story\u0085 the \"who\" and \"why\" are revealed as the Manzzini, ever the egotist, jots down his memoirs in his jail cell. Manzzini's mother, it is revealed, was once part of the d'Ascoyne family but was disowned for marrying beneath her class (to a tenor, no less!). As a result, she is forced to raise Louis in poverty and never lets him forget her misfortune. Louis's frustrations in life come to a head when his mother dies and his true love Sibella, a smarmy gold digger, dumps him for a dull but wealthy beau. When Louis discovers he's technically ninth in line for the title of Duke d'Ascoyne, he schemes to kill off each successor one by one until he gets what's rightfully his (his job is made a little easier when one dies from illness). That's where Sir Alec Guinness comes in. In a chameleon-like performance that puts Peter Sellers's in \"Dr. Strangelove\" to shame, he plays all eight of Louis's victims, including a fisherman, a photographer, and even a feminist (in which he bears a startling resemblance to Susan B. Anthony). When Louis murders the photographer (by planting explosives in his darkroom), he perversely woos his widow, the lovely and morally upright Edith (Valerie Hobson). Louis is so cool and calculating that it comes as no surprise when he gets what he wants. What he doesn't count on, though, is an unpleasant hindrance known as karma\u0085 What a deliciously dark comedy this is! Price really walks a fine line with Louis. You hate him for being such loathsome, shortsighted, murderous mama's boy. One even hates Louis's mother for instilling his appalling sense of entitlement with her self indulgent, woe-is-me attitude toward their situation. At the same time you have to admire his witticisms and his carefully plotted murders. They range from simplistic (trapping an avid hunter in a bear trap and shooting him) to hilarious (one is riding a hot air balloon and Louis nonchalantly shoots an arrow at it, causing it to plummet). There's also no contrivance where Louis sees the light or is transformed by the love of a good woman. You don't buy his romance with Edith for a second: you know she's both the rebound girl for Sibella and a trophy for his killing. I won't give away too much, but Louis does get exactly what he deserves, just not in the way you'd expect.One of the greatest films of all time, this is the twisted tale of how revenge isn't just a dish best served cold, as Louis points out, but sprinkled with arsenic.",

There are many wonderful comic moments: Mazzini's first encounter with a member of the D'Ascoyne family at a haberdashery/clothes shop, resulting in his dismissal - which works as the straw that broke Mazzini's patience, is something to savour.All murders happen in highly darkly comic manner, but those of the photographer, of Lady D'Ascoyne, of the Church of England priest who is baffled by Price's African tribe lingo, and of the admiral who sinks with his ship are absolutely unforgettable.Kind hearts. The man in the white suit, dead of night. Lavender hill mob and the lady killers are all superb examples of the Ealing Studios at their best - but KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is in a class of its own in terms of style, sophistication, cruel wit and sting in the tail ending.I pity the minds of those who dump this baby with 5 stars and less. They should not watch anything except Stallone, Norris, Statham, Neeson, Schwarzenegger and other action clones explode, shoot, and kick everyone to bits.

Except the hero walks away from the book which now will factor in the story that follows what we see, and we know it will be his undoing. There is nothing along the way other than this. It still is the case that the financiers of a movie will base the whole thing on a few gimmicks like this and assume that with moderate quality elsewhere it will pass. Comedy is particularly prone to this problem.The reason such a thing happens is not because how films are financed. I thought it would be thus, because financiers need a few phrases on which to bet the farm. But I discovered that the studios at least had people with pretty deep awareness of the whole composition and why it might work.No, I discovered, these gimmicks come from the shorthand used to coordinate all the players and the artistic team.

Kind Hearts and Coronets is chocked full of hilarious satire and wit.  It moves along nicely, is extremely well acted, and has a great script.  Little moments such as the introduction of the suffragette D'Ascoyne, Mezzini's reaction to the news of Lionel asking for a divorce, and countless others may not evoke any belly laughs, but they are priceless.  The social satire is so stinging, that I often did laugh out loud a second or two after the subtle jokes.  And, of course, Alec Guinness is amazing.  At times I forgot it was Alec Guinness. His eight characters are each distinct and hilarious in themselves.  This is one of my favorite movies ever.",

Movies like \"Fight Club\" and \"Ocean's Eleven\" are popular because they depict clever, marginalized heroes who take on \"the man.\"  But I'm not on board with this subversive formula unless the rebel is a very sympathetic protagonist; there's nothing worse than a movie that glorifies a criminal's behavior for no particular reason.Thankfully, \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" features the most complex and compelling anti-hero I've ever seen - Louis Mazzini, a rebel with a cause. He sets out to avenge his mother's death by murdering every member of the noble family that wronged her.  He's a wholly evil b**tard but I root for him anyway, because he's fighting snobbery and privilege, and because he's so smart that it's impossible not to admire him.It's amazing to see a movie this old pushing so many envelopes.  There's innuendo aplenty in the scenes involving Louis and his lover Sibella, and some very \"modern\" black comedy related to the murders.  There's a certain \"nudge-nudge, wink-wink\" quality to the humor that could be too coy for some viewers, but I find it hilarious.I'd be curious to see a remake, believe it or not, maybe involving an American taking on a powerful family like the Bushes...the issues involved are universal enough that such an update could work beautifully.",

This is a very good movie.It is about a man who grows up knowing that his family disowned his mother because of who she married... but when she passes away, he wants to get revenge on them all for the way the treated her... so he kills them all one by one.The film stars Dennis Price as Louis. Dennis does a fantastic job... he is such a smooth character and even though he is on death row, stays calm through the movie and just writes him memoir. The film also stars Valerie Hobson & Joan Greenwood. These actresses were also very good. Joan played such a horrible woman in this film. At first you start to like her, but then her true colours come out. But the star of the movie has to be Alec Guinness. Alec plays 8 characters in this film. and he does them all brilliantly. He plays young men, old men and even a woman... but he is convincing in all the roles he takes on. The more I see of Alec, the more I think he was a great actor and not just Ben Kenobi in Star Wars.The film was made in 1949, so as you can imagine, the effects were not great, but for the time I can imagine they were very good. You can clearly see that the grave yard scene was just a huge picture background. Also, you can see that the boat scene are model boats. But it does not ruin the movie... if anything it makes the movie better because it shows it's age.The other thing I like about this film is it is the perfect length... i hour 40 minutes. And it felt so quick too. The film played with such a good story that the time flew by. I was hooked to it and was interested by the characters and story.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Another classic Alec Guinness movie...

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Coronets is one of the very finest of the Ealing Comedies, and also one of the darkest. Loosely based on Roy Horniman's novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal, it is the blackest of black comedies, following as it does a protagonist who murders the members of his upper class family one by one in order to inherit a Dukedom.\nDirector Robert Hamer co-wrote the screenplay with John Dighton and whilst the result is not the funniest Ealing Comedy, it is the most wickedly amusing and arguably the cleverest. It's a social satire swathed in irony and dripping with bone dry humour, right from the opening scene in which hangman Miles Malleson gleefully looking forward to ending his career with the hanging of a peer of the realm, Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, for murder. The film's framing sequence sees Louis writing - and narrating - his memoirs and detailing exactly how he set about planning to murder his D'Ascoyne family relatives and how he brought about each death.\nIt is, remarkably, a comedy in which we are invited to sympathise with a serial killer. The characterisation of the manipulative Louis as a charismatic psychopath who constantly justifies his actions is a remarkably believable piece of writing. For all that he claims to be motivated by revenge for the treatment of his mother by their snobby relatives this is a film about class warfare, social status and avarice. The D'Ascoyne's are not portrayed as innocent victims, but as pompous buffoons, oblivious to everything but their own blinkered interests. Whilst the script stops short of saying that they deserve to die, it depicts them as outdated, pointless and shallow. The irony of course is that in killing them off, Louis becomes them, his social status increasing with each murder as he rises near to the Dukedom. The film's crowning irony comes when we learn that Louis is awaiting execution not for murdering his relatives, but for a murder that he didn't commit. Equally ironically, Louis habit of manipulating women for his own game is reversed when he is out-manipulated by the equally scheming Sibella, who having put the rope around his neck blackmails him with the means to remove it.\nDennis Price gives an underrated performance as the Louis, proving alarmingly believable as the killer whom nobody suspects because he's so well mannered and charming. He is only underrated because the entire film is stolen by Alec Guinness, who famously plays nine members of the D'Ascoyne family and makes each one convincingly different: it's one of cinema's greatest comic performances, and a great showcase for Guinness' legendary acting talents. But the whole cast impresses, from John Penrose, who gives a convincing drunken performance as Lionel, to Joan Greenwood as femme fatale Sibella.\nHamer's directing - appropriately enough - is almost reminiscent of film noir in the opening scenes, and he does an impressive job as director, creating a film that remains handsome and elegantly executed. Douglas Slocombe's cinematography certainly helps. There is a particularly accomplished scene in the church when six versions of Guinness appear on screen together. The Kentish location filming - including Leeds castle - is perfectly chosen and meshes seamlessly with the sets, and there are masterly touches throughout, such as the fact that Louis' changing costumes as the film progresses reflect his changing social status.\nKind Hearts and Coronets does not provide belly laughs, but it will amuse and amaze with its audacity, its penetrating social satire, and its gleeful willingness to try and make the audience root for an unapologetic murderer. The British Film Institute included it within the top ten of its list of the one hundred greatest British films of the twentieth century: it is quite easy to understand why.",

The location of the memoirs, ideally ripe for Tit-Bits magazine, and ready for rescuing, mean the viewer is left hanging in agonised and permanent suspense.

It seemed neither right for a Victorian drapery or underwear assistant, nor a Duke. But that is merely the merest quibble.

Even trashy movies from the world over know that they're movies and play by the rules dictacted to the genre. \"Kind Hearts & Coronets\" is something else. Back in '49, Ealing made something that stands up to today's criteria - why, it really could be made by one of the Andersons (Was or Paul Thomas) or the Coens. It starts with flashbacks within flashbacks and moves on, or backwards, telling a story that is pure cinema with a deadpan narration in the very modern style. Price is brilliant as the central, amoral angel of death, Guinness good in parts - his vicar is equal to the best of anti-establishment genius Peter Cook's judges (or once again vicar in 'The Princess Bride'), and Joan Greenwood breathtaking as the heartless, calculating middle-class gal with aspirations - and yes, she and Price *really* do deserve each other.It's a pleasure throughout and surely a high water mark in British cinema - because for a change it *is* cinema.

Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price, who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship. Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives, he doesn't get much time as any of them, and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting.

There was only one thing to do: put it on.He was entranced and it made me a little jealous that I will never see the film for the first time again, to be overwhelmed by its script, the acting and the subtleties.For its time it was very close to the mark sexually. The 'fate worse than death' comment when concern was expressed over what we would now call collateral damage, and the 'I know' when it was remarked how lucky the man marrying his mistress was, were very risqu\u00e9 for the time. The eight murders were not thought to be a reason for criticism.As with so many Ealing comedies there was an undercurrent of political comment, mainly against the ruling elite. The title itself, a compression of 'kind hearts more than Norman blood', is a little dig at the class system. Many people in the lords claimed superiority for being descended from the 11thC invaders who enslaved the population of England.The series of murders is delightfully naughty even now. Everyone empathises with Dennis Price's put down persona (he plays two parts but this is normally ignored and not credited) despite him becoming a serial killer but Guinness's characters are almost universally pompous and perhaps deserving of their fates.There are little twists all the way through, the main one being the fact that he is put on trial because of a lie from his mistress about a murder he did not commit. How could he argue about it? He is also tried by his peers \u2013 again a nice little point as the only way he earned such distinction was by multiple murders.Some of the scenes are perfectly formed. Price's little shake of the teacup when the shed explodes, killing the husband of the woman sitting opposite him, is deliciously understated.I know I'm going against the flow here but I can't help thinking that the film's weakest bit is the multiple roles taken by Guinness. It was rather pointless and the suspicion is that it was done for reasons of cost. Ealing never spent more than was absolutely necessary and often nowhere near what was required. Perhaps two or three might have been funny.The film is a delight. My son-in-law asked to borrow the DVD and I gave it to him, my wife working out that the reason I did so was to give me a reason to buy the enhanced digitally remastered version.I was very happy that my son-in-law watched the film and enjoyed it. I would have resented it if he'd been too slow to appreciate such a masterpiece.I have ranked this as 10 stars, an almost impossible rating I agree. However, it is my favourite comedy. The script is classic, faultless: the story clever and subtle: the on-liners hilarious: the acting (I haven't mentioned the delicious Valerie Hobson who took her part to perfection \u2013 now I have) spot on: the political comment nicely barbed and easily ignored should the mood take: and it is all so delightfully silly.If this film isn't worth 10 stars then no film is.This is no Hollywood blockbuster. It is, however, the perfect black comedy.",

Another problem with the film is that even when we get to the heart of the picture everything happens so quickly (D'ascoyne's are murdered in quick succession without much planning taking place by Louis; some of the murders are not even shown which robs the film of some of its grit). There are subplots involving Louis' involvement with 2 married women which, whilst pivotal to the story, do not feel entirely necessary.Presumably intended as a black comedy, I have to admit that I did not find much of Kind Hearts and Coronets to be all that funny and nor did I find it to be particularly dramatic either. When watching it, I found myself to be semi-involved in proceedings, but didn't really feel any kind of deep love for the picture. The majority of the characters are shallow and unlikeable (presumably on purpose, but this doesn't always make for a pleasant viewing experience) and personally I found the film to be a little too understated lacking in both pzazz and excitement. I found it to be watchable and moderately enjoyable, but nothing more than that.Still to end on a positive note; I did enjoy seeing Alec Guinness in multiple roles and his multiple turns here were excellent (Kind Hearts and Coronets may well be the first film to showcase an actor playing multiple roles - although I could be wrong there). I did also like the way that the film pokes fun at the 'class system' highlighting some of the ridiculous and narrow-minded attitudes of the upper crust.For me though to truly be able to enjoy a film of this nature it needs to be exciting, funny, dramatic and/or have at the very least 1 or 2 decent characters. Kind Hearts and Coronets is made up of bits and pieces of all of these things, but not enough of any one element for me to see it as anything other than a fairly average offering.",

And the gimmick of multiple roles with Alec Guinness. It should have worked; I think Guinness could have done wonders with his eight parts. But no, his segments are so thinly written that all eight roles are imminently forgettable. I mean, the very funny picture of Guinness in a dress for the one female role he plays is completely squandered. Not only does Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne get a mere one minute on screen, she doesn't even get a single line! If it weren't enough that Alec Guinness is wasted eight times over, the wonderful Valerie Hobson is equally wasted. The sole performer who pulls off their role is Joan Greenwood, and even she's not great. I seriously cannot see how people find this movie worthwhile. 5/10.",

Set during the nineteenth century (i.e., the 1860s), it is one of the best acted, written and filmed comedies about murder and class relations ever made. This quintessentially British film is an exquisite pleasure, and make sure you watch it on the big screen.A poor but ambitious cousin of a family of royals takes on the project of removing all the obstacles preventing him from becoming the Duke. He is sentenced to hang only after being convicted of a murder he did not commit. While not (for me) laugh-out-loud funny, there is a great deal of dry wit on hand. Each cast member is superb. Joan Greenwood embellishes the vamp Sibella with her much-envied voice, which has been often compared to a cat's purring. Valerie Hobson (Edith), adds beauty, grace and poise. (I've become a real fan of hers, having also seen her as the Countess in \"The Card\", three weeks ago.) Miles Malleson, as the agreeable and respectful hangman, has his own cult following. However, the two male leads are amazing. Alec Guinness\ufeff famously plays the entire royal D'Ascoyne family comprised of eight (!) members. While each is doomed, Guinness portrays them all differently. Even though some of the D'Ascoynes have few lines and limited screen time, this is still an astonishing feat. Guinness (then 35 and largely unknown to the public) finds so many details with each character representing a wide spectrum of ages (i.e., 35-80) and both genders (Lady Agatha is the sole female) that thespians everywhere should be inspired. It has been said of Guinness that every role he has ever played is different than any other, and here he puts on an acting master class.In most movies, this would be enough. However, Dennis Price\ufeff as Louis, the smooth-talking, serial killer with aristocratic ambition is another character not soon forgotten. In his career performance, Price inhabits the role of Louis and is just as interesting as Guinness throughout. Price also portrays Louis's opera-singing father. I assume that Price is actually the tenor singing early. This fragment sounds great to my ears. The title is inspired by a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\ufeff. The screenplay is (by Robert Hamer and John Dighton) and is loosely-based on Roy Horniman's novel. The dialogue is very precise. The story has some unusual plot turns. I like how each murder is off-screen and accomplished in a different way. Visually, Hamer's direction is excellent. He uses the entire frame; and it is always interesting to see the background details.

            "content": "I like this movie. It is mildly amusing. It would be hard to hate it... but given the outrageous premise, it should be hysterical. The decision to use narration to advance the plot supplies a few laughs, but generally drains the movie of its energy and forward momentum. This is not a failure on my part to understand dry humor; I adore and live by it, offline. For the first hour the tone is rather unfunny (It explains too much plot via narration) and some of Price's victims are rather nice people. Although I can imagine it plays differently in a movie house, for home viewing it's more of a curio. This is more like a slightly funny Romantic novel filmed (Imagine Great Expectations with more humor) rather than a rollicking black comedy. Dennis Price made me mindful of how few young, attractive British actors make it into their films. There seems to be some sort of system to insure that only average looking, doughy, phlegmatic men over 40 ascend.Guinness is funny even without too many lines. I wish the plot had encompassed the daily news' reaction to so many deaths in a single lineage. Surely, the trend would be noticed. This is my 3rd Joan Greenwood movie. I find her to be a rather annoying actress. For my money The Ruling Class is much, much funnier.",

The story was very well constructed and came to a fully satisfying ending.In addition it was interesting to delve into a snippet of English film-making of a by gone age. It seems almost worlds apart to what we are used to in modern movies. Without wanting to sound old fashioned, here was a film that did'nt use extreme violence, swearing etc etc to appeal to the audience it just had a simple and well constructed story, great character acting and a fine pace to it.I think it is a treasure of a film, highly watchable and entertaining to all types of audiences if they are willing to give it a go.",

            "content": "The first thing that struck me about this movie - which was one of several Ealing Comedies that are currently being given away with a National newspaper - was its similarity to Sascha Guitry's Le Roman d'un tricheur; Guitry is writing his memoirs at a cafe table rather than a prison cell and one of the earliest is how he unwittingly wiped out his entire family, who ate poisoned mushrooms en masse after banishing him from the dining table as a punishment for some minor sin. Louis Mazzini (Denis Price) on the other hand sets out to eliminate the members of a family that stand between him and a title with the cold-blooded calculation of Richard, Duke of York - another work from which it borrows. On the whole it stands up reasonably well, much better than another recent giveaway, Brighton Rock, which has aged badly. It is replete with typically 'English' touches such as Miles Malleson's hangman enquiring in all seriousness of the prison governor (Clive Morton) how he (the hangman) should address the titled victim when they meet formally just prior to the execution and then, having been told 'Your Grace', walking away repeating this to himself complete with the pertinent obsequious gestures. Denis Price captures the right note, a blend of impeccable manners and ruthless cunning but most of the parts played by Alec Guiness lack diversity with nothing, for example, coming even close the complete unrecognisable quality he brought to Fagin within a year of shooting this one. On balance a very passable effort but one that may not stand up to repeated viewings.",

In this dark comedy (that's far more ironic than it is actually funny), a lowly Englishman believes he can work his way up to nobility by killing his relatives. Unfortunately for Dennis Price, no one remembers he was in the movie. Alec Guinness is the favored actor in this one, and for good reason: he plays eight different parts! Old, young, male, female, different hair, posture, accents, Alec plays each of the relatives Dennis comes across in his quest for wealth and title.This isn't the type of movie that will have you laughing out loud, but will instead have you smiling at Dennis's cunningness. He also juggles the affections of the proper Valerie Hobson and the equally conniving Joan Greenwood. Remember that song in the musical \"I've Decided to Marry You\" as he discusses his feelings for Phoebe and Sibella while hiding their whereabouts in his apartment from each other? That's not exactly how it plays out in the original movie, but it's still amusing how they all fit together.

He also plays the seventh duke in brief flashback sequences to Mama's youth. I do not want all the credit rewrite to him. Performance is unusual. Some roles are short, but they are quite impressive.The dialogues are perfect, in every moment you expect a gruesome joke. Impoverished and humiliated young man kills all your relatives (almost all), so that inherited wealth and the ducal title. There is a reason. However, the killings are so clumsy and humorous, and therefore the reason it sounds frivolous. This film for general wonder lack inspiration. I'll explain. I do not think anything bad. This movie can serve as an inspiration with with anything. After the film, remains a void in which extinguishes a slight smile. The narrative is a constant, monotonous and reminiscent of the confession.It is interesting how everything works with elegantly and flawlessly. Often you can fall into the trap and think that all of this is true.Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini is a young man, who made a entertains scheme of his own kills. Dennis Price in this role seems quite skillfully. His play with women is much more interesting. After all, can continue indefinitely.The story can be seen as a kind of contempt for the society in which they are pranks, lies and kills some kind of justification.

This creeping sense of uneasiness worsened during the scene where the main character meets the parson, a kindly but doddering old man surely not deserving of Mazzini's hatred. I suppose this concept might have its modern-day equivalent in films like Saw, but even then the victims somehow deserve their bloody fates.

As witty as it is cynical, the film still packs a strong punch and has aged like fine wine.Co-written & directed by Robert Hamer, the story concerns a distant poor relative of a Duke who plots to inherit the title by chopping down the entire family tree. And though the brief overview of his early days doesn't garner much interest, things pick up real quick once he puts his ambitious plan into motion. And through his (mis)deeds, Hamer also explores themes of class, repression & retribution.The film is at its most enjoyable & entertaining when it captures our protagonist carrying out his killings and the lighthearted vibe & intended absurdity only makes those scenes riotously fun to watch. Dennis Price plays the lead role with nonchalant charm but the one who impresses most is Alec Guinness, rendering nine different characters including all heirs in line of succession who get removed from the equation.Overall, Kind Hearts & Coronets is a pitch-black comedy about morals, manners & murders that doubles as a biting commentary on class struggles & relationships and makes brilliant use of its twists to deliver an enjoyable ride. Often ranked amongst the best British comedies of the 1940s, this sardonic & subversive genre delight can still surprise the newcomers with its serrated edges and ends with an ambiguous, ironic & fitting finale.",

His Memoirs, his Karma.. right now I am trying to remember which crime film from old Hollywood has the best and twisty climax ever, I had several names in my mind but I don't remember any film hitting the next level with the smallest period possible in the climax. Kind Hearts and Coronets just did it in those last 10 seconds. Wowww... I was kind of satisfied with the film for 105 and half mins and i thought it would end on predictable note as all crime films end but no, i was wrong. It had a brilliant humourous turn around in the climax which totally blown me. My Memoirs.. Holy Karma.. It's a story of a distant poor relative of the Duke of D'Ascoyne plots to inherit the title by murdering the eight other heirs who stand ahead of him in the line of succession. He successfully murders all of them and i was like this guy deserves to be hanged, please god make it happen. It happens but for the crime he did not attend. He gets away from it too and i was happy to see it although i had the first punishment thought still alive and then his own little Mistake which we all missed strikes. Don't ask what and why, just watch this film to know. I haven't seen a great mixture of black comedy from 40s with such variable twists even though the rest of the plot was predictable and decent at best. Dennis Price was very good and appropriate in his role. I loved his accent and attitude. He narrated the whole story with convincing voice expression. Dialogue were Royal and grammatically high. Screenplay is engaging because of comedy, evil stuff told in no sorry mood and crunchy narration. Director Robert Hamer did exceptionally well despite inconvenient storyline. Overall, a Great Humourous Black Comedy that cannot be missed.RATING - 7/10*",

There are very good films that time does not forgive and that are left behind as others go out and take their place. In this case, I think the time was unfair. The film is not brilliant, but it has merits and justifies a recap in a cycle of classics, at home or even in a theater, why not?The screenplay is based on a novel by Roy Horniman (probably as forgotten as this film) and follows the account that a condemned man makes of his life: born of his mother's (the daughter of a British duke) morganatic marriage, Louis was voted to oblivion for his entire family in a way that, to us, seems shocking, but it was in fact the thought in vogue in the aristocratic classes until fifty or sixty years ago. He even had no chance to bury his mother in the family tomb. To get his revenge, Louis begins to kill his relatives, but he does not do it randomly: he does so in order to obtain for himself the title and the control of the associated assets and estate.Directed and written by Robert Hamer, it is a classic of British cinema where the \"murder\" theme, so dear to British fiction, is naturally present, albeit in an inverted way: the public follows the killer's steps and knows what he does, but wait and see how he gets caught. In fact, the way he exposes his motivations is so captivating that it is difficult not to support him in his attitudes, even if they are despicable. It's not an incredible film, but it has the merit of entertainment.The cast is quite good: Dennis Price is an excellent protagonist, with a posture quite adequate to what is expected of an aristocrat and impeccable work. Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood make a magnificent counterpoint to each other, with antagonistic characters that are everything that the other is not, but build an interesting romantic sub-plot around the main character. But it is Alec Guinness that deserves to take the palm of glory in this film: the actor, still far from stardom, is a true chameleon that assumes several characters, men and women, throughout the film, and that appears and disappears with the greatest of naturalness, and the greatest resourcefulness. It is not a task for any actor!Technically, it's a discreet film, which has nothing special. The opening credits are quite well done from a graphical point of view, and the sets and costumes are very good, but they do not surprise us strictly. The soundtrack takes advantage of famous classical music themes.",

A British film, it combines class-consciousness and Victorian societal wit and manners with the peculiarly British taste for murder in a comedic context. The first 15 minutes are frankly boring, setting up the scenario for all that comes later. A distant poor relative of the Duke of D'Ascoyne plots to inherit the title by murdering the eight other heirs who stand ahead of him in the line of succession. The British flare for satire and irony is never better displayed. Alec Guiness plays the part of eight members of an aristocratic family, each one a different character, and pulls it off. The protagonist, Dennis Price, by turns charming, calculating, ironic, plays the poor relation, determined to get to the top.

The victims are only caricatures, and Louis is such a bore that I soon kept hoping that they would hang him and get the film over with.This is not the first time a supposed Ealing classic has left me stone cold.

Actually I couldn't stick it any more and gave up a few pages in to the third book, but the first two didn't endear me to him.I'm not sure you could make this film with the same effect nowadays. It might lose something in the modern translation.It's brilliantly witty from the start and it's nice to finally agree with one of the BFI (British Film Institute)'s top 100 choices at last.",

            "content": "Classic 'Ealing' comedy from 1949. Now I think of comedy as telling jokes, pulling a face etc..however this film is not an example of that at all.My first foray into the films that were shot post war at the old Ealing Studios in London, U.K. that became known as Ealing comedies. It is more a black comedy. Showing humour such as the screenplay itself.The screenplay is about a rich, aristocratic family called D'Ascoyne's. The family has a noble title producing the Lord Chalfont. The family have a black sheep as such caused by one of the members having a relationship and producing a son with an Italian. The said black sheep of the family, a female branch and the son Louis Mazzini (Vincent Price) live in relative London suburbia poverty well away from the trappings of aristocracy.In later life Louis becomes bitter and vows revenge on the family who have disowned him and stand in the way of the dukedom. All eight members! Hence a series of murders occurs as Louis becomes ever closer to being ancestor to the Lord Chalfont title. I didn't realise until watching the film that all those eight members of both genders are brilliantly portrayed by Alec Guiness. A far cry from some of his roles in later life!The film is a delight and the old black and white photography a triumph that adds to the class of the film. On further reading the Director of Photography is Douglas Slocombe who I recognise from Carry On films to Indiana Jones blockbusters. Surprisingly good first foray into the Ealing comedy.",

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Coronets tells about Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini (Dennis Price), the son of a woman disowned from a high and mighty aristocratic family, who swears revenge on the said family due to the ill manner with which they have treated his mother his entire life. He goes as far as to swear that he will be the next head of the family, a new Duke of Chalfont.It's a surprisingly dark tale for a mid-century British film. Of course, the Hays Code was purely a Hollywood thing, so the films made elsewhere could be darker, but this was still a bit out of the norm. But it's stronger for it. Louis's vendetta is easy to understand and he's charismatic enough to pull us to his side of things. It also helps how the rest of the D'Ascoynes (almost all played by the unrivaled Alec Guinness) are such despicable and uptight people.Speaking of uptight, apparently this film was meant to be a satire against Edwardian London sensibilities and the rigidness of the upper class mannerisms. And it might have been, during its time, but I'm afraid that its satire is way too subtle for someone like me who's seeing it seventy years later. Because I didn't get that this was a satire, like at all. I thought its Edwardian London aesthetic, speech patterns, mannerisms and customs were easily the best part of it. All the characters had a delightfully stiff upper lips and they all talked so well and precisely. I absolutely loved it.Goes to show how time works its blurring wonders on subtleties.If I had to nitpick, I'd call the ending too neat. The plot falls in on itself a bit easily. A necessity of the time period, I suppose, but it's nevertheless a shame, given how clever the rest of the film had been up to that point.A good film, nonetheless. Borderline great. I liked the characters, I liked the setting (satire or not) and I liked the plot. Easily recommended.",

I guess a few of the characters were funny, like the General but are hardly given enough screen time to do anything.  There are lots of scenes with the main character courting one of the two ladies with absolutely nothing humorous going on.  This isn't an awful film, and I kind of liked the story, but it could have been a lot better.  They should have just done away with the pointless and unfunny romance scenes and lengethend the murders and given Guiness more screen time.

            "content": "Undoubtedly a classic of its era, \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" may be unfortunately a difficult experience for modern viewers; though not a particularly long film, its relentlessly dry humour and wit acts as a double-edged sword, making it hard to sit through in one single viewing without growing a bit - dare I say it - bored. That is not to say that it's in any way a bad film, merely that it's a definite product of its time, with a slow pace and theatrical direction, dialogue and performances that may not be to everybody's tastes.However, if you give \"Kind Hearts\" a fair chance you'll uncover an absolutely superb story that has its decent share of plot twists and ironies. The script, though wordy, is magnificent and delivered impeccably by the actors, particularly by star and narrator Dennis Price who one suspects was born to read such lines. Price gives the standout performance of his career and it's a shame in a way that it's so often overshadowed by Alec Guinness' turn as the entire D'Ascoyne family, though of course Guinness is note-perfect and his achievement is startling. Joan Greenwood is also particularly noteworthy, proving that strong female characters on film were not an invention of later decades, and Greenwood was one of the best actresses we ever had.I must admit that \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a film I admire more than I actively enjoy, though it has a great deal of merit and is well worth watching at least once. I fear, though, that it's a cinematic entry destined to always adorn \"100 Best Movies\" lists with fewer and fewer people having actually watched it. Perhaps it'd be worth updating for a modern audience - the only film that I think would benefit from a remake - so long as the essential charm and genteel elegance were retained.",

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Coronets is funnier in concept than in execution. I can think of things from it and laugh at the idea but thinking of the scenes doesn't make me laugh. It leaves me confused. I found the movie a bit slow and boring. Perhaps I need to know more about England, literature and class systems to properly appreciate it. Some humour may have gone over my head. But good comedy should transcend barriers, it should speak to every keen audience member. And it should fire on all cylinders if possible. This Is Spinal Tap has funny dialogue, sight gags, a mockumentary style, funny gestures and facial expressions, everything. But this movie seems to depend almost solely on words with only a handful of visual gags.Alec Guinness doesn't get to do a whole lot. Mostly he wears various costumes and sits and talks like an old man or says nothing at all. It's an acting job that many would be capable of. Why not make better use of him? Dennis Price is too plain and calm for my liking. I found this to make him forgettable and uninteresting. He doesn't seem to feel anything. I get that there is subtlety but then it should be witty or ironic the whole way through. The problem is that half of the lines aren't funny at all and we're left with too many dull moments. There is no drama or romance to speak of so why not go all the way with the comedy? It's confusing. I spent scenes trying to find the humour and couldn't. What are those scenes there for?A handful of parts were hilarious. Price puts gasoline in a photographer's camera. Eventually the photographer goes off to develop the film. We hear an off-screen \"boom\" and then smoke slowly rises in the distance. The characters barely notice but eventually Price goes to investigate. \"Needless to say, it was too late.\" One character he wishes to execute is in jail. So he helps petition for her release. He expresses his gladness when another one of his targets dies. He somewhat liked them and is now relieved from the duty of murdering them. A captain of a ship confuses the sea terms for left and right and gives instructions that lead to an easily avoidable crash with another ship. Both sink and everyone comfortably survives except for the captain - he stubbornly chooses to go down with his ship. The image of him saluting as he goes down is hysterical.I can see what Kind Hearts and Coronets is trying to do. But that's the problem - I should love this movie. I love sarcasm and irony and subtle wit and juxtaposition. The idea of a gentleman planning the vaguely justified murder of a series of rich relatives (played by one actor) and then running into numerous little difficulties is appealing. But this movie feels a bit too slow and pretentious for my liking. It presumes our attention rather than working for it. Not all of the jokes are great and I think most could be done more effectively. Too many scenes are unnecessary and waste time. They don't build tension or develop important plot points.I definitely need to give this another viewing at some later date, perhaps after becoming more familiar with Ealing movies and British humour in general. But I also have to trust my current judgement and say that aside from an overall mildly amusing undercurrent and some laugh out loud moments, Kind Hearts and Coronets is quite plain and underwhelming.",

Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script, that is funny, dark and has bite.

But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson, but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small, they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall, superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "In the early 90s in London, and in the eve of his execution, Louis Mazzini \u2014 played by Dennis Price \u2014 writes down his memoirs in prison. His calmness regarding his looming death is mystifying to the prison guards. Almost the entirety of the story is told in flashback, with Louis' novelistic voice serving as the voice-over chronicling the consequences that led to the status quo. As a result to her eloping with and marrying to someone beneath her status, his mother is not only deprived of her birthright, but also seemed to be disowned of her heir status in the royal D'Ascoyne family, as her dying wish to be buried with her family was not granted. Louis' true love, Sibella, denied him until he'd become a duke. So, he concocted a sinister plan that would simultaneously able him to miraculously climb the dukedom ladder he's entitled to and revenge for his mother, and thus serves as of both self-interest and vindictive purpose, respectively. He carefully, and fiendishly, observed and tracked on a family-tree chart on the back of a picture hanging in his room the passing and advent of every D'Ascoyne family member, \"Sometimes the deaths column brought good news. Sometimes the births column brought bad.\"\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets is an example of a Comedy of Manners, in which the superficiality of the upper classes is revealed. Typically, each character in this type of drama stands for a certain manner or folly prominent in the upper class which the work aims to satirize. Here, and in large part due to the amazing performances from the cast all around, the characters are fairly well-realized to give a sense of verisimilitude to their otherwise purposefully phlegmatic nature and lack of significant development. Sibella, marvellously played by Joan Greenwood, is an unabashedly exploitative to the point one wonders how Louis ever fell in love with her \u2014 but, after all, he himself is a real \"cad\" \u2014 while Edith D'Ascoyne presents the opposite. This sort of dichotomy between these two characters is an eminent feature in comedy of manners. Not to deviate from the mockery which the story aims at in the first place, that of denouncing those who marry for love instead of for rank, the movie's approach is explicitly not-so-subtle. In a monologue speech, Louis addresses the subject of satire quite directly before ending the life of one of the D'Ascoynes. That said, the movie is also snarky, and that can be clear from the witty dialogue, the reversal of roles and the fact one never gets away with what they've done and would be exposed at last sooner or later in a most ironic way imaginable, the latter two features also unmistakably belong to the comedy of manners.\n\nBesides the brilliant acting, what prevents the lethargy and heavy-handedness expected from all of this to sabotage the experience of the film is the delicate sense of emotion that prevails in spite of the ingenious dry British humour that engulfs the entire film and that the protagonist is, in fact, an anti-hero of sorts. There's a distinct film noir look to the cinematography that fits in with the grim undertones and subject matter that are overshadowed by the effectively wry humour. Employing Alec Guinness to play every role in the D'Ascoyne lineage with differences in gender and age is a stroke of genius. Fortunately, this then-novel gimmick has never been the main thing the movie resorts to whenever it wants to churn up a couple of laughs. The pacing drags every so often and the editing feels choppy at times. Regardless, Kind Hearts and Coronets is an extremely clever and special British satirical comedy with a gravitating performance from Dennis Price in the lead role.",

I really liked how Alec Guinness's characters all had different personality's which really helped with the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe cinematography was very good and fit very nicely with the style of the film.\n\nThe set design and props really put you into the movie from the building designs to the various sets.\n\nThe costume design fits perfectly with the era and helps with the atmosphere of the film.\n\nThe style of the film I personally really like from the way the characters act to the comedy of the film. \n\nThe action in the film though not much is still done very well from using Bombs in food to using poison in a drink.\n\nThe dialogue is also very good from the eloquent delivery to the very well written script.\n\nThe film also has some music, but most of it is only played for a short while and is mostly played in the background.\n\nThe story follows a young boy Ascoyne  who's mother a member of a family of dukes dies wanting to be buried in the family vault, but the family won't allow it since she married someone they thought beneath them. So to get his mother buried in the family vault he seeks out to kill the rest of his family to become duke.\n\nThe comedy in my opinion works really well from the subtle comedy to the front and centre comedy.\n\nThe film also has a really good atmosphere especially toward the end.\n\nThe film in my opinion is also really enjoyable and one that I will be watching again very soon.\n\nThe film does have maybe one or two mistakes, but they don't take away that much.\n\nOver all I give it a 10/10 - one of the best",

As the audience watches the undeniably warped protagonist commit all of these crimes in the name of his own vengeance against the nobles-that-be, we definitely feel that what he's doing is wrong. But we're still undoubtedly fascinated to see  where things will go. Indeed, more contemporary works like \"Nightcrawler,\" \"There Will Be Blood,\" \"House Of Cards,\" and even \"Taxi Driver\" owe a certain amount of credit to how well things worked out for a narrative with this kind of audacity back in the day. Every plot element in \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" is intricately laid out, with real intention emanating from the events as they unfold. I only wish the film's admittedly intermittent tone of sardonicism was as consistently impressive as the plotting work. Overall though, a fairly successful tale of depravity and duplicity.",

My first foray into the films that were shot post war at the old Ealing Studios in London, U.K. that became known as Ealing comedies.\nIt is more a black comedy. Showing humour such as the screenplay itself. \nThe screenplay is about a rich, aristocratic family called D'Ascoyne's. The family has a noble title producing the Lord Chalfont.\nThe family have a black sheep as such caused by one of the members having a relationship and producing a son with an Italian.\nThe said black sheep of the family, a female branch and the son Louis Mazzini (Vincent Price) live in relative London suburbia poverty well away from the trappings of aristocracy.\nIn later life Louis becomes bitter and vows revenge on the family who have disowned him and stand in the way of the dukedom. All eight members!\nHence a series of murders occurs as Louis becomes ever closer to being ancestor to the Lord Chalfont title.\nI didn't realise until watching the film that all those eight members of both genders are brilliantly portrayed by Alex Guiness. A far cry from some of his roles in later life!\nThe film is a delight and the old black and white photography a triumph that adds to the class of the film.\nOn further reading the Director of Photography is Douglas Slocombe who I recognise from Carry On films to Indiana Jones blockbusters.\nSurprisingly good first foray into the Ealing comedy.",

In them he details how, though descended from nobility, he grew up poor and had to pull himself up by his bootstraps, career-wise.  Then, discovering that only eight members of the D'Ascoyne family stood between him and the dukedom, he systematically started killing them, making the murders look like accidents.\n\nInteresting, intriguing crime drama, with a dry, dark humour about it.  The whole sequence of events leading up to and including Louis knocking off the claimants to the dukedom makes for compelling viewing.  Quirkily funny at times too.\n\nMore than just a crime drama, the movie also pokes fun at England's class and peerage system.  You can well imagine that someone would go to such lengths for a title and the wealth and other benefits it bestows.\n\nSolid work by Dennis Price as Louis.  Standout performance(s), however, goes to Alec Guiness who plays all eight members of the D'Ascoyne family!  Good support from Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood.",

The way the deaths take place and seeing how dark and passionate Louis was about avenging his dead mother was a striking thing to see. \n\nAnd let me tell you, what an ending! To see that the pages he'd written all along we're still sitting on the desk inside the prison was a complete shock that made me scream out loud in laughter.\n\nOverall, this movie was absolutely brilliant and the acting was superb. I like to think that he was able to go back into the prison and retrieve the pages. Then after that, he would retreat with Edith and kill off Sibella. After all, Edith, to me, is way more prettier and more lovely than Sibella. She is more pure than Sibella.

It is a very dark comedy, because it tries to make all these murders seem like an insignificant thing. The true magic of the film is that, by making the killer our narrator it actually gets the audience into his head and somehow makes it OK that he is killing these people even to the point where you are rooting for him. I'm not spoiling a whole lot here, although it seems like I am, because there is a framing device that sets up Louis already on death row as the duke. I have a hard time expressing just how delightful this film is, because the story sounds so dark, but I genuinely laughed out loud more than once. I think what makes it work is the combination of the cast (which I'll get into in just a second) and the script. Usually I don't think I'd care for a framing device like this one, because it reveals too much at the outset. However there is still a bit of mystery in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Ultimately the puzzle becomes figuring out just how he got caught, it's almost like a reverse murder mystery.\n\nNow the cast must be addressed here. First of all Dennis Price is amazing as Louis. He is both sympathetic and cunning. He does a superb job of portraying all the conflicting emotions he is dealing with, but also the cold calculation that is necessary for his machinations to work. Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood are perfect as Louis' 2 love interests because they have such totally different performances. Just from their accents and intonation you can tell what kind of person they are and what Louis sees in them. Now I've avoided talking about the master stroke of Kind Hearts and Coronets long enough. The truth is, while Dennis Price has the lead role, this film is only possible because of the brilliance of Alec Guinness. He plays the part of all 8 members of the duke's family. I didn't know this going in so I was extremely surprised to see that familiar face popping up again and again. He is the comedic heart of this film, and he delivers 8 unique performances. Aside from seeing the familiar features in each face there really isn't much to connect his portrayal of the Admiral and the Parson, or the Duke and Lady Agatha. All around I was just delighted by Kind Hearts and Coronets and I highly recommend it, especially if you still think Alec Guinness is just \"that guy who played Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"",

I mean, come now, of course this dark, Britastically dry comedy's humor would have stood the test of time, because it's only a measly little, oh, about almost 65 years old. Man, this film is so old that it stars Alec Guinness, who was old by the time he did \"Star Wars\", and also stars Dennis Price, who was, well, a year younger than Guinness, but nonetheless dead by the time \"Star Wars\" came out, so of course the annoyingly nostalgic critics are still calling this film hilarious, even - nay - especially in retrospect. I don't know about you people, but probably the funniest thing about this film is the name of the guys who wrote the book upon which this film is based, and whose name I'm not going to go ahead and say (Look it up and see just how much tastefulness in humor has died throughout the decades), because as this opener's first sentence will tell you, I can sure mess up a play on word. Oh, that joke was doomed from the get-go, much like comedy sensibilities of the 1940s, as this film, well, will tell you sometimes. Wow, I am really just knocking out of the park when it comes to showing that I'm perfectly sophisticated enough to be credible in a discussion of this film, but rest assured, people, I can back up my opinion that this film is hardly rewarding, much less funny, and yet, it's hard to deny what is done right in this film.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else can be said about this film, it looks pretty good for its time, and even to this day, as art director William Kellner captures a tasteful classiness in his designing of this world, often complimented by obviously limited, but generally noticeably sharp lighting tastes, explored by cinematographer Douglas Slocombe. At the time it's release, this film just had to have turned heads, as it remains visually appealing to this day, with clever art direction and tasteful photography that give you a comfortable and handsome feel for this film's world, further old on you by a certain other relatively upstanding aspect. Okay, perhaps upstanding isn't exactly the perfect word to use when describing this film's acting, as this isn't the type of film that commands strong performances, yet that doesn't stop this film from flaunting talented performers, who aren't used to their full advantage, but still engage more than the film itself, with leading man Dennis Price being charismatic and convincing as the classy, but corrupt man out for the blood of those who wronged him, while Alec Guinness steals the show, taking on not one, or two, or three, or even four, but eight roles, and making each one distinct through a careful attention to presence that leaves Guinness to become each and every one of his characters. I really do with I could say that the film is as sharp as its look and performances, as it is so messy and disengaging, with efforts that generally fall flat and leave the final product to gradually slip, but not without leaving behind some undeniable high points in storytelling. I for one would perhaps consider this film more pompous than witty, but rest assured that there are moments in which the film does, in fact, take on effective wit, particularly when it comes to the sense of humor that might not always work, - especially when being played up to the point of breaking a surprisingly consistency in this film's straight face with moderate silliness - but still has those moments of amusing effectiveness that give you a taste of what could have been. Granted, this film was never to be all that sharp, so don't expect the drops of potential fulfillment to be all that rich, but do expect them to at least be present, often on the backs of handsome visuals and strong acting, and sometimes on the back of effectiveness within the telling of this reasonably promising effort. The film has a fair bit at its back, but alas, in the end, the film just cannot cross that line into decency, coming close, but not close enough to avoid a dreaded plunge into mediocrity, anchored by an emotional distance that is itself anchored by questionable storytelling.\r\n\r\nOpening right up with Dennis Price's Louis Mazzini character in prison after the events that are not at all shown right away, this film offers no immediate development and is mostly unraveled in a flashback that you would think would compensate for the out-of-the-gate trip-up in exposition, but ends up being much more flawed than it should be, seeing as how it takes up the film's body, slam-banging through its points and delivering on little expository depth, as though it were planning on breaking out of the flashback that ends up being no mere recap of events preceding what is the majority of the final product, but most of the awkwardly rushed final product itself. Falling into all of the tropes of a throw-away flashback sequence, complete with skimming that is in no way helped by prominence in Dennis Price's summarizing narration, the body of this film is slapdashed and distancing, and such questionable story structuring methods deal a mighty blow to the film, no matter how much it ostensibly attempts to balance pacing out by meeting structurally rushed moments with atmospheric momentum that is anything but pumped out. The film is rarely, if ever necessarily all-out boring, but when this film really dries up, - as it oh so very often does - things really start to slow down, while blandness does the opposite, growing wealthier and wealthier, until devolving into dullness that would perhaps be compensated for if this film wasn't so quiet and tamed, defying traditional comedic atmosphere with a cold restraint that gets to be too intense, and is not backed up enough by lively material for entertainment value to go sustained. I know all of this complaining about a dull atmosphere and rushed narrative doesn't sound like too big of a deal, but when you get down to it, this film is just too dry for its own good, and its narrative is too driven by intentionally undercooked flashback sensibilities for its own good, meandering along with a distancingly lack of humanity that leaves you to meditate upon the lack of likability within the characters, as well as certain other shortcomings in the basic layout of this premise. There's a certain degree of immediate intrigue to this dry, darkly humorous study on a gentlemen with a dark vengeful side, but most intrigue goes lost in translation, thus you're only left with the natural shortcomings in this story, of which there are many, as this subject matter is mighty thin, with plenty of consequence, but still not enough juiciness surrounding and reinforcing the kick to such consequence, whose instrumental flavor rests in the hand of those who execute this sensitive story concept. Needless to say, the shortcomings in this film's thin story concept are not simply not compensated for by the telling of this tale, but intensified, as this film rushes through expository depth with a dully bland atmosphere and emotional distance that further thin out this story, until it stands as nothing more than barely structured and truly near-monotonously aimless. There are well-done aspects to this film, I'm not denying that, but the retrospective lauding of this film cannot possibly not be heavily influenced by nostalgia and appreciation of age over substance, because even if you look at this film for its time, outside of the look and performances, there's nothing terribly outstanding here, but a whole lot to complain about, as the final product drags along, keeping expository depth lacking, atmosphere dull, structure thin and overall resonance distanced, not so much so that the film isn't brought to the border of decency by what it does do so right, yet nevertheless to where you end up with a mediocre misfire that would have been forgotten were it not for its being kept alive by the hopelessly misguided nostalgics.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, handsome art direction, strong performances - particularly by the show-stealingly transformative Alec Guinness - and high points in witty storytelling bring the final product to the brink of decency, but don't quite succeed in battling back nostalgia, as there is too much distancing slapdashing within primarily flashback format-driven storytelling, bland, if not dull dryness in atmosphere, and aimless thinness in story structuring for resonance to be sustained enough to prevent \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" from gradually devolving into a borderline likable, but generally unrewarding mess of a fall-flat \"classic\" piece of dark comedy.\r\n\r\n2.25/5 - Mediocre",

She's not even allowed to be buried with the rest of her family, which makes Louis wanna avenge her, by eliminate all the remaining family members (All played by Alec Guinness) so that he can step up and take the throne that is rightfully his.\n\nWhat makes this film so funny is because that Sir Alec Guinness is playing seven different parts, anything kind of people, from young to old, and he even plays a women. Some of the performances are so great that I don't recognize him at all. And also special is Dennis Price's characters is also interesting in that way that he's kills people that easily and doesn't seems to regret any of it. He's a gentleman killer.

Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) was once heir to the title of Duke of Chalfont, but because his mother (Audrey Fildes) married a commoner, (an Italian opera singer), Louis found his branch of the family being shunned from such entitlement by the D'Ascoyne family, which consist of photographer Henry, Admiral Lord Horatio, Lady Agatha, General Lord Rufus, Duke Ethelred, the Reverend Lord Henry, posh cad Ascoyne and Lord Ascoyne Snr. (All played by Alec Guinness), after the younger Ascoyne gets Louis sacked from his job, Louis seeks revenge, and kills Ascoyne in a boating accident. Louis goes about becoming acquainted with the rest of the family or getting close enough to kill them as he works his way into getting his inheritance, but it might end up being his downfall. While Price adds a warm, dry wit as narrator and murderer, it's Guinness playing the D'Ascoyne which steals the show, proof that he was the best actor we ever had at that time, it has moments of humour you can't believe they got away with at the time, and it still stands up to this day.",

            "content": "Since the brand was revived several years ago, Ealing Studios have developed a reputation for quaintness. With the exception of John Landis' underrated Burke and Hare, the majority of the new Ealing's output has been frothy, often retrograde films designed solely for the export market. How easily we forget that the self-same studio once produced some of the darkest, edgiest and blackest comedies the world had ever seen. And there is no better example of this than Kind Hearts and Coronets, which takes pride of place with The Red Shoes as one of the finest British films of the 1940s.\r\n\r\nDescribing any old film as 'edgy' comes with problems. Changes in social attitudes since the 1940s means that, on one level, filmmakers are now able to show a wider range of subjects to a greater extent than ever before. Under this line of argument, what was once considered edgy, radical or insightful now looks timid and tame. But even if we accept this as a general rule, Kind Hearts and Coronets still stands as a proud and intriguing exception. Like Peeping Tom eleven years later, it has retained its emotional impact even after its aesthetic achievements have been surpassed.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets is a comedy about a serial killer, at a time when the vast majority of films involving murder sought to completely demonise the assailant in question. More than that, it is about a serial killer who vengefully targets the aristocracy, who while waning in power still held a great deal of influence in government and high society. The film is a vitriolic attack on the British class system, thinly disguised as an erudite comedy of manners. To paraphrase Macbeth, it may look like the innocent flower, but it is most definitely the serpent under it, and its venom is ruthless and bitter.\r\n\r\nIn a further comparison to Peeping Tom, the film had a rocky ride with the censors when first released. Sir Michael Balcon, then-head of Ealing, sought to distance himself from the film, believing that the public could not handle its ironic treatment of the subject matter. In line with the restrictive Hays Code, the American distributors requested that Robert Hamer added a ten-second epilogue, to show Louis Mazzini getting his comeuppance in a way while the original ending only implied. While Alec Guinness went on to win an Oscar for The Bridge on the River Kwai, neither Dennis Price nor Robert Hamer would ever reach this level of success again. Film critic David Thompson described the latter's fortunes as \"the most serious miscarriage of talent in post-war British cinema\".\r\n\r\nMany of the classic Ealing comedies used present events to satirise the past and vice versa. Passport to Pimlico satirised both the Berlin airlift and the exile of the Dutch monarchy to Canada, while some commentators have argued that The Ladykillers is a send-up of the post-war Labour government. Kind Hearts and Coronets was made in the year of the Second Parliament Act, which further curbed the power of the House of Lords and with it the aristocracy. The real-life political attack on landed wealth is contrasted with the lethal attacks of Louis Mazzini, with the aristocracy being 'killed off' in both cases.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets has a very poisonous view of the British class system, and in particular of the aristocracy's attempts to justify its position. While marrying out of love may have brought Mazzini's mother poverty, marrying for wealth and \"good breeding stock\" brings nothing but misery. Whatever diversions the D'Ascoynes may pursue (the navy, photography, the church, hunting) there are a universally inward-looking bunch, with little time for anyone whose interests or backgrounds are not identical to their own.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mazzini is of noble blood, his training as a draper, shop assistant and bank clerk gives him a middle-class status, something which simultaneously repulses and pleases him because it serves as the perfect cover for his crimes. The closer he comes to his goal of becoming Duke of Chalfont, the more he takes on the characteristics of a D'Ascoyne, shunning his childhood sweetheart Sibella (Joan Greenwood) and refusing to help Lionel in his hour of need. The film brutally depicts the entrenched arrogance of the British elites, something which has persisted longer after the D'Ascoynes of this world have withered away.\r\n\r\nDennis Price, who had previously found fame in Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale, is absolutely extraordinary in the lead role. Having been aptly described as \"sourly handsome\", he presents Louis Mazzini as a man of immense class and sophistication, but who is also capable of being cold, dismissive, callous and sociopathic. Price was always self-deprecating about his acting abilities, describing himself as \"second-rate\" and \"lacking the essential spark.\" But whatever else happened in his career, this performance is enough to dismiss all such deprecation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes his performance so interesting is that, for a lot of the time, Price doesn't speak. The prolific use of voiceover gives his performance a silent movie quality - not because his movements are exaggerated, but because his facial expressions and posture play a bigger part in his characterisation. Normally this amount of voiceover could quickly become tedious, but here it works brilliantly, taking us behind Mazzini's mask of dignity. It makes his deadpan expression all the more funny, as the most unspeakable things are uttered without the merest twitch of his lips. It is as though we were inside the mind of a killer, hearing his darkest deeds completely uncensored and without any license on the part of the screenwriter.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets' themes of love and class are also expressed in Mazzini's relationships with women. For most of the film he is taken with Sibella, who marries Lionel but confides in Louis due to their friendship as children, and increasingly out of desperation as just how boring her husband is. Louis strings Sibella along, playing with her heart strings and being glad to kiss her while knowing he can never bring himself to be with her. This is a further example of Louis' corruption as he grows closer to his goal, becoming as cold and as haughty as the people who caused him to swear revenge.\r\n\r\nIf Sibella is the proud plaything who is ultimately beneath his stature, Edith (Valerie Hobson) provides the security of wealth and the moral backbone Louis needs. Their initial meeting, while her husband is still alive, indicates that such a marriage would not be any fun: her strong religious conviction forbids drinking, leading her husband to keep gin and whisky in his dark room. Much of the film plays out like a bedroom farce as Louis tries to keep the two women from ever meeting. In the final scene, he has to choose between dull security and loving disgrace, quoting from The Beggar's Opera as he struggles to make up his mind.\r\n\r\nThe humour in Kind Hearts and Coronets is as black as can be, with multiple jokes about hanging and all the murders having a comedic quality. These range from the general being blown up as he opens the caviar, to the admiral mistaking port for starboard and sinking his ship, and finally Mazzini's employer dying of shock after inheriting the title. There are dozens of laugh-out-loud moments, such as Mazzini's comments after shooting down Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne: \"I shot an arrow through the air; she fell to earth in Berkeley Square.\" But a lot of the time the film is so edgy and so forthright that you're almost afraid to laugh: the barb is so strong that to laugh is almost too easy a response.\r\n\r\nThe film is most popularly remembered for Alec Guinness, who plays all eight members of the D'Ascoyne family. He was originally only offered four roles, but pressed Hamer to cast him in all eight after reading the script. Suffice to say, he's magnificent, with each family member having clearly developed character traits and quirks, and each looking hilariously pompous in all that make-up. The split-screen shooting used to put all eight characters on screen is utterly seamless, and Hamer's direction is totally first-rate.\r\n\r\nKind Hearts and Coronets is a perfect black comedy, which is as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail and as artistically accomplished as the best work of Powell and Pressburger. The performances are all superb, particularly from Guinness and Price, and Robert Hamer's direction gives the film a note-perfect pace so that all the jokes hit the spot. Over 60 years since it took the world by storm, it remains the darkest, edgiest and funniest of the classic Ealing comedies, and will be reducing generations to fits of laughter for years to come.",

(Though this is obviously due to the fact that he was not yet an established actor)  \r\nThe film centers around a character named Louis Manzzini (as played by Dennis Price) who is son to an Italian opera singer(also Price), and a woman shunned by her aristocratic family after marrying an Italian. His father dies upon the birth of his son of a heart attack, and his mother later dies during his early adulthood being denied the right to be buried in the family cemetery, thus causing her son to make a vow to kill off every member of the bloodline ahead of him, and thus separating him from becoming the next Duke. \r\nThis being said, this is obviously a vary dark comedy and at times we feel bad at laughing at the horrible things that happen (particularly the death of infants which is usually a no go zone) but alas, we still do. \r\nKind Hearts and Coronets is the dark comedy which every film of the genre should attempt to match in quality, but never will.",

            "content": "The best and most loved of the Ealing Comedies is also the darkest. Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as \"that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters.\" That said, it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini, the charming, urbane serial killer, who really steals the show.\n\nThe film opens in prison, with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne, Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that, his last night, he is completing his memoirs, which act as a framing device for the rest of the film, as well as allowing for a dry, witty narration from Mazzini himself.\n\nKind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue, with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords, being tried by his peers.\n\nI suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII, after the Beverage reforms, and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly, Louis is presented with such sympathy, and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.\n\nYou could regard it as a form of social commentary but, frankly, why bother? It's just glorious fun and, despite a certain English post-war feel, surprisingly modern and anarchic - there can be few films, even today, which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty, for instance, when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying \"furthermore, I am not naturally callous\".\n\nOf course, everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force - playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family; from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne (presumable unready for the fate that awaits him), the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality, few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors - Denis Price, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.\n\nThis remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy, but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful, heart-warming tale of multiple murder.",

Price takes this gesture as an insult, and makes a plan to kill the entire D'Ascoyne family: all of the rightful heirs to the Duke's throne, so that he can become the Duke himself. Each of the eight members of the D'Ascoyne family are played by Alec Guinness, all of them pride filled and retaining a sense of honor, and Price must find a way to sneak around their busy lifestyles and kill each of them without getting caught. \r\n\r\nThere's much hype around Alec Guinness playing eight roles and not to say that he wasn't good, but he just wasn't great. I guess I was expecting a sort of Dr. Strangeloveesque concept where each of his roles were more ridiculous than the next, but other than playing an eccentric-feminist: they were all generally bland. Maybe if he was in the film more and Dennis Price had less screen time, though Price was superb, it might have been a bit more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI was also expecting it to a clever dark comedy with painstakingly laughs, but the only parts I found comedy in were the spontaneous deaths which became more and more creative as the movie progressed. Everything else just seemed to be satirizing British royalty, which isn't really that funny unless you lived in 1940s England. The ironic ending was very crafty as well.\r\n\r\nSo far I've described this film as just not living up to my expectations and yet still being witty and well acted. So to my point: where this movie falls flat is the strenuously tied in romance and sub-plot about an affair that the main character is having with his childhood friend. Personally it made the majority of this movie a bore. And everything else, mostly the acting, was enticing.\r\n\r\nOne more point before I end this, and that's I found the direction to be particularly soulless and the editing to be half-assed: so it's bereft of art. There is little diversity in camera angles and a shot of a hot air balloon hanging from a visible wire.\r\n\r\nIs this worth seeing? First you have to ask yourself \"How much do I like Alec Guinness?\". If you are a diehard Alec Guinness fan, it may please you, and if not then you will be surprised at how infrequently he's in the film. It really has little appeal beyond the dark comedy: but the dark comedy is damn good.\r\n\r\nA prime example of British wit and some clever performances. 91/100",

Much of this owes to Alec Guinness' fantastic performance, a true tour-de-force in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend d'Ascoyne - changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person.\n\nThat said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back.\n\nFor those who don't want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear - Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer's ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted.

            "content": "I approached this with some skepticism but was roiling in riotous laughter within minutes. How a film can be this uproarious, biting and relevant 60 years after release is beyond me. The only recent comedies I can recall that were as hilarious and satisfying all seem to emanate from the English isles ('In The Loop', and a pair of Simon Pegg-Edgar Wright gems).\n\nThis is true black comedy in all its majestic glory: deliciously underhanded, bitingly satiric, furiously whip-smart and, of course, a laugh riot. Dennis Price is Louis Mazzini, 10th in line to a Dukedom but mired in poverty b'cos his mother was cast out for marrying - of all things - for love, rather than land or wealth or prestige. When his mother dies in poverty and is denied her final wish of being buried in the family crypt, Louis schemes bloody vengeance - to usurp the Dukedom by offing every single heir - all played hilariously by Sir Alec Guinness - in his way. It is a brilliant scheme, and Louis's exceedingly proper narration of such grim doings is one of the film's strong counterpoints (his quite natural disdain for hunting and other 'bloodsports' is delivered so drolly and matter-of-factly that it becomes a laugh-out-loud punchline in light that he is at the same time plotting to kill his uncle the Duke).\n\nAll the kudos over the years have gone to Alec Guinness, who is rightfully lauded for playing 8 so different characters, ranging from an endearing if foppish 24-year-old to a doddering old senile priest. It's quite brilliant to watch how convincing he is, even with the limitations of makeup in those days. But Dennis Price, the lead, the 'hero', should not be kept in the dark, b'cos the film flies or fails with him, and it is his amazing performance - so prim, so proper, so diabolically dashing - that is the true cornerstone of the film. Watching his quite delicate and methodical approach to serialized murder is a thrill, and he consistently provides the most laughs without ever telling a 'joke'; comedies, especially the British ones, were so much more organic back then.\n\nIt is a critique of class, and its culmination in a trial b4 the House of Lords is the fitting climax, where Louis is so prim and civilized he will not even risk an outburst at the prospect of being hanged for a crime he alleges not to have committed. The Hays Code enforced a change in the ending for American release, but the delicious ambiguity of the original finale is a wondrous joy to behold. 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' is fiendishly funny and insightful, and certainly one of the greatest comedies committed to celluloid.\n\nADDENDUM: I was shocked to hear the word \"nigger\" used not once but twice, in such casual refrain, but even that did not upset by enjoyment of the film, b'cos there was no malice at all in it. I did some reading and found that it was not widely viewed as derogatory in the UK at that time, and was still the commonplace word in the rhyme \"Eeny meeny miny moe\" (in place of \"tiger\"). Of course, the Hays Code wisely (for once) enforced a change to \"sailor\" for its American use, the first time I know of that gov't film censorship in America was actually for the betterment of all involved.",

The main character, Louis Mazzini, was portrayed by Dennis Price, a very capable actor that perfectly captured what was left of his d' Ascoyne bloodline's elegance and cool, contrasting the social class which he currently resides; impoverished, desperate, yet focused. Of course, a review of this film would not even be complete without even hinting on Alec Guinness' legendary performance/s as the eight heirs of the d' Ascoyne  dukeship, all on cue on Mazzini's crosshair. The whole murder scheme was comic gold all on itself that audience's anticipation for the next kill isn't primarily focused on whether or not Mazzini can pull it off, but instead for the simple reason of one's craving for some black laughter. The latter part of the film is more serious however, as Scotland Yard and the judiciary system interferes with the seemingly perfect crime, but not mainly as a plot device or even a deus ex machina type pay-off for the character, but to provide the great \"irony\" for the film, a figurative language that even the Ealing Studio boss himself does not have much faith into, but nevertheless delivered what was needed to complete this tale of comic vengeance wrapped in ambition.",

While the ending of the British version leads the audience to believe that Price will escape punishment for his crimes, American censors insisted that the criminal had to be punished for U.S. distribution, and so a less amusing ending was tacked on for the benefit of overly sensitive Yanks. Also of note is Joan Greenwood's performance as the murderer's childhood friend Sibella. Ealing was often an underfunded studio, so the production values are modest, though adequate.

The film then goes to an extended flashback of which takes up the duration of the film. In Edwardian England, Louis is the son of a woman who was disowned by her aristocratic family for eloping with an Italian opera singer. On her deathbed, the D'Ascoynes deny her last wish, to be entombed in the family crypt. Louis then plots to have his revenge on his relatives and to inherit the D'Ascoyne dukedom, however there are eight relative standing in his way from becoming Duke. Louis determines to murder each of his relatives, all played by the great Alec Guinness. He kills 6 of the 8 relatives in inventive, blackly humorous, and ironic ways. The Young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, the son of Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, is pushed over a weir with his girlfriend in a boat by Louis; Young Henry D'Ascoyne, a photographer, accidentally explodes the petrol in his lamp inside his darkroom; the Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne dies from poison Louis puts into his port; Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is killed by Louis firing an arrow into her hot air balloon plunging her back to earth; the Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne dies without the assistance of Louis when his ship sinks while going towards the Port side instead of Starboard and in turn crashing into another ship causing the sinking of the ship; the General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne is killed by Louis who sends him a bomb posing as a pot of caviar that the General sets off when he puts his knife into it; Ethelred D'Ascoyne, the VIIIth Duke of Chalfont, is lured by Louis into a mantrap and shoots him with his own gun, making it look like it was an accident; and finally Lord Ascoyne D'Ascoyne, a banker, employer of Louis and the IXth Duke of Chalfont, dies of shock after hearing of the death of the previous Duke. During this time Louis involved with two women, first Sibella, played by Joan Greenwood, who is the wife of his childhood rival Lionel, played by John Penrose, and the other Edith, played by Valerie Hobson, who is the widow of his second victim. He eventually marries Edith but when Lionel goes bankrupt and kills himself, Sibella hides his suicide note. Louis is then tried by his peers in the House Of Lords and is convicted of murdering Lionel, whom he did not kill. Sibella however \"finds\" the suicide note and Louis is then released in time before he can be hanged. Stepping through the prison gate with greets from a cheering crowd, there are two carriages awaiting him: Edith's and Sibella's. He is unable to choose between them and when a representative of a magazine asks for the publication rights to his memoirs, Louis realizes that he left the incriminating papers in his prison cell. It is then left ambiguous to the viewer whether his guilt is discovered.\n\nThe Ealing Comedy classic Kind Hearts and Coronets is based on a novel by Roy Horiman brilliantly brought to the screen by director/screenwriter Robert Hamer. Hamer's script is utterly brilliant. The witty dialogue fantastic. Robert Hamer directs his actors with great skill. The film is highlighted by two actors who give great performances. Dennis Price plays the scoundrel son of a disowned woman to a tee and his performance is only surpassed by the inimitable Alec Guinness who plays eight very different characters with subtle brilliance. The production values aren't too bad though they are only slightly faulty because the studio was usually underfunded. Kind Hearts and Coronets is a fantastic piece of British black humor that is at times more of a crime film than a straight up comedy but the comedy is done in a subtle way. It is truly one of the best black comedies ever made and all movie lovers should sit down and watch it. 9/10",

            "content": "Actually, He Played Everybody!  \r\n\r\nThe title, of course, refers to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson which informs us that the former is worth more than the latter.  The implication, I rather suspect, is that Our Narrator, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price), devalues himself over the course of the film.  His determination to avenge the wrongs he feels, not without justification, to have been dealt make him do things no sane person would do.  All the funnier that he declares that he won't actually shoot anything while his uncle (or something) does, because he won't participate in such bloodsport.  It was said at one point that they were trying to sell irony, and that never worked, but what with one thing and another, this is still considered one of the greatest British films of all time.\r\n\r\nLouis's mother (Audrey Fildes) married an Italian tenor for love.  Her aristocratic family turned her out because of it, and even when her husband died on the day her son was born, they wouldn't take her back.  She raised her son on this resentment, making sure he never forgot how close he was to the Dukedom of Chalfont.  (Due to complicated legal maneuvering explained at the beginning of the movie, inheritance is, in this family, possible through the female line even in 1900.)  When his mother dies, it boils over--the family won't let her be buried in the familial plot.  Louis decides he has had enough, and he is going to claim his inheritance if it means killing every single D'Ascoyne (Sir Alec Guinness) standing in his way.  This is complicated by his relationship with childhood friend Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who married someone else when she thought he wouldn't amount to anything, and his interest in the widowed Edith D'Ascoyne (Valerie Hobson).  \r\n\r\nAnd don't those D'Ascoynes drop like flies!  The Admiral dies in a naval accident, apparently based on a real event, and the Banker is weakened by a stroke and then has a heart attack upon discovering his inheritance of the title.  However, in one way or another, Louis does away with the other six.  While there are at least two cases I can think of which should have borne investigation, in one of those, there's no reasonable expectation that anyone ever would have been convicted, or even accused.  Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne, the suffragette, is in a balloon flying over London, and it is . . . damaged.  This would be, to me at least, obviously murder, given how it's damaged, but also given how it's damaged, she would just be a martyr to the cause, and there is no possible way of figuring out exactly who martyred her.  And that is one of the pleasures of the various plots; the ones which couldn't be seen as accidents or natural could almost never be traced to him, except maybe the last one.\r\n\r\nThe Duke tells Louis that he's quite obviously insane, and for once, I agree.  \"Insane\" has a very specific meaning and isn't the same as just crazy or even mentally ill.  You see, at no time over the course of the story does Louis ever really consider that what he's doing is wrong.  They wronged his mother, and therefore, they must pay.  The lot of them.  One of them even complains about some man who asked that his mother be allowed to be buried there, not realizing that it was Louis and that his mother had been a D'Ascoyne.  And, yes, those with any responsibility should have had to face it.  I just don't think most of them had anything to do with it or possibly even knew what was going on.  Even if they had, being murdered was not going to bring Louis's mother back or make them sorry for what they did to her.  However, once he's set on his goal, Louis doesn't even really seem to consider that.  He's decided that they must die, and so they do.  He's only glad the the Banker, whom he actually likes, dies of natural causes before he's forced to murder him.  There is, however, as close to no doubt as matters that he would have done so had the Banker not had his heart attack.\r\n\r\nPeter Sellers quite famously told Jim Henson that, while he could be Queen Victoria, he didn't know how to be himself.  (So they dressed him up as Queen Victoria.)  Sir Alec didn't have that problem.  The problem he did have was that he knew he wasn't Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He hated it.  He hadn't liked the movie while he was making it, though his costars say he was polite enough so that you wouldn't know it.  The only thing he liked about it, from what anyone can tell, is that he was about the only person confident it would be a hit, so he managed to negotiate himself 2% of the gross.  He didn't, after that, have to do \"the money, dear boy\" movies.  He and his wife, who were married for sixty-two years, were able to live happily, if modestly, on that.  (And how modestly probably depends on your definition.)  It broke his heart that, after all that--unto an Oscar for a movie he was actually proud of--people thought of him in the Mos Eisley Cantina.",

            "content": "Whimsicle farce with dry British humor. Be looking for a chuckle here and there but don't plan on busting a gut. It's just dark comedy and pretty obvious dark comedy at that.\r\n\r\nWe meet our lead actor Louis (Dennis Price) in prison writing a book of his devious exploits. Feeling cheated out of his family inheritance, he devises ways to kill off members of the family tree (hence the dvd cover art with a tree and him with a bloody axe). His resentment is fueled by the loss of his impoverished and kind mother who dies early in the film in a street accident.  \r\n\r\nThe title's significance, Kind Hearts and Coronets, comes from a paraphrased line in a poem read during the film.  The mother is the kind heart who sacrifices for her son into adulthood, while the coronets are the royal aristocrats who disown her and her son. \r\n\r\nAlec Guinness plays 8 of the despised royal family members in this rather fast paced black and white film.  Although subtitles would help me understand the accents here (and they were mentioned as an option in the cover jacket), my copy had no subtitles offered.  This situation has happened before with other dvd releases.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of Louis to knock off his royal family competition comes from the rude treatment by the family. The mother strayed by marrying a singing commoner.  When her husband dies suddenly and early in the film , she keeps writing to the her aristocratic family but recieves no replies save for one grudging and resounding \"we never heard of you\" type letter. (jeeez, that one gets me every time)\r\n\r\nWe should all be laughing hysterically aloud by now, but the early scenes are really more tradgic than comedic, but the line between the two is sometimes indistiguishable. \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming charm of this film and the disguised roles of Guiness prompted me to give it a fresh. Its narrated by Louis from time to time as well. \r\n\r\nThe American version of the film had to end to suit the \"crime does not pay\" code of the time.  Suggest you watch this one if you get that sudden urge for British dry humor.",

The tale of a exiled member of the royal family who kills off the family in front of him in an attempts to attain the throne of Duke is filled with a wealth of black humor that makes the film oddly delightful to watch, and Dennis Price is great as the murdering member of the family.  He keeps a calm demeanor throughout to the point of having an arrogance, even when it appears as if he will be executed for his crimes (the film opens with this, so not much of a spoiler).  Many of the deaths are pretty funny, and his expression of false remorse at their passing is a riot.  It is like a serial killer's comedy of manners, a morbid delight of the film.  And though this would make for a good film regardless, Alec Guinness makes this movie incredible.  Guinness plays not one but all eight of the heirs that are killed off in the film.  Guinness is astounding in his ability to slip in to each role, whether it be an enthusiastic young man, or a decrepit, absent minded old gentleman, or a snooty older woman.  None of the roles are played as screwball caricatures, but instead are played straight and each has their own set of speech, attitudes, behaviors, and mannerisms.  This is a terrific film to showcase what a good range of acting can accomplish and how an accomplished actor differentiates between several different roles.  Fans of Guinness' work in Star Wars as Obi-Wan (i.e., which should be everyone shouldn't it?) will be blown away by his talents in this picture.",

But all the positive press it's gotten over the years made me give it a chance. And I was NOT disappointed. This is a delightful film, made even more so by the fact that it's a black comedy -- the whole premise is based on the idea of a man killing off his family members in order to earn a long-denied royal title of Duke. \r\n\r\nThis started off a little slow for me, and I didn't see a lot of humor in it. But it gained momentum as it went along, and by the last 1/2 hour I was laughing out loud, and the surprise ending had me laughing hysterically and literally applauding. Alec Guinness has gotten all the attention over the years, since he plays eight roles in the films. But since each of those roles are little more than cameos, he is not actually the star of the film. Although, I have to admit that seeing him dressed as Aunt Agatha, riding in a hot air balloon, \"her\" long hair blowing in the breeze, will stick with me forever. No, that honor goes to Dennis Price. He carries on as if killing off his whole family is entirely logical and proper and ANYONE in his position would do the same thing.

There's no doubt that one of Kind Hearts and Coronets' greatest claims to fame is the fact that all eight heirs are played by Alec Guinness, and it's a worthy claim - unlike modern day multiple performances, while Guinness is heavily made up, his characters are as much differentiated by their performances as their look. But there's so much more to Kind Hearts, from the gleefully twisted ironies throughout (my favorite might be Guest's disdain for hunting birds as he sets out to murder another heir) to the increasingly evident gap between Guest's charming behavior and his amoral, sociopathic narration. Part social commentary, part dark comedy, Kind Hearts and Coronets is a great little film that works on every level. Come for the remarkable octet of Guinness performances, but stay for the smart (and dry) comedy and social satire.",

However, it should be pointed out, these are not grotesque exaggerations (i.e. Eddie Murphy in 'The Nutty Professor') but nuanced performances with a real through line of familiar family heredity. The plot is delicately simple, with Dennis Price (often overlooked because of the brilliance of Alex Guinness) playing a wounded descendent of the Upper Class and super-rich D'Ascoyne family, who's demeanour - when he finds out how badly his mother was shunned by having him out of wedlock - is all repressed English bile and hatred wrapped up in a smooth evil shell. He decides to kill off all eight heirs to the D'Ascoyne Dukedom, so that he can inherit the title and the fortune.\n\nThis is a brilliantly black film, with real malice and anger seeping through the comedy, as Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) relates the tale in flashback from his prison cell awaiting execution, as he writes his extraordinary tale down on to paper so that everyone will see how and why he did what he did. The killer twist being that he's awaiting execution for the murder of the one person he didn't kill - the husband of his estranged sweetheart, Sibella (played brilliantly louche and acerbic by Joan Greenwood, with that unforgettable voice), who he spurned to marry the widow of the second D'Ascoyne family member he had murdered.\n\nIt can be slow in places but it's never dull, each vignette with a new D'Ascoyne member bringing new freshness and hilarity to this morality tale. A fleeting appearance by a very young Arthur Lowe (Captain Mainwaring in 'Dad's Army') at the end delivers another killer twist as he's set free when Sibella 'finds' a suicide note from her dead husband and he has to choose between which carriage to depart in (that of Sibella's, who has saved him from death, or that of his wife Edith, who has stood by his side without knowing what he's been doing).\n\nThis is a drawing room comedy of the kind Oscar Wilde might've written if he'd lived to an older age, with the pain of his exile and fall from grace seeping into the script. This is what Alec Guinnes should be remembered for (and why he got so annoyed with 'Star Wars' fans, who clearly only knew him for playing Obi-Wan Kenobi). A brilliant social satire with real murderous menance.",

My only real gripe--and not to be sacrilegious--is that the 60-year-old movie isn't nearly as funny as I hoped. It evokes smiles and nods rather than many big laughs.

But sarcasm, faux pas and snideness are the essence of this film, and very deftly are they woven together into a comic tableaux.\r\nEveryone knows that this film is famous for putting Alec Guinness in 8 roles, though that doesn't automatically mean it's brilliant. The admiral, colonel and 'Suffragette' have barely 10 lines between them, and about as many minutes of screentime; that said, Guinness manages to individualise and personalise the rest of the D'Ascoyne's in a bravura display of characterisation. But the real plaudits must go to Dennis Price, the scheming duke-apparent who heartlessly murders 7 of his own family in a cruel opera of revenge against them for their impoverishment of his family for no reason except pride. It really does force you to consider who's worse in this scenario, but strings this thought up amidst the nigh-unbelievable goings on. Price gives a turn that outshines Guinness's, not only managing to be charismatic and almost deserving of our respect, if not our sympathy, he also convinces in several of his own disguises to off his fellow D'Ascoyne's. Credit is due to th two female leads: Hobson as the loyal, supportive Edith, and Greenwood as some sumptuously splendid crumpet.\r\nIt's a clever, outrageous and hilarious film, but too flippant and carefree. There's something uniquely post-war, uniquely British about its sober attitude that one must have an appreciation of context to fully enjoy the film. Most modern audiences would feel the motives over the top, or certainly too tame to warrant a massacre within one's own family. In any case, it may dilute but it doesn't silence the film's power and sly wit.",

On the Criterion disc you'll also find the American ending, which illustrates the absurd demands of the Hollywood film code of the 1940s.",

This isn't really the kind of humor I generally like, I probably didn't laugh out loud once while watching this... and I still loved every minute of it. A distinctly British film with an interesting take on a theme that country has taken as one of its main literary themes: class. The film deals with the decedent of a Duke who has been ostracized by the eight snobby heir who are ahead of him. As such he decides to gain his rightful title and get revenge by killing all eight of them. This reminded me in many ways of Sweeney Todd, which had a similar darkly comic revenge theme. All eight of the relatives, including an aunt, are played by Alec Guinness in a really neat multi-role performance. Gallows humor is obviously king here, and I had a blast seeing what new way this guy would find to bump off his relatives all the way through.",

His mother who came from the D'Ascoyne family, married an opera singer who they felt was beneath her and so they cut her out. \r\nLouis who grew up and came to the realisation that he was living and working beneath his birthright status, develops the plan of killing the people that stands between him and becoming Duke.\r\nAlex Guinness plays 8 different characters to faultless perfection and everything is wrapped up in a fantastic script that delivers fast paced comedy that still stands strong.\r\nThe ending is superb and this gives the backbone to the perfect film about jealousy and greed.\r\nRating: *****",

Imagine his fury and dismay when they say no. He sets about getting revenge, as well as winning the heart of the mercenary woman he loves through murdering each of the eight d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ascoyne family members that stand between him and a title, riches, and everything that he feels he deserves.\r\n\r\nWearing the Ealing black comedy streak on its sleeve and gleefully black, Kind Hearts and Coronets has got to be one of the funniest films about murder to be made. Much of this owes kudos to Alec Guinness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fantastic performance, a true tour-de-force in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ascoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ascoyne with commendable diversity, changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things, which Guinness then continued to deliver.\r\n\r\nThat said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back. However, his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge, as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on post-war Britain, where the gold digging (played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood) women were everywhere and to some people, rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical, giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.\r\n\r\nFor those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted. You really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get much better, or much intelligent than this.",

But I'm not here to rant! \nKind Hearts and Coronets is by far the best of the Ealing comedies. Everyone who loves the Ealing films raves about The Ladykillers. As much as I love The Ladykillers it doesn't have the biting satire, subtlety and richness that Kind Hearts does. The Ladykillers is nearly as dark - both films have a body count that would put Quentin Tarantino to shame. But the characters in The Ladykillers are each a very broad caricature or stereotype (the spiv, the crusty old Colonel, the smart suited gangster, punch drunk boxer and so on) and it's the one thing that has always really annoyed me about the film. But I won't bash The Ladykillers. It may be over-rated but it's still pretty excellent. \nSo Kind Hearts has the edge for me. It's very much darker than it's given credit for - a comedy about a serial killer who, despite not getting away with it, you wish he had! It's also got a lot to say about class distinction and the privileges of the upper classes. So for example, when the ship's captain stubbornly goes down with his ship he looks pompous and ridiculous - becoming a figure of fun instead of the usual stiff upper lipped heroic types films had given us time and again. \nBoth Alec Guinness and Denis Price were not only great actors but had superb comic-timing. Guinness was probably one of our greatest ever film actors. I don't care who you are or how old you are, everyone has seen him and liked him in something and maybe don't even realise it. He never sold out and was starring in British film and TV right up to the end of his life. \nHe was always a bit snooty about being remembered for playing Obi -Wan Kenobi but the important thing is that he is remembered fondly! And anyway he gave gravitas and screen presence to that character and that's why the fans remember him. Will people say the same about Ewan McGregor?",
