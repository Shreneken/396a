            "review_title": "A Magnificent Timeless Tale of Ambition, Manipulation and Betrayal - Certainly One of the Best Classics Ever",
            "content": "The ambitious Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing (Bette Davis) and her friends Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe); her boyfriend and director Bill Sampson (Gary Marrow); and the producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders), believe that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.\"All About Eve\" is a magnificent timeless tale of ambition, manipulation and betrayal, and certainly one of the best classics ever. Everything perfectly works in this movie: the direction is very precise and tight; dialogs are very acid and intelligent; Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm have awesome performances in very powerful characters; the dramatic story is amazingly good, showing what an evil person can plot to reach fame and success. I believe this movie will always be among my ten favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Malvada\" (\"The Wicked\")",

            "content": "All About Eve is my idea of a perfect film,(and I am 17) beautiful and brooding at the same time. People consider this as one of the finest films ever made, and I cannot disagree. This and Shawshank Redemption are actually films that deserve to be in the top 250. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Just Brilliant!",
            "content": "Brilliantly acted and cleverly characterized, with sparkling dialogue that mercilessly parries the gloss from the New York theater world's highly sophisticated veneer, \"All About Eve\" is a scintillating comedy of manners that compels rapt attention for the whole of its 2\u00bc hours. We like George Sanders, pointing out Gregory Ratoff to his escort, Marilyn Monroe (whom the script describes as \"a member of the Copacabana school of acting\"), with the words: \"There's a real live producer, honey! Go and do yourself some good!\" And the final scene, in which Sanders asks Barbara Bates, \"Do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?\" \u2014 \"More than anything else in the world!\" she answers. \"Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one\", he replies. \"Miss Harrington knows all about it!\"It is often complained of Mankiewicz's work that it is too stagey and too talkative, that there is not sufficient movement. There is some justice in this charge in the consideration of such films as Five Fingers, The Quiet American, House of Strangers, and Dragonwyck; certainly Mankiewicz's two spectacles, Guys and Dolls and Cleopatra, are much improved by sharp editing. But in his best films, The Late George Apley, A Letter to Three Wives, All About Eve, People Will Talk (which I regard as his masterpiece \u2014 it was too off-beat, unfortunately, for contemporary audiences or critics to appreciate), and The Barefoot Contessa, any trace of over- talkativeness is more than offset by the range and variety, the unusualness of the characters. Moreover, it is the characters themselves that determine the plot \u2014 not the fate or some external force.Thus, in All About Eve, Margo Channing is the victim of her egocentricity, Sampson the victim of his own cynicism and Richards, the victim of his own ingenuousness. Eve Harrington is cunning and ruthless enough to exploit these traits in her climb to stardom. Besides Mankiewicz's two awards, All About Eve also won statuettes for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Costumes and Best Sound Recording. Also, producer Darryl Zanuck won the Thalberg Memorial Award for consistent high-quality production over the previous three years.The film also won the New York Film Critics' Citation for Best Picture, Best Direction and Best Actress (Bette Davis). Actually, I thought that Miss Davis' performance, fine as it was, was overshadowed by Anne Baxter's interpretation of the scheming Eve. To cover with a winning veneer of innocence a character that would not stop at blackmail or adultery to win stardom, cannot have been an easy assignment for a young actress; yet Miss Baxter brought it off flawlessly.OTHER VIEWS: I'd had the general idea for All About Eve in mind for a long time. But I never had a middle, a second act. Then our New York office submitted a short story by Mary Orr called \"The Wisdom of Eve\" \u2014 later a radio script \u2014 and I had my second act. Incidentally, Zanuck deserves some credit for what happened. He was the only studio head in town with the courage and intelligence to try new things. I don't think I could have made this picture on any other lot but 20th Century- Fox. -- J.L.M.",

            "review_title": "Superb Acting And Dialogue",
            "content": "What a movie! It's the cinematic ideal, the standard by which subsequent films are judged, at least in terms of acting and dialogue. Maybe the camera, which does nothing but sit there as the actors act, could have been made a little less static. But the story screams stage play, which implies lots of talk and not much \"action\". The film doesn't pretend to do all things. But what it does do, it does extremely well.As Margo, Bette Davis gives what I would consider one of the best performances, if not the best performance, in any film I have ever seen. She truly becomes Margo, that \"fixture of the theater\", so beloved yet so insecure. And as Eve, \"the mousy one, with the trench coat and the funny hat\", breathy Anne Baxter proves adept at subtleties that allow her character to change gradually over time.Then there's George Sanders who effortlessly slips into the role of witty, urbane, pompous Addison DeWitt, columnist magnifico, a man whose high opinion of himself allows him to declare to us, as viewers, that he is \"essential to the theater\". Celeste Holm and reliable Thelma Ritter give topnotch performances as well.And the Mankiewicz script, which tells the story of a group of theater people, is heavy on dialogue, but it's totally believable, as characters talk shop and interrelate, by means of suitable verbal conflict and subtle subtext. Even more than that, the dialogue is witty and clever, with tons of theatrical metaphors, like when Bill (Gary Merrill) angrily tells Margo: \"And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me, it spells a paranoid insecurity that you should be ashamed of.\" To which Margo just as angrily spits out: \"Cut, print it, what happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pits?\"One of my favorite scenes has several people sitting on a stairway at a party. A curvaceous but bird-brained Miss Casswell (Marilyn Monroe), \"from the Copacabana school of acting\", desires another drink. \"Oh waiter!\", she yells out. Addison schools her: \"That isn't a waiter, my dear; that's a butler.\" To which she fires back: \"Well I can't yell 'Oh butler', can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler\". Addison then concedes: \"You have a point, an idiotic one, but a point.\"I'm not sure I really like the characters in this film. Generally, they're self-absorbed, vain, haughty, and backbiting. They're not all that likable. And that would be my only serious complaint.Otherwise, \"All About Eve\" is a film that excels at great language and great acting. If ever there was a film that deserves the status of \"classic\", this is surely it.",

            "content": "In show business, there is probably an Eve Harrington born every day. Someone who butters up to a performer of note, acting innocently, revealing none of the coldhearted ambition they really have.  Anne Baxter plays this type of person to a tee.  She looks like a baby-faced fan, but little do we know, there is a fame machine at work in her mind.  Bette Davis, as Margo Channing, star of the stage, is a veteran who has seen it all.  She is quite the egotist.  Margo is a brilliant actress and she knows it.  Eve discovers her blind spot and moves in on her like a quiet storm.  This is the premise of ALL ABOUT EVE, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's masterpiece of sly wit and subtle manipulation.  Mankiewicz also wrote the picture (winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1950) with such skill, the talented cast need only to memorize the lines and deliver them with the proper technique.The performances are great, regardless, especially by Bette Davis and the always detested George Sanders, one of my favorite actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood.  The film is narrated initially by Sanders, who plays a ruthless swine of a theatre critic, then by Celeste Holm, the wife of Eve and Margo's playwrighter, then Bette Davis in the performance of a lifetime. The movie is about 90% dialogue, much like a play.  The words are so crisp and sharp, you never sway or lose interest.  These characters are just too interesting.  Bette Davis has a cavalcade of unforgettable dialogue. \"Fasten your seatbelts.  Its going to be a bumpy night!\"  This is the one everyone remembers, but I would be remiss to get into any others.The picture runs well over 2 hours, but it doesn't seem like enough. Mankiewicz could've held a seminar of screenwriting by showing this.  George Sanders is the only actor of the roster to bring home an Academy Award, and rumor has it Davis and Baxter, who was just 27 at the time, were feuding during much of the shoot and lusted the Oscar.  Time has been very good to the film as well.  1950 was a wonderful year for movies and ALL ABOUT EVE's artistic equal that year was the equally well-written SUNSET BOULEVARD, which took us behind the scenes of a tainted Hollywood.  EVE takes on theatre and treats Hollywood like an afterthought.  There are many references to the film industry, usually involving the scenes with Margo Channing's boyfriend, who is attempting to make a career on the silver screen.The movie is highly unpredictable, especially the last scenes which tie the ideas of the story up.  There is an Eve everywhere and each character gets what he or she deserves. Fasten the belts and listen up.  This is screenwriting at its finest.",

            "content": "And you really don't need to know about the theater, because it is ultimately about the many facets of human nature.I absolutely adore this movie. It helps when I love Bette Davis, but this is something altogether different from your run-of-the-mill drama, much less your typical Bette Davis melodrama. First and foremost, the screenplay is quite simply one of the best ever written alongside Network and a few others. Mankiewicz's tremendous knack for biting language is glorious. He had shown shades of this gift in his screenplay for A Letter to Three Wives the previous year, but this screenplay is something else.A screenplay, nevertheless, can't singlehandedly make a film as brilliant as this. Mankiewicz pairs his writing with superb direction and the performances are splendid. Davis gives almost undoubtedly the best performance of her illustrious career as the aging Margo Channing and Anne Baxter turns in a quite good performance that sneaks up on you before her character, Eve Harrington, falls prey to herself. Celeste Holm is great as the conflicted friend of both Margo and Eve, Karen Richards. Thelma Ritter delivers a funny, yet powerful performance as Birdie, a part that is inconsequential at first glance. My favorite performance, however, is the absolutely magnificent supporting performance given by George Sanders as the cynical, sardonic, conniving journalist Addison DeWitt. His voice is perfect and his cane and cigarette holder are forever etched in my memory. Hugh Marlowe as Lloyd Richards is really a blank, though a better casting choice probably would have resulted in a more complex interpretation of this admittedly bland character.It's rather ironic when Margo confides to Karen that she wants Bill (Gary Merrill) to love her, the woman, not the actress, because the actress will fade with time. Eve worries over the difference in their ages, Eve being eight years older than Bill. Bette Davis and Gary Merrill did get married, and though it lasted longer than Davis' other unions, it ultimately failed. Davis later said that their mistake was that they thought they were marrying the characters in the film, and when the film faded into the past, there was no basis for a relationship.",

Flash back to October, shy Eve is waiting outside of the theater for Margo Channing (Bette Davis) after her lead performance. The playwright's wife Karen Richards notices her there as always after every performance and invites her backstage. The obsessed fan tells them that she lost her husband in the war. Eve insinuates into Margo's life first by moving in and then becoming her assistant. Slowly, Eve schemes to undermine Margo and take over her place.This is one of Bette Davis' greatest role. She is pitch perfect as the aging star. Then there is Anne Baxter who personifies innocence at the start. It's a bit of a shock to see her spiral in her ambitions. It dawns on the audience that they've been had. These two great performances anchor a compelling story of the rise and fall of stardom.",

Who would have thought he could not only revive Bette Davis' career with her greatest-ever role, but actually make her even more fascinating than she ever was before? Davis plays famous and established actress Margo Channing, a self-centred and tough but vulnerable woman who is purused relentlessly by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a seemingly innocent woman who worships Channing-she even becomes her personal assistant. However, her devotion soon becomes sinister, and Margo lets her friends know, though they just think she's being selfish and unfair. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's best friend, who at first is on Eve's side but eventually sees how conniving Eve can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. The party scene early on in the film features some of the film's best lines (`Fasten your seat belts\u0085it's going to be a bumpy night!'), though my personal favourite is when Davis tells Baxter to put her award `where you heart should be'; Margo Channing is just about the best female character of the fifties.

            "content": "THE definitive saga of backstage brouhaha ever dished out by Hollywood.  A triumph of screen-writing, never will one see such ripe, acrid dialogue spewed out like this again -- every indelible scene gloriously stained with classic one-liners.  An actress wanna-be looking for her big break carefully worms her way into the glamorous life of a legendary Broadway star, then tries to supplant her privately and professionally.A sterling, incandescent cast provides the fire and music to this concerto of theatre attitude.  Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as Margo Channing, the indomitable diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage.  Not willing at all to deal with it tactfully, she makes life a living hell for anyone within knife-throwing distance.  This juicy, once-in-a-lifetime part turned Davis' own flagging middle-aged career back on its feet, especially coming on the heels of one of her biggest \"dumps\" ever, \"Beyond the Forest.\"  Remarkable as it may seem, Bette was not the first choice here, replacing an injured Claudette Colbert.  With all due respect to Colbert, Bette Davis was BORN to play Margo Channing.  A mauling lioness one minute, a coy, declawed pussycat the next, Davis relishes every wickedly bitchy scene she gets to tear into. Yet in her more introspective moments, she evokes real sympathy for Margo (as only a true star can) especially when her character missteps.  It's a resounding victory for the Queen Bee in every way, shape and form.Her \"supporting cast\" also manage to create a buzz of excitement.  Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe, known for their relative blandness, are splendid here in their respective roles as queen bee's lover and playwright.  While Merrill's Bill Sampson tames Margo the woman with gutsy directness and virile passion, Marlowe's Lloyd Richards appeases Margo the star with flattery, great dialogue and a calm resolve.  Worth watching, then, are their fireworks scenes with Margo when intelligence and restraint no longer work.  Debonair George Sanders gives customary snob appeal and dry cynicism to his waspish, ultimately loathsome columnist Addison DeWitt, who swarms around Broadway's elite knowledgeable in the fact his lack of heart and poison pen yield exclusive rights and power.  The most sensitive and sensible one in the collective bunch, the one lacking a true stinger, is Karen Richards (played wonderfully by Celeste Holm), Margo's best friend and confidante, who finds herself caught between the queen and a hard place when she accidentally makes a pact with the devil.  Thelma Ritter couldn't be overlooked if she tried.  An inveterate scene-stealer, she weathers strong competition this time in a movie crammed with clever conversation and pungent zingers.  As coarse but well-meaning Birdie Coonan, a brash ex-vaudevillian now the queen's ever-loyal \"drone\", Ritter's character properly handles her boss's antics with amusing grit and backbone.  On the periphery of this Broadway beehive is mop-faced Gregory Ratoff as an edgy, gullible, thick-accented producer, Marilyn Monroe as a hopelessly vacuous starlet, and Barbara Bates, as a novice schemer with a very bright future, all making their few scenes count -- especially Bates, who is forever enshrined in the film's stunning final shot.The chief thorn in Margo's (and everybody's) side, and the other real star of this picture, is the queen's titular lady-in-waiting, Eve Harrington. As played by Anne Baxter, this role is probably the most delicate and difficult of all for the weight and believability of this drama falls squarely on her shoulders.  Unfairly overlooked all these years by the flashier posturings of Davis, Baxter does a beautiful job of drawing initial pathos then panic as she slowly unveils her own lethal stinger.  By film's end, Baxter is directly on par with her scenery-chewing co-star.  Killer to killer. Champion to champion.Six Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (also Mankiewicz) and Supporting Actor (George Sanders) went to this cinematic bon mot.  Had Bette Davis and Anne Baxter not competed as Best Actress (Baxter refused to place herself in the Supporting Actress category), it would have drummed up two more awards to be sure.Developing a faithful cult following over the years, this film deserves to be on everybody's \"top ten\" list.",

            "content": "This film isn't really ALL About Eve. It's about a young woman's schemes for theatrical success and how she affects all the lives around here.The protagonist is Anne Baxter playing Eve Harrington. Celeste Holm, wife of playwright Hugh Marlowe sees her night after night outside the theater where Bette Davis is starring in her husband's play. Eve tells a sad tale of woe to Bette, Celeste, Hugh, and director Gary Merrill once she's admitted into the star's inner sanctum. The only one who's skeptical is Bette's maid Thelma Ritter. Baxter is admitted into Davis's entourage.Davis, Daxter, Holm, and Ritter all received Academy Award nominations, the first two for Best Actress and the latter two for Best Supporting Actress. The first three already had won awards so more than likely they canceled each other out in the voting. Davis and Baxter lost to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday and Josephine Hull in Harvey beat out Holm and Ritter. But in many ways these may have been the career roles for all these players. Bette Davis made a comeback with this part of Margo Channing. She had left Warner Brothers the year before after a string of very forgettable post World War II films. Davis really was Margo Channing, a big star who was now getting on in years and refused to realize she could not play leading parts for too much longer. Bette had a whole lot of insight to bring to Margo.Anne Baxter had won a Best Supporting Actress Award for The Razor's Edge. But Eve Harrington is miles apart from the tragic Sophie. Sophie is a decent soul who through a tragic accident that claimed her husband and baby went completely bonkers. Eve is a cold and calculating little minx who sets her sights on stardom and she's not too scrupulous about what she has to do to attain it. Both parts show the depths of this very underrated actress.I've always thought Celeste Holm has always been ignored unfairly when people talk about All About Eve. She and George Sanders narrate the film in different spots because the film is told in flashback as Eve Harrington is being presented the Sarah Siddons Award. It's her perspective from which Eve and the rest of the characters are viewed. She's an essentially decent soul, not as ego driven as the others who make their living in the theater. Her life is in her marriage to Hugh Marlowe and it nearly is wrecked because she took pity on a waif outside a theater. Celeste is living proof of the old adage about no good deed going unpunished.All About Eve got a few awards though including the big one for being The Best Picture of 1950. Joseph Mankiewicz got his second Best Director Oscar, he had won the previous year for A Letter to Three Wives.And 1950 proved to be the high point of George Sanders career as he took home a Best Supporting Actor for that 'fishwife' theatrical columnist Addison DeWitt. He also that year stole Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah's with his portrayal of the Saran of Geza. In fact the Saran was a BC version of Addison DeWitt.Sanders is the only other person who sees Baxter for what she is besides Thelma Ritter. He turns out to be quite the investigative reporter and his confrontation with Baxter is the climax of the film. He's not a nice man, but that may make him the only one really equipped to deal with Baxter if she becomes successful.All About Eve hasn't aged a bit in 56 years. I'm not sure about not making films like this any more, but they sure don't write them like this. It's one film you dare not put the mute button on or go to the refrigerator because you'll miss some witty gem. They come pretty fast and furious.And yet for all the sophistication of the film, Margo and her circle aren't a bad bunch. Naive yes, when it comes to Eve, but this con woman takes advantage of the fact that people want to believe someone like Baxter when she tells her tale and they have good extincts.Fortunately none of their good deeds are permanently punished.",

Mr. Mankiewicz's timeless tale for this film was something that paralleled the great writing of another author that knew the inside of the human race: Honore de Balzac.In this story about the theater, all the elements come together to weave a perfect movie, one that will endure the passage of time. Mr. Mankiewicz's screen play is about blind ambition and to what extremes does a person goes in order to realize that goal. The writer seems to be telling us that to Eve Harrington, her end justified the means by which she arrived at getting where she got.The cast assembled for the movie was the perfect blend of styles and acting ability. This film is dominated by Eve Harrington, who, Anne Baxter plays to perfection. We first see her as the adoring fan to Margo Channing, the star of the hit play on Broadway. She will do anything to get to where Margo Channing is. In a way, Eve is a user of the worst kind. She used Karen Richards, Margo's best friend in order to get in the theater world where she finally makes a splash.In that theatrical world, we encounter all kinds of sub species that tend to gravitate toward the limelight where others are shining brighter. They will do anything in their power in order to 'belong' to the glamour and all the things that go hand in hand in that circle.Anne Baxter was an amazing Eve Harrington. She was a young actress then, who showed a lot of talent and was perfectly cast for that role. Bette Davis makes Margo Channing come alive. Ms. Davis shows us what is to be at the top of her class and suddenly see her world begin to crumble, which in a way, it's the way of the theater. The theater and the movies are cruel to the stars that dare to age in front of our eyes. There will always be prettier and younger actresses to bask in their moment of glory in front of the adoring public, but watch out, never get old!George Sanders as the bitchy Addison Dewitt, is the maker and breaker of many a career. He has the power to destroy anyone that doesn't play by his rules. Mr. Sanders was excellent by being the cynic in a make believe land. In a way, the writer is telling us that even then, there was something rotten in theater critics that will ruin a play by just disliking it in the press. Celeste Holm is also effective as Karen Richards, a friend indeed, until she is used to give Eve her big break. Thelma Ritter is a delight to watch as Birdie, the wise maid that sees right through a phony when she sees one. Gary Merrill, George Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe and a young and fresh Marilyn Monroe complete the cast.Never before did a movie packed such an impact to reveal so much about the human comedy, as in this one. After all, that comedy, or call it tragedy, has existed since the beginning of time. All this because a brilliant Joseph L. Mankiewicz brought to the screen to dazzle audiences forever.",

            "content": "All About Eve (1950) **** (out of 4) Broadway star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) invites a woman named Eve (Anne Baxter) into her life because she's an adoring fan but before long the much older Margo begins to fear that the younger woman wants more than friendship. Soon Eve's plans of becoming a star herself come out and she's not going to let anything get into her way.ALL ABOUT EVE was, at the time, the film that captured the most Oscar-nominations with fourteen and it eventually won six including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for George Sanders. If you're a fan of movie stars, directors, producers or anyone in that profession then ALL ABOUT EVE is certainly a must see. Sure, perhaps it does run on a bit too long but there's no question that it contains one of the greatest ensemble acting classes that you'll ever see as well as some perfect direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and his screenplay is bitterly sharp and funny.So much has been said about this film over the years that I couldn't possibly add anything new. What I really respect about the film is the fact that it really could have gone over-dramatic but instead it plays out like a black comedy where we're dealing with some at times ugly people who get out done by a couple snakes in the grass. The way the mystery of this Eve character plays out is so flawlessly done that it's impossible to hate her because you see her game and her goal. You then start to see that she probably didn't do anything that others wouldn't have done also.Davis gets the majority of the credit in the acting department and there's no doubt that she's perfect and this helped rebuild the second stage of her career. As great as she is I think she sometimes overcrowds what others in the film do. Both Gary Merill and Hugh Marlow are terrific in the role of the supporting men. You've got Marilyn Monroe in an early bit and she's really funny here. Thelma Ritter is always fun to watch. Then you've got the three best performances in the film. Celeste Holm is simply divine on so many levels here as the woman who opens the gate for the snake to come in. Baxter is simply wonderful at playing so many different sides of this character. There are so many adjectives used about her character and the actress really delivers everything you could hope for. Then there's Sanders who is perfectly delightful as the rather crooked writer with his own game to play.ALL ABOUT EVE contains a really terrific script for these great actors to sink their teeth in. The film is brutally honest and funny about stardom and what one will do to capture their glory. The way the film plays out is wonderfully done and there's no doubt that the film deserves its reputation.",

            "content": "I had read comments about the quality of the writing in this film but I really had no idea to what extent this would elevate the experience.  The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on.  It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted.  The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to \"act\" too much) only enhances it that much more.  With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.\"All About Eve\" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films \"A Face in the Crowd\".  Both are studies of fame and celebrity.  Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield.  The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so \"liberated\" today.  So what more can I say?  If you love movies and you haven't yet seen it, you've suffered long enough; don't wait another day.",

It opens with a monologue that introduces all the leading players that is at once literate and cinematic at the same time and you know instantly that his is, above all, a movie to listen to. (What film-buff doesn't quote its screenplay ad-nauseum; gay men, at least according to \"The Boys in the Band\", are said to know the script by heart). And while drag queens the world over have always based their Bette Davis imitations on the character of Margo Channing, (Davis' greatest role and her greatest performance), the film is never merely camp. The acerbic wit that runs through the film always has a ring of truth to it; the characters, overblown as they are, are always recognizably human.The acting alone is to die for. Can you believe that other actresses were once considered for the role of Margo? (Claudette Colbert?). Davis makes it her own not by acting Margo but by being Margo. I can't think of another role more indelibly suited to an actress than this. In a lesser film she might have swamped her co-stars but Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed, gives everyone equal credence.Anne Baxter was never better than as the poisonous Eve; Celeste Holm, wonderful as the clipped, sophisticated Karen; George Sanders oozing epigrams as if from every pore as the screen's most famous critic, Addison DeWitt, (what a name!). These were career-best performances and in smaller parts, Thelma Ritter's cynical, wise-cracking Dresser, Birdie, and Marilyn Monroe's vacuous Miss Caswell, ('a graduate of the Copocobana school of dramatic art'), are just as unforgettable. In the seventies someone had the, not very bright, idea of turning it into a Broadway musical called 'Applause'.

            "content": "When I first discovered this movie, I didn't think I was going to be impressed by it. I thought that a movie with a predominantly female cast would be a recipe for disaster, since there would be no fighting, conflicts, or betrayals. As it turns out though, women are often more cruel and punishing than men when it comes to getting back at their enemies. It seems obvious now that it's a good movie, since it got 14 Oscar nominations, a record at the time, and won 6. It's also the only movie in history to have four actresses nominated for an academy award. With so many awards and positive reviews to its credit, it might seem like a stupid question, but does the movie still hold up? It is a timeless and intriguing story simply because it's very well written. The movie is about a girl named Margo played by Bette Davis. She is widely popular in the world of theatrical performance, but she's looking a little long in the tooth. She worries about how her biological aging will affect her career, and doubts it will be good. One day, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) shows up to Margo's dressing room after one of her performances and tells her how big of a fan she is to the point where Margo thinks she is a bit deranged. Even so, Margo plays nice and lets Eve be a \"friend\" of hers, and Eve eventually goes on to perform in a play that Margo was meant to perform in. A critic watching the play is Mr. DeWitt (George Sanders), and he apparently likes it. Eve and DeWitt form an alliance that is somewhat hostile to Margo, and they openly criticize her for turning a blind eye to young and talented actresses like Eve. Later, Eve takes a role in another play after Margo says she doesn't want it. Eve also wants to marry Margo's friend Lloyd because he can ensure Eve stars in good plays. DeWitt later blackmails Eve because he is convinced she is trying to control him, and insists that he's not foolish. He says he knows her real name is not Eve, but Gertrude Slescynski, and was never married. If Eve tries to marry Lloyd, he will let everybody know these things and she will be done for. At the end, the movie returns to where it started; a ceremony where Eve receives an award, and Margo is in attendance. Despite being there, she does not like Eve in the slightest. Shortly after, it turns out that Eve (now a celebrity) has her own adoring and obnoxious fan named Phoebe. I'm guessing that this ending implies that Phoebe is fated to end up the same way as Eve did when she started idolizing Margo. Eve will act coldly towards her and only pretend to like her, but the naive Phoebe will mistake this for genuine interest. Widely considered one of the best movies ever, it's just obvious after watching it why so many people have this opinion regarding this movie. Pretty much all the characters are brilliantly played, and I don't think Bette Davis needs any introduction. Margo is the type of woman that wouldn't look out of place in a noir movie, as she is ruthless, cunning, and dangerous to those that get on her bad side. Anne Baxter plays Eve, the title character for certain, but I would think Margo is the real main character here. Eve's long journey from a generic nobody to a celebrity is caused solely by Margo's influence, and in the end, Eve discovers she might not enjoy being famous after all. George Sanders plays Mr. DeWitt, who is originally shown to be a sympathetic theater critic who is willing to give the inexperienced Eve some praise, but then shows up later to threaten her with confidential information about her life. He's unapologetic and just doesn't care about her feelings, and I think we can all agree the part where he hits Eve in the face definitely wouldn't be allowed today. Although a very minor character, a young Marilyn Monroe even makes an appearance during one of Margo's parties. To summarize, All About Eve is truly one of cinema's all time classics, and its story is an example of how there is no worse feeling than being hated by someone you look up to.",

But then again one is always reading how today's script's just don't cut it. And one wonders why? Surly today's directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than to see how well they are constructed. And no script was more in it's craft that Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. I could also point out Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and a few others but All About Eve is one one Mankiewicz's best, along with A Letter to Three Wives and the charming People Will Talk. But, as many a poster knows All About Eve garnered 14 academy award nominations, winning 6. Bette Davis was robbed! Sure, Gloria Swanson was dazzling in Sunset Boulevard but she didn't have the competition Miss Davis had in All About Eve. There was Anne Baxter reprising a similar role she played in the 1944 film Guest in the House. And George Sanders playing a variation of his role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think the academy members gave him his award for his magnificent body of work. His award was well deserved. But miss Baxter couldn't hold a candle to Miss Davis who essayed her role in 14 days. And out of sequence. The first scene filmed for the movie was Miss Davis encountering Addison De Witt in the lobby of the theatre. The producers could only get the theatre for a certain time not on it's schedule so did what it had to do. Film that scene. The interior of the theatre scene was filmed at a later date. Many people don't know that Hollywood is a very small town. And the academy award members is not a large body at all, maybe a little over two thousand. But at that time the members had long memories and since Miss Davis was no longer Queen of Hollywood let alone under a contract to a major studio they knew they had no allegiance to her. She had stepped on too many academy members toes, and some still felt the sting. Gloria Swanson, well, she just came out of retirement for this one film and so they felt no allegiance to her, either. Neither studio backed the two stars. And the award went to Judy Holliday for a very boring movie called Born Yesterday. A role that Miss Holliday had performed on Broadway many many time. It's hard to watch Born Yesterday today and you really wonder why the members didn't give the academy award to Miss Davis. All About Eve is a timeless movie, a classic and a gem and the towering performance in the entire film is by Bette Davis. To go further in the case of vendetta, the members did give Katherine Hepburn an award for her unforgettable performance in The Lion in Winter but to make sure Davis couldn't catch Hepburn she got another award for the insipid Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a role not worthy of an academy award. Still, Miss Davis somehow comes out a true winner when all one has to do is to watch All About Eve. We are her academy award.",

The dialogue seems more stagey than natural. The characters don't converse so much as declaim or emote. The dialogue doesn't seem witty as some have claimed, just bitter and cynical (for the most part).The visuals aren't very visual. The shots are mostly ordinary shots of whoever's talking at the moment. There's little character movement. This could easily have been a radio play.The relationship between Margo and boyfriend seems contrived. There's no apparent reason why they should be so attached to each other. It doesn't come across. In fact, they seem quite unattached to each other initially, but the movie changes its mind abruptly in midcourse.I'll confess a bias against actors acting about acting. It's the kind of self-referential, self-reverential stuff that bugs me, like news reporters reporting on each other instead of the news, or playwrights writing plays about plays.

However, after hearing and reading so many rave reviews of this, especially on the IMDb Classic Board, and the fact it was out on DVD, I decided to check it out.I was glad I did. I liked it, thought it was entertaining and worth the 138-minute investment. I still didn't find it as good as advertised - at least for my tastes - but it was still a pretty involving story with good acting. How it could have been up for so many Academy Awards - 14, I believe - is beyond me, however.Neverthess, it's main attribute, as advertised, is the dialog which sparkles with \"intelligence,\" as the Liberal film critic-elitists like to refer to it. It's a \"smart\" comedy, they say from their ivory towers. Make no mistake: the dialog is good, but I've heard just as good from some film noirs and other movies. Movies put more of a premium on that sort of stuff back in the days before computerized special-effects and limited attention spans took over.The best dialog came from George Sanders, playing a sharp-tongued theater critic. Davis was next, which is no surprise. Her career, thanks to her own real- life efforts to get good roles, was doted with characters that had good dialog. This role kept her Hollywood career going as it had been fading as she approached 40 years of age. She was beginning to look older than her years and many times that spelled \"death\" to an actress, but she was not the average actress.The only character in the film I couldn't stand was \"Eve,\" by Anne Baxter, not for her role but for the way she delivered her lines. Baxter didn't do this at first, but as the film went on she kept finishing sentence after sentence with a whisper. It was extremely annoying and affected. People don't talk like that!Overall, for a film dominated by dialog for almost two hours and 20 minutes, it did a great job of holding one's interest. I only found one part that really lagged. It's a good movie - a well-crafted story - but putting in almost-mythical status as one of the greatest of all times, as some have, is a bit exaggerated.",

            "content": "Actors are only as good as the material they must memorize, and here, that material is a combination of silk, satin and only the finest of cotton. Certainly, female leads Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are the epitome of perfection, and dominate everybody around them. Their fellow actors have nothing to gripe about either, hence a total of five acting Oscar Nominations. Every detail in this movie is picture perfect, even if the obvious backdrop of New Haven in one sequence is clearly stock footage and the final sequence drawn out to be a tad long.Davis, in arguably her finest film, is obviously emulating Tallulah Bankhead (no matter whom the original story was based upon), and it is fascinating to watch her go from bitch to saint, as well as the titled Eve (Anne Baxter) go from saint to bitch. Davis's Margo Channing is an extremely complex character, perhaps not as drag-queenish as Tallulah could be, and you will find yourself sympathizing with her as she reaches that difficult age of 40, which she expands on realistically through several philosophical monologues in which she reals the truth about who she really is underneath all the glitz and glamor of Broadway. Underneath all of that sardonic humor is what even Eve describes her to be as a truly great woman.Starting off like a drenched urchin, Baxter makes you pity her, but soon you see where her ambition really lies and how she intends to utilize, throw out and possibly destroy the others around her. But along comes the wait-and-see lion type character played by George Sanders and you know her fall will be swift and destructive, and no matter what happens in her rising career, her true character will end up being exposed for the manipulative passive/aggressive cat she really is.Celeste Holm has the hardest job, making you like her Melanie Wilkes like character without being annoyed by her excessive sweetness. You can see initially why she's fooled by Baxter, and in watching her grow a few claws in the film's second half, you really root for her to aid in Eve's soulful destruction. Thelma Ritter turns a hamburger helper part into steak simply by just being Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe adds sly sensuality to a typical sexpot who happens to have a bit of hidden smarts in that bubble head of hers. It is obvious that there is something very special in her, and it is nice to see her working with Davis, equally as exciting as it was to see her with Barbara Stanwyck a few years later in \"Clash By Night\".Speaking of Stanwyck, there's a very funny reference by cub reporter Barbara Bates in the final scene referring to her and Susan Hayward as actresses from Brooklyn, but \"they're only movie stars\", a reference which reflects the snobbery of Broadway towards movie people. Then men in this film besides the bitchy Sanders (who deservedly won his Oscar) are less showy but they go out of their way to do more than just be a masculine presence on the arms of these colorful females. This could have given the film a camp presence, and it certainly does have that, but there is also a thought-provoking intelligence to it that is mesmerizing.Directing his own script (just as he did the previous year with \"A Letter to Three Wives\" for which he also took home two Oscars), Joseph Mankiewicz instills much unique detail into every segment that the film is truly unforgettable. Delightfully bitchy dialog that has gone down into the screenplay hall of frame is surrounded by some lesser known unknown gems and even in those sequences (such as one where Davis and group all bite viciously into a stalk of celery as a response to Sanders and Baxter's presence at a table near theirs), and everything comes up roses for everybody. You'll cheer for Margo Channing as she learns a major lesson from Eve's scheming, responding in a way that truly makes her a much better person.",

It's also about one of the most villainous characters to appear on a screen, and, yet, to her fans, she is the darling of entertainment. This is about two actresses who are at the top of their games, facing off like a couple of gunfighters or boxers, shadowboxing, waiting for the right moment. The great thing is that Bette Davis's character could be a true victim, but we know enough about her to know she ain't going to take this lying down. She's aware of the betrayal of her kindnesses and the empty flattery of her foe, but she also knows that she isn't dealing with a lightweight. The loaded verbiage, point counterpoint, is just amazing. The younger woman believes that she is the rightful heir to the throne and is willing to do anything. There are numerous supporting characters, who ply their respective trades to this movie, especially George Sanders, who is a master of pomposity, much like Rex Harrison. The movie works at every level, script, pacing, and acting. What more can we ask for?",

I can't find a negative thing to say. It uses flashbacks to tell the story. The plot isn't really a great epic thing. It's about a younger apparently nice women that insinuates herself into an older actress' life and manipulates people to get what she wants, stepping all over them. But what makes it special is that it's like a character study in motion. You see the characters develop as the story develops until it comes full circle right back to the beginning, just before the flashbacks start. The conclusions you drew about the characters at the beginning will be significantly changed by the end.The ending has irony at play, and leaves the viewer satisfied that karmic payback is definitely at work. 10/10",

Mankiewicz / Cast: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill: Fascinating drama about confrontation when Eve Harrington appears backstage to meet Broadway actress Margo Channing. Eventually Eve replaces Channing thus receiving praise once reserved for her. Brilliantly written, and directed with insight by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who touches greatly upon the glam and vanity of being a star. It opens at an award ceremony where facial reactions play the key as to what follows through flashbacks. Bette Davis is remarkable as Channing who is growing older and feels her starlight fading away. Eve is played with great innocence by Anne Baxter whose transformation seems alarmingly true in the business but these decisions also bear consequences as she learns when her hunger for fame runs rabid. Great supporting work by George Sanders as a theatre critic used by Eve for success but perhaps he already knows this drill. Celeste Holm plays the wife of an author who specializes in plays. She discovers Eve thus opening an introduction to Channing. Gary Merrill plays a film director who is also Davis's much younger boyfriend, which also plays into delusional show business relationships. Easily one of the best and most inspiring films of the year. It has terrific art direction and a message about age, entertainment and infinity. Score: 10 / 10",

Celeste Holm \u2014 whom I'm delighted to say is still among the living and working as of 2010, no less \u2014 is indispensable. The demise of Barbara Bates adds a poignancy to the final scene as Phoebe stands before the mirror wanting success \"more than anything else in the world.\" More than anything, a film is its characters. All About Eve exemplifies this by combining perfect casting with writing of the wittiest kind. The Killer to Killer scene where Addison unravels Eve's fictitious life is one of my favorites, period.

            "content": "One really could not ask for a more perfect film. One of the reasons, often neglected today in Hollywood, is that it had a phenomenal script. Such witty, intelligent dialogue. See 100 movies of today, and you won't find its equal. A second reason - a perfect cast. Bette Davis, who filmed her role in a mere 10 days and had to have oil treatments because of a throat problem, is monumental as Margo Channing. It's really a women's picture all the way - Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, Celeste Holm as Karen - these are all strong roles. Though the arch Addison DeWitt is brilliantly played by George Sanders, this role, too, has the feel of a woman's part in its manipulativeness and bitchiness. That may not be very PC to say, but there it is.Of all the scenes, I think my favorite has to be that one that takes place in the theater when Margo arrives very late for the understudy audition. What fireworks, what staging, Bette on the stage, Max and Lloyd yelling from the audience - \"Are you threatening me with legal action...(Bette stomps out cigarette with foot)...Mr. Fabian?\" Fantastic.I take issue with only one point, and it's a small one. Mankiewicz did not want to cast Jeanne Crain as Eve. He didn't think she was a good enough actress. Okay, but I still maintain that in the beginning of the film, Crain's genuine all-American look and real sweetness would have been great and would have given no hint of the Eve to come. I admit that she probably couldn't have pulled off the rest, but for me, Baxter was a fairly obvious conniver. I realized that Mankiewicz has it set up that way, as she interrupts Bill and Margo's kiss, but Crain would have looked innocent as all get-out. Also, Margo's jealousy of Eve and fear that Bill was attracted to her would have been more understandable. Just an opinion.The third reason - A great director. Joseph Mankewicz has written and directed a fantastic film about theater that, 55 years later, not only holds up on its own but has a life of its own. There is today a Sarah Siddons Award, the term \"Eve Harrington\" is used commonly in theater to denote an ing\u00e9nue waiting to pounce on a role; \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night,\" is one of Davis' most famous lines; and, last but not least, it spawned the musical \"Applause,\" which I frankly have never been able to warm up to.

It received 14 Oscar Nominations in 12 categories and won 6 including Best Picture and Director. However, it is much better than that.Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is a waif that is constantly seen waiting outside the theater for her idol Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  When Margo's best friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) invites her in to meet Margo it begins a relationship that is destined to turn into a typhoon.  Margo is taken in by Eve's hard luck story and her obsequious deference, and she decides to employ her as her personal secretary.  With duplicitous and cunning ambition, Eve maneuvers her way into becoming Margo's understudy. Just turning 40, Margo begins to become self conscious about her age and sees Eve as a threat to her career and her relationship with Bill, who is eight years her junior.  The resulting tension between Margo and Eve is electric, with power plays, blackmail and conniving at every turn.John Mankiewicz was one of the most prolific and gifted auteurs of the studio era.  He won back-to-back double Oscars for directing and screenplay in 1949 and 1950 for `Letters to Three Wives' and `All About Eve'.  His accomplishment in this film is gargantuan, with a powerful script and forceful direction of a talented cast.  The dialogue is fantastic, with snide humor and barbed innuendo that cuts like a stiletto.  The scene between Eve and pompous theater critic Addison Dewitt (George Sanders) where he confronts her about her past is like a mating of snakes.The acting is stupendous.  Bette Davis appeared in over 100 films in her 58 year career, nominated for 11 Best Acting Oscars and winning two.  This was one of her very best performances and it escapes me why she did not win the award that year.  Davis is a whirlwind of dramatic power in a riveting portrayal of the tempestuous Margo.  She imbues Margo with a gigantic ego and equally enormous insecurity, which yields some of the best and most bitter tantrum spewing ever been put on celluloid.  Anne Baxter is deliciously evil as Eve.  Her sweet helplessness veils a cold, calculating serpent waiting for her opportunity to strike.The supporting actors were also superb.  George Sanders won a best supporting Oscar for his haughty performance as Addison De Witt.  Celeste Holm was nominated for a supporting Oscar and was terrific as Margo's well meaning, but meddling friend.  One of my favorites was Thelma Ritter (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as Birdie, an unrefined and blunt woman with extraordinary perceptiveness about Eve's true nature.This is one of the best dramas ever made and among my favorite films of all time.  It was rated number 16 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  They don't make them like this any more.  It is required viewing for classic film buffs.",

A shy and naive theatre fan Eve (Anne Baxter) gets the chance of a lifetime to meet her idol, Margo Channing (Bette Davis). Through a few happy coincidences she ends up as Margo's assistant and proverbial lady-in-waiting. But slowly Margo starts to feel jealous towards this quiet and unassuming young lady with many hidden talents.All About Eve is above all else a beautifully acted film. There's only about ten characters in the whole film, but the group's inner dynamics, frictions and squabbles make the two and a half film feel at least an hour shorter. That's how interesting, dynamic and engaging the story and the characters are. Baxter and Davis are both brilliant in their role, although I do like Margo's character arc a bit more. She starts out almost as a Disney villain, lounging on a divan and smirking at Eve's sweet urge to please. But slowly something shifts and you start looking at her with sympathetic eyes. Whereas with Eve the journey is almost backwards.In general All About Eve is one of the better character studies I've seen in a while. To think that they manage to create two such complex women and make their individual journeys so fulfilling, believable and mutually supporting. Not to say the rest of the characters aren't good - they are - but this is clearly Baxter and Davis's show.Not really anything more I'd like to say.

The script has great moments of biting humor and all that, yes, and Joseph Mancewicz's direction is pretty good, too.  But there are plenty of moments when the film simply dissolves into talkiness, and it gets a little slow and boring.  The film is at its best when Bette Davis, giving no doubt her best performance as fading star Margo Channing, really lets loose and lets her costars have it, as in the scene where she fights with Marlowe in the theater.  She is also good when being vulnerable and revealing in some of the quieter scenes, but the talkiness factor does override her a little bit.

There will be spoilers ahead: I admit freely that I didn't fully appreciate this film the first time I saw it, more than 40 years ago. Then, I considered it merely a very good film. Subsequent viewings have caused me to revise those views. Previously, I thought Sunset Blvd. and Born Yesterday were better. My opinions of those two haven't changed, but I now believe that All About Eve is even better than they are.I'm not even going to do a brief summary of the plot, which I would normally do these days in a review like this. But though the plot is quite good and one of the film's virtues, it's secondary to both the dialog and the acting, which take this film from being very good to great.Memorable lines drop like leaves from a tree in autumn in New England. It's one of the most eminently quoted and quotable films ever made. I could have built this review entirely out of the dialog from this film and managed a credible job just by doing that. While all of the significant characters have memorable lines, the character with the most memorable lines is probably Addison de Witt, played marvelously by George Sanders, who deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar-and he may not have had the best performance in the film! Bette Davis, in a tour de force performance as the lead, Margo Channing, walks away with the movie, even as Sanders steals some of their scenes together. Davis had the misfortune of giving what was probably the best performance of her career the same year Judy Holliday did Born Yesterday. Great as Davis was, Holliday was arguably even better.Anne Baxter, as Eve Harrington, was also nominated for Best Actress and two Supporting Actress nods were given to Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter, losing out to Josephine Hull in Harvey. Holm's performance is slightly stronger than Ritter's, mainly because it's a stronger, more thoroughly developed role. Ritter's is primarily that of acerbic, slightly jaundiced gadfly Birdie and is more one-dimensional.I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Marilyn Monroe has a brief but memorable performance as one of Addison's dates. Even her character has a few memorable lines. It's a great script for actors and the actors go to town.This film is available on both Blu Ray and DVD and is well worth having.

I would go with Ritter since she hadn't won and she stands out in the cast here ) A different actress playing Eve might have made it more believable.The ugly: obviously looking at in through the rear view mirror is tricky but the way George Saunders character theater critic Addison DeWitt blackmails Eve makes the skin crawl. Yes Eve was horrible but was she that bad ? Compared with the rest of them? Not so much. She was only mildly a bit worse than most of them and on par with Margo. Addison was the worst. Only Birdie is all that good. The so called scandal is pretty trite even back then and in the entertainment world her scandal from her hometown would blow over by lunch. Her being tied to Addison that way seemed most uncomfortable even frightening.The mixed: the script is sharp with cutting dialogue and observations but the plot is thin and Eve's so called scandal seems pitiful they couldn't come up with something more than an affair with a married boss ? That probably covered most of the people they knew. What if Eve had a child she abandoned? A possible murder suspect? Then your cooking!The questionable: Margo and her fianc\u00e9 are less than convincing and Margo is going to be less ambitious and satisfied with less star status and more of a homebody?It also runs a bit long for what it is ( over two hours) .

As you might hope from such smart people, the repartee is sharp and fast, and the delivery is sharp and fast. Those are two different things--the writing, which is brilliant throughout, and which can afford to be overly flashy because we expect these sorts of actors and writers to be flashy, and the acting, led by Bette Davis.Director and writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz is at the top of his game, and you have a feeling he is dealing with the types of people he knows very well. The plot is actually fairly simple, made complicated by all this great dialog, and a series of small turns of event that never upends the single-mindedness of the young woman played by Celeste Holm. But there is a nuance to it all that you feel in the restraint of Holm's devious character, and in the acknowledgement in others of what they really want in their lives (love), and in the final moments, where bitterness never quite unfolds, and where we see that all the seeming backstabbing is normal somehow, and that if you are being stabbed it is probably because you stabbed someone else. All if fair in the world of theater, as in life at large.If this whole affair sounds like a play, it is played out as one, in a limited number of sets, and often with a handful of actors bouncing retorts and observations around like a volleyball. The one scene out of New York that I remember is actually shot with clumsy backprojection, the single technical flaw of the film, which is otherwise a typical product of the finely oiled Hollywood system of the time. Mankiewicz of course is one of those expert, underrated directors who was less interested in becoming an auteur and more interested in making films in the conventional way, but very very well. All About Eve is a perfect introduction to him, and to Bette Davis, for that matter, in a smaller lead role than many of her films where she looms larger than life. And he often gathers top talent around him, like cinematographer Milton Krasner and music director Alfred Newman.",

There've been a number of films that explore the passion for success on the stage: Stage Door (1937) and A Star Is Born (first made in 1937 and made several times thereafter) being two of the most notable. And, other films have also taken an introspective look at the machinations of the acting profession \u0096 The Player (1992) and even the goofy, but entertaining, Get Shorty (1995).This one, however, is the definitive voyeuristic analysis of why actors will do anything to get to the top, for three reasons. First, it has a script that is flawless in its construction, logic and plot development; to use a hackneyed phrase \u0096 it all hangs together seamlessly, showing \u0096 and telling, with three different voice-overs \u0096 the depths to which some go to reach the heights of narcissistic glory. Second, such a film required a strong hand to keep the actors in check, to prevent it from descending into farce, and that's why Joe Mankiewicz was needed; well, it was his script, anyway \u0096 so who better to direct, with his fine record of films? And, third, the main protagonists: never before, I think, has a script followed so closely the juxtaposition of a true star (Bette Davis) in her waning years, playing an actress in her waning years, and being challenged by a relative newcomer (Anne Baxter), playing a newcomer challenging the aging star. Such delicious irony, I think, is rare to see on screen. Add to that, a collection of actors (George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Celeste Holm, the irrepressible Thelma Ritter) of the time who ably and professionally flesh out a drama about the reality of life in fiction.Perhaps even more interesting than the actual film would have been a documentary filming the action on the sets, as the film was made... One can only dream, I guess, to have been a fly on the wall.A word about the dialog: checking the above link for Quotes, I see that all of the lines I rate as some of the best I've heard, all show up in the list \u0096 which is, also, one of the longest list of quotable film quotes I've seen. If you're hesitating about seeing this film, just scan through those quotes to get a sense of what is in store.As implied, the direction from Mankiewicz and the acting \u0096 particularly Davis, Baxter and Sanders \u0096 are riveting. Bette Davis is the personification of diminishing self-confidence as the onset of age dominates and depresses; Baxter is almost sociopathic in her portrayal of naked ambition disguised as sycophantic concern for one and all, but particularly for those who will advance her ambitions; and George Sanders does give the performance of his career and deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actor. Other actors (Dick Powell or Claude Rains, for example) could have played that role, for sure; Sanders, however, does such a good job, it's a though the character of Addison DeWitt (what a play on word sound \u0096 Addison, the wit and critic, given a name that sounds like a New Yorker's disparaging put-down. Was Mankiewicz having a bit of fun at New York's expense?) morphs into George Sanders completely. And, vice-versa...So, treat yourself to a filmic experience that you'll never see repeated \u0096 for obvious and sad reasons. But also, this type of narrative is long gone from the Hollywood scene: talky movies are box-office death these days, as we all know \u0096 unless you're in a Phone Booth (2002) or on a Cellular (2004).One can only hope that nobody attempts a remake of this masterpiece. Highest recommendation...",

For 47 years EVE held the record for most nominations -- in 1997 Titanic matched the 14 nominations. Bette Davis was awarded the New York Critics Award once in her 58 year career -- and it was for this film. Marilyn Monroe, Thelma Ritter and Celeste Holms gave terrific supporting performances while Anne Baxter kept up with the great Bette every frame of the way. It was Bette's eighth nomination, and sixth loss; Judy Holiday won for Born Yesterday, beating two legends -- Gloria Swanson was also nominated that year for Sunset Blvd. All About Eve was the first film to be released after Bette ended her 18 years with Warner Brothers. For a moment she was back on top of the world, only to find disappointment throughout the 50's with choices and offerings in Hollywood. The writing by Mankiewicz and supporting performance by George Saunders would alone make the film worth viewing -- A NEAR PEFECT FILM!",

Davis was 41, had been in movies for almost 20 years, with almost 60 to her credit, and this movie certainly gave her middle-age career a needed boost. Baxter was in her 20s and compared to Davis really was just getting started. Marilyn Monroe also has a lovely but small role, during the birthday party scene, here 3 to 4 years before she started to hit it big. 'All About Eve' does not come across as a great movie today, 50+ years later, but is a very interesting 2+ hours. Eve has acting in her veins and seems to be willing to do anything to become a star, even selling her soul to the devil.\nSPOILERS follow, please read no further, OK!?What Baxter did so well here is convince us right away that 'Eve' was an actress, and as we see everything anyone ever saw was part of her act. The movie begins and ends with a ceremony, where Eve is receiving an acting award, and the narrator tells us how all this came about. Eve's entre' is her apparent worship of established star, Margo, but she really simply had designs on Margo's life, her men and her roles, first insinuating herself as Margo's understudy. When the equally shrewd person, writer Addison DeWitt, finds out what she is up to, in the end he threatens to expose her series of deceptions, effectively destroying her budding career, unless she 'gave herself' to him, totally. She does, because ultimately her career is the most important thing. She sells her soul, to all the fans and all the media, and DeWitt is the personification of all that.",

            "content": "Based on the story The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr, All About Eve is an elegantly catty backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Tattered and forlorn, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing (Bette Davis), weaving a melancholy life story to Margo and her friends. Taking pity on the girl, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long, it becomes apparent that naive Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodedly uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill), Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap.Also appearing in All About Eve is Marilyn Monroe, introduced by Addison De Witt as \"a graduate of the Copacabana school of dramatic art.\" This is but one of the hundreds of unforgettable lines penned by writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the most famous of which is Margo Channing's lip-sneering admonition, \"Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\" All About Eve received 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Smart, sophisticated, and devastatingly funny, All About Eve is a Hollywood classic that only improves with age.",

            "content": "The story of an actress in decline, past her prime, offered at the last moment to an actress who herself was in decline and past her prime. The parallels between fiction and reality could not have been more blurred as they were during the creation of what has been considered to be one of the greatest movies about the theater and one of Bette Davis' most indelible performances. Starting from the link between Davis and Elisabeth Bergner via a remake Davis acted in 1946 called A STOLEN LIFE -- itself a version previously performed by Bergner, and snowballing into the anecdote that Bergner herself had been the apparent victim of an unusual admiration by a young female actress of whose identity and life little is known (unless you read Sam Stagg's book \"All About All About Eve\"), ALL ABOUT EVE is as interesting -- and at times, even more so -- as to its backstory to what was presented on screen as the final result.By 1949 Bette Davis was strictly on the way out. She had been in a 4-year slump with movies that were failing commercially even when they still got fair to good reviews, with the notable exception of BEYOND THE FOREST in which Davis played a woman much too young for her age and donned a black wig that made her look even older. Many of the roles Davis (later) admitted as to wanting to have played while she was still at Warner Bros. were going to her professional rival Joan Crawford; indeed, Crawford, relegated to second fiddle at MGM with hand-me-down roles Norma Shearer rejected, and coming out of her strong debut at Warner's with MILDRED PIERCE, a role Davis herself rejected and one that gave Crawford her only Oscar win, was now getting the better pictures at Warner's. From MILDRED PIERCE to FLAMINGO ROAD, Crawford was back on top, if at least temporarily so.Such a thing must have made Davis mad. Seeing that the camel's back had been broken with the failure of BEYOND THE FOREST, she was now a free agent, but needed work. PAYMENT ON DEMAND was a mostly forgotten film she'd made which did not receive a release until the 1951, and was so far the only job offer she was getting. The notorious story as to how she got the role of Margo Channing -- where Claudette Colbert sprained her back -- is the stuff of Hollywood legend, but it ensured Davis one more chance to assume a major role in a major movie. What she possibly didn't know was that this would be the one that would define her as a screen icon -- forever she'd be quipped with her most quoted line from this film: \"Fasten your seatbelts -- it's gonna be a bumpy night.\" And she couldn't have foreseen that on set of ALL ABOUT EVE she'd also meet and marry the man who played her lover on screen: Gary Merrill.There is so much that can be spoken about this timeless classic. It's such an iconic movie, a thing of elegant beauty that hasn't been repeated since and one of the most quotable movies of all time. Again, highly recommended and a must-read is Sam Stagg's book which tells everything, down from the casting list for each role (at one point Gertrude Lawrence and Joan Crawford were up for Margo Channing), wardrobe, stories as told by the actors themselves, Celeste Holm's resentment of Davis on the set -- a thing that was probably Davis' fault, since she wasn't known for being social and Holm from then on took great offense and to this day remains offended. And on and on. Snippets of dialog that never made it into the film is presented in the book, and it's understandable: it would have bogged down the story a bit much. (Would it that Mankiewicz had done the same thing with his dialog in CLEOPATRA!) A fascinating book.And a fascinating movie that over a half a century later can still be seen for what it is: a scathing portrayal of backstabbing, backstage, and a complex study of a professional and social climber and what she will do to ensure success. Full of in-jokes that have to be heard to be believed, and one of the oddest pairings of a male-female dynamic in Anne Baxter and George Sanders who play a game of cat and mouse throughout with a terrific, sadistic denouement, it's one of the essentials, a movie that has to be studied in order to admire movies, not because of its visuals -- if anything, ALL ABOUT EVE fails in presenting ground-breaking visuals and opts for a play-like feel -- but for its entirety. Razor-sharp performances from everyone -- ranging from the film's major parts, played by Davis herself, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Gregory Ratoff, Hugh Marlowe, to the minor players -- Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates, and Randy Stuart (or THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN fame).",

            "content": "Bette Davis is just fantastic. I've never been as enamored with an actress, past or present, as Bette Davis. Many male actors have stayed on my radar for years, but Bette Davis is alone among the women. All About Eve tells the story of an aging actress and a young woman that will do anything to take her place. The 1950 film starring Anne Baxter and George Sanders with Davis, was an interesting character study into the lives of those most involved with acting and the theatre. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, All About Eve really delves into the relationships between writers, actors, directors, and those they love exposing the side of the industry, rarely seen by those on the outside.Margo Channing (Bette Davis) is a Broadway star, heavily sought after by the best in the business. Margo has become increasingly concerned with her advancing age. She focuses on aging constantly and is worried her career is on the brink of a plummet. One day, waiting at the stage door of one of Eve's performances, a young girl named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is hoping to meet the star. When she happens upon Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), a member of Margo's inner circle, Eve edges her way in for a meeting backstage with Margo. Eve blows Karen away with her knowledge of Margo's performances, as she has seen every performance of Margo's current play. Eve astounds backstage when she meets director, and Eve's boyfriend, Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill), playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) as she tries to wrangle a spot closest to Margo. After a successful meeting, Eve begins working for Margo and subtly taking apart Margo's life by the seams, all the while looking as if she is simply a doting fan. Eve fools everyone, with the exception of Addison DeWitt (George Sanders). DeWitt can be somewhat ruthless himself but refuses to see Margo be taken down by trusting a fan too much. Addison DeWitt takes control of the situation and keeps Eve under his wing protecting Margo at the same time. After Eve is accepting DeWitt's strong suggestion to vacate, she meets a young woman who calls herself Phoebe, willing to emulate her every move.I've covered the fact that I really enjoy watching Bette Davis. Davis is a one-of-a-kind actress and we really haven't seen one like her since. An ensemble piece, All About Eve boasts brilliant performances from all involved. As wonderful as each performance was, George Sanders was the one that consistently steals the show. Each scene he is in, Sanders is just captivating and by far the standout, for me. The first couple times I watched All About Eve, I found the film nearly perfect. I almost always love ensemble pieces and enjoyed this one each time I watched it. This time, looking at the film as critically as I ever have before, it didn't quite measure up like it has in previous screenings. As exceptional as All About Eve is, it's one that doesn't replicate the initial viewings as well as some other films. Perhaps it's because there's no surprise factor after you see the film once and know what Eve is up to, but this viewing just doesn't measure up as its previous viewings, for me. All About Eve, a wonderful Bette Davis vehicle with a splendid ensemble cast, is still deserving of its status, and a wonderful Best Picture winner.",

Davis plays Margo Channing, who is Eve's role model, a great but now older actress who both affects and is affected by young Eve's career.There is a wonderful collection of characters, each with distinctive and interesting personalities.  Their relationships with each other are fascinating, and the film makes full use of their potential.  The dialogue is terrific, and the cast does it full justice.  The characters and their lines are all perfect for the performers who portray them - George Sanders as the cynical and calculating columnist, Gary Merrill as the high-strung director, Hugh Marlowe as the sophisticated playwright, and so on through the entire outstanding cast.  After watching this movie, whenever you see any of these actors again you may well think of them in these roles.\"All About Eve\" is a testimony to how great a movie can be when it is based simply on the important basics of writing, acting, and directing.

            "content": "In the early 50s, as the old studio system fell into decline, the producer-directors and writer-directors began to muscle in. All About Eve, written and shot by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was one of the first major triumphs of this new breed of filmmaker. Although it is about actresses, in it writers and directors are cynically lauded as those who \"construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it\", while stars are dismissed as \"pianos\" who ought to realise \"they did not write the concerto\". But upon seeing the performances in All About Eve, all one can say is what lights... what pianos! Let's begin with the skillful turns of Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. The styles of these two players, like their characters, are mirror images of each other. Davis, true to type, projects a callous and world-weary exterior, and yet I am struck by the depth and sincerity of her emoting, for example as she listens to Eve's sob story in the dressing room scene, or the tenderness she clearly feels for Gary Merrill. It's a depth that it is essential for her character, and yet sensibly she doesn't allow it to dominate, just letting it shine through at key moments. Baxter by contrast is a model of girlish innocence and boundless altruism, yet beneath the surface shows herself to be a treacherous, cold-hearted lizard of a woman. And like Davis's inner warmth, Baxter only reveals that in brief flashes. Hidden depths are something of a running theme in the acting here. Celeste Holm is ostensibly a naive and trusting figure, yet she expertly lays bare the strength of her character in later scenes. Even George Sanders's trademark suave veneer cracks once or twice, giving way to that sharp end of his cynicism which he normally masked.And yet, these supreme talents of the acting profession have been carefully orchestrated by one who has certainly styled himself a builder of cinematic towers. Mankiewicz was a brilliant arranger of motion pictures, and this was far and away his best effort to date. His direction is subtle on the surface - clear, direct shot compositions with no fancy tricks, an \"invisble\" camera which only moves to follow the actors - but Mankiewicz himself has hidden depths, and the shooting of All About Eve is in truth a work of considerable complexity. Although his aim was to draw attention the players in the foreground, his work is all about backgrounds. Take the opening scene at the awards ceremony. When we are introduced to the central figures, look at how unnaturally still the extras in the background are. It is the equivalent of shooting these principle players against a blank wall. When Eve goes to accept her award the tactic is reversed. The crowd claps excitedly while Davis et al remain eerily motionless. At other times Mankiewicz's use of backgrounds becomes a direct commentary on events, such as the shot of Davis next to a sign saying \"Handle with Care\".And so Mankiewicz is a true \"tower constructor\" of the type described in All About Eve. He is not a show off, and his work though elaborate is all about highlighting the performances and the characters. But it would be doing a major disservice to this wonderful cast to deride them as mere flashing lights, for to quote another picture concerning performance and production, even the most skilled conjurer cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat if there is not already a rabbit in the hat (That's from The Red Shoes, by the way). All About Eve may be shot through with pessimism about the dramatic arts, yet it is the very smoothness of its collaboration - the skill of the tower builders and the brightness of the lights, if you will, both of which are equally important - that make it an engaging and enthralling piece of movie-making.",

Mankiewicz (Guys and Dolls, Cleopatra), I didn't know much about this classic drama, but with a good cast list, I was willing to try it. Basically ambitious Eve Harrington (Oscar nominated Anne Baxter) is very fond of actress Margo Channing (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Bette Davis), and manages to get close to her boyfriend, and her friends Karen Richards (Oscar nominated Celeste Holm) and her play writer husband Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), director Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) and producer Max Fabian (Gregory Ratoff). All the big shots, except for cynical critic Addison DeWitt (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated George Sanders), believing she is only a naive and obsessive fan of Margo's, but Eve is much more cynical, manipulative and conniving than that. Using the lives of Margo and her friends, all along she planned to become an actress, and she achieves her goal of Broadway stardom, leaving a trail of unhappiness for everyone behind her. The end sees her accepting the highest award for any stage performer, and another fan wanting to see the now famous Eve, and it seems, this naive girl may have the same sneaky plans. Also starring Barbara Bates as Phoebe, then rising star Marilyn Monroe as Miss Casswell and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Baxter may not be the conventional wicked witch/bunny boiler/psychopathic bitch villain, in fact, she may not even by the right person for the role, yet even with a few appearances, she is a good light villain. Davis is very good as the emotionally wrecked actress, then little known Monroe makes the most of her few minutes, same goes for Ritter. I can see why critics complained about it being too chatty, and yet it is this, being witty and cynical, that makes the film very watchable.

            "content": "Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve is about as good as a film you can get. Even though the film is more than seventy years old, it remains as timely as ever as it tackle important themes such as aging in Hollywood. Fiction becomes fact as the great, vivacious Bette Davis stars as one of the main leads. This film is an autobiography of hers as much as it is a work of fiction. This is also an actor's film. This remains one of the best acted films I have seen to this day. Perhaps that is what happens when you give these legendary actors such juicy material to work with. Mankiewicz created a film that is bold, timely, realistic, and most importantly entertaining. In my own humble opinion, it is one of the best films that the Golden Age of Hollywood has produced.People often compare this film to a similar film, Sunrise Boulevard (which I still have yet to see but I soon will, I promise). Both films tackle what it is like to age in Hollywood, and both have received top honors. Although this film combats that issue with a more realistic take. No matter how good of an actress someone can be, Father Time does not care. It is especially a brutal occurrence for actresses. There are some quotes here that will stick with me regarding this theme. When Davis's character claimed \"Bill's thirty-two. He looks thirty-two. He looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now. I hate men,\" it really made me think. Men can age gracefully within their careers, but women can be outcasted by the time they turn thirty. In any career really.Mankiewicz heralded from a family of writers. His brother actually wrote the script for a little film known as Citizen Kane. So, this family oozes with talent when it comes to paper and pen. The story came to be in the 1940's when Mary Orr was told a story by theater actress Elisabeth Bergner. She employed a young fan as her assistant but regretted it when she tried to undermine the actress. Mankiewicz wanted to make a film about aging in Hollywood and it so happens he came across Orr's story. He combined this story and his original idea to create one of the best screenplays ever put forth on screen. The characters, Birdie and everyone's favorite film critic Addison DeWitt were Mankiewicz's creations. In addition to aging in Hollywood, some important themes that were tackled were the idea of a traditional housewife (Rosie the Riveter was fresh in everyone's minds) and the powerful film critic who could make or break one's film career.The film begins with a narration by critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) as he begins to talk about the narrative. Margo Channing (Bette Davis) is a major theater star but is happening to grow older. She has a steady relationship with director Bill Simpson (Gary Merrill) and is dear friends with playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) and his wife Karen (Celeste Holm). Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) enters the picture as a huge fan of Margo's. She becomes her assistant and eventually her understudy. It goes bad for Margo when she misses a show which allowed DeWitt to hand Eve great reviews and criticizes aging actresses. It gets worse when Eve tries to force Karen to give her the leading role in Lloyd's new play. Sooner than later, Addison is aware of Eve's schemes and lies that may or may not end Margo's career.This kind of screenplay is heaven for actors/actresses, which is why Davis knew she needed this role when she read the script. Her character is essentially a version of herself, so it is not hard to see when people claim this is her best performance. I loved her performance and that of Anne Baxter's. Baxter was always a supporting actress, so this was her time to take the spotlight. Her character seemed so innocent in the beginning, so color me surprised when her character took a nosedive for the worst. George Sanders was magnificent as DeWitt, and he had a memorable monologue in which I will never forget (and probably that won him the Academy Award). Celeste Holm is fantastic as Karen who is essentially the traditional housewife. Same as Thelma Ritter who plays Birdie, the caretaker who was suspicious of Eve from the getgo. Finally, you may recognize the very young Marilyn Monroe. This is one of the early films that got her started. Her role is brief, but it will not be missed.All About Eve won Best Picture of 1950 and it deserved every accolade. This is about as close to perfection you can get. Led by Bette Davis and George Sanders, these are performances that are unforgettable and timely. Mankiewicz's script and direction are also powerful factors that carry the film. This is one of those films that were produced during the Golden Age of Hollywood that needs to be seen immediately. It is that kind of film!My Grade: A+",

            "content": "Most film buffs know that Claudette Colbert was originally slated for the leading role of Margo Channing--but following a back-injury was replaced at the last minute by Bette Davis, whose career had been in the trash can since her departure from Warner Brothers. By most accounts the set was unusually explosive, with Davis proving as temperamental as the role she played and directing most of her fury at co-star Celeste Holm. But as they say, what counts is what you see on the screen, and ALL ABOUT EVE emerged as one of the most honored films of all time, racking up an unheard-of number of awards with its poisonously witty tale of an insecure, aging Broadway star (Davis) whose life and career are slowly consumed by a seemingly devoted but secretly calculating fan (Anne Baxter.)In some ways the film has not worn as well as you might expect: seen today, the construction seems a bit clunky, the plot is improbable, and the film as a whole feels overlong--not to mention a scene in which Davis delivers a \"what is a woman without a man\" monologue sure to give every feminist viewer an extreme case of acid indigestion! But the razor sharp script offers a showcase for a cast of brilliant artists at the height of their talents, and they skate across the screen with such exceptional skill that all criticism seems negligible.Although actors Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and a superlative George Sanders give the performances of their career, the emphasis is on the ladies, and in them ALL ABOUT EVE is remarkably blessed. After seeing the film it is completely impossible to imagine any one except Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and Celeste Holm in the roles of Margo, Eve, and Karen, and even the small parts of the backstage attendant Birdie and the showgirl Claudia are played by Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe with such brilliance that they become as memorable as the leads. The result is like acid-etched crystal: hard, sharp, and brilliant from top to bottom. One of the great classics. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "All About Eve is written with a consistent attention to stylization and lyrical perfection given to its dialogue. Whether it is truly realistic or blatantly theatrical is not a decision between a flaw and a pro, but between the nature of dialogue that is normally striven for by a logical writer and what could be beyond that nature and perhaps some new, inventive little flare, something to keep the audience determinedly on their toes. The film is loaded, and neatly limited modestly at the brim, with powerhouse scenes of dialogue, be they fiery arguments between infamous flamethrower Bette Davis and a co-star who dares to match her or dangerous, hardly predictable scenes tossed with threats and lies between others. To me, beyond the cast, beyond the direction, beyond the atmosphere of the scenery and cinematography, director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script is what makes this movie the powerful light-refracting gem that it is.I will admit that this is my first Bette Davis film. I had never seen a performance by her before this film. I believe she has a mixture that always turns me on to an actor actress, a mesh of an extroverted, active, dynamic quality that allows them to act upon people and surroundings extremely quickly and with no inhibition and an intuitive, deeply emotional characteristic that may even negate the shallow emotional characteristic of the aforementioned quality, revealing a penetrating insight into people. Davis conveys this in the least challenging and most entertaining way, which is by playing herself, which is perfectly fine by those who judge that sort of thing because that is truly what was required of the role. She is not the light-refracting beauty one expected from a star actress in the silver screen era, but I believe she was still an untouchable star not only because of pure confidence but confidence so solid that one like Joan Crawford who would attempt to tamper with it would be thrown back as if it were a forcefield. What presence she has.Anne Baxter plays the title character, a character who is supposed to be Bette's match. As an actress, Baxter could never match Bette. Where Bette is completely natural in every way on screen, Baxter is not at all. Baxter looks and feels staged to us, because she endlessly stares off into nothing whenever she is speaking, and no matter how interesting she makes her monologue, she still unrealistically stares, and sometimes leans, into space. However, her saving grace is how beautifully she executed the very difficult and tricky role she played. Eve is a person who can never appear to be doing what other characters suspect that she's doing, and even more, she can never appear to be the sort of person that would ever feel inclined to do what they suspect that she is doing. She is the most secretive sort of mysterious personality, quite insightfully captured by the screenplay, which I once again complement, and also fleshed out very effectively by Anne Baxter, who despite her hopeless overtheatrical habits completely becomes Eve.The cast is consistently great. Celeste Holm as a playwright's housewife, a very honestly written character, is very effective in her fleshing it out. Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all very entertaining and likable. The doosie is Marilyn Monroe, who even with her few minutes on screen is very wooden. The outstanding man in the film is George Sanders, who plays theater critic Addison De Witt, one of the most intelligent and refreshingly practical and analytical characters I've seen in a movie. He is introduced as simply another one of the many people we will be seeing in the social circle of the film's main characters, even through the story he is partially narrating. Yet he slowly grows to be something more, and we are surprised to see the full extent of what his character is significant for. Sanders has a scene where he is disturbing and vindicating to us at the same time.All About Eve is full of what so many people don't seem to realize can be the most satisfying and fascinating quality a movie can have, in its writing, in its actors, in its direction, in its detail, and that is a razor wit to wield. It has all different brands of smarts, and we need more films like it today.",

            "content": "Good dialog, very good acting (particularly by Davis and Sanders), but a premise that isn't all that realistic; Baxter runs off from some small town with stolen money, then plans to get close with Davis by seeing all her performances in a play! Once that is achieved, the extension of the plan is to study and brown-nose Davis and play a goody-two-shoes innocent until her big break arrives as an actress. And the far-fetched thing is that it all works! We aren't even sure that Baxter has any real experience in acting. It would be one thing if she made it overnight in a movie, but in theater?? Sure, she knows the lines by heart, having seen the play a zillion times, but to be so good the first time in a major role?! Quite far-fetched, especially for a drama.As one can plainly see, the plot is very much Hollywoodized in the moronic old-school sense, but the theater setting is a good idea as it presents a variety of characters and twists. Some twists aren't very credible; 1) Baxter's blackmail plan doesn't hold much weight, but it seems to be enough for Holm; 2) Sanders's blackmail of Baxter has much more weight admittedly, but since she is planning to make it in Hollywood wouldn't her native town folk recognize her and thereby force all the filth in her past to swim up to the surface? But okay, the latter blackmail, all in all, has plenty of credence.Though interesting throughout in spite of its length, the movie is universally overrated. So much so, in fact, that one famous salivating male film-critic even praises Monroe's acting! To actually mention HER performance, what with all those other good actors and the much more relevant characterizations, is to truly get carried away with the male hormones. (\"Yes, yes...! Even the extras are great! The way that man walks down the street in scene no.235 in the lower-left corner of the screen... Amazing!\") Monroe's appearances are few and brief, and her affected acting is totally out-of-place. She is a feather-weight among heavy-weights. I have to add even that as far as looks are concerned Monroe is totally overshadowed by Baxter's beauty. Even Davis's charisma overshadows Monroe's looks. Monroe is no beauty here, probably due to the fact(?) that this movie was shot before she had all that facial surgery.

On a casual viewing, \"All About Eve\" may seem like an unlikely candidate for great film status: it's not epic in scope, it's not even about any \"big\" issue, and, Davis aside, it's not full of above-title stars. But each time I watch it, I'm more impressed with how rich a movie it is. It's perhaps the one film I've seen that comes the closest to being able to do what a novel can do: develop full, psychologically complex characters whose inner thoughts you can read, even though they're never (or rarely) directly stated. This film is a monument to screen acting. Not one actor hits a wrong note (though Baxter is occasionally over the top). And the writing is as sharp as writing ever gets, with one quotable line after another firing off the lips of the actors without giving the audience a chance to catch its breath.Even though it's about the theatre, one has to believe that \"Eve\" is really more about Hollywood and the business of film making. A group of show biz veterans who helped the art form grow up have to sit back and watch the business taken over by a younger set with ideas of their own. Never before have I seen assembled for a film a cast with more chemistry than the one here; it practically makes the screen sizzle whenever all of them are on it together.\"All About Eve\" is a totally adult, fairly cynical film produced at a time when many films felt it necessary to tack on hokey happy endings no matter how unbelievable they might be, or spell out the film's message with a bullhorn and a neon sign for an audience the film makers obviously didn't think were savvy enough to get the message on their own. Come to think of it, \"Eve\" stands apart from the majority of films released today that are still being made for the lowest common denominator. A truly great film and one not to be missed.Grade: A+",

            "content": "\"All About Eve\" is the kind of movie that blows your mind, not because of special effect or something like that, but because of what movies are all about, a great direction, a great screenplay, and great acting.Stage star Margo Channing(Davis) is friend to playwright Lloyd Richards(Marlowe) and his wife Karen(Holm), in love with director Bill Samson(Merill), and the idol of Eve Harrington(Baxter) who becomes her secretary-aide. Eve begins to dominate: she sends Bill Margo's birthday wishes and arranges a party for him, at which point Margo explodes. Eve becomes Margo's understudy and, when Margo misses a performance, critic Addison DeWitt gives her rave reviews while making acerbic remarks about aging actresses like Margo.In it's first scenes, you can see an unusual style in this kind of movie, and it doesn't look old, even nowadays. The plot is not very entertaining, but the dialogues and the acting grabs your attention, and some quotes leave you speechless to describe how good they are, and it's memorable scenes, like the dialogues between Eve and Bill about the theater, and the last scene, which is probably the best one, are awesome.The acting is almost perfect by all it's cast, except for Marilyn Monroe's short appearance, that with three or four lines, can show that she is not in the same acting level of the rest of the cast. Bette Davis is what really stands out (Although George Sanders as DeWitt is almost as good as her), she's funny, and know where to show her emotions, and when to hide it.Verdict: Almost everything works, and it's a classic that should not be missed.",

Instead they came up with a near masterpiece.Two things make the difference: (1) the gongoristic script, and (2) the glistening performances.You've never heard such dialog. \"You're maudlin and full of self pity. You're magnificent.\" But a thousand examples wouldn't do the script justice because it's all of a piece. It was written -- some might argue aptly \"overwritten\" -- by Joe Mankewitz and directed by him as well. For a few years he was all over the place, but he never turned out anything else like this film. Nobody could. It's unique.All of the performances are adequate and most of them are more than that. I had a little trouble with the Eve Harrington character, played by Ann Baxter. She seemed out of her depth somehow, which was a shame because she's one of the central figures. She's a likable and attractive woman and the grand daughter of Frank Loyd Wright or somebody, which is all for the good, but her breathlessness limits her range. Hugh Marlowe is better than usual. Marilyn Monroe is indescribable and has some of the funniest lines. The rest of the cast is superb. Gary Merrill's baritone is reassuringly masculine. Bette Davis gives a Saturday Night Live imitation of Bette Davis with her broad gestures and husky voice projecting to the balconies. Celeste Holm is so damned sweetly likable without being a stunning beauty or a bravura actress. Her devotion to Davis is solid without being stolid, just what the role calls for. Perhaps best of all is George Sanders. Great name for the character too -- Addison DeWitt. Addison, as in \"adder.\" Twice he's referred to as \"venomous.\" Okay, the dialog and performances are overblown, but unashamedly overblown -- \"I am once again available for dancing in the streets.\" Almost every line is equally juicy and ripe.In a way, \"All About Eve\" is what used to be called a woman's picture -- all that jealousy and backstage intrigue revolving around publicity, age, beauty, and men. Davis has a rather lengthy stint of monologue in which she discuss womanhood as a career. And the men are, frankly, all dummies except for Sanders who may or may not be gay. I only mention the possibility because he's the only man who really understands what these babes are up to. The other men -- even the reassuringly baritoned Merrill -- are as manipulable as Play-Do, but not Sanders. He smirks with his secrets throughout the movie until he cashes his knowledge in at the end. Actually, without wanting to be accused of stereotyping, the movie should have a good deal of interest for the gay community. It's got all the icons. Bette Davis at her bitchiest, the fear of aging and losing one's beauty, the skewering insults, the toughness under the froth and lace.I do kind of wish that Thelma Ritter hadn't disappeared half way through the movie, like King Lear's fool. I missed her a lot.It's curious that the agents of social control objected to a scene in which Betty Davis smokes a cigarette in bed. It sets a dangerous example. There was some static too over Gregory Ratoff's eructation after a glass of baking soda. Presumably, this might set a bad example as well. Before you know it, everyone will be burping and even children will take up the filthy habit. And of course married couples had to be shown in twin beds. Curiously, there was never a peep out of the censors about the brutal beatings and lethal shootings that were everyday fare in films of the period. Smoking is out, but killing is okay.Anyway, see this. There's nothing else quite like it, especially now, when the art of speech seems to have been pretty much lost in American movies. I can visualize it now, Mankewitz presenting this literate script to a committee of MBAs and having them brush it off -- \"too talky.\"",

            "content": "\"All About Eve\" was the Big Film of 1950. It was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for a record 14 Academy Awards, a feat which has since been matched (by \"Titanic\" in 1997) but never bettered. Of those fourteen nominations it won six categories, including Best Picture. And yet it is a film completely different in style to anything likely to win Best Picture today. It perhaps illustrates the changes in film-making which took place during the second half of the 20th century better than any other Big Film of its era. Indeed, it is very different to most other Best Picture winners of the 1950s. It is not a light-hearted musical like \"An American in Paris\" or \"Gigi\" or an action film like \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" or \"Ben-Hur\". It is made in the \"filmed theatre\" style of cinema, the sort of film which was shot in the studio and concentrated on dialogue and character development rather than physical action. (Such films were usually, although not always, made in black-and-white rather than colour). This was the sort of film which had dominated during the thirties and forties but which began to lose favour in the fifties as the studios demanded more in the way of spectacle. The film is set in the world of the theatre and reflects the mutual antipathy between Hollywood and Broadway at this period, something also referred to in \"Singin' in the Rain\" from two years later. Both leading characters are female. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, a leading Broadway star- hugely popular, but beginning to show her age as she approaches forty. (Rather pointedly, her current play is titled \"Aged in Wood\"). Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, an obsessive young fan with theatrical ambitions herself. After Eve is introduced to the older woman, Margo befriends her, and offers her a job as her assistant. Eve initially seems well-intentioned and helpful, but it soon becomes clear that she is using Margo to further her own ambitions. \"All About Eve\" remains the only film ever to receive four female acting Oscar nominations. (Besides Davis and Baxter for Best Actress, the others went to Celeste Holm, who plays Margo's close friend Karen Richards, and Thelma Ritter as her maid Birdie for Best Supporting Actress). Despite this galaxy of female talent, however, the only acting award it actually won went to George Sanders as Best Supporting Actor. Sanders plays the gossipy, spiteful and sarcastic theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who both acts as the film's narrator and also plays an important role in the action. \"Addison DeWitt\", actually, sounds a much more plausible name for an American than for an Englishman- Sanders makes no attempt to hide his British accent- but the name seems to have been chosen symbolically, \"Addison\" being a reference to the eighteenth-century critic and \"DeWitt\" presumably a pun on \"the wit\". The role of Margo has become so closely associated with Bette Davis that it seems strange to think that she was not the first choice for it. Claudette Colbert was cast in the role, but had to withdraw with a back injury, and several other actresses were considered. Davis, however, was precisely the right choice to play the ageing Margo. (Coincidentally, \"Sunset Boulevard\", probably \"All About Eve\" 's closest rival for \"Best Picture\", is also about an ageing actress). In her youth in the 1930s, Davis was considered a beauty, known for her large, limpid eyes, but by 1950 her looks had faded although she was only in her early forties. (Colbert was five years older but looked much younger). She delivers what has become a legendary performance- arrogant and bitchy, yet also vulnerable to Eve's scheming in the battle of youth versus age. The film did much to re-establish Davis's career after something of a slump in the late forties. This film changed the way in which I regarded Anne Baxter. I had previously seen her as primarily a supporting actress, someone who only achieved leading lady status in films like \"I Confess\" or \"The Ten Commandments\" where the emphasis is much more on the male characters. Here, however, she emerges as a real star in her own right and gives a great performance as the cunning, manipulative Eve. (She also look stunning with that short, boyish haircut, something not all actresses could have pulled off). I can well understand why she insisted on being Oscar-nominated for \"Best Actress\", even though she might well have won for \"Best Supporting Actress\". In the event she and Davis both lost out to Judy Holliday in \"Born Yesterday\"; as I have never seen that film I will not comment on the wisdom of the Academy's decision. Holm and Ritter are also very good, and there is a brief but vital contribution at the end from Barbara Bates, an actress I had not previously come across. I will not enter into the controversy about whether both Eve and Addison are supposedly gay, except to say that this was not an interpretation that occurred to me, and that Eve's predatory designs on Margo's boyfriend Bill argue against it. There are films from this era, such as \"Caught\" and \"Strangers on a Train\", which strike me as having a possible homosexual subtext, but this is not one of them. \"All About Eve\" is not, officially, a comedy, but it has a brilliantly witty script, written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with far more wit and humour than many so-called comedies, and manages to combine that wit with a gripping psychological drama and some first-class acting. It is a long time since I last saw \"Sunset Boulevard\", so will not attempt to compare the two directly, but both must count among the finest films not just of the year but also of the decade. 9/10",

            "content": "Joseph L. Mankiewicz, it should be noted with All About Eve, shows how good a screenwriter he is. He's very good, almost too good if that's possible. It's such a richly textured script with its dialog and plot turns, its evolving and revealing characters that reveal through their distinct personalities, that it almost becomes too much of a good thing. In a way the script reminds me of the main star character of All About Eve, Margo played by Bette Davis, who knows she's good and is almost arrogant in its flamboyance (if not quite as insecure in comparison). This isn't as a put-down per-say; the film overall is one of those smashingly entertaining mainstream Hollywood classics, a less weird and noirish take on somewhat similar material as Sunset Blvd. If I won't immediately want to re-watch All About Eve as much as I would Sunset Blvd, it would still remain something I'd recommend in a heart beat to an aspiring movie buff.Especially if one wants to see Bette Davis movies. This is possibly her quintessential performance, full of fire and bravado and put-ons and tears and slight little motions with her eyes that tell more than other actors can do in an entire scene as usual. She embodies this character while still coming off as a real star herself, and giving a great performance. On top of her (appropriately) stealing the show in every scene she's in- even that quiet scene between her and Celeste Holm- Anne Baxter shows her up in a more subtle turn as the title character (the only one of the principles without some narration), since she does has a transformation that we can guess will happen but comes around somewhat unexpectedly. It would've been poetic irony had she won the Oscar, considering how her character winds up, but on its own it's one of her most incredibly touching and dangerous characters.The beauty as well with All About Eve is that it transcends what could have been just a (in quotes) \"chick flick\". It has backstabbing and double-crossing, second guessing and secrets withheld, high and tense emotions, and just the real full-on presence of mature and tough female actors. It could fall in to the traps of convention, but even when it feels familiar it's never boring, it's never too contrived where it distracts from the flow of the story or character dynamics, the supporting performances from female and male performers (notably Thelma Ritter and George Sanders) surprise and hold up their own with the stars, and it's cool for just about anybody (it's not like, for example, certain other Bette Davis pictures that seem much more skewed for female audiences). It's both terrific theatre and finely staged film-making, without pretension but delivering one of those final shots that is right up there with Sunset Blvd.Bottom line, I won't put All About Eve in my top ten favorites of all time, but most scenes are unforgettable as far as classic Golden-age Hollywood goes.",

This is one of the film legends that show what Hollywood film-making is truly all about.Davis gives one of her best performances ever as the ageing stage actress Margo Channing. Margot is pretty cosy in her nest with her circle of friends until an ambitious young woman, Eve, comes along. One might say that as Margo, Davis was simply playing herself. There is a lot of truth in that, as Margo's barbed sense of humour, neuroticism, warmth and professionalism are typical Davis qualities. Davis is simply brilliant in this role, as is Anne Baxter. A sorely underrated performer, Baxter definitely tops Davis for sweet cunning and measure as Eve.And the supporting cast...how fabulous are they? We have the great George Sanders as Addison de Witt, the cynical theater critic. Addison's the only one not fooled by Eve's plans, and delivers most of the sharpest lines in the film. Sanders oozes both charm and venom in a role that won him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Celeste Holm is much better here than in Gentlemen's Agreement, as Margo's best friend Karen. Her warmth and understated performance works well with Davis' paranoid theatrics. Delightful Thelma Ritter is just priceless as Birdie, and Gary Merrill is fine too, as Davis' beau (they were married in real-life at the time of making the film). Maybe the only downer is Hugh Marlowe, who has about as much screen presence as a cardboard box.Check out a young Marilyn Monroe in a small role as a would-be starlet who has been taken under Addison's wings. She gets some good lines as the dumb blonde she would be destined to play over and over again later years. Is it pure coincidence that Monroe gets the lines that parody Gable? Marilyn, as Norma Mortensen in younger years, idolised Gable as the perfect father figure. There's plenty of other occasion for name dropping in this film, with Fox stars Tyrone Power and Gregory Peck getting a mention, too. Smart marketing ploy, actually.There is a never a dull moment or spare scene in this film. It is rather long for a comedy-drama, but that just means more wit and humour can be added. Perfectly directed, this is one of the best satires of the acting industry you'll ever see. It also deals with universal themes ; ageing, ambition, deceit, the abuse of trust etc.Very entertaining 10/10.",

            "content": "Bette Davis is so effortless and breathes fire in her performance as Margot, an aging actress who finds herself slowly and insidiously being usurped by a young fan, Eve, played by Anne Baxter. I don't think it's in a 'best ever' type of discussion, or worthy of its 14 Academy Award nominations, but its sharp dialog, predatory manipulation, and overall bitchiness make it entertaining, even if it's hard to like the characters. There are some great lines here; in addition to the famous \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night\", I loved it when Davis exclaimed \"I'm not twenty-ish, I'm not thirty-ish. Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. 4-0. That slipped out. I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off.\" Davis herself was 42, and this line and others ring true. George Sanders (as Addison DeWitt) is also fantastic, at one point saying \"You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I. We have that in common. Also, a contempt for humanity, an inability to love and be loved, insatiable ambition, and talent. We deserve each other.\"These quotes capture the spirit of the movie, which to me is simply about the difficulties that aging women face, and the cold and calculating world of the theater. There is supposedly a homosexual element, a theory put forth and apparently confirmed by writer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but it's so subtle, perhaps because of the Hays Code, that it didn't even register with me, and I think it's irrelevant. These characters are in the best cases rough around the edges, and in the worse, simply awful people. We see Margot being slowly replaced and want to feel sympathy for her, but it's tough because she's so abrasive. We see the evil side of Eve slowly unveil itself as it becomes apparent she's far from being a starstruck fan or even who she says she is. And at the end we see that she, too, will be replaced. It's all a bit grim: time, a machine that grinds them down, and competition for glory that leads to Machiavellian backstabbing. It's ironic that Davis was such a diva that there was discord amongst the actors, and Baxter pushing her way into a 'Best Actress' nomination instead of 'Best Supporting Actress' would lead to a division of the vote and neither of them winning. I was happy to see Marilyn Monroe in a small part at age 24 and before she was big, just to bring some lightness into the film. This is certainly a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not one I'd watch again and again as I would my favorites.",

That woman was a real dog.And if \"All About Eve\" was really supposed to be a realistic, behind-the-scenes look at the NYC Theatre Set (of the early-1950s), then working in that environment truly must've been one of the most horrible places in the entire world to be employed.I thought that all of the hate, the jealousy, the treachery, the back-stabbing, and the sneering cynicism that certainly prevailed throughout \"All About Eve\" to certainly be enough to cure anyone (in their right mind) of ever wanting to pursue a career in this line of work - Ever. But, with that said - Are actors really considered to be in their \"right mind\" in the first place? Anyway - Even though this 65-year-old, b&w movie had its fair share of good points, as well as its not-so-good points, I still say that it was well-worth a view in spite of its flukes and flaws.*Trivia Note* - I think it's kinda interesting to note that actress Anne Baxter was the grand-daughter of famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright.",

            "review_title": "If Only the Walls Could Talk!",
            "content": "All About Eve is a delectable comedy from the pen of Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who also directed, and those who like movies that talk will be in heaven with this one. It's nearly all talk; much of it gossip, or things that will be gossiped about later; and there's scarcely any action at all. Yet it's visually pleasing, and stylishly photographed in grayish tones, taking place in backstage dressing rooms, apartments, restaurants, beds, sofas, and in one memorable scene, in the backseat of a car that has run out of gas.\nAging actress Margo Channing befriends a waif-like young woman whom she eventually hires as a girl friday, to help her around the house, schedule appointments, and in general assist her in her busy life. The young woman, Eve, is a schemer, with an eye on a career as an actress, and she uses Margo as her stepping stone to better things. As things develop, Margo catches onto her tricks, but by this time Eve has already finagled a role in a play, and before long Eve is herself a star. Such are the bare bones of the story. But getting there is half the fun, and how Eve achieves her goals is what the movie is about. The old chestnut of whether movies are about talk or action is exploded in All About Eve. For Mankiewicz, talk is action, and his characters use words like swords. Each scene features people engaging in verbal jousting, not to the death but for the fun of it. I can't think of a single line that falls flat, though when a character in an early scene carries on about how the theatre is everywhere (in a flea market, etc.), one senses Mankiewicz overreaching himself, aiming for an effect, part G.B. Shaw, part Rod Serling, that comes across as strained. Bette Davis, as Margo, is superb. Margo is bitchy, brilliant, insecure, self-pitying, and always deeply human, and Davis manages to breath life into the character, never allowing us, amid the merriment, to lose sight of the pathos of her situation, which is that of a middle-aged woman who has been able to have a ball all her life who must learn for the first time to be sincere, to deal with what's really on her mind. There's more to life than being a star. Margo knows that, and is trying to come to terms with this even before Eve enters the picture. As far a Eve is concerned, stardom is everything. She admires Margo as a star, could care less for her as a person. Anne Baxter plays Eve with a kind of controlled ham that's very effective. I find her far more convincing with the bark off than on, however, as in her early scenes she's comes off as disingenuous. As Margo's best friend, Karen, Celeste Holm is a nice mix of the catty and the upright. She's in the theatre but not of the theatre, and has a knack for playing second fiddle to others, not always successfully as things turn out. As her playwright husband, Hugh Marlowe gives a solid, unimaginative performance, right for the movie though unconvincing as the real thing. Gary Merrill's more lively as Margo's director-lover, bringing his trademark warmth to the part. George Sanders is brilliant as the caustic critic, the wonderfully named Addison De Witt, giving his lines (some of the best in the movie) a Shavian spin. Thelma Ritter is a delight as Margo's dresser, Birdy, delivering her lines with briskness combined with streetwise cynicism, an underling more than capable of standing up to her boss.Wordy though it is, All About Eve is fun to watch. Mankiewicz was nothing if not a skilled film-maker, and he sets up his scenes pictorially in order to make the verbal and visual mesh. He seems to have lost this talent later on, or at any rate he didn't develop it. In this film, we see Mankiewicz in all his glory. There are scenes that play as well for the way they look as the way they sound. Margo's dressing room is a wonderful creation all by itself, with its clutter and secret places. If only the walls could talk! In a Mankiewicz world they would talk, and what tales they'd tell.",

            "content": "It always astonishes me that everyone is so overwhelmed by Bette Davis as Margo Channing in this superb and witty film about the theater. Davis, in real life, WAS Margo Channing--it was no great stretch for her to play this part. Furthermore, co-stars report that she was sometimes every bit as rude and bitchy as many of the parts she played--so much so that Celeste Holm refused to speak with her except on camera and poor George Sanders was subject to her rage at a party after he won his Oscar. When she turned her back on him, he purred over her shoulder, \"What's the matter, Bette, sour grapes?\" She spun around and spit at him! So the part of Margo Channing fit her like a glove--totally self-absorbed and egotistical about her own talents and overly temperamental in an actressy sort of way. The real stars, in my opinion, are Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm who inhabit their roles in such a way that they are brilliant. Baxter--even Davis admits--had the most difficult role to play and she plays the calculating Eve with great restraint (a word not in Davis' vocabulary). My favorite moments in the whole film are the post-Award dinner scene in Eve's apartment, after Margo has told her \"You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.\" Enter young actress, Barbara Bates, another \"Eve\" who worships the actress. The scene where she drapes Eve's cape over her shoulders, Sara Siddons Award in her hands, admiring her reflection in a three-paneled mirror while the main theme builds majestically, makes an unforgettable climax to an unforgettable film. Everyone makes the most of the ripe dialogue--and another real treat is seeing Marilyn Monroe, shining like a beautiful beacon in a small but cleverly written role--one couldn't help feeling she would soon be on her way to major stardom--she glowed. So does the film. A real treat--but remember, here is Bette Davis playing Bette Davis--no real stretch in that.

It's a film about the business. We just saw Birdman this past year win Best Picture and Eve was no different. Not to say it doesn't deserve it, but I think the Academy has a soft spot for those type of films. With that being said, All About Eve is a really good film. In fact, as far as I can remember this was the first major female driven film that won a ton of Oscars, though I don't think any of the actresses won their respected categories.I really loved the way the story was told. You see where it ends up, with Margo being disgusted of Eve for some reason, and Karen being somewhere in between. How did the relationship become so sour? And how does Eve, an unknown actresses, get honored? Well it's all so wonderfully told in the next few hours. I have to give major props to all the actresses. Whether it was Bette Davis' Margo, the heart and soul of the film and gives the performance of a lifetime. Or Anne Baxter, the sweet but manipulating Eve Harrington. Or even Marilyn Monroe who has a small role but is great as Miss Casswell. You can already start to see her charm on screen. The Margo-Eve apprentice storyline didn't become apparent to me till the it did for the actual characters. But it all made sense once it did, and you probably see this type of thing happen in real life more than you may think. George Sanders, who plays Addison was the major standout for the guys, but also because of that Shere Khan voice.This sort of story is timeless. The beloved actress is overtaken by someone much younger and more fit to the part, while behind the scenes issues ensue. It's funny because the story is about a play, but the story could really bode well for a play. It's also a very satisfying story. Especially when Barbara Bates' Phoebe rolls around towards the end.

            "content": "\"All About Eve\" is a mildly entertaining story that is well acted but which ultimately suffers from its own deleterious content and messaging. This problematic story and content caused me to somewhat dislike this film, much in the way I felt about \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" (see my previous review). Both films feature a creepy psychopathic main character who effortlessly moves up in the world without compunction. Both characters are shown to face no repercussions for their actions as well. The improbability of this and the lack of a moral ending are troubling to me and cause this film to seem like a celebration of bad behavior in the entertainment industry rather than a more needed critique or satirization of it.I had heard \"All About Eve\" was a classic so I figured I'd watch it at least once. I had thought that Bette Davis' character (Margo) was the witch-like villain but much to my surprise she was about the only decent and likeable character in the film. Though Marilyn Monroe had a nice small role which featured her good comedic timing and delivery (she would have been good in a sitcom). But the pretentious playwright, wife, director, critic, understudy, etc. Are all insufferable and awful, featuring the worst New York and the entertainment industry have to offer. Again, the screenplay is lacking, it lauds where it should lambast. It celebrates the seedy underbelly which is akin to putting lipstick on a pig.The writer and director view their actors condescendingly, as props and puppets at their disposal, incapable of adding artistic value. And worst of all, these props have the gall to age, as humans do. Thus the actors are dehumanized, devalued, and ageism is enacted (especially against women). Unfortunately poor Margo ends up marrying a man whose love for her is dubious at best. Also sadly the young Eve lies her way to the top, exploiting and she herself becoming exploited, sexually we presume by the critic. And finally at the end she wins awards and accolades for her lack of ethics. Then another young female apprentice appears, eager to degrade herself and exploit others. This pervasive sado-masochism and lack of virtue and ethics is quite troubling. And the perfunctory way in which these crass acts are covered by the film is also troubling. Also note how the ending shot of the new apprentice standing before the mirrors creates many reflections which represent the split and fractured personality of the psychopath.It was also sad to see Margo's friend throw her under the bus, to give Eve an opportunity to act. It is also hard to believe that someone can go from off the street to best in class in such a short time period. I also did not care for the writing in general, it felt like a man writing for a woman all the time. He overemphasized female aphorisms at times, almost becoming self-referential in his declarations of womanhood by his women. The script further suffers from its pompous insular tone, as if theater, Broadway, and writing are the most important thing in the world. To perhaps counterbalance this deficiency, Eve's character is made annoyingly self-deprecating, at least in the beginning. But, for a more realistic view of New York society life, see \"Weekend at Bernie's\" (which I also reviewed) as it lambasts and lampoons such a thing. For example, if Margo had died at her party of a drug overdose or something, would any of her pretentious, vapid, and superficial friends and acquaintances care? Sadly, I think not.So in summary, \"All About Eve\" is a mildly entertaining watch but which ultimately leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. Apart from Bette Davis' good performance I found the rest to be humdrum. Moreover, I view the aforementioned issues as so troubling because they are so subtle. The poor messages may be internalized unknowingly by some unsuspecting viewers. Sorry to be the spoiler here, I know movies are just for fun and entertainment, and that there are many worse movies out there, but I just felt compelled to write an alternative but honest review of this film as the discussion seems to be so one-sided, with only glowing press abounding.

It had won so many awards, and, even though she wasn't a favorite of mine, Bette Davis did have a considerable reputation in her day, and this was often cited as her best role. To my surprise, when the film ended, I learned that all three of us thought it was terrible. George Sanders in his patented role as an arrogant stinker and the young Marilyn Monroe who appears on his arm in a party scene were the only two characters we found interesting -- and MM is only interesting, of course, because of her later stardom. Ms. Davis chews the scenery as was her wont in her role as an \"aging\" (40) actress still playing roles meant for actresses in their 20s. Nearly every other actor in the film indistinguishes himself or herself. I hope not to remember this movie for very long.",

Marilyn Monroe saunters in and almost steals the show with her small but memorable role.

Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) is depicted as possibly gay and is a cynical, emotionally vacant individual.Whatever the case, Joseph L.

            "content": "Separating the hype from the truth is not easy, especially with an acknowledged classic like ALL ABOUT EVE. Some of its lines have entered Hollywood lore, especially Margo Channing's (Bette Davis's) line: \"Hold on to your hats. It's gonna be a bumpy night.\" The film won six Oscars and revived Davis's career as well as giving George Sanders the role of his life as acerbic critic Addison de Witt. The supporting actors are all superb, notably Celeste Holm as the kind but spineless Karen who takes Eve (Anne Baxter) under her wing and ends up being blackmailed as a result.Thematically speaking, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script exposes the emptiness of the awards culture that seemingly dominates the media landscape each year. Eve might pay tribute to those who helped her in her rise to fame, but the film shows how she wantonly abuses their generosity. All of her pronouncements are hypocritical, designed for a media accustomed to the sound-bite and the publicity photograph. Mankiewicz suggests that there is no basic division between the worlds inside and outside the theater; everyone simply plays roles and disrespects everyone else.Cinematically speaking, the style is fairly flat, almost theatrical, with many sequences comprised of shot/reverse shots interspersed with two-shots. On the other hand Mankiewicz has a flair for the suggestive; notably the portraits of Margo in her most successful roles festooned across the staircase of her expensive home, drawing our attention to the ways in which performance dominates her life. Or what about the shot of Maego standing beside a huge cartoon of her in one of her favorite Broadway roles just inside the theater where her play is being performed? Music is also used suggestively - just before Margo utters her famous line about the bumpy night, we hear Rodgers and Hart's standard \"Thou Swell\" on the piano, praising the charms of a woman. Later on in that sequence Margo storms upstairs in a huff to the sound of \"Stormy Weather.\"Perhaps one aspect of the film that needs to be highlighted is the way in which it confirms dominant attitudes towards gender in early Fifties America, where women were expected to stay at home and support their spouses. Despite her performances as a theatrical grande dame, Margo believes that her life will not be fulfilled unless she marries Bill (Gary Merrill). And in a climactic sequence where the truth about Eve is finally exposed, Addison claims that she belongs to him.We are presented with a paradox at the end; whereas ALL ABOUT EVE provides at least three substantial roles for leading female performers, it still reinforces patriarchal values. And there's the cynical ending, where Phoebe (Barbara Bates) begins precisely the same process of hero-worship that Eve has completed in order to achieve her ends. All Broadway heroes, it seems, have feet of clay.",

Yet the satire runs deeper and more personal than that as Eve (the character) is not content to merely supplant Margo professionally but tries to be a homewrecker. It speaks to the way powerful men dispose of women if they which a certain age. And how unfair that is too everyone. It is not just the men who come out looking awful. Eve is an unscrupulous witch. Margo, the brilliantly self-parody of Davis, is a flighty devil who settles for scraps. Karen, the nicest of the bunch, commits the greatest wrong. Birdie is ultimately a coward. None of the characters look good, but they are fully human.A lot of this is due to Mankiewic's smart screenplay and polished direction. Filled with irony, great one liners the screenplay deftly handles everyone's agendas. It also makes sure that everyone gets their just desserts. Likewise, the uniform excellent of the acting and how memorable the big scenes are are testament to Mankiewic's direction.One last thing Addison DeWitt, the acid tongue critic is one of the great characters in history.

            "content": "A special moment at the Sarah Siddons Awards when a new talent shines...the talent of a 'Junior - a golden girl, a cover girl,' young and pretty Eve who looks so innocent, grateful and fresh while receiving the desirable statuette for the role of her life. It seems that we already know all about Eve at the glimpse of her modest gesture. Yet, we soon realize there is a lot to be revealed for the sake of honesty between the award in her hands and her speech of gratitude; a lot in the drama fully equipped with classy entertainment and clever dialogs. The girl's heart is as old as a theater where applause gives all satisfaction but...each theater has its stage and its wings.As a holder of many awards, including the Best Picture Oscar, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's movie has been acclaimed as one of the most significant movies ever made, one of the 1950s' gems. Truly, more than half a century later, we can still say that the film is a captivating experience. Yet, its strength does not lie in innovative camera-work, great sets nor special effects. ALL ABOUT EVE relies on clever screenplay and absorbing performances. Its major strength, in other words, lies in the film's theatrical nature. Here, let me quote James Berardinelli who states accurately that \"ALL ABOUT EVE stands out as one of the best small-scale dramas ever produced under the Hollywood system\" (2003). He adds that the film \"could easily be mistaken for a movie adaptation of a stage play.\" And from within the truly clever script and the stagy nature emerge brilliant performances.Although Anne Baxter as the title character calls viewers' attention naturally due to her duality, we get to know her thanks to other characters around her. As naturally as life can appear...a person is perceived better by others than by oneself. Viewers call their attention towards those people in the lead, particularly Bette Davis as Margo Channing and George Sanders as Addison DeWitt. They are not only given some best lines in the film but also portray their characters with real charisma and climactic focuses.BETTE DAVIS: There are many reasons why we can openly say that this was one of her greatest roles, a real milestone in her later career. Why? This part not only re-established the actress after her farewell at the Warners Studios and welcome at Twentieth Century Fox but Margo is a sort of character Bette was born to play. Bette and Margo...a lot of parallels between two women! Bette's primary contribution is her own personality: her strong straightforward attitude, charisma of an aging star, pretentious with producers who leaves 'peace and quiet for the libraries' striving to be on the top, jealous of women who are too many things for a man she loves. 'Liebestraum' by Franz Liszt appears to be merely a 'cheap sentiment' that she detests. Davis admitted her confusion as for where the fictional personality ended and the real-life personality began. Although her roles galore are worth attention, this performance of hers is a must-see.GEORGE SANDERS: As the narrator of the story and an intensely dry Martini of the drama, his major merit is distance to all characters and his 'rapport' with viewers. He is certainly 'nobody's fool' who is 'essential to the theater' and to both Margo and Eve. Sarcastic, sympathetic at moments, cold in emotions, a perfect observer who leaves us all with a breathless delight. His lines occur to be the main entertainment of the storyline that raise unique movie fans' experience. Similarly to the director, he also seems to psychoanalyze the characters around. Sanders as DeWitt makes the entire story truly believable and inspiring. He simply leaves a viewer with pure admiration for the performance that vibrant. Sanders's best moments include the sarcastic talks with young Marilyn Monroe as Claudia and acting as a sardonic 'master' of disguised Eve in the harsh talk filled with 'boxing terms.' ANNE BAXTER: She has a hard role, supposedly the hardest one, because as the title character she cannot allow herself to be predominated by other cast. Ms Baxter, as one of my favorite actresses, absolutely rivets me as a shy Margo's fan who takes a chance of a lucky evening and visits her idol in her dressing room. There, she submits herself to the self-expected emotions and desirable impressions from her listeners. She bursts out with all her passionate fan's love but no hysteria. And, viewers along with Margo Channing allow themselves for a delusive sympathy for the young Eve. Then, her task is to reveal her true nature and her means that, at first, appear so good and honest. Then, we realize that she would do much more for the part that good, for the goal that ambitious and the career that promising. Does she manage in executing that? I think she does it well artistically but we, as viewers, no longer like her, she disappoints us as a character and, consequently, major appreciation is not of Eve/Baxter.SUPPORTING CAST: There are two people who are most memorable as an extra ingredient to the whole drama's taste: Gary Merill as Bill Sampson and Thelma Ritter as Birdie. Mr Merill as Margo's lover delivers some best lines about the theater, about his own dilemmas and accurately depicts a young man in this reality. Ms Ritter is excellent at her doubts about Eve. The matter of liking the ambitious fox is rather an argument than an answer...until Eve stops acting as if Margo were a 'queen mother.' Some outstanding moments, delightful dialogs, and riveting performances...a great achievement you will never forget!Slow curtain...the end...Although the show on stage is over, it goes on offstage. Knowing the wings equals to knowing all when the winner gets her trophy and all around Eve are not content with everything. All except one...a 'replacement' to come who learns the cruel maxim: The end justifies the means...",

She decides to take her in and introduce her to her feisty idol. \"Channing\" - despite the rather brusque protestations of her assistant \"Birdie\" (a lovely effort from Thelma Ritter) - and writer \"Richards\" (Hugh Marlowe) take a bit of a shine to this endearing young woman who proceeds to regale them with a rather sad story explaining her current predicament. Next thing we know, \"Eve\" has ingratiated herself into the home of her new - and increasingly frustrated - mentor, and - well is she quite what she seems? Davis is at the top of here game in this drama. Her characterisation of the ageing star is potent and poignant - especially when she hosts a welcome home party for her soon-to-be husband \"Simpson\" (Gary Merrill) and the \"fasten your seatbelts\" quote is unleashed to devastating cinematic effect. Holm is also really quite effective as the conduit between these two women, but it is really Baxter who steals the show. You just know she can't be as pure and innocent, as sweetness and light as she portrays. Luckily, we have the dastardly critic \"Addison DeWitt\" (possibly a career best supporting performance from George Sanders) on hand to help keep the audience ahead of the plotting and scheming and also to ensure a certain amount of divine retribution is doled out as required at the end. This is a cracking drama with six principal characters left to develop and evolve in front of us exposing all that is good and bad about human nature and nurture. Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapts and allows Mary Orr's pithy and sharp story to accumulate gently but powerfully and even though it starts as it finishes, robbing the denouement of a touch of jeopardy, it's still one hell of a star-studded \"bumpy' ride.",

Broadway actress Bette Davis (Oscar-nominated) is self-absorbed and cocky to put it mildly. Enter aspiring actress Anne Baxter (also Oscar-nominated) who seems to wander in off the street one day literally. Of course Baxter is not near as naive as she seems. Some realize this (notably assistant Thelma Ritter, Oscar-nominated), but some seem blind to what is going on (Oscar-nominee Celeste Holm). Baxter slowly starts to take control from the inside of the circle and then begins to branch her unyielding power out in every direction. In the end it appears that Baxter's actions will get her everything she desires, that is until sleazy reporter George Sanders (in a well-calculated Oscar-winning performance) comes into the picture. \"All About Eve\" works in cycles and tells its story with stunning flashbacks. It is a film that was different for 1950. The film shows a dark side of the entertainment industry and showed the lengths that some are willing to go to become icons. All the performances are right on target with Baxter, Davis and Sanders making bright impressions. The cast had a lot to work with though as Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Oscar-winning in writing and direction) picked up his second directing Academy Award in as many years. He became only the second individual to ever accomplish that feat (John Ford was first). Watch for a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe in a short supporting turn. Dominant, wicked, sophisticated, intelligent and definitely thought-provoking, \"All About Eve\" proves that the cinema can convey most anything when the fundamental elements are present. 5 stars out of 5.",

The characters are just as enjoyable and the plot, almost a farce, really, is just as beautifully set up and makes you want to clap your hands at every twist.Bette Davis is stunning as the melodramatic Margo Channing, I loved every moment of her performance, I have to say. Anne Baxter was also brilliant as Eve, and George Sanders in his Oscar-winning role actually really surprised me, considering I'd never heard of him until I saw this (obviously more my fault than his).And the dialogue is to die for. Every scene is almost like an Abbott and Costello routine, with snappy remarks followed immediately afterwards by equally snappy comebacks, just thrown from one character to another as quickly as you please, and the result is brilliant.

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)When I was a kid I would go to the second-run movie theater virtually every Saturday and watch three features, a cartoon and a newsreel indiscriminately. It was all wonderful to me (although I would hide bashfully behind the seat during the love scenes). I would come out of the theater several hours later (sometimes watching one of the features twice) amazed at what I'd seen and changed forever.The first adult movie that ever really held my interest though was All About Eve. Such is the power of the all too human story and how directly and clearly it is told from a celebrated script and some sublime direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Bette Davis who was then, by Hollywood standards for actresses, an ancient 41-years-old but not yet halfway through a 58-year movie career, stars as Margo Channing, a New York stage actress feeling very heavily the loss of her splendid youth. Eve Harrington is played with a veiled duplicity by Anne Baxter in a breakout role. I sat with fascination, understanding perfectly how and why she had insinuated herself into Margo's life, and on the edge of my seat to find out what would become of her. Yes, a child may well know of such matters, and it is to the credit of Mankiewicz and everyone involved in the production that a movie could be made that would inform and fire the imagination of a ten-year-old boy while at the same time intrigue and entertain adults. Ah, if only they made \"chick flicks\" like this today!Of course, All About Eve is more than a chick flick even though the men, Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) as Margo's beau, and Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) as a writer (and husband of Margo's best friend, Karen, played by Celest Holm) headed for Hollywood, take a back seat to the main action which is the playing out of the eternal power struggle between (take your pick: they all fit psychologically): youth and age, the daughter and the mother, the bride and the mother-in-law, the upstart and the established talent, the new and the old.Bette Davis is excellent of course, and the role fits her like a glove. But what transfixed me as a child was the contrast between the wholesome good looks of Anne Baxter and her sneaky treachery. Could someone so pretty be so bad? I may have wondered who I would have preferred for a mother, Davis or Baxter, and perhaps have come away not knowing. For Bette Davis the luster had gone from those famous eyes, and so it was only natural that her character Margo feared the loss of love from men. Even that I understood as a child. And in Baxter, youth would be served and perhaps she could be forgiven the lies because time does not stand still for anyone, especially it does not stand still for a starlet.Notable in supporting roles are Thelma Ritter and George Sanders, the former as Margo's maid and alter-ego Birdie, the latter as the cynical and barbed theater critic, Addison DeWitt (named perhaps with the 17th/18th century Brit wit and essayist Joseph Addison in mind), who escorts about town none other than a not-so-dumb blonde named Marilyn Monroe in her screen debut. The script, resplendent with some very sharp one-liners, was adapted from the story, \"The Wisdom of Eve\" (a bit of irony-on-the-square in the title perhaps) by Mary Orr and of course became the Broadway musical Applause (not yet a movie). Mankiewicz won Oscars for both his script and his direction, and Sanders won for Best Supporting Actor while the movie itself won for Best Picture over such fine films as Sunset Boulevard and Born Yesterday. Both Davis and Baxter were nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday.Bottom line: one of the great stories of the theater, a classic Hollywood film not to be missed.",

It has such a great plot that is terrifying to think about but you can't help but keep your eyes peeled on the screen as Eve just rips away Margo's life. The ending, I loved the karma, you'll know when you see it. The acting, man, ladies and gentlemen, this is what acting dreams are made off. Without a doubt Bette Davis steals the show, I loved watching her just slowly falling apart. Anne Baxter played such a great b-you know what. Did you just want her character to get her own medicine or what?All About Eve is a terrific classic that I will forever cherish.10/10",

            "content": "Joseph L. Mankiewicz made his masterpiece here with All About Eve, a smart, sassy and completely captivating film about the life behind the curtain of the theater world that may in some instances mirror the world behind the film industry. Bette Davis resurrected her career with a tour- de force performance that is nothing short of exemplary. Anne Baxter is perfect as the sneaky, conniving Eve trying to do all she can to get ahead. Gary Merril, Hugh Marlowe, and Celeste Holm also give fine performances to complete the ensemble. Nevertheless, George Sanders gives the finest performance as the smart and sinister Addison DeWitt, an influential critic who has a major role to play in this event.Above all, the script is what makes this a classic film in its own right. Mankiewicz, just like he did in his previous film A Letter to Three Wives, perfectly balances the transitions between all the main characters. There isn't a dull moment here and by the end, it is a surprise as well as a satisfying look at backstabbing and deceit. This is a near-perfect movie that gets better and better with each viewing. Great acting, solid direction and perfect writing make this a true classic of the Golden Age.",

            "content": "1950 was quite the year for movies and it was All About Eve that came out on top at the Oscars. Personally, I would have to agree... strongly. This movie is phenomenal. Not only is it a solidly great film for its time, it's just a purely good film out of any sort of time context. It's witty, intelligent, charming, funny, and exciting. It's the story of the acting world and the colorful and competitive people who inhabit it. Eve, played by Anne Baxter, is a young girl who has huge aspirations for herself on the stage. Aging stage star Margo Channing takes Eve under her wing, only to discover that Eve is a conniving little girl who tries to steal Margo's job as well as her husband. The film is loaded with laughs, all perpetuated through rapier wit dialouge. The film is an excellent dramady with plenty of style and poise, rich and vibrant, gleaming with life and excitement.The best scripts are those that keep at a consistent cadence that never falters and never loses your interest. All About Eve has one of those scripts. There is a very gracious flow to the dialouge in this film, and it is also at a level of intelligence much greater than the average script. It is loaded with double entendres, parallelism, and witty metaphors. It's the kind of dialouge that works so smoothly and every transition and every exchange between characters is so seamless and perfect. Every scene provides some new element of excellence to the poignant dialouge. Sometimes it's sincere and dramatic, full of sophistication. Other times its very light hearted and airy, bringing about a lot of laughs that come from the heart instead of being just mindless entertainment. Then other times it combines the two. There are those scenes in the film where the characters go on rants and tangents, insulting each others intelligence and social ability, and it is all done so eloquently and is delivered without missing a single beat that you can't help but laugh in esteemed approval of the masterful wordplay unfolding before your eyes and ears.Of course where would a near perfect script be without excellent actors to deliver it? Nowhere. So its a good thing All About Eve has some of the finest actors of the era performing their most sincere and dedicated roles ever. It all starts with Bette Davis as Margo. Her performance is nothing short of stellar. The sharp wit of the dialouge flows so naturally from her mouth its as if she wrote it herself. You believe that she believes every last word she says and at no moment do you believe this woman on the screen is anyone but Margo Channing.The male roles of the film also shine, each in their own unique way. George Sanders plays Addison DeWitt, a prominent figure in the performance world who speaks with a sort of slow, well thought out sophistication to his voice. He adds a lot of the sarcastic wit to the film, but delivers his best effort in one of the most important scenes of the film, and it is astounding. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe play the husbands of Margo and her friend Karen, and their performances are hilarious. They continue to further the profound development of the story and its statement on the acting world. Anne Baxter is the weakest link of the films cast as she doesn't have all of the presence necessary for the character of Eve. She's an undoubtedly interesting and is obviously an important character because if not for her we would be nowhere. In her final scenes of the film she is fantastic, but the build up to it makes it seem odd. Regardless, the film does not falter because of her.Films with this amount of fast paced brilliance to them just don't come around as often as you would hope. This film is a staple of the golden age of American filmmaking and rightfully so. It's got everything you need to make a truly great film and it not only satisfies but excels in all aspects. It is a truly remarkable film.",

Applause from the audience is ...\"waves of love\"... as she maniacally describes her need to perform. Initially a waif, who ingratiates herself to Margo Channing (played by Davis) the grand-dame of theater. Anne Baxter as the young Eve is both believable and odious. She is first a friend, then an under-study, then a star. All in a short time.Addison DeWitt (Sanders) sees through her cherubic persona; ...\"you should have no problem resting now, Eve\"...he quips, after she has nearly destroyed Channing's career.Davis also has some excellent lines. Describing her career, she tells Celeste Holm ...\"a woman forgets she will need her femininity, after she has climbed to the top, after she gets all she wants\"... a brilliant insight into women's issues, considering this was 1950. Margo Channing, at 40 was considered too old- Davis is wrestling with this issue, as well as competition from Eve.Gary Merrill is charming, and cynical. He eventually sees through Eve's motivations as well. This film is a classic with excellent performances, and could never be remade today. 10/10",

It's more like a look at what life turned out to be during the 1950s.Like The Third Man (1949), it's composed of artistic/intellectual clever tricks (including ways around censorship) to hide a tedious story of self referential self importance.

            "content": "As much as I do like a lot of things about this movie and I like the movie itself overall, I don't quite understand its exalted status among classics. Perhaps its mostly Davis herself, such a commanding screen actress who so rarely received a role worthy of her talents. In this one they came really close, but she was let down to some extent by Mankiewicz's direction and by her co-stars.Joseph Mankiewicz wrote the thing as well as directed it, and he's a bit too much in love with the stuff on the page to let the film really breathe. Baxter in particular is undermined by a rather literal interpretation of the script that robs her character of ambiguity, ultimately. As far as Gary Merrill, I haven't ever really seen the appeal of the guy as a leading man but this is a pretty good character for him. He feels like an afterthought, and George Sanders really steals a lot of the movie. Of course it's ultimately Davis' film, but Sanders is there soaking up every leftover scene, which is a more suitable exposition of what the story is actually about than anything going on between Baxter and Davis on screen.The film does an excellent job of evoking the majesty of Broadway stars in their glory years, and it was brave for Davis to take on a role with the explicit element of her aging out of younger roles -- many male stars were said to have turned down the similar role in \"A Star Is Born\" in various productions over the years. Obviously for her fans, this film is a must. It also offers some impressive moments of grandeur from Sanders. Baxter however doesn't have the presence to imply that she could be a replacement for Davis, and she doesn't effectively transition the character into the latter phases of the film. Celeste Holm's character is interesting as well, and she gives a self-effacing performance worthy of her own stature.There's a lot to like in the movie, but to me it could have been even better if the characters hadn't become so explicit and delineated by the end of the film. Addison DeWitt in particular seems to stop resembling even a human being by the end. He and Eve Harrington become self-consciously fascinating characters to the point where the humanity in the character drops away, and only Sanders' extreme ability keeps the whole artifice from becoming too obvious. Margo Channing is not only more sympathetic but also more believable; a rare combination in film indeed.",

It is not. While still a great film, it pales in comparison to many other films, and many of those never got nominations (or won the awards). Not sure what that says about this movie, but it sure says the Academy is not always right.What I learned from this picture: having Bette Davis eyes is not a compliment. Maybe Davis was attractive at one point in her career, but clearly by 1950 she was not. How much longer she remained a star I am not sure... but it is more than a tad ironic that Davis' star seemed to fade here just as Marilyn Monroe's was rising.

All about Eve was no doubt important, but it also holds up better today than many movies released this decade. It's wit is just as sharp, and the performances are still top notch. It's a movie about hunger for power, staying relevant, and realizing that nothing lasts forever - all of which are still interesting themes today. (Staying relevant will maybe never lose its relevancy.) While the cast is stellar all around, Bette Davis' performance really stands out as just amazing. She's the highlight of any scene she is in, and when she's not a part of the scene, you miss her. Much of it is because she really captures the character (which might have been easy for her), but also because of the writing. So many movies around this time has excellent dialogue. It's like they didn't care if it was realistic at all, it was more important that it was good.There's only one scene I really object to, and with a fear of spoiling it, I'll say it's a scene between DeWitt and Eve in hear bedroom near the end, where Eve's reaction feels either over done (which does not match her character at all), or, if meant to be genuine, seems uncharacteristic of her. Perhaps it's just not aged that well? If so, it's unlike the rest of the movie.",

She had the power that future generations attribute in part to people like Stevie Nicks... she had a mastery, a beautiful mesmerizing and bewitching ability. To watch her act is to be a student of microexpressions... Tonight I watched for the first time a movie I consider now to be a perfect film. The movie won 6 Oscars, and rightfully so. Everyone is exceptional, no one overstays their welcome or overplays their hand. The movie works on so many levels, what it says about the times, what it states silently in the mise en scene and props. The dialog is absolutely delicious, the story profound and disturbing... I rate it immediately 10/10 That movie, All About Eve (1950). Extraordinarily brilliant in every way. Bette Davis is lovable and masterful as always, all the women seem to understand there's wool there thrown over the eyes of the men, but there are twists, there are turns, the entire film smolders and burns, and will not let you go, or turn away... you must keep watching, here enjoying the treat, there disturbed by the rich and unmistakable sickness of the plot... there's nowhere to go but forward... and in the end, you'll want more and more.",

Bette Davis (absolutely unforgettable) is the one to watch, perfectly matched with Anne Baxter ( as Eve), the ultimate career and home wrecker. Period. George Sanders deservingly won an Oscar for his part as the unofficial observer (and insightful narrator) of the devious proceedings, always in a league of his own and making the most of his role, if not his lines. Celeste Holm is, likewise, a treat to watch, always by Davis' side. Not to be overlooked, as this is one compelling production, and perhaps a stellar example of storytelling at its very best. An early credit for Marilyn Monroe, who was skillfully climbing the ladder in Hollywood to better roles.

How they found Eve around the stage door, apparently the devoted fan. They took her in, gave her a chance and she used it to all it was worth. Although being in the company of prominent theatre professionals, and despite given an award for a play later, Eve gives the performance of her life to play all angles, to rise to the top, quickly and at all costs. Only writer Addison DeWitt sees through her, but instead of revealing her he gives aid with small advice, as another little project of his.Comments: I find it is prudent to be careful when seeing old dramas, even when they are lauded and awarded as All about Eve is. They might be anything, a stellar classic or a boring slow movie that is just beyond me how everyone thinks it is so great. All about Eve is close to be the former, it is great, despite being quite long at 138 minutes (I believe). It is one of those movies where the sum is greater than its parts.First off, and most important always, is the groundwork. The story. It is complex, intricate and not too apparent. It carefully examines its main characters, but not too quickly, it reveals small tidbits here and there, gives a small hint. It is a drama but seem to lend a lot of qualities how to develop a story from the genre of mysteries or crime. But also there is a hint, small but always there in the background of humor. A witty one-liner or remark or the behavior of a diva. It is a splendid story, keeping at least me in its grip during the entire run.Second, there is the cast. Cast is nothing without a good story, but a good cast can let a story shine. This cast does. Anne Baxter is splendid as the coldly manipulating but oddly passionate Eve. Bette Davis is almost better, in part due to the more manic character of Margo. Supported by a good cast of Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe and, in my opinion (he did get an Oscar for it), especially George Sanders who plays the devious, equally manipulating, Addison DeWitt.Not to mention Marilyn Monroe. She got a small role, really not very important to this story. She could have been excluded and not be missed. But with her looks, and her delivering her few lines it is apparent, at least in hindsight, that she would be a future star.And everything just fits together. This is a true classic, a gem that is one of those you should see.9/10",

It's a stylish and very well done movie that from a cinematic point of view is a superb one, even when its moments and emotions are obviously exaggerated for its cinematic reasons. It doesn't matter since \"All About Eve\" is a real movie movie, made for the big screen and written for the actors to shine in it.Bette Davis is truly fantastic in some of the movie its moments but still I feel that Anne Baxter and George Sanders perhaps deserve even more credit for their roles. It after all is also Anne Baxter who plays the true main character of the movie, at least in the second halve. Because of this both Davis and Baxter also got nominated in the same category for best actress in a leading role. Of course not something that is very usual. Both lost out however to Judy Holliday for her role in \"Born Yesterday\".It's story progresses nicely throughout its 138 minutes of running time. It perhaps gets a bit predictable after a while, especially for todays audience but the class and style this movie got made with keeps you watching- and interested throughout its entire running time. The script provides the movie with a couple of great dialogs, which in return brings out the best of some the actors. It's a real story that got character driven and could had basically been about anything and still would had made a great movie. One fine multiple Oscar winning production from Darryl F.

It was written at a time when profanity was not allowed in movies but within this limitation, its use of the English language has far more sting than swearing ever could. Even without the wit, \"All About Eve\" is a strong story that exposes the consequences of a hyper-ambition that borders on evil and how evil attracts more evil. Adding to this is a great expos\u00e9 of the joys and insecurities of the theatre world.As a grand stage star who might be considered \"too old\" at the age of forty, Davis is stunning. Whether displaying neurosis, anger, drunkenness, egotism, sentimentality, or light-heartedness, she is at the very top in all of these emotions.As the upstart Eve, Anne Baxter does superbly in a very difficult role. Not only does she not get to deliver any of the script's sharp lines (most of which are directed against her character), she does what few can do: be believable when pretentiously simpering and groveling; then, in seconds, ably displaying the evil behind the mask.As an acid-tongued theatre critic, George Saunders adds his own special venom to the brilliant lines he spouts.

Having lived through some scandals of the silent era, the studio moguls didn't want the spotlight so much on them and their business as on the glamour of the actors and actresses. The studio PR departments concocted fabulous backgrounds for some up and coming stars, and the studios that had contracts with most of the players, shaped, organized and orchestrated their stars in the images they wanted.The glamour of Hollywood and Broadway began to fade around mid-century. The studio system with contract players was on its way out. Actors and others wrote biographies, exposes and novels about the life and lives of Hollywood and Broadway. And, during this time, Tinsel Town cashed in on the publicity and changing public images of performers and producers. That would lead to some dramas, bio-pics and musicals over the next couple of decades about stars, entertainers and the stage.This year - 1950, was the beginning of the last craze over stage and screen celebs. And two movies about stage and screen stars vied for honors in the Academy Awards for that year. It was a year of many very good films, but \"All About Eve\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" had the most nominations and won the most Oscars.\"All About Eve\" was the most star-packed of the films nominated for the major awards in 1950. It beat the previous Oscars record of 13 nominations held by \"Gone With the Wind\" since 1940. \"Eve\" won six Oscars of its 14 nominations. And, it set a very unusual record that still exists in Hollywood history. It is the only film that received two nominations in both actress categories - best actress and best supporting actress. Yet - and even with truly outstanding performances by each actress, none of them won either Oscar.No one could doubt the tremendous performances by Bette Davis as Margo Channing, and Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington. And, Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter were outstanding in their supporting roles.But this also was a year of tremendous competition among films, and while \"Eve\" won best picture and best director Oscars, it won just one acting award - George Sanders as best supporting actor. The best actress Oscar went to Judy Holiday for \"Born Yesterday,\" and Josephine Hull won the best supporting actress Oscar for \"Harvey.\"\"Sunset Boulevard\" won three Oscars out of 11 nominations; \"Born Yesterday\" won one of five Oscar nominations; \"King Solomon's Mines' wone two Oscars of three nominations; and \"Father of the Bride\" had two nominations but no wins. Other top films that won Oscars that year were \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" \"Harvey,\" \"The Third Man,\" \"Panic in the Streets,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" Captain Carey, U. S. A., \"Samson and Delilah,\" and \"Destination Moon.\"And, the quality of films that year is also attested in some of the outstanding films that weren't even nominated for Oscars. Among them were \"The Asphalt Jungle,\" \"Adam's Rib,\" \"Caged,\" \"The Third Man,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"The Flame and the Arrow,\" \"The Magnificent Yankee,\" \"When Willie Comes Marching Home,\" \"A Life of Her Own,\" \"The Black Rose,\" \"Mister 880,\" and \"That Forstye Woman.\"Interestingly, for all the PR and buildup for \"Eve,\" none of the actresses nominated for the Academy Awards won in the other major awards for that year. The Hollywood foreign press corps had two categories for best actress and one for supporting actress. Its Golden Globes for best actress in a drama went to Gloria Swanson for \"Sunset Boulevard,\" and the best actress in a comedy or musical when to Judy Holliday for \"Born Yesterday.\" Josephine Hull won the supporting actress Globe for her role in \"Harvey.\"",

            "content": "There are many films that we as viewers call `a classic', and I believe that we (myself definitely included) tend to overuse that term.  When discussing the `classic' All About Eve however, the term is more than warranted.Possible SpoilersAll About Eve is the story of an ambitious and almost `too sweet' woman named Eve who manages to work her way into an elite group of theater people headed by Bette Davis, who plays the stage actress Margo Channing.  Margo may be intelligent and beautiful, but she is the perfect target for the young Eve; She is 40 and is concerned about holding on to her roles and holding on to her younger boyfriend, the theater director Bill Sampson.  Eve becomes Margo's personal assistant when Karen, Margo's best friend and the wife of the playwright who pens most of Margo's work, finally satisfies her curiosity and goes to talk to the woman she sees at every performance.  Eve sees her `in' and grabs it, thereby giving her the opportunity to slowly manipulate the circle of friends and slowly pit them against one another while she rises to her own ambitions.There are two things that make this film one of my favorites.  The first are the great performances turned out by a couple of standouts in an altogether great cast.  Bette Davis positively radiant as Channing, and is at her prime in her career.  She takes a scene and chews it up then spits it out with an amazing amount of panache, while still convincing us that she is vulnerable. My other favorite is the outstanding George Sanders, who plays the velvet voiced and acid tongued theater critic, Addison DeWitt.  DeWitt will rip you to shreds, but he will do it with such style and ease that you have to wonder for a moment if you have been complimented or insulted.  Sanders is brilliant in this role, and despite the fact that I cannot recall a time when I've ever seen him play anything BUT the snake guy, he is in rare form in `Eve'.  I'm sure it's no coincidence that these characters' lines are the ones that most people remember.Conversely, as the acting IS dead on, if it weren't for the fantastic script, the roles would have had no substance.  The writing in All About Eve is so lightning paced, that even those of us who have seen the film many times feel the desire to slow down the film a bit in order to catch every nuance, every aside, or any impromptu look or gesture.  I've heard criticism of the film stating that it was `too dramatic' or `too overdone'.  I'm inclined to disagree with that based on the fact that it is a film featuring a cast who are theater people and are therefore inherently dramatic.  I found it to be completely believable and natural for the setting it was in. \nAt a recent meeting of our `film club' my friends and I watched All About Eve, and it is our tradition during the discussion for each person to point out one good thing and one bad thing about the film.  If I recall correctly, the harshest criticism about this film was that it was `a little dated'. When one is forced to find something bad about a film and this is what they come up with, that is pretty reflective of the integrity of the film.  All About Eve set an Oscar record for its 14 nominations and walked away with Best Supporting Actor, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay among others.  I've noticed that All About Eve is one of those great films that people (at least ones I have encountered) acknowledge as a `classic film' but haven't actually seen it.  Perhaps this is a sign of the film's longevity \u0096 it isn't as timeless as say, `The Wizard of Oz'.  Whether that is true or not will be determined in the coming decades, but whether or not the film eventually becomes hackneyed and irrelevant, sliding into obscurity, I'll still be extolling its virtues and showing it to those who have not yet experienced this jewel of a film because in the opinion of this movie lover it is sheer perfection.--Shelly",

Then it was not her presence to which the famed theater actress began reacting to, but everything else. It was an interesting and beautiful film to watch.

Davis is magnificent, now fuller of figure, her looks fading - the 50's were not a great time for her as fashions changed in favour of \"method acting\", but she gives a fabulous multi-layered, almost valedictory performance, starting out as the caustic queen of all she surveys who's checkmated by the machinations of on-the-make not-so-innocent waif Anne Baxter in a career-defining role.In truth it's all about Margo and Eve, but there's great support too from the whole ensemble, particularly George Sanders as the lewd, vile critic, who brings Eve to heel and Celeste Holm as Margo's devoted friend who fails to see the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing until said wolf has come between not only her and Margo, but even her and her husband. You could cut yourself on some of the barbed remarks delivered here, so sharp is the dialogue, every word a weapon, fitting for a movie about the theatre-world.The only thing that didn't work for me in this otherwise brilliant piece was the tacked-on ending when Eve learns that turnabout is fair play as her own little \"Eve\" appears on the scene, much as she did her own \"girl from nowhere\" entrance herself with Margo - this despite the technically superb closing image where mirrors imitate art literally! The scene itself though is such an artificial comedown after the climactic showdown between Sanders and Baxter, where they act their socks off as they sock it to one another.On reflection, if only one of the three Oscar-nominated main players (Davis, Baxter and Sanders) was to get the award, (Thelma Ritter deserved hers too in support - shame she disappears about half-way through the film), it's right that it was Sanders who won. Perfect practice for his later vocal outing as \"Shere Khan\" in Disney's \"Jungle Book\", he is the sleazy, easy serpent who destroys Eve's self-made Eden as he snakes his insidious presence into every nook and cranny.An epochal film then, with endings (Davis' career) and beginnings (Baxter and Marilyn Monroe in a telling early role). Say goodbye to Hollywood indeed - things got a lot bumpier in TinselTown after this mould-breaking feature.",

            "content": "About half way through the film, one realizes just exactly what Eve Harrington is, and it begins with a capital 'B'. Anne Baxter turns in an understated but tantalizing performance as the title character, at the same time challenging co-star Bette Davis for the Best Actress Oscar, though won by neither that year. The film is a scathing portrayal of getting to the top in the ethereal world of the Broadway theater, and how one woman pulls out all the stops to go for the brass ring.One generally finds the best one liners of the era in stylish noir thrillers, but this one offers some great ones. Margo Channing (Davis) commenting on her own brashness - \"Oh relax kid, it's just me and my big mouth\". Her friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) reacting to yet another Channing outburst - \"We know you, we've seen you like this before. Is it over or just beginning?\" Brilliant stuff.One of the surprise appearances of the film for me was that of Marilyn Monroe in a performance that might have paralleled Eve Harrington's own in real life. How fitting would it have been to have her cast as Phoebe at the end of the story, daydreaming her way to future stardom in a case of life imitating art? I got a kick out of how the script managed to work in the names of leading celebrities of the day into the script. There were references to Tyrone Power, Gregory Peck, Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward and even producer Zanuck.\"All About Eve\" is a great take on the old 'what goes around comes around' theme, peppered with insightful bitter wit and colorful players. It's focus on age obsession with Davis' character is particularly poignant today with the TV tabloid emphasis on out of control faux celebrities and wanna be's.",

            "content": "All About Eve is All About Perfection, it really is a flawless, time less piece of classic cinema. I know many feel that the theater references are now dated, and maybe that's true, the theater is not what it is portrayed in the movie, however, the film's theme remains time less.Sadly, the word classic has to be attributed, and I say sadly cause even though by regular standards calling a movie would be a grand thing, with All About Eve it is rather melancholic, cause every time that I see it, it reminds me that Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.All About Eve is a massive combination of production, directing, and above all, WRITING AND ACTING. No person should be allowed to do films without seeing certain movies, and All About Eve is certainly amongst them. It's almost hard to keep up with the continuous flow of writing perfection, phrase after phrase of exuberant brilliance, every single line clicks, and believe it or not, that is a hard thing to do in writing for movies or plays. The story has everything, comedy, drama, tension, surprise, you name it, watching the film for the first time is bliss, and it's a bliss that never fades out after each re watching.The acting is perfect, absolutely perfect. It works both as an ensemble and as single performances, every single actor did a outstanding job. However it is obvious that the two main gals from Hollywood's golden age steal the show, watching Bette Davis and Anne Baxter is to see performing at it's best. Davis made many, many movies when she was young, but I think the pick of the litter of her performances is Margo Channing, same goes for Anne Baxter far as I'm concerned. George Sanders does steal the show from the 3 main male characters. And it's fun to see a young Marilyn Monroe start to glitter in an almost cameo role which was no cameo at all back then, but nowadays feels like it.I won't get into any details of the story or characters, I think pretty much all has been said and said again, and it's also quite stupid to be arrogant and post personal interpretations of the story and the themes it deals with.All that I what to say is that All About Eve is a perfect movie, and it's a shame we won't see any movies of it's like again. I'm not talking about remakes(which would be a tremendous sin), but films today just don't hold the brilliance that All About Eve has, it is really one of those films that sets very high standards for motion picture excellence, it ranks high up with the other films that do this such as Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, Raging Bull and Schindler's List just to name a few.Everyone should see this movie, and any person that dares to write and make a movie without having seen it, it's really not all together credible.",

Anne Baxter is equally as her biggest admirer who has her own plans for herself by sticking close to Eve.  As for the male actors, it is George Sanders's show all the way in his best supporting actor winning performance.    As good as the movie may be, the best part of it is certainly the script which never lets down the characters.  It's a smart, clever picture by one of the century's best directors.

            "content": "Undoubtedly one of the greatest films ever made, \"All About Eve\" combines the finest acting, witty dialogue, sparkling tongue-in-cheek humor, and a highly-entertaining storyline. Bette Davis plays Margo Channing, an aging star of the stage. Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington who claims to be Margo's most adoring fan. One night, Margo's dearest friend, Karen Richards (Celeste Holm), discovers Eve lurking around a stage door during one of Margo's performances, waiting for her to come out. A flattered Margo takes the seemingly innocent Eve under her wing. But we soon discover the adoration is really obsession, and Eve is actually out to take over Margo's romance and career. The crazed Eve's manipulations are a hoot to watch and Baxter turns in a beautiful performance. Some amazing effort went into the scenes in which Eve's \"Jekyll and Hyde\"-like transformation from sweet innocent into devious witch are shown. The appeal of this film classic is made even greater by George Sanders, as critic Addison DeWitt, and his jaded, but funny commentary. Also, Marilyn Monroe in a bit part as a young starlet (what a stretch!) is a true gem.The backstage intrigue of this film rivaled that of the tumultuous on-screen doings. Davis reportedly neglected each and every member of the cast and crew once she fell in love with co-star Gary Merrill who played her on-screen love, Bill Sampson. And from day one, Davis and Holm disliked each other so much that they didn't speak one word to each other unless they were in character. To top it all off, Davis was apparently hell-on-wheels and a viciously jealous woman who automatically disliked every other female. Monroe later claimed that Davis was a \"mean old broad\". This movie was, deservedly, the darling of the 1951 Academy Awards, winning six Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Sanders, and Best Director for Joseph Mankiewicz). Of note that year was the Best Actress category. Davis was such a huge favorite to win, but Gloria Swanson was also up for her eerie perfromance in \"Sunset Boulevard\". Swanson was also considered by many to be a shue-in. However, due to both actresses' extreme popularity, Davis and Swanson cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday won for \"Born Yesterday\". In 1998, \"All About Eve\" was listed by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 Greatest American Films. Yep, this screen classic is not to be missed. Each viewing of this stylish and snappy classic is indeed a fun and bumpy ride.",

            "review_title": "The sanctity of marriage preserved as amoral lesbian actress wins pyrrhic victory in iconic film classic",
            "content": "Joseph L. Mankiewicz, writer/director of All About Eve, revealed that the antagonist Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) was intended to be a lesbian. Had the film been written today, I'm not sure if he could have gotten away with the portrayal of the back-stabbing schemer who ends up usurping the position of her rival, Margo Channing (Bette Davis), the well regarded thespian approaching middle-age.For those who question whether Eve is supposed to be depicted as a gay woman, I direct you to a key scene toward the end of the film in which she calls on her obvious gay lover to deceptively make a phone call enticing playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe) to visit her at her apartment. Note after the phone call, Eve and her lover walk up the stairs with arms wrapped around one another..Despite being gay, Eve has no compunction about getting sexually involved with men-as long as such contact proves advantageous in furthering her theatrical career.Indeed, at the beginning of the film Eve is shown sucking up to Margo. I would argue that as much as she's initially trying to use Margo to get ahead, she's also sexually infatuated with her. It's only when Margo becomes jealous, believing that Eve is trying to seduce her theatrical director husband Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill), that the acclaimed actress turns on the woman who so devotedly spent all her time helping her as a personal assistant.Once it's revealed that Eve does attempt to seduce Bill, it's clear that Mankiewicz views his character with contempt. If Eve is guilty of a series of \"felonies,\" one could say the other characters in her orbit are guilty of only \"misdemeanors.\" It's clear that Mankiewicz is a lot less hard on his heterosexual characters than those who are gay.Margo's narcissism, jealousy and denial about growing older are her main character flaws. We see these flaws in high relief when she learns beforehand from critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) that Eve has become her understudy and then pretends she's learning of that fact for the first time.Bill's flaw is being impulsive-walking out on Margo after catching her lying and seemingly treating Eve so poorly. Seduced by Eve's charms, what Bill cannot see is that there may be some justification for Margo's jealousy who now is convinced the younger woman has been manipulating her all along.Lloyd's wife Karen (Claire Trevor) also has been played by Eve and initially sides with her after believing Margo is guilty of having acted poorly toward her rival. Karen goes so far as sabotaging Margo's career by emptying the gas tank of the car they're traveling in while on a trip upstate, causing Margo to miss a performance and allowing Eve to perform as an understudy.But suddenly Margo has an epiphany while stranded in the car with Karen and confesses she's been self-centered and feels guilty over her treatment of Eve. Mankiewicz allows all of Eve's victims (again all heterosexual) to have a conscience, leading to redemption. That includes Karen, now chastened, who goes to bat for Margo. Similarly Bill returns to Margo after reading DeWitt's poison pen review (goaded by Eve) criticizing Margo for seeking out roles that should be played by a chronologically younger woman.Ironically, Karen, who now despises Eve, turns down her request to urge her husband to promote Eve as lead actress in his new play. But it's Margo, with a newly found maturity, no longer has an interest in promoting herself in Lloyd's play. Hence more redemption for the protagonists.At this point can we conclude that Mankiewicz is a homophobe? In these times, it's fashionable to view all gay people as victims. But the reality is there are still morally reprehensible people even among the gay population-particularly those who have no guilt feelings about turning on their \"own\"-those of the same sexual persuasion. The amoral Eve is one such character and by far the most interesting of the characters Mankiewicz has drawn here. That's because she is multi-dimensional: evil but at the same time highly intelligent, crafty and charming.Interestingly enough, George Sanders, who plays the other seemingly gay person in the drama, has an equally complex role. Despite identifying with Eve (referring to each other metaphorically as mutual \"killers\"), DeWitt steps forward and prevents Eve from seducing Lloyd making it clear to Eve that she \"belongs to him.\" DeWitt too seems to reflect Mankiewicz's belief that the homosexual lifestyle is predicated on dominant and submissive roles. Nonetheless, perhaps due to Mankiewicz's bias toward a masculine ethos, even DeWitt gets to \"do the right thing\" by preventing Eve from committing another one of her \"felonies\" (i.e. Attempting to seduce another man).Eve's triumph, winning the Sara Siddons Award, is clearly a pyrrhic victory. At film's end, she is depicted as an empty vessel. But clearly the most interesting and compelling of all the characters. Margo, Karen, Bill and Lloyd on the other hand, are a bit less complex as they're the \"good guys,\" who represent Mankiewicz's conviction that marriage-a sacred rite-must be preserved!Baxter is the standout here but it's Davis who has the wittiest lines and a role that suggests that maturity can lead to the absolution of the sins of one's youth.In a sad footnote, Barbara Bates, who played the Eve wannabe, Phoebe, in the final scene, ended up committing suicide at the young age of 43 after her career never took off despite the acclaim garnered for her small part in All About Eve.",

            "content": "There are no great dramatic moments in ALL ABOUT EVE; no suicides, no murders, no fist fights, no chase scenes. Rather the film is about people of the theatre (that's \"thee-A-tah\") to whom life is drama. The film is full of little dramatic moments: grand entrances, dramatic exits, fiery confrontations and lines of clever dialogue drenched in wit or sarcasm or acid. There are precious few casual or ordinary moments; the characters all know the power of words and the greater power of delivering those words with style. My favorite moment is a great example. During a heated quarrel with her beau, Bette Davis, as Broadway star Margo Channing, has an equally dramatic confrontation with a candy dish. As the two squabble over matters both petty and poignant, superficial and sincere, Margo divides her attention between the man in her life (played by the man in Davis' life, Gary Merrill) and the contents of the candy dish. As she swaps snide one-liners, Margo debates whether or not to surrender to the temptation of a diet-busting sweet. She picks up the lid of the candy bowl and picks out a chocolate; she sets it down and picks it up and puts it back. The simple act of eating a piece of candy becomes high drama. Then, at precisely the right moment, she pops it into her mouth and chews ferociously, conquering the chocolate, even as the chocolate conquers her. She loses the battle, but on her own terms.The title is misleading. It is only partly about Eve; it is equally about Margo. Margo Channing is \"a great star, a true star,\" so we are told. Into her life comes Eve Harrington, a dangerously ambitious young actress, more interested in a short cut to stardom than in paying her thespian dues. Little by little, Eve worms her way into Margo's life and bit by bit she tries to steal Margo's place as the first lady of the theatre. Eve ultimately wins, sorta; but even as Margo loses the battle, she loses on her own terms. ALL ABOUT EVE is a great movie, one of the all time best. But the film has no clear-cut arc or structure. Rather, it is meant as a character study, a collection of wonderful little scenes that allow a remarkable cast to shine. A film about actors for actors. As such, most of the performances are just a tad over the top; not hammy, but theatrical. Yet, pitch perfect; we never doubt for a minute that any of the characters would act just like this in real life. Davis is at the peak of her skills and gives the performance of her career: petty, flamboyant, bitchy, sincere and \"maudlin and full of self-pity.\" The rest of the cast is made of pros: Merrill, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe in a small but telling early role. Especially fine is George Sanders as Addison DeWitt (\"I am a critic and commentator. I am essential to the theatre - as ants to a picnic, as the boll weevil to a cotton field.\"). His character is both the film's villain and moral conscience; seeing through the other characters' artifice, keeping them honest, a trait he avoids in himself. Coming to the role with an established screen persona of an arrogant cad, Sanders is perfect as a man who has made an art out of being demanding and judgmental. It is one of the great screen performances. The one truly odd performance is that of Anne Baxter. Her performance as Eve is obvious, arch and almost amateurish. In another film, it would be awful. Here it is just right. The audience sees through Eve's manipulations and lies -- and so should the other characters. But in a world where everything is a performance, sincerity is whatever is the most flattering. We take it on face value that Eve is a great actress on the stage, where she may indeed be real; but off stage we are meant to see the difference between her false theatrics and the other characters sincere theatrics. Baxter's performance is bad for all the right reasons. I remember seeing this film with a college audience in the 1980s. The audience laughed when Davis gave her famous monologue about the sacrifices she made for a career (\"Funny business, a woman's career, the things you drop on the way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman.\"). I wonder how many of the proto-feminists in that audience would laugh at it now. ALL ABOUT EVE is about blind ambition, but it is also about the acceptance of change. A star knows when to take center stage; a great star knows when to take a bow and exit.",

            "content": "There can be no denying that All About Eve has retained some sort of epic feel watching now that I can only imagine must've felt rather jarring back in 1950, when it was first released. Here is a film that covers and raises so many points and issues, and does so in a very grand and atmospheric manner. If director Joseph L. Mankiewicz was trying to raise points and debate surrounding Hollywood; the need for greed; that lust for being famous and the transition or rivalry between theatre and cinema then All About Eve can only be attributed to being an epic success.The primary reason this feels so fresh and the one manner in which you can read into All About Eve stems from the fact that whatever points Mankiewicz raises, they are still apparent here and now in our time. The film covers the life and certain times of higher-ups in the American entertainment industry, circa the late 1940s and early 1950s. We get all sorts of characters and various different view points revolving around the sole theme that greed, good looks and good stardom will see you through. The opening voice over is by that of Addison DeWitt, played by George Sanders. He is a critic of the theatre and goes around a room during an awards ceremony, pointing each person out. We are initially presented with this viewpoint of a critic; the smartest and eldest character in the film but the point of view quickly changes hands as the film wears on, giving us a rounded and fair perspective of the themes and events Mankiewicz will raise.So All About Eve is a tale of stardom; a rise through the ranks. It is a morality tale of how to act, how not to act and uncovers the mentality behind it all. Eve is played by Anne Baxter, she has an encounter with established actress of the stage Margo (Davis) and ends up in the dressing room full of mouthy servants; glamorous actresses and their equally handsome male partners \u0096 it is a large utopia within a very small room for Eve. Then there is the gradual obsession the film builds on regarding Eve and her idol Margo. Eve does not look at Margo, she gazes and the shot construction suggests so. Eve is willing to go not only the extra mile for Margo but just a little further, setting up phone calls and making her breakfast without any prior mentioning. Eve refers to Margo as 'mistress' and the film piles on all the necessary scenes that presume us to think she is a stalker what with her attending all the plays over and over.In fact the film is very tempting in its early establishment of these character conventions that it takes Margo's lover away from her. He must travel off on a train to Hollywood for more work, sort of paving the way for Eve to fill the space left empty by the male. But when the film unfolds and it appears the deeper issues are beginning to make themselves known, the themes of greed and disgust at the greed float to the surface. When a revelation involving Eve is made apparent, it seems that the lust for one certain female star was so great that Eve would stop at nothing to get to where she wants to be. This is where the themes can be applied to nowadays. Young girls even now are looking at pictures of female actresses, envying the faces; the build and the fashion statements. So much so that the line between being a 'fan' of someone and being obsessed by them becomes blurred and ambiguous in its retrospect.There can be no doubt that these days you do not need to have done much to be famous, not least in America in which All About Eve was also produced via and set. Starring in your own pornographic film; winning a reality TV programme; having the natural looks and physique as well as being in connection with a famous brand name are all sure fire ways to get noticed or famous \u0096 none of which require effort or intelligence and it is these people that we have younger people obsess over. It is a similar thing in All About Eve; an actress is huge in the theatre and garners a cult following \u0096 but one fan is mad enough to take it to the next level that they will lie and deceit their way to fame. Now, it is this ideation that in order to become 'someone' you do not particularly have to do 'anything'; something Mankiewicz touches on in this film when a lot of talking and soppy sounding stories get you 'into' a clique.There is a sad irony behind Marilyn Monroe playing Miss Casswell because she is really just playing herself. Additionally, there is a sad irony behind three of the cast being victims of suicide in years to come: Sanders who plays the critic; Barbara Bates who plays Phoebe (who adopts the role of 'Eve' when 'Eve' becomes 'Margo') and of course Monroe herself. All victims of stardom? All victims of their own success? It is still happening today with Hollywood stars not being able to take the weight and escapism through drugs doesn't help either. So greed and obsession with success is the theme: people wear 'Hollywood fur' even when they do not need it and when the show 'must go on', it is corrected as \"No, Margo must go on\". In Hollywood's 'golden age' of production, here is a film with themes that could well still count for today's era.",

None of them, however, reached the heights of All ABout Eve, the definitive testament to director Mankiewicz's superb acumen & sophistication. Every one of its characters is subtly and robustly nuanced. Using flashback (the movie is a huge flashback that starts from the moment Eve receives the prize in her hands), plenty of scenes with mirrors and narrative displacements, the film is an acidic and lucid study on compromise and the rise to fame. Cannibalistic Eve is Margo's good, hard-working friend who in reality just vampirizes all of Margo's gestures and tastes. Eve's character lives the same relationships of dependence as those experienced by characters in Fassbinder's Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, in its tasty self-mocking tone, as well as in Almod\u00f3var's variation on the same theme, Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Mankiewicz would once again address the world of theater and cinema icons in The Barefoot Countess (1954), a fine movie if far from a masterpiece like this one.",

Even without the Gofundme Campaign that would be necessary for me to Encyclopedically document the dozens of Fake News Scoops in EVE (or the thousands riddling the entire Body of the Fox Film Corpus), consider these two Norma Jean moments from EVE calling out \"Marilyn Monroe's\" most famous co-star and spouse BY THEIR REAL LIFE NAMES!! About 56 minutes into EVE, Marilyn's character \"Claudia\" says that she'll sacrifice \"anything\" for Clark Gable, an eerie foreshadowing of the co-star she'd leave with a fatal heart attack after plaguing him through the filming of his final flick, THE MISFITS a decade AFTER this comment is made in EVE. Twelve minutes later, Fox insures that its Fake News about a false-fronted bimbo seducing and ruining America's top playwright (EVE's \"Lloyd\" character) is cemented into American Culture's REAL LIFE Future as Arthur Miller is mentioned BY NAME in front of Artie's Looming Femme Fatale, nee Norma Jean Mortenson. Of course, it goes without saying that EVE--nee \"Gertrude Slojinski\"--and her back-story dalliance with a Royal Family of American Booze is sly Fox's way of including Jack and Bobby Kennedy among Ms. Mortenson's long list of Real Life victims.",

The storyline depicts a fading and insecure Broadway star, Margo Channing, who comes across a fan, Eve and takes her under her wing. Margo suffers from allowing herself from being happy due to her insecurities and complains that Eve wants her career and lover. Margo's personality is so over the top it's hard to tell if her complaints are justified or fabricated...Margo might not even know.This movie is directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Guys and Dolls) and stars Bette Davis (Dark Victory), Anne Baxter (The Ten Commandments), George Sanders (Rebecca), Hugh Marlowe (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Gary Merrill (Where the Sidewalk Ends) and Marilyn Monroe (Some Like it Hot).This storyline is very well told with great twists and turns that keeps the audience's attention and guessing what's going to happen next. Bette Davis' intensity, mannerisms and sharp tongue was perfect for this role. Her depiction of Margo's insecurities were perfectly executed. The attire for everyone throughout this film was magnificent, as were the sets and backdrops. The way people spoke to women and their opinions of them were fascinating and definitely provided insights on the times.Overall this movie is a classic with an all time great performance from Davis.

            "content": "1950 was a year for greatness in cinema, particularly when the awards season arrived. Two of the leading contenders were, ironically, films that explore some of the not-so great aspects of the world of show business. The films in question were Sunset Boulevard, as well as this film from writer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Ultimately, Mankiewicz's film would win six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. If there was any film that was worthy of defeating Sunset Boulevard for such honors, it was definitely this film.All About Eve is without a doubt one of the finest achievements in the history a cinema. The film is perfect in every conceivable aspect, everything to the brilliant writing and story to some of the best acting that I've honestly seen from any film, there isn't a single negative aspect to mention. It's also a film that has surprisingly stayed relevant with the passage of time, because like I said, it's a in depth look at some of the backstage drama of theater life, which shows, just as Sunset Boulevard did for Hollywood, that it wasn't is wonderful a place as it was made up to be.While Sunset Boulevard tackled the shadier aspects of Hollywood, this film treats Hollywood like an afterthought and instead focuses on stage and theater. In one of her most famous roles, Bette Davis stars as Margo Channing, an actress who is both renowned, and at the same time, rather temperamental. Before long, an aspiring actress named Eve Harrington enters the picture, in which she claims that she's fan of Channing's. At first, Eve seems relatively nice and innocent, but underneath this fa\u00e7ade, there's someone with ambitions of her own. It doesn't take much for Eve to discover Margo's blind spot and slowly begins to manipulate those around her to exploit Margo for her own purposes. And unfortunately, there are plenty of people like this in the world of entertainment, in which, through what some might say is the duper's delight, play up a form of naivety around someone already famous, while they secretly contain an aura of darkness to become something of their own.Joseph L. Mankiewicz certainly has a flair for storytelling. A large fraction of the film consists of dialogue, much like a play, which is appropriate considering the type of world that the film explores. But never once, does the film drag, Mankiewicz keeps the story compelling in away that one won't lose interest. As a matter of fact, when the film was over, I feel that it could've kept going because of how engaging it was. Further helping is the fact that the film contains an interesting assortment of characters that are all played to perfection. Never once did any of the characters in the film feel flat or weak, as all of them played a role that was vital to the story.And naturally, the acting from the all-star cast is by far some of the best that a film has to offer. Much like Margo and Eve do in the film, Bette Davis and Anne Baxter try to command attention whenever they are onscreen, and whenever they are interacting, it's hard to tell which one made the better effort. Though, maybe Baxter could have a reason to upstage Davis, since she was perfect at playing a character who can be very innocent at one point, and then be rather sinister at another. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe manage to shine in their roles as Margo's lover and playwright respectively, not to mention that Davis and Merrill had excellent chemistry with each other. Celeste Holm was also incredible, playing Karen Richards, Margo's best friend who finds herself inadvertently making a deal with the devil and ends up getting caught in the crossfire that ensues. And also, there was a huge scene stealer in the form of George Sanders, who plays Addison Dewitt, a conniving and devious journalist and critic. Every time that he was in front of the camera, all eyes were focused on him, with his dry cynicism making him a thrill to watch. It was no surprise that he would ultimately win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. One would be hard pressed to say that they've found better acting in a film than this one, because the actors couldn't have done a better job than they did here, even Marilyn Monroe (in an early role) manages to make a great contribution to the acting, in which she also has a tendency to capture the audience's attention when she's onscreen.Ultimately, All About Eve has held up perfectly since 1950, as it is still one of the greatest movies ever made. In addition to being a cinematic masterpiece, it also presents a blunt and honest look at the theater business and the lengths that one will go to in order to obtain stardom, which is shown in one of the most enthralling stories from any movie in cinematic history, with one of the greatest screenplays every written. Reiterating, the film more than deserves its reputation as a classic, as it is cinema at its absolute best.",

Despite the joint theme the films are very different in other respects.\nThe character of Margo Channing (Bette Davis) in \"All about Eve\" is very cynical but also very realistic over the phase her career is in. The character of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in \"Sunset boulevard\" on the other hand has completely lost sight of reality.\nBoth Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson were not only playing aging actresses, they were aging actresses themselves. For Bette Davis her role as Margot Channing was the beginning of a come back. For Gloria Swanson \"Sunset boulevard\" was really (a glorious) end of career.\nThe main attraction of \"All about Eve\" are the rasor sharp dialogues. The main attraction of \"Sunset boulevard\" are the design elements relating to a German expressionist silent movie (being the era in which Norma Desmond really was successful).\nApart from Bette Davis, for which \"All about Eve\" was a come back vehicle, there are some other interesting points about the cast to make. Anne Baxter plays the inexperienced but ambitious admirer ready to take the place of Margot.

            "content": "\"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\", the more I watch \"All About Eve\", Best Picture of 1950, the more I wonder what exactly this 'All' is about. Is it about Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), the central character who's introduced on the night she wins the prestigious Sarah Siddons Award, which is to theater what the Oscar is to cinema? Is it about Margo Channing (Bette Davis), the aging star? Is it about Eve's insatiable ambition? Is it about the friendship of Karen (Celeste Holm) or the suspicion of Birdie (Thelma Ritter)? Is it about imitation? Deception? Life imitating Art or Art deceiving life? Is it about theater? Jealousy? Love? Passion? Manipulation? I guess there are many possibilities that could came up from such interrogations but maybe, we can put all these words in a same box with three letters graved in: E-V-E, but simply Eve, as a more poetic word to define womankind. Not that the movie has a pretension to show both the bright and dark sides of female nature, but it sure has a little pedagogic value about it, isn't it fitting that the film received the most Oscar nominations for female acting performances (all the actresses I mentioned in that paragraph)? And now before I would go on, please don't treat my words too cynically \u0085 after all, I didn't make the film, so put the blame on Joseph L. Mankiewicz.I admit I cheated a bit to come to that conclusion, the movie says it itself in the trailer: \"All About Eve\" is all about women \u0085 and their men. However, I didn't really care for most of the male characters, only foils for the fair sex, the real star of the film, but still, and this was the masterstroke of Mankiewicz's Oscar-winning script, whatever the male supporting cast lacked was contained in one single male character, the critic, Addison DeWitt (the Oscar-winning George Sanders), the man who devoted his life to theater with a level of passion that could've only been equaled by Eve's devouring ambition. Addison is not just the narrator of the film, our confident, THE Man, he's also the match for Eve, because he combines two essential qualities: understanding women and having the ability to overpower them. He understands women because all his work consists on guiding people's feeling into his personal ones, guiding as a euphemism for manipulating, he can fool but not be fooled, and he overpowers women, because he still have enough principles not to let himself blinded by his heart. Margo has the principles, Eve has the manipulative power, but Addison has both. Addison is the perfect neutral barometer to help us understanding women.Margo has the principles, she might be capricious but this is only the expression of an ego that became fragile since the big 4 have been reached. Margo is stuck in the middle-age crisis that expresses itself on stage when some roles get more difficult to play with credibility. She hides her vulnerable lack of self-confidence in a sort of diva attitude that makes her lower her guard when Karen introduces her to a young fan named Eve. Margo is first flattered by Eve's humility and devotion. Progressively, Eve's zealous nature starts to annoy her. At the end, Eve finally unmasked the true nature of her personality, an extraordinary mastermind of blind ambition, and probably the most memorable cinematic bitch since Veda Pierce. Eve's power would ultimately contribute to Margo's redemption after a powerful moment of personal evaluation, and even if Eve wins at the end, literally, she has lost something precious: the integrity that provides the independence. Margo is independent because she owes nothing to anyone; she's a true star because she sacrificed her own stardom for happiness, while Eve sacrificed her integrity for stardom. Swinging between the two opposite poles of female nature, \"All About Eve\" is a gender study with the theater world as a clever subplot. I say clever because in a way, Eve's attitude conveys whatever theater is about: acting, illusion, inspiring desired feelings, notice how we never see Eve on stage, if only to get a glimpse on her incredible talent. But do we need to? Isn't Eve's behavior all about acting, pretending to be what she's not. She might overact here and there but overall, she's convincing, because no one could ever guess that behind this angelic face, is hidden the heart of a she-wolf. The revelation of her true hypocritical and unethical ambition that earned her the #16 position from AFI's Top 50 Villains might come late in the film but it makes the dry and immediate slap she gets from DeWitt after she laughed at him even more satisfying, it's probably the most rewarding scene of all the film. Eve is an eternal actress treating her entourage as a supporting cast before being straightened out by Addison DeWitt, the one who could kill her character off at any moment.\"All About Eve\" is about theater as much as its eternal rival \"Sunset Boulevard\" is about cinema, both worlds are embodied by their female lead characters, Eve Harrington and Norma Desmond, or both mirroring a pivotal moment in the lead actresses' respective careers: Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis. Both Best Picture nominees question the notions of success, but we finally understand, that it's only the institutions that throne and dethrone, and audiences that applaud or boo, cherish or forget. An actor or an actress are simply puppets dancing on strings held by these institutions, maybe being a star is being the true conductor of one's success. This is why Eve, contrarily to Margo would never be a star, there will always be Addison in front of her, and behind her, a wannabe Eve, hiding in a box of admiration an eagerness to take her place.Well, I guess this is what the ending shot of \"All About Eve\" is all about",

Baxter and Davis were both nominated for the best actress Oscar, while the all-star supporting cast garnered three more nominations, with George Sanders winning the best supporting actor award for his darkly comic turn as snobbish critic Addison DeWitt.Having starred numerous times on the Broadway stage, Bette Davis was a natural choice to be paired with \"All About Eve\" writer and director Joseph Mankiewicz, who just a year earlier had won a pair of Oscars for \"Letter to Three Wives,\" an outstanding drama on the theme of marital infidelity. It wasn't only Mankiewicz's phenomenal success that made him the ideal director for Davis, but also the interest he shared with his star in presenting women as independent and strong-minded \u0096 tough as any man.No discussion of \"All About Eve\" would be complete without a mention of the Oscar winning costume designs of Edith Head, who is responsible for the supremely tasteful high fashion costumes in \"Eve.\" Edith Head won more Oscars than any other woman in the history of the academy awards. Her gorgeous gowns have adorned Hollywood's best loved leading ladies, including Mae West, Ginger Rogers, Olivia de Haviland, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor and countless others.Ironically, \"All About Eve\" was remade in the 1970's, not as a movie, but as a stage play on Broadway and the aging actress chosen to play the role made famous by Bette Davis was instantly recognizable to all fans of the film as Miss Davis's original co-star, Anne Baxter \u0096 making it seem as if Eve Harrington had finally succeeded in transforming herself completely into Margo Channing.",

            "content": "Nominated for a staggering 14 Academy Awards, out of which it won 6 including Best Picture, All About Eve is a classic amalgamation of brilliant direction, excellent screenplay, sophisticated production, outstanding performances & sparkling use of humour and covers the themes of ambition, betrayal, self-interest, fame & fate in the world of show business.All About Eve tells the story of Eve Harrington; an ambitious young woman who maneuvers her way into the life of Margo Channing, a prominent but ageing stage actress & her circle of theatre friends, to pursue her very own interests on Broadway. Hiding her true nature with a well-worn mask of modesty, Eve's well-planned schemes ultimately lead to the downfall of Margo's career.Written & directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, All About Eve opens on an interesting note by cleverly introducing all the relevant characters to the viewers before flashing back a year to portray Eve's meteoric rise from an outsider to the newest & brightest star on stage, which in turn also adds a sinister tone to the devious means she used to get on top. And the script is just as good as Mankiewicz's direction.The screenplay brims with sharp dialogues, terrific use of humour, fleshed out characters & wonderfully layered storyline and the entire plot is smartly narrated from start to finish. The greyscale photography & fluid movements of the camera keeps a safe distance but patiently observes every character's actions. Editing is skilfully carried out but the last act feels a bit stretched as its runtime is slowly realised in those final moments.Coming to the performances, All About Eve features a marvellous cast in Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm & others plus we also have Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest roles here. Davis plays Margo with remarkable finesse and her performance only gets better as the story progresses. Baxter is equally fitting too as the manipulative Eve and this film is mainly her story, while the supporting cast chips in with strong contributions.On an overall scale, All About Eve packs in all the ingredients that one can find in any great feature, is a rivetingly told drama that's about women in entertainment industry & their men, and from its opening moments till the final shot, maintains a firm grip on viewers' attention. Living up to its legacy, exhibiting an irresistible charm throughout its runtime, and powered by captivating performances from Davis & Baxter, All About Eve is an absolute delight that comes thoroughly recommended.",

            "content": "All About Eve is perhaps the most perceptive film ever made and the American theater. Wickedly funny, yet with the foresight of it's era, perhaps the most grounded film of it's day. We are introduced to the characters as they sit through a knowing, yet curiously boring speech at the Sarah Siddons Awards (today, it would be the Tony's). Addison DeWitt, that creature of the theater, introduces us to the majority of the cast in a voice over effect. Surprisingly, most of the cast reacts as if they can hear every word Addison is saying (if you don't believe me, watch Bette Davis' and Celest Holmes' reactions especially). As Addison comes to end of his recitation, he introduces us to the character who the film is ostensibly about, Eve Harrington, the actress being honored by the old actor's speech. She also seems to react to Addison, believing the attention being paid to her is only her due. At that point, just is Eve is about to accept the award, the narration shifts to Karen Richards, the playwright's wife, the \"lowest form of celebrity\" as she herself says. It is important at that juncture that Karen continues, as she is the woman who has unwisely unleashed Eve on the theater, and it's greatest star, Margo Channing. One never not believes that Margo is the greatest star. Even the fact that the young upstart has momentarily diverted the spotlight, it will always return to Margo. We then see most of the cast backstage in Margo's dressing room the night Karen introduces Eve to Margo. Even at that early moment, Eve knows just exactly how to worm her way in, to use her affected guilelessness to her advantage. Eve continues to work her scheme, unaware that she has been noticed by someone who understands her all too well, Addison DeWitt. Their teaming will cause the havoc that this film wrought. But Eve will find herself trapped by her unholy alliance, and by a young woman who knows that Eve is every bit as gullible as her rival, Margo Channing.Is this the Best film of 1950. The Academy thought so in 1950, though now, most critics prefer Sunset Boulevard. The central performance in All About Eve, though, is more realistic and therefore to me the better performance. But there was no way Hollywood would ever have give the Academy Award to Bette, or to Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. Their performances hit too close to home for the Academy and they would never have rewarded those performances.The most jarring scene for me in the film is when Karen and Margo are sitting in Karen and Lloyd's car, out of gas on a deserted New England road. Margo give a speech that was EXACTly the speech Hollywood (and to be fair American society) expected in 1950. When a great actress tells Karen (and the women in the audience) that none of it is worth while without a man. Remember that this was 1950. A woman as bright and strong as Margo Channing couldn't do all this without a man in her life and be the little homemaker. While it provides the catalyst for Margo to return to her fianc\u00e9e director, Bill Sampson (played by the man who would become Bette Davis' fourth husband), to me it is unnecessary. Margo did NOT need a man to be complete, however, Eve could never have survived without a man as an audience for her conniving.The performances in this film are as brilliant as the dialog, with one minor flaw in my opinion. Bette Davis is simply glorious, possibly not the best performance in her career, but the one she NEEDED to give at that point in her career. George Sanders is splendidly oily as Addison. Thelma Ritter as Birdie Coonan, Margo's assistant and confidant, is a wonder. The one off kilter performance is unfortunately Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington. She is fine in the earliest scenes, as the nervous fan, but too obviously smug as the woman who uses her friends to get what she wants. The performance is still better than most of the performances in films at that time, though Bette Davis herself could have played the part of Eve better.Probably the best comedy Hollywood ever made at the end of it's Golden Era, it is a film that requires multiple views to truly understand.",

So we took along my VHS tape (which I gladly relinquished to one of them, since I'd just recently acquired the new DVD version) to the beach house we'd rented for a few days and, at first, reluctantly closed the drapes on a picture window overlooking a spectacularly moonlit bay!  But I once again was enthralled from the first moments of George Sanders' voiceover and my sisters agreed that watching it was worth the brief respite we took from gazing upon the awesome natural beauty outside that window which so enhanced our time together.\"All About Eve\" has it all (except, perhaps, color cinematography, not at all necessary, of course): a pitch-perfect cast, Joe Mankiewicz at the top of his form as writer/director, one of Alfred Newman's most subtly tasteful music scores, and top-notch professionals working their magic in all of the crafts that contribute to an absolutely satisfying viewing experience.It's a bit dated, especially that scene when Eve, Margo and Bill go to the airport and waltz to the gate with nary a security guard, screening device, bomb-sniffing dog, or a harassed and impatient fellow traveler in sight! Boy!  Those were the days!My only complaint is Thelma Ritter's too-brief role as Birdie.  But she did get some of the most delicious lines, including that one when she comments on Eve's sad (but utterly fabricated) tale, told to the film's main characters assembled backstage in Margo's dressing room: \"What a story! Everything but the hounds snappin' at her rear end.\"Whatever one can say about the tyranny of those moguls of the major studios, you have to give Darryl F.

Why waste over 2 hours on a movie about a bunch of stuffed shirt snobs and their irritating pretenses? There are better things to do with your time, such as watching virtually any other movie made by Darryl F.

These were entertaining pictures which could be watched over and over, still enjoyed. In Eve she plays an overambitious cutthroat aspiring actress, who is oh so dull to watch.The entire boring mess is about Broadway, its stars and creative talent. Taking a cue from Walt Disney's Thumper, who said, \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nuthin' at all.\" Here it goes: There's not one homosexual in All About Eve. If you see a Broadway play in 2006, just try finding a play or musical WITHOUT a homosexual theme. Of 20 current ones, not so many as 5 are non-homosexual. And this year's Tony went to a play that advocates homosexual teachers preying on their minor students. Oh, they don't tell you about that until after you buy the ticket.Off subject, sorry. \"All About Eve\" was hands-down the worst picture to win an Oscar during the 1950's when some really great films were made.

            "content": "All About Eve came out in 1950, the same year as Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder's subversive portrayal of Hollywood and its actors. Mankiewicz was equally scathing in his look at the world of Broadway stage, portraying the mythical ruthlessness and petulance of stage actors. Both were big hits, and All About Eve was nominated for a record fourteen Oscars, winning six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing. It's the best film about theatre that I've seen, also happening to say more about the film industry too. Sunset Boulevard might be the film about stars that dwell in the glory days of the past and live in self-delusion, but All About Eve shows how they got like that.Like Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve tells its story in the form of a flashback. It all kicks off with the presentation of a prestigious stage-acting award to the eponymous Eve Harrington, accompanied by the commentary of theatre critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders). He introduces us to the players in the world of Broadway before we go 9 months back in history before Eve was a star. The film then charts the story Eve and how she has wormed her way into the acting clan. She does so by getting into a circle of theatre friends around an aging (and insecure about it) actress Margo Channing, whom she attempts to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of, using her a persona of friendliness and self-deprecation to mask a sinister plan of getting to the top.All About Eve is an absolute treat in terms of acting. The role of the older actress, Margo Channing, was considered for a range of in-form actresses, from Gertrude Lawrence (wanted script changes that the director did not), Susan Hayward (too young), Claudette Colbert (pulled out back injury), Marlene Dietrich (Mankiewicz didn't love her), and Ingrid Bergman (would not leave Italy) before Bette Davis was finally chosen. And it's the role of her lifetime, playing a character that ran only too true \u0096 a brilliant actress, but one who felt her time was running out. Bette Davis knew she was handed a dream role when she was cast as the resolute diva caught up in the throes of mid-life crisis both on- and off-stage, and she's amazing her in performance. She's selfish and tough yet at the same time, vulnerable and insecure. Getting suspicious about her increasingly distrustful follower Eve, Margo lets her friends know that she doesn't trust her, though they, taken to Eve's put-on niceness, disagree, mistaking her fear for jealousy and harshness. Not willing to resolve the problem in a dignified way, Margo goes on a rampage and has a go at anyone who comes near her. Bette Davis was born to play Margo Channing and, in my opinion, is even better than Swanson in Sunset Blvd. She can be a catty cow or a coy pussycat, and Davis loves every scene she gets to tear into. At the same time, however, she evokes real sympathy for Margo. The film may be titled All About Eve, but Margo is and always will be the real star of the movie.Her supporting cast are to die for. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo's sensible best friend, who at first is on Eve's side but eventually sees how conniving she can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. When she took on the narration, I just got the feeling that things would turn out alright for Margo. She's the closest character to any of the audience throughout the movie, as, she is pretty much a spectator herself. Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe are a joy in their respective roles as Margo's boyfriend and playwright. George Sanders plays his trademark role as the cad with such cynicism and unfriendliness that it's no wonder he bagged the Oscar. As the diabolical theatre critic, he has some of the best lines of the movie. Thelma Ritter again proves why she is the best supporting player in the biz - as coarse but loyal Birdie Coonan, a member of Margo's \"drone\". Anne Baxter is pretty good as the sneaky Eve, though obviously my opinion of her performance is tainted by the fact that I despise her character (realistic as it was). There's even space for a Marylin Monroe cameo, in which she steals the show in the dumb-blonde role that she would carry for the rest of her acting life.All About Eve's screenplay is another one of its assets. Written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz from the Mary Orr play \"The Wisdom of Eve,\" it features strong characters and great dialogue that is witty, bitching and biting. Despite its running time, at nearly 2 and a half hours, it never drags on. Each of the characters are so perfectly drawn, you could imagine them doing things just like that in the 50s. Femininity, aging, betrayal, manipulation and ambition are just a few of the themes touched upon in All About Eve. It's funny, but it's also a lot cleverer than it looks. It's got melodrama, yet somehow never goes over the top. All About Eve takes the age-old story of a young performer buttering up an old one, with the intention of usurping them, but makes it into something new, something utterly brilliant. Not to be missed.",

We don't see it happening, but the wisdom of people like Eve keeps sneaking up on us all the time...and bringing us down when we least expect it. Therefore, \"All About Eve\" still couldn't be extended to be just the entertainment industry, although the movies and \"Sunset Boulevard\" seem to take it all in their stride. It remains a wonder how a film made half a century ago still can retain a lot of its thought content value. THIS is a movie about the throes of human nature...and all in disguise of film epitome glamour, other lives and Bette Davis. At the time of release, it was viewed as provocative. In other words, Hollywood, still in the Hayes Code era but heading dangerously close towards the end of the Golden era, basically didn't like the truth. \"Eve\" is not made in the obscene sense of being provocative, but it is perhaps more for Joseph L. Manckiewicz's crisp writing and direction. \"A Letter to Three Wives\" is my personal favourite of his films, but it was that film which paved the way for his glory days at the FOX studios. It is not my favourite Bette Davis movie, but deserving credit, she brings home her strongest performance here by stealing the show. Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm, some of the strongest FOX studio supporting actors, all turn in respectable performances. Finally, Marilyn Monroe features in a small role, but noticable role, pre-exploitation period.\nDespite this, the film dipped a fair way short of my expectations. It has been more than a year since I viewed this film, and since it was during the period of early classics days, I could provide a better judgement of the film. This could be an indication that \"Eve\" is a film that I should have another viewing of. Perhaps bitchy soap opera type films don't always entice me...or perhaps \"Eve\" still pales to a more compelling \"Sunset Boulevard\" which remains more worthy of taking out Oscar's top golden statuette for 1950.

However, as an audience who is interested in cinematic elements (is it strange?), All About Eve cannot be masterpiece. The way of story telling was not impressive at all and this causes the movie to be uninteresting most of the time. In other words, can I say that it was not dramatically powerful? There is not any sound scene except the final and the scene which Marilyn Monroe appears was very nice. She added color into the film, she breaths life into the film. And as said, the alarming final was stunning. I love Sunset Boulevard, because cinematically (includes everything) it was great and impressive. And why I have compared All About Eve with Sunset Boulevard? because, they are alike in terms of the thematic element, probably, many people would agree with me at this point. Sunset criticizes the world of cinema industry, Eve criticizes theater industry.

Everyone surely knows the story by now so I won't go into that, but I will say Eve's six Oscars (and at the time, 14 nominations, still a record tied only by Titanic) were ALL well deserved.The cast: what to say? They're all perfect. You can tell they are relishing Mankiewicz' adroit dialogue to the max, and truly enjoying themselves. It's addictive.My favorites are Thelma Ritter and the Oscar-winning George Sanders and some dame I'll bring up in a minute. Anne Baxter rightly campaigned to be considered for a Best Actress Oscar (instead of supporting); she after all is the title character and gets the memorable closing sequence along with bit player Barbara Bates (her only notable role, but it is VERY notable).Alfred Newman's score is excellent if sparingly used, and relative newcomer Marilyn Monroe's few scenes are startlingly effective.And then of course there is Bette Davis in one of best late-career roles (she still had Baby Jane on the horizon). Davis underplays until she is required to unleash, and then unleash she does. She is particularly effective with her scenes with Ritter and Celeste Holm (whom she loathed, but you can't tell from what's on screen).Holm is no slouch here either and has one of the movie's best scenes, a ladies' room encounter with the conniving Baxter.I have watched All About Eve countless times and when it pops up on TV, I can't turn it off.One of Hollywood's crowning achievements. And then some. To this day, the definitive film about \"theatre folk.\"",

            "content": "\"All About Eve\" is set in a vanished world, the glitzy \"Golden Age of Broadway.\" But, remarkably, the film doesn't seem dated. This classic tale of ambition and manipulation features characters real enough that you can imagine the same story happening today. Scheming Eve Harrington insinuates herself into the life, and eventually the career, of aging actress Margo Channing. A vivid array of theatre types either help or hinder Eve as she rises to fame; they include Margo's younger boyfriend/director Bill, famous playwright Lloyd and his wife Karen, Margo's sharp-tongued maid, and influential critic Addison DeWitt. The characters are well-drawn, with many foibles; nearly everyone behaves stupidly or cruelly at least once.The screenplay for \"All About Eve\" was based on a short story, and at times the film feels too literary or talky or stagy. Scenes tend to be long, as they are in stage plays, rather than short, as is usual in the movies. The camera work is fluid and competent, the lighting is bright and professional, but they lack that cinematic spark. Still, though, it's hard to say exactly how to change the screenplay\u0097it's full of witty observations about life and the theatre, which would be a shame to lose.Bette Davis deserves all the praise she gets for this role, and the movie loses a lot when she's not in it (especially toward the end). I was struck by how she conveys Margo's larger-than- life personality, the \"actress who can't stop performing,\" while also showing us Margo's real human needs. George Sanders is excellent as Addison DeWitt (was there ever a more perfectly named character?), gradually revealing the slime beneath his cultured persona. Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe are great fun.The character of Bill is supposed to be 32 years old, prompting 40-year-old Margo to fret about how she's losing her looks and dating a younger man. Gary Merrill acts the role of Bill well enough, but he looks at least as old as Bette Davis, making this plot line somewhat unbelievable. Celeste Holm and Hugh Marlowe, playing Karen and Lloyd, are unremarkable. And I still can't decide how I feel about Anne Baxter's performance in the major role of the manipulative Eve.Though \"All About Eve\" has its flaws (I'll admit it, I prefer \"Sunset Boulevard\"), it's a smart movie, with an excellent script and some wonderful performances. Cynical and entertaining, it will make you wonder whether you know any modern-day \"Eves\".",

While much can and has been said about the superb acting, what makes this film so memorable for me is the writing. The story of Eve's diabolical ascent is simply so compelling and perfectly done that it's one of those rare perfect stories of fiction, the kind writers will be ripping off and using as inspiration for centuries. On top of a delightful story, the dialogue is crisp, intelligent, and in combination with the acting, almost realistic (of course, no one really talks like these people, but it would be a lot of fun if they did).All About Eve is essential viewing.

Generally the story holds up pretty well after six decades. In my book, that's because Eve (Baxter) amounts to a compelling portrait in perverse psychology, quite apart from a show-biz setting. Eve literally connives her way to the top of the Broadway heap by shrewdly separating an outer poor-little-me from an inner backstabbing-schemer. To me, her perverse character can unfortunately be found in many walks of life. Here her scheming makes good dramatic use of a competitive Broadway setting, but can also be found outside that high profile venue. I agree with most of the positive remarks about the film. But I can also understand why some folks find the lack of action and snobbish setting off-putting. That's one reason I've emphasized that Eve represents a broader personality type rather than just a single movie character. So if you don't like the movie's context, you may still find Eve's personality type interesting-- the type whose inner person separates from the outer for purely selfish reasons, which Eve represents in spades",

I am not exaggerating when I say I could reel off three hundred lines of that film at a crack! I also like that director Mankiewicz took on some then-controversial mores. It is obvious that premarital sex is happening, the George Sanders character is so venomous that I think Mankiewicz STUDIED George Gene Nathan or something. Ignore those who call this film cynical; this is a slice of life in the theater of the late 1940s to 1950, and Broadway reviewers are known to be some of the harshest critics in the world; if you can't handle this, avoid the film. My own favorite strategem employed by Mankiewicz is during the party scene, when they are all sitting on a staircase. Some question if all the hard work is worth it, the business is a charade, and so forth, and the Ann Baxter stops them and equates applause with an orgasm! Brilliant! Says she in this scene, \"Why if there's nothing else, there's applause. <i>It's like waves of love flooding up over the footlights and enfolding you</i>.\" Ha!

Even if you haven't actually *seen* the film, you just can't consider yourself a movie fan if you haven't at least heard of it.There is so much to dwell on with this film--the direction, the script (zingers flying so thick and fast it would take years and about 100 viewings to get them all straight, much less memorise them!), its clever themes. What makes it stand out, though, really is the cast that was assembled to bring it to the screen. Bette Davis never gave a finer performance than her Margo Channing here--at times shrewish and a harlot, at others vulnerable and little more than a child. Who could have pulled it off but her? Ann Baxter too does fine, subtle work as the Eve of the title: it's a difficult role to pull off with the proper complexity that will allow for varying interpretations of the character. Baxter manages it. The supporting cast is fine as well, Celeste Holm (almost unrecognisable from her turn in 'High Society') as the gullible good friend Karen; Gary Merrill playing Margo's paramour to great and believable effect; and yes, the Oscar-winning George Sanders as the ultimate slimeball, Addison DeWitt. And who could forget Marilyn Monroe in her small part? She glitters--all \"fire and magic\"--even in the ten minutes of screen time she has.A fine, fine film--one of the best of the backstage films Hollywood was so fond of producing. Brilliant writing, with the story told through interspersed different points of view. Great observation, as well, of some of the things that make women, especially career women, tick. Yes, it *is* somewhat sexist, with the claim that whatever career a female has, she must ultimately work at being a *woman*. It's not a belaboured point though, thank goodness.

Also, this film had some similarities to another film \"Sunset Boulevard\" which was released in the same year. While the latter was terrific in writing and wonderful in acting. This film, All About Eve is different in terms of writing and involves 4 principal women who have their friendships, their careers at stake.Eve Harrington played by Anne Baxter seems to be an extremely determined woman who goes to any length to get what she wants. From creating a false story to coldly intimidating her friend for a role in play, she is cold blooded and yet adorable. Anna Baxter played the role superbly and credit goes to the writing and her lines, more than half her job was done by the good writing itself.The next most important character, I saw was of Margo Channing played superbly by Bette Davis. She is generous and yet very possessive and has a humane nature under the embellishments of fame. She is indeed the true gem of the film and takes the script and writing to a high by her portrayal of the character. \"Tonight I forgive all, I forgive Eve\" can't be said in much more cold way than how Bette said. Great acting by a superb actress. Even the other women, like Celeste Holm who played Karen Richards or the final character that is \"Phoebe\" played by Barabara Bates or even Birdie played by Thelma Ritter are well written and played well. This is essentially a film about women more than men.The production design is superb and the music adds to the drama. I wish, the editing could have been better and the dialogs were crisp. Especially the long climax between Karen and Eve could have been cut short. Also, many moments would have been done away with reducing the time and also easing out the pace. Perhaps, the director Joseph Mankiewicz had been persistent to give detailing to every scene and thus made it the way it stand today. It's fine though but I wish it could have been greater than being just good, as per me.A 3/5 for this, I liked it nevertheless, yet did not fall in love with it. I loved \"Sunset Boulevard\" though. I expected this film to be better and maybe that is the flaw, it's just good by all means.",

Hey it's a big deal to me). The story is a haughty and over-confident woman being upstaged by a younger, manipulative starlet. It's a powerful film and a cautionary tale about getting too comfortable in one's position of power. There will always been someone working to overpower you in your field. You must always remain on top of your game. The game is never over either, for in the end when Eve feels she has one, a new challenger appears, and she realizes with horror that she is now where her old opponent once was.",

Yes but not in the top 100 films of all time. The acting was good but I wasn't overpowered by any scene. I didn't sense romantic chemistry between the various couples, for example, and didn't buy it when the characters managed to forgive each other after each outburst. I found that the narration was unnecessary. Everything that happens on stage is hidden from the viewer... we hardly get a feeling that we're in the theater business, so rarely do we see theatergoers. And on a totally wild note, does anyone besides me think that Anne Baxter looks like Kathleen Turner?Despite these minor flaws, the pacing was good, the story captivating, and there's a great ending.Who should see this film:-- Anyone curious about classics but worried about being bored, this one's safe. Note, however, that it's in black and white.-- Theater vixens fighting their way to the top. And see \"Working Girl\" and \"Heartbreakers\" too.I believe that old films should be rated for how they play today, not originally. But All About Eve still packs a punch. I'll give it an 8 out of 10.",

As played by Anne Baxter, Eve's character is the consummate performer as she uses everything in her power to be drawn into the inner circle, then to extract from her friends all that she needs for success.The acerbic dialogue of Joseph Mankiewicz always drives home scathing points about the shallow, narcissistic perceptions of the stars with a killer instinct. As one character asserts to another of a recent tribute, \"You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.\"The most memorable character is Margo, as played by the incomparable Bette Davis. A remarkable transformation occurs as Margo begins to look on the world of the theater with irony, accepting the Eve Harringtons as a reality of life. Margo makes an effective transition from the all-consuming world of the star to the recognition of the good things in life when she agrees to marry Bill.The film is deservedly a classic with a unique niche in presenting the tragic underbelly of seekers of fame. The film is worth watching for the hotel room confrontation between the nefarious critic and the ruthless rising star. For posterity, Gertrude Slokinski is unmasked for playing sexual politics at a local brewery, being run out of town, and taking her act to Broadway.",

            "content": "*** SPOILERS FROM VERY BEGINNING!***\nI had always heard OF All About Eve. Fortunately, I had never really heard much ABOUT the movie. I am most thankful for that, now! When I finally got a chance to see it over Christmas, I went in knowing only that it was about backstage Broadway life and that Bette Davis had received rave reviews for her performance. Therefore, I was totally na\u00efve, entering Joseph L. Mankiewicz's world.I was totally stunned by the final 20% of the movie & how far afield my judgment of Eve had been! I pity the viewers who have already heard how things turn out before watching it. I then, naturally, went back and watched a second time, knowing what everyone else probably knew to begin with. This really helped me see what a master work of film craft this was!I came away amazed at how my (and probably most na\u00efve first-time viewers) opinion of Margo Channing and Eve Harrington changed between my first viewing of the first \u00be of the film and my second viewing! Ms. Davis certainly deserved all the praise she received for this role! Seemingly conceited, vain, childish, selfish and totally paranoid, to Eve's gentle sweetness, Margo winds up emerging as a tremendously more likeable human being than her devious understudy. Childish, vain, selfish? Perhaps-although probably less than many would have been in her position. Paranoid? Ha! As hindsight showed, of course, she is the only one with enough intuition to mistrust Eve. Despite her foibles, Davis' Margo emerges as a thoroughly human, decent person. It is hard to come up with adjectives for Eve in a family website!All About Eve could represent the last gasp of the glory days of Hollywood. Box office receipts were already down, television was beginning to take its huge bite and experiments with everything from 3D to Smellorama were just a few years away. So were the dark, troubled films of rebellion, as the studios gave up on the old formulas for the most part. All About Eve took the old formula and showed just how well it could work. The acting of Davis and Anne Baxter (Eve) is superb, as is that of George Sanders (the appropriately-named columnist Addison DeWitt), Celeste Holm (Karen), Gary Merrell (Bill) and Hugh Marlowe (Lloyd). The cinematography is wonderful and the script a true joy. Listening to the good-natured bickering and cajoling between Margo and her long-time maid Birdie (Thelma Ritter) is delightful. So are little touches like the exchange after Karen (having unwittingly betrayed Margo) breaks into uncontrollable laughter after Margo announces she no longer feels the need to play characters half her age \u0096 and Margo's delightfully instinctive move to scoot her wine glass away from her as she does.Of course, is was 1950, not 1955. None of the married or semi-married men (We assume Addison is a bachelor) go for Eve's seduction ploys. She gets hers when she realizes Addison `owns' her. (Incidentally, this may have been the only time I have ever grinned [though just a little] when a man slapped a woman on screen.) And, of course, in the end, we see Eve opening the door to an Eve of her own. Poetic justice still prevailed in Hollywood-and when it was this well-done, old-fashion morals and sentiment worked as well as ever. Not many more movies like Eve would be made. Then again, All About Eve is timeless and will always be there for new generations. All About Eve was really All About What Makes a Great Film.",

It takes it for granted that the viewer will want to be subjected to hours of flat-footed, uninspired misogyny, humorless misanthropy, indulgent self-loathing and contempt for \"ethnic\" people of lower classes, as well as thespians and their fans. This movie isn't even original, it's a remake of \"A Star Is Born\" smothered in vile sentiment. A more fitting title would be \"A Steer Is Born\". This is an emotionally cruel movie, and its writer emerges as the main villain, peddling insult as insight. Where is his love of humanity? Where is his compassion? Indeed, where is his sense of beauty? He doesn't even TRY to create something beautiful, which makes his failure all the more repellent. He seems to think there are only two kinds of people: the stupid and the vile. He cranks up his cynicism to such a degree, that nothing whatsoever could pass inspection.

Stage star Margo is not old, she's vintage, fit and frisky, quite beautiful really, but the bloom has clearly come off her rose as the drinking and too-clever quips attest.If there were an Eve Harrington Fan Club, I'd be a member. Not that I'm anti-Margo, she's swell, in a sad sort of way, but Harrington gets a bad rap, even as Scarlett O'Hara and Jackie Brown are her kindred spirits. If Eve were a man, or Bette wasn't the lead, she'd win high-praise for her off-stage performance and single-minded determination to succeed in the same class as cinema legends Tom 'Chisholm-Trail' Dunson (Red-River) and Jett 'Oil-Rag' Rink (Giant). And when she hits Tinseltown, her Studio will save any dirt that caustic critic DeWitt will dish (Sanders), he who likes to shoot fish in a barrel (Casswell), for contract talks with their new investment, then tie a knot in Addy's tail, or, if Eve prefers, turn the blackmailer into Messala ground-round.Don't be too quick to take sides in this testy, tectonic plate shift because this story is everyone's story who has climbed that ladder to success. Vicki Lester aside, Stars are not born, they are made, in a business that leaves no room for sentiment. Talent helps, hard work's a must, but even marvy Margo doesn't make it onto the marquee without cutting in line on ocassion and working some clever cons herself. Enter Phoebe, a late arrival played by Barbara Bates, she, the writer's hammer, driving home the point that MC, Eve and the new kid in the dressing room are all part of one, big acting eco-system where the only givens are survival of the fittest and the endless stream of young hopefuls who dream of fame. The diva would've served herself better had she accepted those truths and been mentor (Shearer-Leigh) to the precocious but unpolished new star, an act of grace and a first step towards a possible directing career, rather than stewing in bitters & gin, only to boil over in a cringey display of self-pity (\"Little Miss Eveil\").And watch for the best line in this cornucopia of wise-cracks at midway (138m). That's right, watch for it. In a movie that's nearly all dialogue and quoted as often as Shake-Speare's Hamlet and Book of Psalms, the best statement makes not one sound, save the soft caress of a pricey garment and producer's giggle, as Margo playfully drags her mink-coat over the seated Max factor. Ahhh, to be under Bette Davis' fur (3/4).",

That, however is not the rarity I refer to; the rarity is that the film is deserving of the praise. It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars- a record tied only by the abysmal Titanic, in 1997- a film that represents an almost polar extreme from this film, in that it was all glitz and special effects, and had a terrible screenplay- one that dates Titanic, made almost a half century later, far more than All About Eve. This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders). Yet, despite all that, and my admiration for Mankiewicz's great writing, All About Eve is not a flat-out great film. It's close, a near-great, but the fact is that, for all of its stellar writing, it simply is not a deep film. In a sense, it recapitulates the shallow values all its lead characters embrace, in varying degrees. That, along with its rather pedestrian cinematography by Milton Krasner, as well as bad rear projection, in a scene of Eve and Addison walking in New Haven (even if its minimal soundtrack, by Alfred Newman, is commendable), are just enough to keep the film out of the pantheon of all time greats. Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).",

            "content": "..and there IS another movie called \"The Star\", which stars THE STAR, Bette Davis. Almost every \"user\" says that \"Eve\" is the real-life story of La Davis. Close - \"The Star\" is much closer, because it takes the story of an aging actress - who even sells her Oscar for booze and pocket-change, and -again - is saved by a man. \"The Star\" shows how desperate losers audition for roles far beneath them, just to be in the public eye, yet wanting that public to see them as they were - not as they would've-gotten-the-role, present time. I can't even place just when it was released or where it falls in the 100 films Davis made, nor if it is in black-and-white. It is far more convincingly directed to tell the story of \"has-beens\". Younger people most likely have never heard of it......even I have not heard anything about it in a long time, but everyone needs to look for it, as a comparison to the brilliance of \"All About Eve\". Whatever studio produced it should look through their vaults and re-release this film. It's every bit as \"theatrical\" as \"All About Eve\".Many \"users\" have written brilliantly about this movie. \"Jkingel\" is one of the few who mentions \"Applause\" was adapted from it, although how it could successfully become a musical about such a stellar cast of personalities is beyond me. Even Lauren Bacall, who played the Broadway-lead in \"Applause\" admits that when La Davis attended one of her performances, it was not known she was in the theater, and La Davis was not amused. Maybe it could have been turned into one of our \"modern\" operas, but a musical??? The brilliance of Mankiewicz's script was, no doubt, the loser.Because Davis wasn't the original lead in \"All About Eve\", she came to the set with a lot of baggage. Can't you feel the dread all of the other performers must have felt upon hearing \"the set-eater\" is coming in? HER ?? Thelma Ritter and George Saunders were the only two really seasoned actors/actresses in the already-hired cast. Celeste Holm was established, but not the caliber of actress Davis was - is there any wonder La Davis was bitchy on-set, knowing EVERYONE knew everything there was to know about her, all hoping she would fall on her face? I took it for granted that Holm was pretty-much like the role she played. Correct me if I'm wrong, but she was always a \"supporter\" - that she won the award for \"All About Eve\" proves that. Anne Baxter was just beginning a career that includes several good roles. How could anyone one of them hope to NOT disappear when La Davis came on ? Yeah, what DID happen to \"Birdie\".....? Just like \"The Little Foxes\", \"All About Eve\" is a perfect example that movies used to be about acting, rather than \"action\".....both starring Bette Davis. One of the more recent films that was dialog-driven is \"Sophie\"s Choice\", with another astounding actress, Meryl Streep. Unlike Davis, will she EVER have a role like that again ?I agree films like \"All About Eve\" is one that any-and-all movie-players and directors should study. It can also teach modern-day people a lot of what life is about, no matter which profession they are in - be on the look-out for the younger folk coming in. They are career-driven and greedy...... Anne Baxter lost an Oscar because she refused to be cast as \"supporting\", but Holm may have beaten her out. In all of the script-writing schools, there has to be a writer who can produce dialog as sharp as this movie contains. If not, then we are in for a lot of dull movies without good performances. I agree with one other \"user\" - \"All About Eve\" should be rated much higher than 10, and definitely higher than 45 on IMDb's list of best movies. Give me these old gems every time - I want to learn something about human nature. If I want colorful explosions, I'll watch a film about war. \"All About Eve\" is superb in every way.",

This concept alone proves it difficult to create a compelling story from, and it definitely did not happen here.It is a picture that consists of only dialogue, and has no other redeeming qualities. Some of the dialogue spoken has a certain level of depth i admit, yet this is one of the few things that keep this movie afloat on a quality basis. Almost all of the scenes are indoors and feature mediocre scenery that do not delight the eyes. Some critics have praised the acting in All About Eve, but Bette Davis's dead eyed lazy delivery of her lines, Anne Baxter's extremely forced mannerisms, George Sanders's wooden emotionless plank behaviour make it quite difficult to see what they are talking about. I would say Gary Merrill was alright, but even thats pushing it.We start off with Eve as a relatively likeable humble insecure celebrity fan ( The only likeable person in the film at that point ) yet halfway through this changes and she becomes just as unlikeable as all the other manipulative melodramatic women in this film. All the women's boyfriends seem to barely have anything to say in their respective relationships, capturing a biased feministic kind of look on reality. In the end this is a film that has no one to root for since every single character is unlikeable, but even worse they are also just not interesting. As stated earlier, the best parts about the film is the writing and dialogue, yet the acting is just so wooden and lazy ( by most of them ) that this barely matters at all. There is just no emotion, no passion in this film. Also it doesn't help that nothing significant ever happens in the film, but that isn't the actors fault. Just a bunch of pseudo intellectual dialogue and shot reverse shot techniques just isn't enough to convince me of its quality. While not a complete disaster due to some witty dialogue ( Yet still kind of pretentious ) it is still a mediocre film with little significance in the end.",

In black and white. From a bygone era. The authenticity of the dialog, the natural acting styles, the subtle characterizations remind one of how rare such qualities are in the dramatic arts, especially Hollywood films. How amazing it is that films of this quality got made, and still do. How fortunate we are as the public that our lives are enriched by such movies. Yet, how unfortunate that they are the exception rather than the rule.My one quibble is a finale which I think was unnecessary. It has the feeling of being tacked on, almost like the producers felt that the main character had to face a kind of moral reckoning. Nevertheless, for 95% of it's length, 'Eve' is a priceless and exquisite journey.",

            "content": "One of the most popular and lasting movies of all time among movie fans All About Eve is a story about the New York theater life and it's backstabbing, manipulating Broadway acting community. Based on a magazine story by Mary Orr and written for the screen by Joseph L Mankiewicz as a satirical look at infighting among self-centered stage actors as strive to achieve and hang on to stardom. Mankiewicz was an important figure in the Hollywood studio system staring as a screenwriter in the 1920's and become a successful producer of major films beginning in the 1930's and branching out into directing films in the the 1940's he worked for Paramount, MGM and Fox and succeeded in everything thing he did weather it was producing, directing or writing. Often working with large ensemble casts he assembled a great one here with Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, Gary Merrill, Marilyn Monroe, Barbara Bates and Hugh Marlow among the cast. This was nominated for 14 Academy Awards including an amazing five cast members in Davis, Baxter, Holm, Ritter and Sanders. Sanders won Best supporting Actor in his first and only nomination and win. Baxter and Davis were nominated for Best Actress and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter were nominated for Best Supporting Actress but in both categories they split the vote and canceled each other out and came away with no Oscars. It won the big prize as Best Picture and also Best Director and Best Screenplay for Mankiewicz in addition to Costume Design for Edith Head and Best Sound. It was All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard at the Academy Awards for 1950 with 25 nominations between the two films and Eve winning six to Sunset's three. This is a fine film and holds up well but it's a little too melodramatic and too much of a soap opera for me in it's bombardment of dialog. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "All about Eve would have been stellar on 'Suspense Radio', not to forget, presented by 'Roma Wines'. It has the supremely raspy and volatile voice of Bette Davis and a very cynical and intriguing plot, quite unusual for a film of the 50s. There are plenty, and I really mean it, one liners which can be remembered after the film, most of them spoken by Davis, Thelma Ritter and George Sanders. This would've been the one of the most successful radio play in USA. But AAE is a feature film, having everyone perform, from Bette Davis to well, everyone. And how did I like it? Well, let's say, I enjoyed it despite its unsympathetic characters and plot and its wholly disturbingly cynical ending. It's a different thing to watch in on screen than to hear it on the radio, I guess.All about Eve is probably the perfect title for the film, and the main poster itself is very smartly made, with Ms. Davis in the foreground and Anne Baxter behind. There will be confusion as to who the main character is here \u2013 I understand why both Anne and Bette were up for Best Actress. As Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) put it '\u0085More about Eve Later. All about Eve, in fact\", Anne Baxter's dominance over the film is gradual and calculated. The movie begins with an award ceremony to felicitate distinguished theater performers and their plays \u2013 we hear the deep narration of Addison Dewitt, who stays away from the stage itself, but is an integral part of the theater- he is a critic and commentator. He mordantly remarks about the people surrounding him \u2013 a playwright's wife, Karen Richards (Celeste Holmes), who according to him, would've not been closer than the fifth row had she not married her famous husband, and Margo Channing (Bette Davis), a phenomenal middle-aged actress. Both women seem indifferent to the awards ceremony; Channing seems to smoke cigarette after cigarette, staring at the main table where a prestigious award has been kept. Then enters Eve, the most sought after actress, to accept the prize; the scene freezes just when she is about to take the trophy, and we are taken back in time to see how she managed to receive this honor. The co-narrations along with the critic are Margo and Karen. Eve first acts as alacritous fan of Channing who gets to meet her through Karen, Channing's best friend. Channing is the typical petulant, larger than life, effervescent and slightly obnoxious and over-dramatic actress who is not exactly malicious but very proud and ambitious. She is touched by Eve's story and employs her at her home. When Eve begins to overshadow her and somehow create strife between Margo and her close ones, Margo, who holds high opinion of herself but is vulnerable within, grows suspicious of Eve. Eve's meteoric rise to super stardom is laced with lies and deceit, as we begin to know more of her intentions.The film was hard to watch, because it is imbued with bitterness and sin \u2013 a woman, in order to reach the very summit of fame blackmails, lies and turns emotionally sterile. The acerbity in the script is highly concentrated; I never expected such coldness to come from a film of the 40s. The women here are the highlights, with Bette Davis taking charge for most of the part, This is probably a film in which she played herself; just reading some of the quotes of Davis regarding her co-stars, such a Celeste Holmes, it is not surprising that this role is tailor-made for her. Her director had told her that she was to 'treat a mink coat as it were a poncho' and god she does it well. She possesses all the excess that is required of her character \u2013 her self-indulgent and over-the top behavior or rather antics work well here. Some of her childish outbursts are hilarious, and I have encountered actresses and actors with such temperaments. But to certain extent, I felt that in all her fireworks, she never released a fire-lantern that would have caused a spectacle and shown a different side to her. In all her scenes, she was sassy \u2013 I wish she had just toned it down a bit to elevate her personality. Anne Baxter's Eve is a despicable fox \u2013 her obsequious nature in the beginning garnered some reserved sympathy but when she turns heel, she bears her sharp fangs, becoming an icicle. It is very interesting to observe her body posture in the beginning; her shoulders are always towards the front, as if she is waiting patiently to pounce.The other ladies are luminous in their roles. Celeste Holm deserves accolades for bearing Bette Davis, whom she found rebarbative after an incident with her. To actually sympathize with Margo and settle herself in the story which has her play a more relatable character in a circus called 'theater' is a difficult task. Thelma Ritter as the crass but trustworthy assistant is a scene-stealer, giving great effect to her one liners, especially during the green room scene. Marilyn Monroe was embarrassing though, clumsily spitting her dialogs and blotting the otherwise well-penned scene. No wonder Davis barked at her. There was only one man worth mentioning in the film \u2013 M. George Sanders, brilliant in his role. The other two men were unjustly ignored; I wish they had been given more space.The foremost reservation I had regarding the film was about Eve's intentions, which although executed with Machiavellian skill, seemed questionable. Why did Eve have to do all this when she was, according to all, a brilliant actress? It's not as if she had a grudge against Channing, so her intentions seemed unclear. Many evil characters usually do have reasons for their wrongdoing; Eve didn't. That's puzzling about Eve.",

This maybe happened because if you have watched similar movies then it's pretty easy to understand what's going on. The plot was simple and nothing special and about the same for the direction of this movie. I liked the interpretation of Anne Baxter who played as Eve Harrington but I believe that the best interpretation of this movie belongs to Bette Davis who played as Margo Channing and she was outstanding in her part.Finally I believe that \"All About Eve\" is a simple and nice movie to spend your time but do not expect anything special from this movie. In my opinion this movie has not the best plot or the reason that I did not like the plot was because I figured out pretty early what happens and then it does not have any interest to me.

In this site there are many who proclaim this the best film ever, and wax ecstatically about Bette Davis, and on and on - but I'd submit that its fascination, especially now, lies elsewhere.George Sanders is a delight to watch and hear. He is the \"Babe Ruth\" of filmdom at playing ego-maniacal, smarmy, unctuous characters. In more recent times, Dabney Coleman and G. D. Spradlin have served to carry-on this type of characterization.Watching Celeste Holm's character could turn even the most hardened chauvinist into a rabid proponent for women's lib.Baxter's Eve Harrington can be excused for trying to hasten her supplanting Bette as Broadway's leading light. However, one can't help but imagine even such a ruthless individual biding her time a bit longer, and perhaps accomplishing her goal with everyone's influential support, and without the inevitable besmirching of her reputation among theater insiders. But, we should forgive her haste; she needed to get something done before Bette chewed ever available piece of scenery in sight.Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe acted like a pair of narcoleptics; one wondered which one might nod-off first,Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable representation of the post-war, 1940's - early 1950's melodrama, enjoyable as much for its lapses as its virtues. I found myself enjoying further just picturing (and wishing they'd included) a scene where Celeste Holm - mink coat, high heels and all - drained the gasoline from their auto, so Bette would be prevented from catching the train to New York, miss her performance, and permit Eve's making her understudy's debut. (Celeste's having drained the auto's gas tank of a full tank, was clearly explained in the film, and was the event which led to Eve's big chance, and some of the subsequent double-dealing. However, I would have loved to see her actually accomplishing this feat. It could have been the best part of the flick.)",

What makes this one so unique is the supporting players, all of which give sterling performances. I am sure we have all heard the saying \"it takes a village to raise a child\". In this instance, it took a village to raise a star; from the producers down to the supporting players.

            "content": "There aren't many perfect movies: At least, I don't know many. However, this film is almost certainly one of them. The result of an ideal combination of factors, which harmoniously came together to make it a work of art, it is a timeless film that is as pleasantly watched today as it was fifty years ago. But when we talk about classic films, it's far from being one of the first to come to mind. What is the reason? It's hard to explain, but I feel like the film never really touched the hearts of the general public. The film deserves more attention these days and is worth seeing. I'm not one of those who measure the quality of a film by the awards it receives (although that is always an indicant to consider as to quality)... but the film is one of the most nominated for the Oscars, with fourteen nominations, something that has only rarely been equaled, and six statuettes won, including Best Picture.The film begins by showing us a ceremony in which an actress, Eve, receives an important award for her performance in the theater. Then, the action goes back a year to, in flashback, let us know everything that happened until that moment. And that's how we follow the rise of Eve, an aspiring actress from obscure origins who manages to arouse the pity and sympathy of Margo Channing, then the biggest star of the stages. The film explores the two characters well, and the way they relate to each other. Eve is quite ambiguous for part of the movie, and even after we see the darker side of the character. Margo seems like a very insufferable shrew, but the character has a good heart, hidden under tons of ego and big theater diva tics.Based on a short story and intelligently developed by Joseph Mankiewicz, the director who will ensure the script, the film has an excellent cast and memorable dialogues, full of quotable phrases that we've probably heard somewhere. The cast is powerfully led by Bette Davis, an extremely talented, charismatic and full of personality actress who gave her all in this film, managing to achieve here, in my perspective, her work of glory. The difference between Margo, the character, and Davis, the real person, is so thin that you can almost say that the actress has taken the character and brought it a little bit into her own life. It's a truly superb dramatic exercise, and the same applies to the one given to us by its co-star, Anne Baxter, who plays Eve. The way they both collaborate in their scenes is mesmerizing. I also really liked Celeste Holm, George Sanders and Hugh Marlowe, even though the men in this cast aren't as strong as their female counterparts.Being a black and white film, this might be a bit off-putting to current audiences, but it's not something I see as a problem. On the contrary, I really liked the cinematography and I think the film has a lot of elegance and visual beauty. There are some scenes and camera movements that I found strange, but I think some are really unusual in films from this era. As for the costumes, I really liked the way they fit the story, and some of the actresses' costumes and dresses are pieces worthy of haute couture. The film has some implicit humor, which can escape the most inattentive, like that piano piece that Davis, intoxicated, listens to several times, later calling it \"cheap sentimentality\".",

This dynamic fuels most of the film as Eve hijacks Margo's fame to surpass her role, triggering all the futile outrage that Margo can muster. The other characters are pawns in her game but show their own schemes later on, demonstrating the wit of the script. The main problem with the film is the pacing, as it really drags at times and the amount of characters and talking seemed excessive (why did Marilyn Monroe really need to be there?).",

Fortunately, I love Sunset Blvd, so much in fact that I gave it one out of eleven \"ten's\". However, the similar topics forces a comparison, and seeing Sunset Blvd first leads to a natural bias, leaning towards that film. I truly enjoyed All About Eve, and if you see it first, you may think different than me, numerically.Like Mad Men, which gets an apparent creative boost from being about creative folk, All About Eve is a film about entertainment by entertainers. Which, as the trend goes for such occasions, makes it incredible. The story is rich, with many little things that can't be pinpointed. But on a larger scale, everything is enjoyable. The actor's performances are mesmerizing; Davis' aging, displaced star is wonderfully upsetting and relateable. Sanders' deWitt is slimy but charming, with such a confident voice. But it's all about Eve. As Chris Rock would say, \"you're goddamned disgusting!\" And she is, oh, so wretched. Even in her first scene, the false humility and gratefulness leaks through her facade, and the cracks grow from there. By the end though it comes full circle, with a bitterly poetic conclusion. Eve's speech, and the glances the camera takes at the crowd, speak volumes about her character and the film's themes.Another point of note is how sharp the dialogue is. Being about theatre, many references get tossed around, of which I caught about 2: Macbeth and Hamlet. But all of the conversations have weight and wordplay that would make Shakespeare himself smile.All About Eve, despite being over 60 years old, is remarkably fresh. To start, this is probably the only film I've seen all year in which death is not a plot point. Also, in a medium which can be seen as male- dominated (there are 6 films higher than this on the Top 250 principally starring women), seeing female drama is unique. This story of deceit, undermining, fame and fakes is well- directed, well- acted, and enjoyable. Love the film, hate Eve. 9.0/10",

Anne Baxter as the conniving title character with hidden intentions and hidden qualities to her character is also dead on, and I believe either could've been a deserving winner in their year they hadn't cancelled each other out. Celeste Holm as a playwright side character, George Sanders as a poisonous writer, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, all light up the screen.

I've seen \"Eve\", hundreds of times, and am always totally amused and enraptured by this great film.  The storyline, direction,script, cinematography, score, and above all the great cast make this a movie to see over and over again. re; cast, \"Eve\" has the best ensemble cast ever, the entire cast should have been given an Oscar...Bette Davis was absolutely brilliant as Margo, there has an never will be another Margo on screen!! Anne Baxter was outstanding, especially in her later scenes.  Thelma Ritter almost steals every scene shes in (the only flaw in the film, is where's the Birdie character played by Ritter later on?) George Sanders is sophisticated, and sinister as Addison De Witt, a role which he played to the hilt.. a well deserved Oscar winner..The other male characters, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and Gregory Ratoff are all well cast, and well played.  Celeste Holm made a perfect Karen.. and of course, Marilyn Monroe, as Miss Casswell, looked breathtakingly beautiful,with a promise of a great future to come.(I'll never understand why it took 2 more yrs.,for her next major role in\"Don't Bother to Knock\"??). The film that equalled it's Oscar nomination record, Titanic, I've seen only twice, thats enough!It(EVE) should have won more than 6 Oscars!  Oh well, it will live on forever...Unparalled Wit and sophistication on screen !!",

From its early scenes when Eve moves from the stage door into the presence of Margo after nights of freezing in the cold, to the perfect ending, where Eve discovers there was a flaw in her plan after all, this is a perfect film to watch over and over.

            "content": "image1.jpeg ALL ABOUT EVE, 1950 An ingenue insinuates herself into the company of an established but aging stage actress and her circle of theater friends -- and DOES she ever!!' BerlinbFilmbFestivsl, 2010 Director: Joseph L. Mankiewicz Writer: Mankiewicz,written for the screen by the director himself. Stars: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, with an early bit part by Marilyn Monroe.Baxter, Davis, Monroe and Sanders ... There are great actresses, there are very great actresses, and then there is Bette Davis. Davis had such a strong personality that when she played a role like Queen Elizabeth she didn't convince you that she had turned into queen Elizabeth, but that queen Elizabeth had turned into Bette Davis. In All About Eve she is simply in a class by herself and the picture itself is one of the great landmarks of the Hollywood cinema along with the likes of Casablanca and Sunset Boulevard, Eve has, in fact, much in common with the latter in which a long over the hill movie star tries vainly to make a comeback. Amazingly both of these masterpieces came out in the same year, 1950, marking it as one of the milestone years of American film history. Over the years as a non-critical film buff I had caught Eve several times on late night TV and always enjoyed it but, seeing it again in a pristine new print on the big screen at the Berlin film festival in a sidebar section devoted to the most beautiful women of the silver screen, I was totally Wowed ! ~ and left breathless at the end realizing I had just witnessed an all-time masterpiece which I had more or less taken for granted before. Well, Okay, Bette is staggering ~ but everything else is equally tip-top: The crystal clear black and white photography, the edgy outlining of every single character in the supporting cast, supreme arch bitch Anne Baxter, ultra suave super cynical George Sanders as poison pen critic Addison Dewitt, with a glowing young Marilyn Monroe on his arm, Celeste Holm, celestial as the perfect wise-cracking protective best friend, and all others in perfect tune in a perfect symphony of backstage maneuvering and interlocking personal dramas --spiced at every turn with gold-plated tailor-made dialog topped off, of course, by Bette's unforgettable party line \"Fasten your seat belts -- it looks like it's gonna be a bumpy night\"\" What is really amazing about the dialog of this film is that it was all written out beforehand by director Mankiewicz but is so perfectly suited to every character (including a zingy one- liner by Marilyn) that it feels like they were making it up as they went along with the story. So natural it is supernatural! If this is not the most perfect film ever made in Hollywood it is certainly one of the top three. If you ever get a chance to see it with an audience on a big screen be sure to fasten your seat belt and prepare to be knocked for a loop.

I have never seen a movie beat around the bush as much as this one does.  I it weren't for some very clever dialogue I would have given this movie a two or three.  The most frustrating thing is that it was not only voted to the AFI top 100 list, but also it was named best picture of 1950 over the likes of \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"The Third Man\": two spectacular, unforgettable films.  I will never understand how people can say that this trash was anywhere near the level of those masterpieces.  What a convoluted mess!",

(I know I'll misspell his last name!) gets the most out of his all star cast. Bette Davis is the star (both in real life and as Margo in the movie) and she delivers as usual in her role as the aging stage star who feels threatened by an up and comer. But I thought Anne Baxter was the premier performer in this movie. She is simply outstanding as the ambitious and duplicitous aspiring actress Eve Harrington who ingratiates herself to Margo. It's hard to believe she didn't make a bigger name for herself along the lines of Davis. The three male leads are up to par with the ladies as well. A minor quibble is that Marilyn Monroe's character didn't have a larger role. She is simply gorgeous in this movie. It must have been because she hadn't yet become the star she would be in later years. 9/10.",

            "content": "I don't know what it was about 1950. Perhaps filmmakers had sufficiently recovered from the destruction of WWII to finally take stock of themselves, but it is in this year that Hollywood suddenly became self-aware; and it apparently didn't like what it saw. Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' is cinema's most scathing satire of Hollywood's demented and destitute moral values. Likewise, Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' demonstrates how the studio system snuffs out genuine talent through its intent upon \"selling popcorn.\" But it was 'All About Eve (1950)' that truly took America by storm that year, uniting an ensemble of the industry's most charismatic stars and giving each of them acerbic mean streak that is both wonderfully compelling and entertaining. Though the film, scripted and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {who is also responsible for 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947)' and 'Sleuth (1972)'}, specifically concerns itself with the theatre, the parallels to Hollywood are unmistakable, and such is the screenplay's apparent distaste towards the film industry that I'm almost surprised of its success.On the brightly-lit stages of Broadway, respected but aging theatre star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) clings extravagantly to roles for which she is far too old; as though Mankiewicz and Billy Wilder were exchanging ideas, you can almost see her turning into Norma Desmond a few years down the track. One night, Margot is introduced to ostensibly her biggest fan, a meek and sincere young woman named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) \u0096 now, remember that name! Had I known beforehand that Eve is considered one of American cinema's finest villains, the first half of the film would have severely confused me \u0096 what detestable qualities could possibly be exhibited by this shy, modest and frankly adorable admirer of theatre? I decided that the mutual looks of contempt with which Margo and Karen (Celeste Holm) greet Eve's theatre award (a less-prestigious version of the Oscars) were merely the result of unfounded jealousy, and their resentment that such a modest girl could have received the high honour. When the penny finally dropped, oh, how I felt like a fool!Bette Davis, late in her career, was one of the few actresses with enough sheer charisma to persevere in Hollywood despite her relative lack of glamour or traditional beauty. In 'All About Eve,' her aging features look tired and almost grotesque \u0096 I say this not derisively, but as an observation for how well Davis suits her character. Margo Channing could never have been played by an actress still completely at ease with her looks. In comparison, Anne Baxter illuminates every room, particularly after her selfish intentions are revealed to the audience. The moment of revelation, when she stands, still in costume, positively pulsating with ambition, desire and lust, is a shocking betrayal that really took me aback. The film uniquely emphasises female dominance, with the inconsequential, malleable husbands (Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill) frequently relegated to the sidelines. However, George Sanders, as the sharp-tongued columnist Addison DeWitt, holds such contemptuous views towards society that he recognises Eve's game from the very beginning, watches it with amused, admiring eyes, before promptly reasserting his male superiority over her in the final scenes.",

            "content": "For me, thismovie is satirical but I cannot easily identify if it is a comedy, a dramedy, a cynical social comedy or an outright femmefatale drama. Maybe it is all of them in meticulously calculated quantities.It must be pointed out thaat Mankiewicz' dialogue is visibly but not unbearably overdrawn, pompous, full of grammatical twists and exaggerations and theatrical mannerisms and expressions but for the most part they are mixed well with the performances. It is though one weak point of Mankiewicz pictures. You can notice it even more grotesquely in Cleopatra (1963).All performances are very good, but I distinguish Anne Baxter who I think stands a little higher even than Bette Davis in this film. Baxter's voice, face, exressions and lines are filled with fake docility, fake humility and yet a spark glows constantly urging for ambition. She is even scary sometimes. Within her role, she easily passes from deference to cruel manipulation, lying and b;ackmailing on a whim! It is quite unfair that they couldn't puull out a four-way tie at the Academy and award Davis, Baxter, Swanson and Holiday equally the statuette. Baxter deserved to be in the Best Actress category. I don't believe she stole enough votes from Davis to strip her of the win but she contributed. I have not watched Eleanor Parker's performance who was the fifth nominee, but the other four were equally worthy of the award. Sentimentally, I woud like Davis to share it with Swanson. Obectively it should be a four-way tie at least. So, Baxter is a major driving force for the script. She is 40% of the picture and Davis gets the same percent for me. The rest is divided between George Sanders, Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter. It is no miracle that film received four female acting nominations. It is the only film to have achieved this. Davis also plays brilliantly tthe bored, alcoholic and insecure fading star who has to transit from ingenues to older roles.The sets are austere and not elaborate but they are perfect for this movie and you can get a glimpse of how Broadway theatre worked in the mid-20th century.\nThe second weak point I can sense is a slightly urefined progress of Eve Harrington. I think Margot gets the truth behind her character quite too early and she starts loathing her before her friends do and this important for the plot but I will spare you a spoiler by not revealing why. It would be even smoother and more realistic if Margot slowly interacted and saw things and then pieced the puzzle together about Eve's true nature.In general, male performances except Sanders' are weak and do not play a large part in advancing the plot. Any actor could have played Gary Merrill's role or Hugh Marlowe's and be quite the same.All in all, I rate it with 9/10 and I have probably omitted some details, though I have expressed most of my thoughts.",

            "content": "Over the years I have become a fan of watching classic movies; that is to say movies that span the period that is often referred to as the golden age of Hollywood, 1930 to 1960. However, not all movies of that era turn out be classics.\nSomething which certainly upholds for 'All About Eve'. This movie is all about the dialog, after all it is a theater play on printed film. And it is a very bad play with bad dialog and over-extend monologues and soliloquies who make you think of Macbeth but not in a way the writers of this vile play would want you to. I am sure it is full of inside jokes and innuendo that only real, ahem, artists understand. Do people from the world of theater, the actors, writers, producers,etc, really talk like that on cocktail parties?\nOnce in a while Hollywood makes this pseudo artistic nonsense. Other more recent examples are The Artist and La La Land. Hollywood makes those for themselves, to show off, to give themselves an air of artisticness. And they know it will fail so they throw everything they got at it. Lots of money to promote the movie, get the critics on board and of course, the best of it all, overload it with academy award nominations and wins. It is not a coincidence that this movie and La La Land both share the record for most nominations given to any movie. It is very sad that because of this abuse the number of Oscars a movie receives or is nominated for has become more of an indication of other motives then purely the intention to reward it for whatever category it receives that nomination or award.\nCompare this to another 'theater play' movie from that same era, namely 'The Importance of Being Earnest' from 1952 directed by Anthony Asquith after a play by Oscar Wilde. And you are in a completely different league here. No academy awards for that movie, of course it was not a Hollywood production, so nothing Hollywood could show off with.",

Bette Davis is a powerhouse in her role as Margo Channing, the experienced star. Margo is hard but not a bad person. Ann Baxter is enchanting as young Eve, a blend of honey and venom. Possibly best of all is George Saunders as Addison DeWitt, the cold and witty critic. Of course I cannot recount everything I love, it would take simply forever. A must-see for any actor, or aspiring actor. And I could not say \"If you like this, then see...\", for there is simply nothing else like it.",

In the unspoken rules of many industries, these two aspects are associated. Even, success itself is a combination of nobleness and sloppyness. Our accusations are as if Eve was so willing to avoid the truest self in the pursuit of success. If this is the case, those innocent stars who started with pornography probably don't need to be so distressed to block their history. Success is fundamentally a mediocre and funny word. No matter what the person pursuing sacrifices in this process, she or he can't be intact when success comes, especially women, their success is more than just going through a period of time. The road of thorns is so simple, their success is entirely in a huge mushroom cloud, the wounds of thorns can heal, but the radiation of radioactive material will always sting their minds.",

            "content": "I remembered this film because it was the film that got me ensnared in the web of classic film (I haven't willingly watched a post-1969 film for about a year), but revisiting it I found that it's not the greatest or even the most entertaining film of 1950.The acting is splendid, as one might have been told.I've never much cared for Bette Davis (like Joan Crawford said, she did get very far by just waving around a cigarette), but I can admit that she's a pretty decent actress. Of course, not every film with her is worth watching, and I've found that when she has a bad movie script, her performance suffers greatly. Luckily for Ms. Davis, the script of this movie is amazing- the line \"Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\" is fairly overquoted, often incorrectly.Now, here's a side note.Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard was much more deserving of the 1950 Oscar than either Davis or Judy Holliday, or any of the other nominees. Davis already had two Oscars for two shoddy movies- she didn't need another. (And for the record, she should have won those Oscars for Dark Victory and Now, Voyager instead of Dangerous and Jezebel. But actors never win Oscars for the right movies.)Anne Baxter was also good, but came across as pretty one-dimensional at times. The ensemble cast of actors like Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill (who later became Davis's final husband), George Sanders and Thelma Ritter are also quite decent support.There is also Marilyn Monroe in a five minute bit part which is fairly overhyped, and if you're watching this movie just for that, then you seriously need to find another movie. The most interesting thing she does is steal some guy's drink and mention Clark Gable.The direction is pedestrian, and there were several places where the director could have used a better shot than the 'I learned this one at directing school' one he did use. The length was also far too long- the scenes where Bette Davis was feeling sorry for herself while drunk (most of the film) could have been shortened, and maybe not used at all. Now that I mention it, a lot of Bette Davis's films are a bit too long. Viewer beware.My rating is a solid 7.5/10. Not the worst film I've seen Davis in, but hardly a classic.Now, Dark Victory. THAT is a classic.",

            "content": "Compared to the rough and tumble, dime-a-dozen action movies you see everyday, you'd think that All About Eve would be boring. The action is little, and it's all interiors and upper class hangouts. Yet, it isn't boring. This movie bites. It's screenplay keeps the action crisp, and every character is bad and/or totally helpless, just more proof that no matter how well-bred or famous you are, you are nothing more than animal trying to win your way in the world.The story is basic. Eve Harrington is a sweet, looking, homespun girl from the Mid-west who is given a chance by her idol, the sarcastic, always smoking and drinking Margo Channing. Little by little, this girl is revealed to be more than innocent. Instead, she is a cruel and malicious girl who uses everything from cheap tricks to blackmail to get her way. She isolates Margo from her friends (Mr. Lloyd Richards the playwright and his wife Karen Richards who unwittingly helps Eve before realizing her true self)and steal both Margo and Karen's fianc\u00e9 (Bill Sampson) and husband, respectively, from them.The only people who see through this girl's act is Margo's maid, the tough-talking Birdie, and the critic Addison DeWitt who is every bit the demon under the guise of a cultured man. Addison DeWitt eventually blackmails Eve into his service, ultimately getting the best of her, before another \"starstruck\" kid comes to steal eve's limelight, and the cycle begins again.The plot seems basic, but the screenplay makes it fresh as morning dew. There are more biting one-liners in five minutes of this film than in every film of the past ten years. Margo, who realizes Eve's actions thanks to Birdie, but is helpless to prevent them, quickly starts gnawing at Eve. Her constant drinking seems to make her all the sharper. She would be called nowadays a b***h, she treats everyone else like filth due to her own basic insecurities. She insults, nags, tear down, yet we see this woman is just desperate to be more than just a name on a poster. Bette Davis gives this woman more depth than you can believe.Eve Harrington is a spiteful soul. She was never loved, and she is incapable of loving. She knows only to get on by way of tricks and smoke and mirrors. Anne Baxter plays her with excellence. She is the perfect villainess. George Saunders plays Addison DeWitt with much the same force, but his sentences whipcrack in the air, and he can leave even the worst people defenseless and vulnerable with the sheer power of language.Celeste Holm plays Karen, docile, sweet, wanting to help this poor backward girl to get on, before finding herself in Margo's position. This character seems useless, but she is so nice and out-of-place in this world of backstage backstabbing that you want to help her. The three main men apart from Addison, Mr. Richards, Bill Sampson and Max Fabian (the producer) are played well, but not as well as the women.The other two roles are Birdie, played by the wonderful Thelma Ritter, and Miss Caswell, played by a very young Marilyn Monroe. Both do their roles excellently and add another facet to this multi-layered film.The costumes, make-up, music, sets, all add up to create this wonderful 40s New York atmosphere.",

The whole movie has bite. As Maltin said, it has a \"heaven-sent\" script. It deserved its Best Picture Oscar, although it should have switched places on AFI's 100 list with the lesser \"Sunset Boulevard\" (\"All About Eve\" made 16; \"Sunset Boulevard\" made 12). Some parts, I must say, are out loud laughs, especially the \"That's not a waiter- that's a butler\" bit, and all of George Sanders' opening commentary. Also, at two hours and twenty minutes the film never seems long. Not one scene is unneeded. The music is excellent, first-rate, sweeping. It's large when it needs to be, somewhat sad when it needs to be (like a little reminder poking you), and perfect all the time. Glad it too won the Oscar. Timeless should be a word applied to this. As Celeste Holm's Karen said in it, \"Don't run out of adjectives, dear.\" You needn't worry. The surprising element is, is that I have seen it quite a few times and haven't gotten tired of it yet.

Everything about this movie just screams Bette Davis, but I really enjoyed DeWitt and Eve quite a bit. This movie really just had everything. The script was top of the line and the cast was unreal. Great movie that really shows why some of these movies are classics that will never die.I do not usually do this but I went back and changed my score from a 10 to a 9 because of the fact I remember that my mind was wondering a bit throughout the film.

As the master of ceremonies goes through his paces leading up to his introduction of Eve we scan the faces in the crowd. And the people we are told know Eve best do not look happy. At all. Interesting. So who is Eve Harrington, how did she claw her way to the top? And who was left behind in her wake? We're going to find out all about Eve.Flash back a year and Eve Harrington is no Broadway star. She's a nobody. Margo Channing, now that's a star. Margo is one of Broadway's brightest lights but as she turns 40 years old she now faces the anxieties any aging actress would. Is it only a matter of time until she's shoved aside? She's a great star and she knows it but she can't go on playing younger characters forever. Time catches up to everyone. But for the moment she's a big success, her current production is a smash hit. And apparently there is no bigger fan of said production than Eve Harrington. She's seen every performance. She's undoubtedly Margo's biggest fan. And then comes the critical moment when young Eve meets the great star Margo. Before you know it Margo has taken Eve under her wing, making the young star-struck girl her assistant. Things go swimmingly. For a time anyway. Eve does a fine job attending to Margo's every need and Margo seems to really like the young girl. The only hint of discord comes from Margo's maid Birdie. She sees Eve studying Margo. Closely. Too closely. What are Eve's true intentions? Could this seemingly sweet young girl really be up to no good? Fasten your seat belts...The movie may be all about Eve but the standout performance no doubt comes from Bette Davis playing Margo. The perfect meeting of actress and role, autobiographical in a way with Davis undoubtedly facing many of the same questions in her own life that Margo does. In retrospect the fact that Davis did not win an Oscar for her performance is rather laughable. It's the performance of a lifetime, a tour de force the likes of which is very, very rarely seen. Anne Baxter plays Eve, a challenging role no doubt as it is a character who undergoes a great transformation over the course of the film. Baxter does very well although there is the nagging sense that she is more believable in the first half of the film than she is later on. The other standout is George Sanders playing snobbish theater critic Addison DeWitt, a man who has a talent for getting right to the heart of the matter and cutting people down to size. His dry wit is one of the film's great charms. The other men in the story don't make much of an impression. Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter have their moments but aside from Davis and Baxter the woman who draws the most attention is one Marilyn Monroe. She was basically an unknown at the time and has only a bit part here but she plays that part perfectly and when she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Is that because all these decades later we have the benefit of knowing she's Marilyn Monroe? Maybe that's part of it but there's no denying she did a great job here with what little she had to work with.All About Eve is smart, witty, brilliantly written. It's a movie which is entertaining and more than a little surprising. Some fascinating characters lead the story in some very interesting directions. High drama with room for some good laughs too. Davis turns in one of the most memorable performances of all time and is ably supported by a fine cast around her. There's very little not to like.",

Eve begins to get close and befriend a famous Broadway actor named Margo Channing and her famous friends. Most of the friends believed that Margo was just an innocent fan of Margo who didn't want any trouble and wasn't trying to pull anything. However, that was not the case. Eve was only using Margo and her friends in the business to help get her known and to help get her connections in the industry.

Eve's dedication to Channing and to her show biz circle (George Sanders, Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill among others) gains their trust and affection, and abets her sinister ulterior scheme, which is, in fact, 'all about Eve'.\nThis memorable production boasts an elegant screenplay and good direction, as well as impressive performances by the central characters (Celeste Holm's lacking delivery being the sole exception), all wrapped up in incessantly intriguing storytelling. The textbook character development that adorns the script is fascinating and in itself constitutes a motive for all vintage cinema fans to indulge in this fine specimen.Overly conventional cinematography and an unnoticeable score keep 'All About Eve' from achieving cinematic supremacy, yet they have proven too marginal to seriously threaten the film's undisputed historical legacy.

But when a film is a classic because it is apparently just good, one should be able to dislike it.  \"All About Eve\"  is just plain boring.  It was on AFI's 100 Greatest Films and won multiple Academy Awards, including best picture, but it is one of the hardest movies to sit through.  It is supposed to be a satire on the theater world and ultimately acting in general, but it isn't funny.  It is slowly paced, which isn't necessarily bad, because \"A Man Escaped\" is very slowly paced, but it works for the tone.  But in a comedy-drama, the pace should be an in-between.  Comedies are usually fast paced and dramas are usually slower, but \"All About Eve\" can't really find it's zone.  Which again can be brilliant, as in \"Pulp Fiction\". Two entirely different films, yes, but similar in that they don't have a distinct genre.  Regardless, \"Eve\" will be forever etched in film history as a wonderful movie and it doesn't matter what anybody really thinks now.  But it still seems unfair that there are some movies that people HAVE to like, just because they are staples, and if they don't, there is something wrong with them.",

            "content": "All About Eve is all about Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. One an outspoken and uninhibited diva with a kind heart. She's always honest, even if it might hurt feelings, not in the least of herself. The other an innocent and naive wallflower that can turn into a skilled devious witch in the blink of an eye. The male leads are somewhat interchangeable, alike in looks and behaviour. Exception is DeWitt, who is slick, distinguished and amoral and therefore a rather interesting character. The scenes in which he confronts Eve are among the highlights. Marilyn Monroe has a small part, and, though we all know of her, eh, average acting abilities, she has a radiance about her that has future stardom written all over it. Oddly enough, for a movie about the theatre, we hardly see any scene in which theatre performances are shown. These scenes might have been left at the cutting table, but more likely it has just been a matter of indolence or incompetence. For a story about two top theatre actresses it must be quite a challenge to deliver these stage abilities on the silver screen, but quite essential too. It's nevertheless an enjoyable movie, where the interesting plot and acting power of the two lead actresses will keep you in your seat.",

I'm deducting 2 stars for the unfortunate appearance of George Sanders, a despicable character who ruins every film he was in, and who met his demise the way he deserved, and for the ever despicable \"Marilyn Monroe\".I'll skip talking about how wonderful, and gorgeous, Anne Baxter was in this. And the story is brilliant. There are great characters too, like Bette Davis' friend and her maid, who see right through Anne's character, the way Norm-Jean Mortensen's housekeeper saw right through the fake Marilyn Monroe.You see, this is the film where awkward, uncharismatic, boorish and terrible actress \"Marilyn Monroe\" learned how to be a ruthless opportunist and slept her way to the top. Her very first scene is so embarrassing for her, it's hard to watch. She makes those huge eyes when she sees Bette Davis, her stupid way to act \"admiration\". One can't help but wonder how jealous MM was of BD. She truly pulled an \"Eve\" and, shortly after she made this film, she stole Barbara Bates' \"Phoebe\" personality for her own. And the breathless voice of Monroe's? Totally stolen from both Phoebe and Anne Baxter. In fact, I had my back to the TV and thought it was the blonde tart talking but nope: it was Anne Baxter. Marilyn spoke with a harsh, brash and manly voice here. Her real voice. No wonder no one wanted to meet Norma-Jean and talk with her.Monroe was a doxy who slept with everyone in Hollywood. She was a homewrecker who stopped at nothing to get to the top and she climbed into other women's husbands' beds. But she coped that \"fragile\" image and idiot women stupidly bought into her fake image. In reality, Marilyn Monroe was cold, calculating and nasty to boot. She hated children and dogs, and those who knew the real Norma Jean (her maid, her director, her neighbors and many friends) said so. But did her idiot fans listen? Oh no! \"She was misunderstood\"; \"they took advantage of fragile her\".Nope. The only fragile thing about Monroe was her stupid smile which kept quivering because she was so fake, she couldn't maintain the fake thoughts behind that mask of her that would allow her smile to stay put. Funny how exactly NONE of her impersonators (down to Michelle Dawson's Creek who got nose & cheeks surgery to resemble her for her dumb film Week with Marilyn) ever mastered that annoying mannerism. Were they blind? It's her #1 trait: the idiot smile that she can't maintain and which made her lips falter. Every.single.time!!!Monroe was often quoted as saying that people weren't interested in Norma Jean, and that she gave them what they wanted, the fragile and soft-spoken \"Marilyn Monroe\", which was like a skin she put on. Few have understood what she truly meant, but this film offers an interesting and rare glimpse as to what the crass woman behind the mask was, and how her iconic persona was constructed: by copying at least 2 actresses here. Namely Anne Baxter and Barbara Bates! After this film, Norma Jean's MM persona truly emerged.Watch this film for its brilliant storyline and Anne Baxter's amazing performance. Anne also got a major nose job, if you watched her in The Razor's Edge, she looks fresher and more youthened here: new, better nose!Anne Baxter here speaks with a very breathless voice, a beautifully husky and soft-spoken voice. And Marilyn Monroe, in this film, is sounding very unlike herself! The maid for Bette Davis' character tells her that Anne Baxter's has been studying Bette: how she moves, walks, talks, eats and even sleeps. It would appear that Norma-Jean Mortensen learned a lot from this film: namely, she altered her own personality, changed her voice, walk and mannerisms. This would be the last film where Marilyn Monroe spoke with her own voice: she soon emulated \"Eve\" aka Anne Baxter's performance here, and borrowed her voice and speaking style, which became Marilyn Monroe's trademark.It's worth repeating that's why I looped my comments. EVERYTHING you think you know about \"Marilyn\" is fake! THAT is the real her. It's fascinating how one can go beyond the lies told by biographers, and solve puzzles from the past. Watch A Star is Born from 1937 starring Janet Gaynor to find out how studios crafted fake personalities for movie stars. Marilyn Monroe was never an orphan and her mother was not in a nut house, unless Norma Jean herself paid to have her committed to further her \"fragile little girl\" image. Mortensen/Monroe was THAT evil! (I think she even killed a dog, once, because she didn't like it coming around to her. Whacked it with a shovel).Those who don't want to hear the truth will be all bent out of shape. WHY continue to worship a fake image? Enjoy her characters if you must, but KNOW that the woman behind the \"persona\" was fake and nothing like Monroe. She only told the truth about that hundreds of times. You fans didn't listen then? Grow up! It's long time you listen now.Now excuse me, I gotta go find out if the great and gorgeous Anne Baxter won an Oscar for this. (Bette Davis, as usual, is a \"meh!\" and an overactress, though I'm mighty pleased that she's a backburner character here and negligible presence.) 8/10 and wish the 2 garbage people (monroe & sanders) weren't in this film!",

Bette Davis gives a terrific performance as the aging, insecure actress confronted by her younger, schemish protege (Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington).

            "content": "Just about as perfect a film as they come, 1950's ALL ABOUT EVE was an instant classic upon its release and remains one of the most talked about films by cinema historians fifty years later. The film received an unprecedented 14 Oscar nominations (a record unbroken until TITANIC) and walked away with 7 Oscars, including Best Picture of the Year. Joseph L. Manckiewicz, for the second year in a row, won dual Oscars for directing and writing this sparkling comedy drama about an aging actress named Margo Channing (Bette Davis), who befriends a star struck fan named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) who we slowly learn has her own agenda in befriending her idol. This film is an on-target skewering of the New York theater scene and the poor souls who toil in it. Davis and Baxter are both flawless and were both nominated for Best Actress. George Sanders won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as an acid-tongued theater critic named Addison DeWitt, who becomes a prime player in the delicious twists this story takes. Gary Merrill plays Bill Sampson, a theater director and Margo's much younger lover. Hugh Marlowe (in probably the most significant role of his insignificant career) and Celeste Holm play Lloyd and Karen, the playwright who writes almost exclusively for Margo and his wife, Margo's best friend. There are also memorable turns by Thelma Ritter as Margo's housekeeper and a very young Marilyn Monroe as Addison DeWitt's \"protegee\", Miss Casswell. The cast all work at the top of their game, thanks to inspired direction, but it is the screenplay that is the real star of this classic. I can't think of another movie in history with dialogue that sparkles and dances the way it does here. Mackiewicz's Best Screenplay Oscar was richly deserved. His Best Director Oscar primarily stemmed from having a perfect cast. Ironically, Claudette Colbert was originally slated to play Margo but had to drop out due to an injury, twist of fate that allowed Bette Davis to give the most amazing performance of her career which should have won her an Oscar as well. A true classic in every sense of the word...don't miss this one.",

There was some mentions about an actress named Bette Davis and how great she was on a movie named \"All about Eve\"(1950) and I wondered who was she and what was that movie. Some time later I became fan of a Korean drama titled \"All about Eve\" (2000)and I wondered if it was a copycat, a tribute or an imitation of that - until then- unknown movie. I told myself \"Well, I guess I'll never know because in my country it is hard to see old movies being broadcasted by our local TV stations\". However, for my great surprise, yesterday I came across with \"All about Eve\"(1950) on cable TV, and I decided to give it a chance.I was a little bit worried thinking that maybe I wouldn't like the movie because its title in Spanish, my first language, was \"La Malvada\". Oh no - I said- that title sounds so... evil... maybe I won't like this film. But as soon as it began, the narrator said another title instead. He said \"Hablemos de Eva\". Then I changed my mind: \"Maybe I could like this\". And it was so. I watched it and I can tell you that it has been the best 1950's film I have ever seen. Now I understand why this film was so remembered in that magazine. Good acting, good story, good script, like-able characters... I really loved it. I watched it with my sister and she loved it, too.

The classic film All About Eve owes its fame to an incredible director/writer, Joseph Mankiewicz. Mankiewicz created a script and mixed it together with an incredible cast of performers almost as if the roles were created for the individual actors based on their true-life personalities. All About Eve is a story about Margo Channing who is a Broadway star who is growing older. Margo invites a fan into her home only to learn that she is trying to become famous herself and has set her sights on Margo's life as a star. The theme of the film All About Eve, is the pursuit of success. Eve Harrington wants to become famous in the theatre so badly that she will do just about anything in order to climb her way to the top in the fastest manner possible. Eve is a caring person on the surface in order to get in close with those that can help her to maneuver her way into stardom to the top. However,under the surface she doesn't care about anything or anybody and doesn't care who she destroys in her quest for fame. Addison sees the true person that she is and begins manipulating her in order to prevent her from ruining the careers of any more actors. Bette Davis is a cigarette-smoking strong, independent woman in the film. As the character of Margo nears a midlife breakdown Bette Davis plays the emotional roller coaster incredibly. Bette Davis has can give credit to this role as that which made her famous. George Sanders is the theatre critic Addison Dewitt in the film. His performance is incredible as he convincingly conveys cutting remarks to the actors almost as if he enjoyed the power. Thelma Ritter is not very well bred in the film. Birdie Coonan plays the unmannered, wisecracking character perfectly. Celeste Holm plays a housewife who is gentle natured on the surface, however obvious jealousies are bubbling inside of her. The performances of all of the actors blend together perfectly in order to create one of the most famous films of all time which is loved by generations of all ages. The character of Eve, a Broadway actress who is growing old is compared to the performance of Gloria Swanson who played an aging star in Sunset Boulevard. Both Davis and Swanson were nominated that year for the Oscar award of best actress, but the award went to Judy Holiday for her performance in Born Yesterday. The lighting, costumes, makeup, and set were all designed to portray the glamour and wealth of American actors in the 1950's, which was then present day. All About Eve is about the struggles of an aging star compared to those of a younger actress trying to make it to the top. The film was originally filmed in black and white therefore; careful consideration was given to the lighting. Many of the scenes were shot with lamp lighting giving a soft glow to the room. Frontal lighting and was used to illuminate the actors and it appears that filters were used when shooting Davis in order to give her a softer, more glamorous look. The costumes were circa 1950 with the women in glamorous gowns ornamented with jewels and the men in classic suit and tie giving the viewer a glimpse into the long forgotten glamour of actors of the last century. The all-star cast of All About Eve, the sets, the costumes, the makeup, and lighting were successfully give the viewer the feeling of being there in the room with Eve through the struggles of an aging Broadway star.",

I can't say enough about her performance in this film though...I think that the character of Margo worked so well for her because it hit so close to home. She was 42 and Margo was 40, She was a talented aging actress and so was Margo, etc. etc.... I love that the film is equally dramatic as it is comedic and Bette captured it so well. I don't want to spoil the film by any means, but look for the equally heart-breaking and hilarious scene titled \"Coming Unglued\" on the DVD. This is still during the time in the film where Margo is the only one that is on to Eve's plan. Just look for Bette, standing on the stage and swinging her purse back & fourth, screaming at the play-write, \"You may change this star any time you want, for a new, and fresh, and exciting one, fully equipped with fire and music. Anytime you want, starting with tonight's performance.\" It is amazing!! Anne Baxter as Eve is amazing as well and I just live for the moment in the film where she stupidly laughs in Addison's (George Sanders) face and he slaps her back into reality...LOVE IT! Celest Holme is also great. Her performance is very real. I don't think that she get the credit that she should, as she never over-acts, but still gets her point across...It's a wonderful film with wonderful performances, but to me, it's \"All about Bette\"...",

            "content": "'A Letter to Three Wives' was the only other Joseph L. Mankiewicz film that I had seen before watching 'All About Eve'. One can easily find links between the two films in terms of an auteur's style. In both films one can find an immense priority being laid on the writing and the dialogue which is very sharp and witty, instead of directorial flair in terms of visuals,although there are subtle moments of visual storytelling. Both the films share the storytelling techniques like the voice-over narration and flashbacks. I had thought that 'A Letter to Three Wives' felt very much like a stage play. The same has to be said vociferously about this film. Not only does it have a distinct play- like style when it comes to the storytelling and the showy, dramatic acting, but the film is also about the world of theatre itself. 'All About Eve' is in both ways a love letter to the theatre as well as a scathing attack on its players.Some of my analysis of the themes and other observations:1. Females in 1950s society: Margo is a huge star, but her position is as fragile as ever. This fragility gives rise to paranoia when she sees Eve making waves in her career as she knows her time is up. Karen represents a woman who has to remain satisfied with a secondary position in her life as she can't really do anything or achieve anything and has to experience satisfaction through her husband's work. One of the main reasons why she was so kind to Eve was because she saw a bit of herself in Eve and so wanted her to succeed and hence manipulated stuff to ensure Eve got to perform in one of the shows instead of Margo. In the end in order to achieve any form of happiness, Margo has to choose between her career and marriage. She can't have both as she is flirting with her sell/buy date when it comes to actresses in the theatre world. The ending shows that Eve's stay will also be temporary as the rise and fall in the theatre world for actresses is a cyclical process.2. Karma is a b**ch: Eve was in a way successful in driving Margo out of the theatre and replacing her as the new star. But at least Margo will still have a hope of achieving some sort of happiness in marriage with the man who loves her and whom she loves, Bill. Eve, on the other hand, as a punishment for her devious, conniving, immoral ways is forced in the end to sell herself and pledge allegiance to the devil himself, Addison Dewitt.3. Attack on the pomposity of the theatre world: The style of acting is very over the top especially in case of actors playing characters who are directly linked to the artistic process of the theatre world like Margo, Lloyd and Bill. I think one of the reasons behind this was to make the viewer feel distant from them and their world. But ironically we see that the whole world of the theatre gets shaped, heavy influenced and molded by people who are actually outsiders like the critic Addison Dewitt, the producer Max Fabian, Eve who was nothing but a fan and to some extent Karen who is just a playwright's wife but who manages to have a bearing on proceedings.4. Relationship between Margo and Eve: This relationship between an obsessive fan and her idol really reminded me of the same between Rupert Pupkin and Jerry Langford in 'The King of Comedy'. Eve, I think genuinely idolises Margo, but also wants to destroy her and replace her. This paradox is fascinating.5. Visual Storytelling: Observant viewers will be able to appreciate the subtle nature in which a harp and the words on its box is used to describe Eve's character. When Eve tells the false story of her past to Margo, Lloyd and Karen, Mankiewicz frames the shot in a way to make it look like Eve is giving a performance while the listeners are her audience which was exactly the case. Another great symbol was the stairway ladder visible beside Eve in the first shot where she appears in the flashback symbolising her future rise upwards in the theatre.Bette Davis plays Margo with the kind of authority and bravura that one would expect from her. 'All About Eve' shares some similarities with Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' and Margo Channing is similar to Norma Desmond. Although I like 'Sunset Boulevard' more than 'All About Eve', but one has to concede that Margo is a more rounded and realistic character than Desmond in spite of using snappy lines and endless sarcasm. While Norma is an idea, Margo is a real middle-aged woman with insecurities and a heart in spite of her razor-sharp words. George Sanders as Addison DeWitt looks a bit like Jack Lemmon, but his English charm can rival Orson Welles in 'The Third Man'. Sanders owns every scene he is in. His cheeky looks, his voice modulations and those eyes, everything is so expressive and the deviousness of the character he plays adds to his charm. Of course Anne Baxter deserves a mention. She makes tonal shifts throughout the film in her demeanor and expressions. She proves to be a great juxtaposition opposite Davis.I think the only minor problem I had with the film was that in some scenes, Mankiewicz seemed to be engaging in self-indulgence to show off his written dialogues a bit too much in a flashy overly dramatic fashion. But that really is a nitpick.'All About Eve' is a great film about the theatre, about women, about fandom, about deception and so much else. Mankiewicz shines as a director/writer as he celebrates and critiques the world of the theatre, a bit like Addison Dewitt. Maybe there is a bit of Mankiewicz in Dewitt after all.",

            "content": "It is amazing to watch this film 72 years after it was released and still be able to enjoy all the rich, catty dialogue. Yes, it's dated. Yes, it goes on too long. Yes, it borders on the melodramatic. But all said: who cares?Bette Davis, in perhaps her last best role as \"Margo Channing\" (an absolutely perfect \"star\" name), is just at the cusp of turning middle-age. She still has fabulous Hollywood hair, she commands every scene she's in, and it's worth the price of admission to hear her say two lines: \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\"There are so many delicious moments in this movie, but most of them have nothing to do with Anne Baxter, who plays the young, conniving Eve. She did her job well, but I didn't believe her for one second. She is entirely fabricated. I also didn't buy the performances by either\nGary Merrill, as \"Bill,\" the director, or Hugh Marlow as \"Lloyd,\" the playwright. They said their lines and did what they were told to do. Gary had a sort of simian charm to him, and Hugh had the look of a sophisticated, closeted playwright, but looks aside, I didn't think either of them could act.Thelma Ritter, as Birdie, Margo's right-hand gal, is brilliant, but she disappears after a few scenes at the top. The glue that holds it all together is Celeste Holm, as Karen, Lloyd's wife, who makes the terrible mistake of helping Eve out at the beginning, and George Sanders, as Addison DeWitt (another perfect name), an acid-tongued critic who figures it all out and knocks the wind out of Eve's sails.The movie, watched in 2022, is very gray, old, grainy and stagey. It doesn't matter. Watching Bette sashay around a room in her Edith Head gowns is something that must be seen.Again, it's too long, but it was 1950 and they probably thought it essential to say all they did. All in all, this is a great film that can be watched every 5-10 years, just to hear some of the great zingers.",

I wo n't go into details here. To tell the truth, when one third started to be bad, I was anxious and angry and could n't watch it anymore. This film was really watched in two.\nNow that I want to come here, it's really a three-point shot. For fame and fortune, I can really say that everything is extremely useful. She can even ignore herself, how can she take care of others? Su Dongpo and Zhang Dun traveled together that year. When they saw the father leaving a message at the cliff regardless of his life, he lamented that the father could kill people in the future. The same is true for Eve, who has already thrown himself, and only fame and fortune are his goals.\nBut when you really abandoned everything to bring fame and fortune to you, you found out that the four places are desolate, friends are already like strangers, and the surrounding vultures are around. Mr. Dewey knows everything about her is lethal, younger and more beautiful One after another, welcome to the game field.\nSo are the two women in the four really so innocent? Their anger may come more from how an old river like me could be deceived for so long by being blind? Margo's four-year-old Shakespeare play knows how to hype. No class experience but many years of experience, rich resources, and the blessing of drama director boyfriend. Along the way, I am afraid that she has used less than Eve. In the face of reality, she finally confessed that she was old and no longer suitable for those young characters. What she lost for ascending to the peak now seemed extremely precious and urgently needed. Those sloppy and unreasonable troubles were just a means to retain her love The anger and frustration of youth perishable, and finally she no longer stubbornly, listened to her heart, and pursued her love. She admits that no matter how many careers a woman has in her life, no one can escape from being a woman. Respect your choice. There are many precedents for women at home and abroad during the peak period, and they will also be there in the future.\nKaren, Dewey's assessment is that, by her origin, there is absolutely no chance to have a place at today's banquet. At that time she was just a college student, Richard went to their school to give a speech, the next year she became Mrs. Richard. Is it love at first sight or intentional, maybe all. Karen said that my husband likes my qualities. He has long been accustomed to it. Karen is just a housewife. Her husband is blatantly hooked up in front of her. She has no effective counterattack. She just quits silently. It is Margo 's at this point. Giant baby crying is more impactful. If it were not for Dewey to stop it, although he did not have any good intentions to stop it, Mrs. Richard might be about to replace him.\nFortunately, both men ended up with one. Although they were stunned in the middle, in the end, the cliff ended, only those who had seen evil, even if they lived in the sun, they would still feel cool.\nDewey rarely sees people who are as good as his own. It reminds me of the feeling of a beautiful woman in troubled times. We are a class of people with endless desires and endless talents. We despise all living beings and yearn for love and being loved. From then on you belong to I. Haha, let the two of you fall in love with each other. Looking back, both of them are masters of hype.",

Yes, this is the main reason that it proves itselfs. I appreciate the staff of film so. Eve acts her amazing role skilfully and the others of course, too. Marilyn Monroe suits her role but I think she would be a good choice to play Eve.To the story, Margo Channing is a well-known theatre player whose staff contains her darling also the director Bill Sampson, her writer Lloyd Richards and his wife Karen Richards. Eve is a peculiar girl who meets Margo Channing by means of Karen Richards. I said peculiar but at least she introduces herself as she is like that. She fools everybody and starts to serve Margo Channing like a servant. Nobody doubts this condition except for Birdie Coonan who is the assistant of Margo Channing. Then the time goes and Eve's aim appears spontaneously. Eve wants to substitute Channing but she displays such a modesty that makes everybody pity for her. After that Eve goes forward desiring to take Bill from the Margo Channing.I think the film must be separated into two parts. In the first part, that makes you ask the question \"I wonder What will Eve's end do?\" and more exciting from the second part, in the second part which is more boring but also completing the puzzle you'll find the character of Eve, all about Eve.This film is an impressive example for the people who wants to be a star and do anything to became a star.",

I also liked the party scenes which managed to give another dimension to another type of \"performance\" from all involved.At least 5 or 6 characters juggle the required balance to this film, all seeming individual and understandable which I think must be very hard to achieve.There's a lot to this film and I'll probably see more into it if I watch it again, it's so full of intricacies. Not a full on macho-action flick, but an absolutely gripping plot & character based study into the ultimately changing position of people within their careers.A brilliant example of a very well made film from people with a clear understanding of how to do their bit best, for the greater cause.Watch out for an early appearance from Marilyn Monroe.",

Presumably they feel the same about most movies made before, say, 1960--as one unimpressed commenter put it, 'everybody looks alike and you can't tell them apart', particularly in B&W. (A rather superficial viewpoint, but granted---guys back then were all wearing suits and hats, all looked like they were at least 37, and in lesser films they did tend to blend together.) But such a view is sad, because they're missing some great performances, writing and directing. \"Eve\"' has all of these things, and deserved every one of its then-record 14 Oscar noms. Most agree that Davis' performance here is the crown jewel of her career and should have snagged her that year's Oscar (although Anne Baxter's Eve matched her blow for blow) but the supporting cast is sterling as well......and for the record, the guys do not all look alike and you can tell them apart. The whole cast carries off Mankiewicz' clever dialogue superbly---no small feat. As this depraved old world turns on, most younger people are unable to recognize a drama about Broadway backstabbing that isn't filled with profanity, sex and probably a fair amount of nudity. In fact, they aren't even needed, and instead of those things \"All About Eve\" employs a witty script, strong direction and a perfect cast. It's a must-see for anybody who loves Old Hollywood.",

I wouldn't have picked it out of the library collection had a friend not recommended it me. It's a shame it's not better known, as it is a truly great film.Margo Channing, aging theatre star and prima donna, is introduced by her friend Karen to Eve, an apparently obsessed young fan. Eve has a tragic story to tell and is taken under the wings of Margo and Karen. But the movie makes clear from the start that Eve is not what she seems, and soon she is causing ripples in the lives of both older women. Ripples that grow into whirlpools.The script is a gem, funny and very clever, full of lines like this:Lloyd Richards: You've developed a certain cynicism since you've been married to me. Karen Richards: I developed that cynicism the day I discovered I was different from little boys.Characters frequently trade lines like barbed arrows, but it's not all dazzling wit: there's plenty of fascinating insights into the characters' personalities, and also a couple of rather chilling moments, when a lot of tension that has built up gets released. It's both a brilliant satire and a compelling drama.The actors are all excellent, with Bette Davis as Margo and Anne Baxter as Eve standing out. Davis gives Margo real depth: she's a complex mix of ego and insecurity, warmth and venom. Baxter is pitch-perfect as Eve: just a little too sweet, just a bit too modest. It's a performance of a performance. Both got Oscar nominations for Best Actress (the movie recieved 12 and won 6, including Best Picture). There's also a glittering cameo by Marilyn Monroe. She was not famous yet, but somehow, despite the classy actors around her, she draws the eye in every scene she's in.Go and track it down. It's worth the effort.9/10",

The acting is mechanical and stagey. There is no reacting here, only people waiting to give their next witty riposte. An occasional witty remark is fine. It gets tiring when everyone is witty. This has nothing to do with the period. The wisecracking in 1940's His Girl Friday or 1941's Ball of Fire, for example, is much more natural and believable. There is no doubt that a lot of the script is great, and the premise is groundbreaking for its time. But a lot of the lines are clunkers or non sequiturs, and these are delivered with the same smugness as the good ones, which adds to the impression that the characters are not thinking about what they're saying, but just reading the text and the stage directions. Celeste Holm gives the closest to what I would say is a believable performance.Bette Davis is the biggest disappointment. Whether she's playing happy, sad, or angry, it's always reined in, without any real emotions getting through. My 7 is for the script alone. If I had to score the acting and direction separately they would be less.",

            "content": "Margo Channing is clearly the most interesting character here.  The title character, superbly played by Anne Baxter, is not even second.  But then, this a film with so many interesting characters, all of them superbly played.  The bulk of the film, however, is far more concerned with what effect the threat of Eve has on Margo, than with Eve herself. \nIt wouldn't have been nearly as good a film as it is had it been done any other way.  First of all, it's necessary for Eve to be a bit of a mysterious character.  Margo, on the other hand, is the \"victim\" we're all meant to relate to.  What a switch!  The audience relates to a mega-star actor and not to a young, \"innocent\", wide-eyed fan.  How'd they ever pull that off?Well, when \"they\" is Joseph L. Mankiewicz, there's plenty \"they\" can pull off.   Modern audiences beware:  this is one of those very old-fashioned movies that has a great story, three dimensional characters, relaxed pace, and crackling dialogue.  It's also in black and white.  If, however, you are not put off by those things (many young people are, I don't know why) then you should treat yourself to this film.  It's on the AFI's Top 100 list, it's got a great user rating here, and it's very well regarded, but I still think it's under-rated.  That's how good this is.  It's right up there with Lawrence of Arabia, Grand Illusion, Rear Window, The Godfather, 2001, and Citizen Kane, as one of the absolute greatest films ever made. \nThe last time I watched this... hmm, let's see, it was the day before yesterday..., I really enjoyed trying to spot the edges of Eve.  Where do the lies stop?  How much of the events of the film did she intend from the beginning?  Is she a meticulous schemer, or simply an opportunistic improvisor?  There's evidence to support both conclusions.  Not that it really matters, of course.  Because it's not about Eve, as I said, it's about Margo.  It's also fun to listen for the numerous references to the title, which are littered all over the film.  But these are little touches which it's fun to watch out for on a second or third viewing.  If you're discovering this film for the first time, just sit back and enjoy the wonderful dialogue, full of witty banter and fierce barbs.  Not to mention insight.  Just glory in the incredible performances. Breathe a sigh of relief at the uncommonly adult relationship between Margo and Bill (it's so rare, even in good films, to find Hollywood offering a truly convincing depiction of a romance between adults... the fact that the romance is not the center of this film, I think, helps enormously). \nAnyway, see this one.  It's great.",

This film is made brilliant by superb actors and by dialogue you could shave with. The main focus is on Davis, and she's excellent. But so is Baxter, and Holm is probably better than either. Addison's performance is career-defining and a well-deserved Oscar. Monroe's cameo shines like a girl's best friend and Ritter is spot on.

            "content": "I had heard a lot about All About Eve but I had not ever seen the film. I thought this film lived up to all that I heard about it. The performances by Bette Davis as Margo, Celeste Holm as Karen and Anne Baxter as Eve are incredible. Their performances are effortless. The main theme of this film is doing anything to get what you want. This is back-stabbing at its best. Eve gets herself entrenched into Eve's life and slowly takes over. The only person to see her for what she is in the beginning is Birdie, played superbly by Thelma Ritter, who is Eve's assistant. She makes people feel sorry for her and then uses them to get what she wants. Karen is put into the middle of the trouble when Margo starts to see Eve for what she is. Karen ends up betraying Margo, unintentionally, and gives Eve the big break she has been looking for. She ends up making a pact with Eve to help Margo but Margo saves her from being beholden to her. This film uses lighting to help with the theme. In the beginning of the film Eve is shown in soft light-almost as if the lighting was filtered. Margo, on the other hand, is shown in a harsher light. This is to show Margo's age and to emphasize that Eve is the younger of the two and that Margo is reaching a crossroads in her career as far as age goes. . As the film goes on I noticed Margo looking softer and Eve looking harder. At the end Margo is seated at the awards dinner looking happy and when we see Eve in her hotel room she looks hard and unhappy.Dialogs role in the theme is evident in much of the same way. In the beginning Margo is brash and a little vulgar while Eve's dialog is sweet, almost saintly. She talks about how she was married to someone in the navy and is widowed and how the play Margo is staring in is the only thing that got her out of the house. She uses the same type of dialog, showing herself as naive and only wanting to help Margo, as she establishes herself. Margo becomes bitterer in her dialog. The scene that best showcases this is at Bills birthday party that Eve arranged. She drinks too much and let's out all that she thinks about Eve. This scene is important to the film because it is through this that Eve gains the sympathy of Bill, Lloyd and Karen. This scene also has one of the all time greatest lines in film \"Fasten your seat-belts, it's going to be a bumpy night!\" which was said by Margo at the beginning of the party.",

This is probably one of the most intelligent movies ever made for mass appeal. Firstly, the cast of actors not only represent the golden age of Hollywood, but a unique artistic tapestry, which it is hard to find or even put together these days. Secondly, the script is as intelligent and compelling as one could find in any Shakespearean library. And thirdly, the film does a superb job presenting a range of human dimensions and complexities that after 65 years after its release, we still have not fathomed to explain entirely.During the first half of the film you would appreciate the artistic range and savviness of one of the best Hollywood actors ever, Bette Davis. Her uncanny ability to tear up the silver screen is more than palpable and compelling, but simply astounding. She really deserved the Oscar that year, for a performance that put her on a pedestal for generations to come. The rest of the cast simply exceeded expectations. Anne Baxter simply proved that she had the skills and range to showcase herself as a multilayered actor, which is hard to find these days. Celeste Holm certainly held her own by bringing the audience into the movie in a measured and sensitive way, and George Sanders could not have been a more intelligent choice for the role. His portrayal of theater critic Addison DeWitt was as amalgamated and compelling as ever. On the lighter side, if one would like to see an upcoming and untainted Hollywood star, this is probably the best movie to see the enchanted, glamorous and extremely beautiful Marilyn Monroe.The movie is certainly a must-see for any person wishing to explore the unexplained nature of unchecked and untamed personal ambitions. It is simple a clever study of human psychology, when the word psychology was still in its infancy. Yes, the unexplained world of human emotions is presented in this timeless classic in a way that takes us a step closer to understanding our core nature.",

Even more astounding is that Davis wasn't even the first actress considered for the immortal role of Margo Channing. Claudette Colbert was the original choice, but injured her back just two weeks prior to filming. Scrambling to find a replacement as soon as possible, writer/director Joseph Mankiewicz next offered the part to Davis. Having parted ways with Warner, and not having had a solid hit in five years, the 42-year old Oscar winner gratefully accepted. As she described it in the Eighties, ALL ABOUT EVE resurrected her from the dead.The screenplay by writer/director Joseph Mankiewicz may very well be the greatest ever written. It brims with the kind of sparkling, witty dialogue that the rest of us mere mortals wish rolled off our tongues so fluidly. His previous film A LETTER TO THREE WIVES won him Oscars for his screenplay and direction, a feat that impressed Darryl Zanuck, the chief of Twentieth Century Fox. In fact, Zanuck was so wowed that he volunteered to personally produce ALL ABOUT EVE.Mankiewicz couldn't have gotten a better roster of actors to back up Davis, and not a single one of them was miscast. Anne Baxter was under contract to Fox, and inherited the role of Eve after the original actress got pregnant. Mankiewicz enjoyed working with Thelma Ritter on A LETTER TO THREE WIVES, and she was the only one he had in mind for Birdie. Celeste Holm parted ways with Fox following a bitter contract dispute with Zanuck, but now he had to swallow his pride and hire her back after Mankiewicz insisted on her playing Karen Richards.Margo Channing is one of the most celebrated stage actresses in the country, a true legend of the Great White way.",

It is, by some peoples accounts however, a fairly modest production; there isn't any grandiose staging or 'cast of thousands' spectacle like in some old well-regarded classics. The film is about observation and intelligence though, not sentiment.",

Precious and marvelous acting by it's leading and supporting characters. I just realized after the end of movie, that this movie had no wasted characters, all cast were equal in skill of performances. Hard to differentiate which one is lead and which one is support. Judging by the acting of eve harrington in prologue, i never predict any manipulation or turn-down in his character after.

The script is witty, insightful, comedic and hits the nail on the head. Acting is brilliant all around - apparently Academy Award voters were undecided between Bette Davis and Anne Baxter for Best Actress and decided to give the award to Judy Holliday. As much as I adore Bette, I personally would have given the award to Anne Baxter whose manipulation and conniving is astounding.

So, while Bette's \"source material\" reference is clear, it's also apparent that the two actors brought their own unique qualities to their work.They both are fine artists, and while Davis may have \"borrowed\" a lot from Bankhead, Davis added so much more of her own creativity to come up with a distinctive and unique presence that can only be summarized as \"one of a kind.\"",

A cinematic masterpiece and one of the all-time classic films, this award winner has superb acting, directing, and highly believable characters, which i think someone could relate to, at one time in life. The film is kept together by Mankiewicz' witty,tough and believable screenplay. The film is based upon his view's about show business, and thanks it's not all fancy and glamorous, it can be nasty and deceitful. The film also shows the fear of ageing and what can happen when the loss of power and fame wears off, for whatever reason.It was nominated for fourteen awards - more than any other picture in Oscar history, until Titanic (1997), forty-seven years later. The skillful film won six Oscars: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (Joseph L. Mankiewicz), Best Sound Recording, and Best B/W Costume Design. Four actresses in the film were nominated (and all lost). It holds the record for the film with the most female acting nominees:* Best Actress (two) - Bette Davis and Anne Baxter* Best Supporting Actress (two) - Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter'Bette Davis' skillful and leading role as Margo Channing has generally been considered her greatest career performance and her most memorable role. Her part as an ageing, 40-year old Broadway actress fit the 42-year old Davis perfectly, at a time when acting roles were drying up for her. Anne Baxter as the devious Eve warms our hearts straight away, she seem's so sweet and innocent, but that all changes later one. The question is did she plan to take over Margo, was she really a huge fan? Or just a jealous stalker? These can all be questions of strong possibilities. Thelma Ritter gave a great performance, and although she had a smaller role she did it tremendously and gave it her all. George Sander's played a great scheming wannabe agent, but did a great job. And the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, my idol, her small scene opened up her and lead the way for her being around such legendary people which she herself became too, i would of like to see her with a bigger role.All about Eve is without a doubt one of the best films of all time and must be watched, it will alway's stick i your mind like glue, and is a film you have to see before you die.",

True, she had formidable competition this year, particularly from Gloria Swanson in her comeback \"SUNSET BOULEVARDE\" and taking nothing from the thoroughly deserved Best Actress winner Judy Holliday for the comedy classic BORN YESTERDAY, nor from EVE herself, Anne Baxter. But Bette is utterly mesmerizing, and with a gallery of exceptional performances around her, in the end it's hers we all remember. With a plethora of outstanding films and performances prior to this and luckily for her fans, with many more to come, Margo Canning remains her best ever delineation. Perhaps Baxter, in the title role that gives full range to her own talents, from sweet to spitefullly manipulative, took votes from Bette. But that's no excuse for this outlandish oversight on the Academy's behalf. The deliciously malevolent dialogue is spat out with glee by both leading ladies as well as by George Sanders (an utterly deserving Oscar winner) & the ever delightful Thelma Ritter. Marilyn Monroe, in a small role, made sure she was noticed too among the fireworks.  And let's not forget the stellar work of Celeste Holm & Gary Merill.

In the first third of the movie, Eve presents herself as an innocent, loyal, and passionate girl who is so kind and sweet. The audience feels compassion and sympathy for her, also shortly she will find a warm place within every heart. In the second third of the movie, Eve begins to do some sort of behavior that can be assumed malicious or immoral; but the audience can't believe that the vicious side of Eve exists, so, she or he supposes that there must be a reason that Eve did such sort of thing. Finally, in the late third of the movie, Eve starts to relive her pure herself, furthermore the audience starts to accept her true personality.This movie is all about Eve, all about psychology, moreover all about fame.

            "content": "Without question, Bette Davis made some of the best films in Hollywood's golden era, between 1934 and 1956, delivering many indelible performances, arguably more than any actor of her generation.The acting profession today is not the same as it was in Davis' time. Acting is no longer learn-as-you-go. Although Davis' education began at a dramatic academy, her actual education was working with established actors in off-Broadway plays. The time-worn formula then was toil until you're \"discovered,\" transported to Hollywood, and given a part in a movie. For Davis that was \"Bad Sister\" in 1931 at Universal, an inauspicious start, but George Arliss saw something in her that no one else could, which wasn't sex appeal or glamour. It was something much better: untapped talent and a willingness to learn. And learn she did, and trudged her way through contractual obligations to reach something worthy of her talents: Mildred Rogers.Beginning with her first really good film, \"The Man Who Played God,\" with Arliss, who regarded her his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Davis secured a seven-year contract with Warners, where her career progressed with forgettable films, like \"The Cabin in the Cotten\" (best remembered today for the line \"I'd love to kiss 'ya but I just washed my hair\") and \"Parachute Jumper.\" Then casting began for \"Of Hunan Bondage\" in 1934. Davis begged and won temporary release from her contract to play Mildred at RKO, the role that would make her a star. For this part, she learned to speak Cockney, impressing her costar Leslie Howard (affecting a believable English accent would serve her well in later years). This repellent, unsympathetic woman was a challenge for Davis, which she took on with blind will and determination, managing not only to portray Mildred convincingly, but make audiences both despise and pity her. The Davis trademark took shape: she is the woman audiences love to hate, a trait that stuck, even though not all the women were bad. She was a write-in vote for best actress in 1934 (the last time that was possible), but lost to Claudette Colbert. Back at Warners, her first Oscar came in 1935 for \"Dangerous,\" which she always thought a consolation for having lost the previous year.For three years, Davis-a Yankee trouper-waded through dregs at Warners until she could no longer accept substandard roles. She left for England and sued Warners to get out of her contract. She lost the suit, but was offered better films, most notably \"The Petrified Forest\" in 1936, reuniting with Leslie Howard, and \"That Certain Woman\" in 1937, costarring her favorite actor Henry Fonda. Eventually, she was given the lead in \"Jezebel\"(1938), opposite Fonda again-the film that began her career-altering relationship with director William Wyler and won her a second Oscar. Of the films that followed, many would bring memorable, iconic performances, demonstrating the remarkable range of her talents. No one more so than Leslie Crosbie in \"The Letter\" (1940), again for Wyler. For this film, he wanted Davis to tone down the trademarked mannerisms, inflections, and wide-eyed stares for a subtler approach (he had her wear eyeglasses in many key scenes). At first she resisted, but later admitted he was right. As a long-suffering, plantation wife, prim on the surface but yearning underneath, she is revelatory-it's a controlled and beautifully underplayed performance, perhaps her best, and earned her a fifth Oscar nomination.Davis always challenged herself to play against type, never afraid to be unlikable, or ugly in temperament and appearance. She tackled roles that other women might have refused to play.Like Garbo's Camille and Crawford's Mildred Pierce, Margo Channing is the role Davis was born to play. She might have been playing herself, some have said, but this was a woman Davis knew well and knew she could play, although it was first offered to Colbert. This is Davis for the ages, both camp caricature and genuine midlife crisis. It earned her a ninth Oscar nomination.If the apogee is Margo, than everything else is post \"All About Eve.\" In the years after 1950, subsequent roles did not live up to the standards set by this extraordinary film, and her acting choices careened, from noir villainess, to hasbeen Oscar winner (a tenth nomination), to Elizabeth I (again), to Catherine the Great, to evil twins, to worn-down Bronx housewife, to Apple Annie. And then the forays into Grand Giuignol horror, the last resort for aged actors in the 1960s. But for Davis this was yet another triumph (for Crawford, too).An all-out duel between sibling grotesques, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\"(1960) was a critical and box-office success, earning Davis her final Oscar nomination.This is a role she inhabits (see Lynn Redgrave struggle to find her footing in the unfortunate remake). Davis is captivating-just try to look away: the hideous maquillage (her own choice), the boozed-up voice, the feeble singing, the joyful rages, the child freak dancing on the beach with ice cream cones. Weird and sad, sad, sad. Who among her peers could have set aside ego to play this woman? One might argue that Davis had laid the groundwork for Ruth Gordon's Minnie Castevet in 1968.Much has been written about the so-called feud between Davis and Crawford, most of it fabricated and enhanced over the years by those who knew them and thought they knew them. The feud was more likely a clever marketing ploy sanctioned by both stars, who ably played their parts well. Maybe too well. After all, Davis resented Crawford for supposedly campaigning against her nomination and accepting the award for Ann Bancroft who was absent at the ceremony. The two actors really had no reason to dislike each other, as they were both under contract at separate studios and never in competition for the same parts. There were, in fact, more reasons for them to like each other: they were both career-driven and dedicated to their profession, unafraid to confront powerful studio heads for more demanding parts in prestigious projects. It is well documented that Davis admired Crawford's work ethic and considered her talent equal to her own (it was Miriam Hopkins she considered her inferior).Davis was known to have had lasting friendships with fellow actors she respected, like Claude Raines (also a lover), Henry Fonda, James Cagney, Olivia de Haviland, Mary Astor, and Geraldine Fitzgerald. Davis championed the careers of Astor and Fitzgerald, choosing them as costars in crucial roles (Astor won an Oscar and Fitzgerald, the National Board of Review). These actors were, after all, her colleagues at Warners.In those days, working at Warners and MGM was like living on opposite ends of the earth. Davis and Crawford were both stars at their respective studios, and audiences knew what to expect from each: it was either a \"Davis film\" or a \"Crawford film\"-the twain never met. But it was Davis that audiences most loved to see and loved being surprised by. Perhaps that was so because she wasn't an unattainable beauty like Crawford, but someone in whom audiences could see themselves. She was for them the epitome of the acting profession and always more than just a movie star. Yet, she wore both identities well.Davis remains still today the subject of debate and discussion, more so than most of her peers, whose careers have been given the certified stamp of approval, like that of Katherine Hepburn, Barbara Stanwyke, Vivian Leigh, and certainly Joan Crawford. Some may question her choices in the years after \"All About Eve,\" but those who do must remember that Davis was, for better or worse, a working actor her entire life, in theater first, then film, then theater again, then finally television. But even the small screen could not contain her, nor diminish her commitment to acting. Although she seemed without discretion at times, she returned to form in \"Strangers: The Story of a Mother and Daughter,\" with Gena Rowlands in 1979. It is a remarkable testament to Davis' evolution as an actor as there exists no equivalent to this performance in her body of work. For it she was awarded a Primetime Emmy.While a few of her performances over the years may have veered into self parody (even Crawford could not escape this trap), the incredible span of her career cancels out any dismissive commentaries or bad jokes. By all accounts, she was at times temperamental, opinionated, and, with age, imperious, but those are well-earned qualities for someone who was never going to win the hearts of audiences. In the end she was content to win their respect.",

            "content": "What more can be said about this greatly cherished account of backstage life in the world of theatre? A brilliantly acted film with a superlative screenplay, ingeniously cast with fine direction & a memorable music score, this movie really couldn't miss - and it didn't. It is very doubtful that there will ever be another film which will equal (or even rival) this incisively cynical & sophisticated comedy/drama masterpiece from 195O. Bette Davis - as a replacement for the assigned Claudette Colbert who hurt her back - gives what many believe to be her finest, flashiest performance as Margo Channing, the insecure 4O year-old diva of the theatre. Davis plays her role with such assured relish that it's practically unthinkable that another actress could be more effective in the part.  During the production, Davis strained her vocal chords, which gave Margo that distinctive husky voice a'la Tallulah Bankhead: it was an ironically lucky stroke of timing! So much has been written about this film, so I will try to shed some rarer light on it. It was noted that Claudette Colbert deeply resented Davis due to the fact that felt helplessly \"robbed\" of this prime dream role: she alternately envied and despised Davis for taking Margo away from her and playing her with such brilliance. George Sanders was perfection personified as poison pen critic Addison DeWitt: he won the Best Supporting Actor AA. Months later, at a cocktail party, Sanders recalled that Davis spat at him after he remarked \"What's wrong, Bette? Sour grapes\"?. Davis intimidated Marilyn Monroe, bluntly stating that her \"baby talk\" voice was atrociously ridiculous.  When Celeste Holm would appear on the set and spread a cheery \"Good morning\", Davis would disgustedly respond \"Oh, these TER-RI-BLE good mannahs!\" Holm was cool to \"the Queen Bee of Warners\" as she referred to Davis ever after.  Most fans know that Davis coveted the New York Film Critics Award for her playing of Margo and that she and Gary Merrill fell into a rather lusty love affair during production.  As Margo's loyal companion, Birdie Coonan, Thelma Ritter is tops & Celeste Holm is perfect as the kindly humble Karen: she and Margo have a most interesting contrast in personalities, which is best showcased in the classic scene in the car while Lloyd is out fetching some emergency gasoline. For years, the film held the record for being nominated for the most Academy Awards: 14. If you want to see this gem in all its glory, invest in the DVD version: it's crisp, sharp & clear. My favourite goof? Look at the clock on Margo's bedside table: time stands still!",

            "content": "Backstage backstabbing is the theme for this juicy Academy Award winning drama.  Bette Davis is simply stunning as Margo Channing, an aging theater star who is drmatically upstage by her biggest fan, a ruthless younger actress named Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter. When Margo invites her protege into her dearest circle of friends, Eve manages to steal from her idol the success she once envied.All About Eve is probably my favorite \"american classic film\" for a great many reasons.  For starters there's that impeccable ensemble of actors headed by the late, great Miss Bette Davis who turns in probably what is next to \"Baby Jane\" her most well-known and detailed role as theater diva Margo Channing.  Lest we forget her co-stars, including Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, Celeste Holm as Karen Richards, Gary Merrill as Bill Sampson, Hugh Marlowe as Lloyd Richards, Thelma Ritter as Birdie, a very young Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell and last but not least, Barbara Bates as Phoebe.  All of them listed above give what is in my opinion some of the most scintillating performances ever captured upon celluloid.  Secondly, there's the matter of that script, probably one of the best if not THE best script to ever come out of Hollywood.  The dialog within it is scintillating, and the quick verbal repartee is priceless in so many instances too numerous to mention here.This film was honored with a record 14 Academy Award nominations and it won six: Best Picture, Director, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Sound Recording. Amazingly enough Bette Davis and Anne Baxter who were nominated both for Best Actress were beaten by newcomer Judy Holliday's dynamic star turn in George Cukor's Born Yesterday. Frankly, if you ask me I think Bette Davis should have won it that year.  Her performance as Margo Channing was simply amazing.For its day, All About Eve was a very long film, clocking in at just over two hours.  It's a very \"talky\" picture, especially when it gets into the \"cocktail party\" scene (the film's piece de resistance). However, it is the breadth and depth of the story that writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz is telling that requires our full and rapt attention.  And we do give it. For as many times as I've seen this film (probably around fifty or so by now) it still is looked on as THE perfect film by so many people, myself included.  No matter how hard anyone tries, no one will ever be able to either replicate or duplicate it.Believe me, this film ain't called \"the bitchiest film ever\" for nothin!My rating: 4 stars",

Marilyn Monroe is the perfect scene stealer, but is hardly alone with other supporting cast members like Thelma Ritter, who easily dominates her few scenes as Davis' dresser. Although Davis was the star and the story revolves around here and \"Eve\", its George Sanders who steals the show. His long, confrontational speech with Anne Baxter near the end of the film is easily one of the best things about the film. I wonder how the subtext of lesbianism and homosexuality (Addison DeWitt's obvious \"beardsmanship\") got past the censors. Perhaps it was the heavy handedness of Davis' character's desire for a husband that overshadowed it. Margo Channing's willingness to give up the stage seems a bit overdone, even for its era and is the one false note in the film, especially coming from an iconoclast like Davis. Nonetheless, this is a great film that holds up well, even on repeat viewings.",

We are presented with scheming women situated in a world that thrives on deception and illusion.  Likewise all the relationships between the characters are illusory.  What seems to be love or devotion is in fact hidden cruelty, and desperation.  Everyone is exploiting everyone else.\tEve Harrington (Anne Baxter) forges an unlikely relationship with Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  Eve has enormous ambitions in the cutthroat, and deceptive world of the theater, and hopes to study her idol with the eventual result of taking the place that she held in the theater world. Margo is smart enough that she probably knows this from the start, but she is aging, and her theater career, is consequently on the verge of decaying, and as a result she allows the flattery and sycophantic behavior of Eve as a way to ease the pain that is destroying her ego, and relive some of the adulation that existed in her earlier years.\tThe other players include Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), as America's most commercially successful playwright and Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) as a brilliant director.  It's Bill that delivers a sparkling monologue defending the position that the theater exists in many incarnations, thus explicitly linking the movie's portrayal of the Broadway way of life, to the way of life of Hollywood.  Finally, there's George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, a theater critic, and power-hungry social climber, who's the only character who is not a self-deceiving hypocrite and hence the only character who understands Eve.\tThe name of the main character alone is enough to communicate to us that this is not just a film about theater, however, but also about women, the compromises they have to make and the poses they have to strike to get by in the world.  Both Eve and Margo are aware of how low and cruel they are, but justify themselves by the very fact that the world is equally cruel and unfair to them.  Except for DeWitt, all of the men in the film exhibit a selective blindness to the real nature of Margo and her student Eve, not out of kindness though.  The movie is about the way women, to succeed, must provide men with illusions, and how the men look the other way when any sign is made manifest that those illusions might be false.  This kind of game playing is almost universal between the sexes, and it's of vital importance to the film's world view that it's the effeminate DeWitt who sees through this heterosexual game playing, and exploits it as an outsider.\tIn a magnificent stroke of irony, this film also features an early performance by Marilyn Monroe, the high queen of illusion of the American cinema, as an ambitious and none too bright young starlet.  The movie is revolutionary because it marks a rare time that Hollywood decided to be honest about what it was doing, to it's stars and audiences alike.  All About Eve also has a script by Joseph Mankiewicz that features some of the most razor sharp and cynical dialogue ever to crackle from the screen.  If you haven't seen it, then see it, by all means.10/10",

People in today's society scheme their way into jobs they don't deserve. Many like Eve purposely sabotage others in order for them to have their big break. I found it a little ironic that for a while Eve was able to keep the act of a good assistant, showing her true talent for Broadway acting without really knowing it.

Its one of those classic film lines that will always be floating around.

Additional fine performances are given by Celeste Holm, as Margo's best friend and the wife of the director (Hugh Marlowe) who directs just about all of Margo's plays, and George Sanders who plays Addison DeWitt an acerbic theatre critic who's onto Eve's machinations but supports her nonetheless. A small part, her first, was performed by Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, a young actress trying to break into show business with the help of Addison DeWitt. The film has everything: great acting, humor, a wonderful story line and certain lines that have become quoted over and over again, like \"Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.\" All About Eve was given more nominations that any film in the history of motion pictures (13), until Titanic, which I believe garnered 14.

People have heard of these films and they refer to them when mentioning or suggesting films for others to see. They creep up into the conversation. \"Oh, but you have seen _____, haven't you? That's a classic film!\" It appears that All About Eve is one of these films. There is nothing more enchanting than fame\u2014at least to the people portrayed in this film. The world of acting is continuous. All of the characters act. There is not a single moment when any of them are through acting, not even at the end. If the performances seem strange or an account of 'over-acting', that's because there is no such moment when the actors are not performing. This leads to performances. Above all, Bette Davis is the true star. This is the very first film I have seen her in, though it will not be my last. Yes, people call her a legend and she is famous, but this movie shows just how much she deserves to be a famous legend. She knew exactly how to play Margo. I do not know if there is any other actress that could have given the performance she did (at least in that time period.) It may be called All About Eve, but I was really mesmerized the most by Bette Davis/Margo. That being said, Anne Baxter, or Eve, was exceptionally good. At first, she seemed a little stiff, but by the end of the film I understood why she behaved the way she did. Her determination to get exactly what she wanted was very apparent throughout the whole film. Finally, Marilyn Monroe, who played Miss Casswell, was only in the film for two scenes, yet she was one of the most memorable\u2014which really does prove something about her performance. She was great at switching between Miss Casswell the Woman and Miss Casswell the Actress (though who in this film was not an actor/actress in some way?) There really were no bad performances, which is a very rare thing for a film. Of course, you cannot review All About Eve without discussing the script. I have not seen every film ever released, so my claim that this is the greatest script I have ever found may not be entirely accurate, but I do not know how else to describe it. The dialog is just wonderful. So many wonderful lines have emerged and become well-known because of this movie. (\"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night!\") The script alone could have made this a brilliant movie. Some of the lines may not feel completely realistic, but is that really the point? The great thing about the dialog is the way that it \"snaps\" from line to line, thereby adding to the entire experience of watching the film by engaging you further in the story. This is not a film for everyone. This is only a film for those who have ever wanted something in their life and have been willing to destroy others in order to get what they desired. This is a film about passion and the way that we act in order to protect that passion of ours. If this feeling is familiar to you, then go to the nearest DVD store and rent (or buy) it. You won't be able to forget it.",

            "content": "Friedan spoke of the \"problem that has no name\" \u2014 the demand of society that women give up the agency they had been demanded to accumulate to lubricate the wheels of the war machine with their factory work. No longer required as servants of warfare, they were supposed to be content with reclassification as unpaid and dependent family worker, because enough of \"their men\" had returned from abroad. As Smedley Butler so cuttingly detailed, war is a racket. When a racket moves an entire society then the sexes are going to get caught up. Hollywood, the propaganda vehicle in those days, needed to dress up the shabby role of \"happy little housewife\". And so, one sees slickly corrupted presentations of Friedan's problem. You see, feminists like Friedan also were part of the trap. Instead of being able to fully comprehend that egalitarian gay relationships are not a threat to the foundation of society (e.g. its war profiteering and other machinations), even those who recognized the problems inherent in withdrawing the newly-found agency of women had to decry them in order to put a nice sheen on the \"institution\" of heterosexual marriage. Why? Because they didn't understand that only a small percentage of people are gay enough to want serious gay relationships in the first place. Think I'm joking? The former PM of Australia stated with a straight face that same-sex marriages, if legal, threatened the extinction of humanity! The \"logic\" was that same-sex relationships, presumably because they're more egalitarian, were so attractive to most people that they would abandon heterosexual relationships that are about reproduction (for taxes and other resources). There are several failures of logic and examples of ignorance in the Howard claim but the bottom line is that All About Eve uses that very viewpoint as its foundation for dramatic conflict.The fight against the dreaded gayness causes all things to take place in this film. Eve's relentless hollow pursuance of stardom is due to her vapid lesbianism. She has no heart and seeks to put an award there. She and the gay man (critic) who she conspires with are \"killers\". In fact, she's not even fully human. She has a \"feverish little brain\" like a rat. She studies people, mechanically, like a serial killer \u2014 rather than a natural and warm woman who is interested in true love, what Margot transforms into. Lesbianism is just trickery, as when she and her lover conspired.Margot, the quintessential harpy of Greek myth, is tamed by a younger man. This flip in the gender roles is part of the cleverness of the trickery happening. The common assumption, that younger women belong with older men, is reversed, a seeming improvement for female agency that comes at greater cost \u2014 her career. That loss of career, not accidentally, comes with her affirming that older women should leave the business because they're not beautiful enough anymore. Gone is the Margot who doesn't care how young the woman in the part is because of her talent and ferocity. Replacing her is Grandma Channing, who will somehow remain enchanting to the younger man once she has given up all the feminine wiles that made her enchanting \u2013 like her fantastic acting and her grande dame exaggeration. Bill sees into her true heart, though \u2014 the soft warm fuzzy one that stays in the kitchen to bake muffins.Heterosexism has the word sexism in it for a reason. Almost no one uses the word for reasons, too. In this film, it is the tool for the promotion of sexism. The film's poster said it is about \"women and their men\". It's about the role of women now that their men are back from the abroad. That role is definitely not to be \"strong women\" who will be corrupted by lesbianism and the resulting feminist demands. It won't be to leave men floundering, bereft of female companionship, forced into the arms of other men \u2014 seeking art rather than child rearing. Make no mistake. The gay male character is purposefully put right next to Marilyn Monroe to make a point. His sophistication is shallow and self-defeating. Leads to a blind alley. By contrast, a virile red-blooded heterosexual man knows just how to treat a lady. The film is so slick that even Ebert was oblivious vis-\u00e0-vis that entire narrative is based on repudiating homosexuality (female agency being one of its symptoms) in favor of patriarchal heterosexual marriage. He gabbed about Channing as being a \"universal type\" and merely focused on mechanical aspects of filmmaking. People have been conditioned in the modes of seeing the world according to heterosexual patriarchal imperative. Also willful blindness? How any thinking viewer can miss obvious bits like Eve and another woman conspiring together and holding each other's bodies while doing it... Of course she was a lesbian! And, of course it's amusing to her for a gay man to claim that she's his property. It's amusing for a gay man to try to possess a woman in a patriarchal way. The perversion of the scene is obvious and intentional. Film cleverly lays out the Friedan problem in pretending that it's only a problem if one is gay. Reaffirms inferiority of feminine brain, when it comes to the Machivellian requirements of running the world; also shows gay man trying, and failing, to live up to duty as a man (woman under his control).Davis is wonderful, despite these themes. She was in love with \"Bill\" then. The writing is cute with cutting sophistication. I can't escape from all the clich\u00e9s, stereotyping, and backward beliefs it promotes. Example: Plain folks have common sense to see through nonsense artsy types are tricked by. Although he wrote that Hollywood \"needed to drop its vendetta against them\", the best Mankiewicz manages to do in this film is not have gays kill themselves (i.e. the Children's Hour). It just shows that all that their \"hearts\"' desire is folly.",

I adored Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday (who won the Oscar for best actress that year competing with Davies) and I only wish that the 2 films had been released in different years - Bette so deserved it for this.

The scenes between the men and the women seem like real adults interacting, not cutesy couples playing at love.  The script and cast are terrific.

George Sanders certainly deserved his Oscar as the \"I love to hate you\" theater critic who enabled Eve to rise to stardom. All the other players in the cast were great too. Even Marilyn Monroe is good in her small role as a sexy, air-headed actress wannabe. It is an excellent script that holds one's attention throughout. There is a little something in it for everyone.

The fact is, it leaves me with no other choice than to give it a perfect 10. Unless you see this film, I don't think you'll have the necessary frame of reference with which to to base any expectations on. It's an incredibly engrossing, moving and often comedic experience, but time and time again what knocks you over is the absolute finesse with which this script was crafted. The fact that the acting and direction are flawless and surprisingly natural-seeming (most old movies usually seem stiff or people seem to \"act\" too much) only enhances it that much more. With this film, you can really imagine the *people* the actors are portraying.\"All About Eve\" shows some similarity to one of my other favourite 50s films \"A Face in the Crowd\". Both are studies of fame and celebrity. Eve shows how a person will corrupt themselves in order to attain it, whereas A Face's premise is that fame corrupts those who find themselves in the spotlight. Both have themes that are perhaps even more resonant in our celebrity-obsessed culture now than when they were made. Interestingly, Eve predates A Face by several years.And possibly most interesting of all is the honest and often raw way in which women are portrayed, the strength of their character and the power they wield. The male contingent is practically relegated to the back seat. One might be hard pressed to find a movie quite so \"liberated\" today. So what more can I say?

The black and white cinematography is gorgeous, and the script is sharp and focused with great lines such as \"Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night\". The direction is excellent, and this is further advantaged by a terrific cast, a very good subject matter and sumptuous costumes. I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Times change, but whereas talent wasn't always enough, now it isn't even required.  \n\nBlind ambition is as old as MacBeth, yet Mankiewicz delivers a modern twist, with the new celluloid royalty of his time. The dialogue hasn't lost a step, as delivered by a who's who of A-list stars.  From the previous generation's greatest, Bette Davis, to a darling of the moment, Anne Baxter.  Toss in another Oscar winner in Celeste Holm, along with the woman that still holds the record for the most best supporting actor nods, Thelma Ritter.  It remains the sole film to receive four acting nominations for female actors.  You will never see that again.  Oh, and someone named Marilyn Monroe appears in her first cameo role too.  The final result, 14 Oscar nods, a record yet to be broken.\n\nAlong with his directing win, Mankiewicz rightfully took home a statue for best screenplay.  His broad script brought to light the blatant ageism that plagues female actors till this day, while also exposing the sycophantic relationship between performer and critic. As scum personified, George Sanderson nails the pivotal role of Addison Dewitt, scoring yet another Oscar for the film.

Her mixture of passion for the theatrical arts with her tragic personal life made her reputable as the \"Queen of Tragedy.\" The term was coined from a Greek mythological figure Melpomene, the God of Tragedy, one of the nine daughters of Zeus, and originally the God of Song. Siddons, likewise, rose to tragedy after her strained marriage and death of five of her seven children. Her legacy would be appropriated in a painting that compared two idols, one that would centuries later be hung at Margo Channing's (Bette Davis) home in the film All About Eve. Channing, like Siddons, stepped into theatre at a young age and continued to garnish her reputation on Broadway. However, unlike Siddons, the modern Goddess of Tragedy faces the challenge of being replaced on stage, particularly by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), her understudy. Like Siddons and the Melpomene, she is painted with admiration in the theatrical arts, even after her retirement. Once the younger actress is given the Award, Eve will inspire from Margo's legacy, wear the crown, and become an idol herself. Furthermore, comparing Margo Channing to Sarah Siddons makes All About Eve's story of a fallen idol passing her torch to another more significant and powerful. \n\n(5 Sarah Siddons Awards out of 5)",

            "content": "Based on Mary Orr's The Wisdom of Eve, itself inspired by a true anecdote, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve is a blistering satire on the acting profession in general and theatre in particular. It won six Academy Awards and was nominated for a record-breaking fourteen and it's easy to see why: whilst some Best Picture winners haven't stood the test of time, All About Eve is every bit the classic its reputation would suggest.\nThe story is about the eponymous Eve, a fan of theatre actress Margo Channing, who gets to meet her idol, is employed by her, and then gradually starts to inveigle herself into Margo's life, eventually stealing her fame. That sounds fairly straightforward, but Mankiewicz' screenplay is about far more than just Eve and Margo. Critics have read many different things into the film, but most strikingly the plot takes broad pot-shots at theatre life and it does so with biting wit. At no point is the audience likely to believe that people really talk in this way, but within the context of the narrative it works perfectly. There is, for example, a hilarious scene immediately after Eve's audition when Margo, Lloyd and Max trade extravagantly barbed insults. There's lots of material here too about the theatre versus cinema, as Bill's monologue on what theatre is demonstrates.\nThe screenplay isn't just a collection of pithy one-liners: the characterisation works brilliantly and the casting is perfect. Anne Baxter is very convincing as Eve, whose gradual take-over of Margo's life and career is very subtle at first, winning over Margo, Bill and Karen with a sob story about her husband, winning a job with her, and then slowly starting to interfere. She gets increasingly devious, for example when she ensures that Lloyd's car runs out of gas so that she has to perform instead of Margo and she even tries \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to seduce Bill and shows real anger for the first time when she fails. We don't see her being openly manipulative or indeed malevolent until she blackmails Karen into convincing Lloyd to give her the part of Cora. Later, she plans to lure Lloyd away from Karen, not because she is interested in him sexually, but because of his importance as a high-earning theatre playwright. Baxter goes from seemingly shy and awkward fan to ruthless career actress with ease: her eyes light up when Eve is breathlessly imagining the adoration of an audience.\nBette Davis is well cast as aging theatre star Margo Channing, and gives an utterly convincing performance even when she's delivering outrageous lines; Margo is an aging theatre actress with a superb reputation, but who is painfully aware of her advancing years (she's just turned forty) and the fact that her boyfriend Bill is eight years her junior. Her fears of fading glory turn out to be justified as Eve eventually supplants her. Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill are very good as Margo's best friend Karen and lover Bill, who dreams of breaking into Hollywood, whilst Hugh Marlowe convinces as theatre director Lloyd Richards, who frequently clashes with his diva of a star. But the show is stolen from all of them by George Sanders as Addison DeWitt, a supremely devious and snide theatre critic who believes that he is as much \"theatre folk\" as any actor or director and who proves to be the master manipulator, seizing control of Eve \u2013 and her success \u2013 without her even noticing it. Sanders gets all the best lines, although with plenty to go around Davis comes a close second.\nMankiewicz uses all manner of directing tricks to great effect, from freeze-frames to tracking shots. The film opens with a droll voiceover from DeWitt, who sets the scene with a withering analysis about the acting profession works, and later various characters chip in with voice-overs at times, recalling the events as they unfold. The plot isn't really focalised through any one character, with the points of view of various used at different points.  A notable exception is Eve: we never gain any insight into her mind until DeWitt exposes her past at the end and interestingly we never actually see Eve perform \u2013 her audition and subsequent understudy performance both happen off-screen. Cinematographer Milton R. Krasner's use of wide-angle and deep focus shots adding a sense of scale to the mise-en-sc\u00e9ne, with cameras often following the actors: thus, the art of the cinema is use to skilfully depict a film about theatre. The final touch is that Alfred Newman's score is sparingly used, so that musical only plays at key moments, usually when Eve has a success that leads another step closer to her acting apotheosis.\nThe final masterstroke is that as Eve leaves Broadway for Hollywood, she meets a young woman who will clearly do to her what she did to Margo \u2013 a fact that puppet master DeWitt actively encourages. It's a wry and cynical ending to a film that is every bit as brilliant as the many accolades it receives would indicate.",

            "content": "Show business satires have never quite equaled either All About Eve or Sunset Boulevard (1950). The writing, the performances, the style, the use of narration and the actors being willing to comment upon themselves make both films work so well and therefore it is difficult to call one better than the other. The story of women manipulating one another to attain power has appeared on screen several times with the recent success of The Favorite (2018) allowing for a resurgence in appreciation of the genre. This is the mother of them all however as we watch a dark narrative play out and feel almost ashamed in ourselves as we revel in the nastiness of it all.\n\nA young theatre fan Eve Harrington, Anne Baxter, quickly ingratiates herself into the life of her idol, Broadway star Margo Channing, Bette Davis, but her intentions soon prove to be less than innocent. What follows is a game of manipulation in which we discover that Eve is not who she has sold herself to Margo and close friend Karen Richards, Celeste Holm, as and that her main ambition is to become a star, an ambition that she is willing to tear Margo down to achieve. Both women fight over a certain part in a stage play before Margo settles down with her younger boyfriend Bill Sampson, Gary Merrill, and Eve is manipulated by gossip columnist Addison DeWitt, George Sanders, after a brief dalliance with Lloyd Richards, Hugh Marlowe, Karen's husband. The final scene implies that the manipulation of stars by ambitious younger women is simply a cycle and Eve too will face her comeuppance.\n\nWhat occurred to me when watching the film was how impeccably the dialogue was written. Every scene is filled with witty one liners and cultural references but they never distract from the drama at hand and small details such as Eve referencing a \u2018Shubert Theatre in San Francisco', which doesn't exist, hint at the deeper cynicism of the film. Each character, even Miss Casswell, is complex and gets a moment to show just how vicious they are to have survived in the industry. The allusions to royalty throughout may be obvious but that doesn't make them any less effective as you imagine that the actresses talking about thrones and crowns did imagine being princesses as young girls but grew up and realized they needed to be Queens and rule the kingdom or theatre in order to survive.\n\nThe performances are superlative as everyone from Bette Davis to Celeste Holm portrays their character with an incredible amount of clarity as they deliver dialogue with that wonderful 1950s fromage. Davis gives what I believe to be one of her best performances as the ruthless, fading star who is manipulated by someone working right under her nose. The role works partly because of Davis' reputation as a diva and her rivalry with Joan Crawford as both were desperate to hold on to their stardom and prevent younger actresses from eclipsing them. Baxter is deliciously awful as she is almost sinister in how charming she appears initially but when we realize that she truly is villainous we can see how she has been playing everybody around her for so long. Holm is reliably fantastic, she is the best part of Gentleman's Agreement (1947), as the innocent who gets duped and ultimately feels guilty and Thelma Ritter excels as the tragic Birdie giving a naturalistic, intelligent performance amid showy, literate actors.\n\nI would have given this film Best Picture because by the thinnest of margins I would call it better than the iconic Sunset Boulevard. I know that is a controversial choice but this is an impeccable film in which every element works perfectly and it deserves to be considered one of the greatest films of all time. The film touches on issues in show business but perhaps more interestingly it talks about the glass ceilings that women face and the encouragement of vicious competition between women causing bitterness. It makes you wonder, had conditions been better for women in Hollywood during this time period, would Joan Crawford and Bette Davis have feuded so publicly?",

Davis is an extraordinary screen presence, with a gravelly voice and all the facial expressions in the world, she realistically depicts a starlet who was once on top of the world but is now being forced to accept that the limelight may not be shining on her for much longer. The film goes on too long in many scenes and I found the screenplay to be unnecessarily verbose, with many conversations dragging on because the characters insist on delivering long, fancified answered or explanations when short, concise ones would do much better. But the highlights are the quality of the acting and the rivalry between Eve and Margot, which begins out friendly but slowly disintegrates into spitefulness and envy as one individual's success overtakes the other. Due to its length and excessive wordiness, I can't see myself rushing to see it again, but for a chance to see so many big names of the mid-20th century duking it out on screen in classic fashion, I'm very happy I've seen in once.",

Baxter is particularly enchanting and terrifying in her complex role.\n\nWith an all star supporting cast ranging from George Sanders to Marilyn Monroe herself, All About Eve captures the seedy underbelly of show business like never before! It's remarkable how Mankiewicz basically has many of his ensemble playing versions of themselves. He's satirizing and critiquing the shallow and disloyal Hollywood populace, while also admiring the film and theater industries.\n\nThat is the key to All About Eve's success. Mankiewicz directed a classic about how much he clearly loved the movies and plays, but he must have felt compelled to address the lesser attributes to the world he lived in with All About Eve.

Everybody gives a good performance, but contrary to popular opinion I don't think even Davis put in an amazing performance. The film discusses the back-handedness of the theater and film industries, although this kind of thing is found in many other professions as well. I think the reason it won Best Picture is because it's a film where the Academy gets to feel important and they tend to gravitate to films like that. There were some comedic moments, but it wasn't much of a knee slapper, the drama and twist were good but formulaic and there are a number of plot holes that go unanswered. The film's message is that people will do anything to get into theater and mirrors a lot of the journeys that people took to get into it in the first place (like I said, it's why it appeals to them) and that you can't take everything someone says at face value, but I've found that is quite a cynical way to look at things.

Mankiewicz's All About Eve that 67 years after it's initial release it still holds up as one of the finest examples comic dramas ever shown on screen. It is a film that can be viewed as the rule book for aspiring screenwriters, the swift notes for student actors and a timely lesson to all film fans that a well told parable, with a smart dialogue and talented cast wins hands down over any CGI effects, camera tricks or show stopping stunts that technology can muster up.\nBased on the story The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr, All About Eve is an elegantly bitchy backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Tattered and forlorn, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing (Bette Davis), weaving a melancholy life story to Margo and her friends. Taking pity on the girl, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long, it becomes apparent that naive Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodily uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill), Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap.\nThematically multi-layered, this sharp and witty written film  won 6 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a Best Supporting Actor for the magnificent George Sanders.\nIn fact it has the unique honour of seeing two actresses and two actors nominated in the Best Actor/Best Actress category at the Academy Awards - a feat that has not been repeated since.\nUnsullied by the demands and technology of modern cinema, this classic Hollywood tale is a wonderful insight to the backstabbing backstage of Broadway as the heavy weight bout between these two divas comes fuelled with poisonous yet witty dialogue in a timely reminder that as the cliche goes \"the don't make em like they used to\"!",

Whenever I'm asked who my favorite actress is, I always respond with Bette Davis, even though I'm often met with a perplexed blank stare. I get it, though; Ms. Davis isn't exactly from my time, and to be honest, if it weren't for my mother exposing me to black and white movies, I don't think I would have come across this gem of a movie either.\n\nFor anyone who has ever daydreamed about what it would be like to meet and work with their idol, All About Eve wonderfully captures this. Eve, played by Anne Baxter (The Ten Commandments), is a young aspiring actress with an overt adoration for Margo Channing (Bette Davis), an aging Broadway star who pities Eve's sad life story and takes her under her wing. Although well intentioned, Margo soon discovers that Eve doesn't just worship her but strategizes to become Margo's unwelcomed prodigy.\n\nNow it's one thing to have another woman try to steal your job from you, but the claws really come out when Eve attempts to win over Margo's man and two best friends. Although I began by rooting for Eve, by the middle of the movie I was throwing popcorn at the screen and mumbling a few choice words at her. But that's what makes this movie so great; it sends the viewer on a wave of all kinds of emotions.\n\nWhile the drama of a backstabbing plot is exciting on its own, there was something else I appreciated about this movie (and well, all old Hollywood movies), and that's the purity in theatrical acting prior to the 1960s. To me, watching classic Hollywood cinema feels more like watching a play than a movie; the performances from each actor are lively and overdramatized, creating a beautiful harmony of drama and humor in the satire of Broadway.\n\nThe worst thing about this movie is also the best - it's a black and white movie. A lot of people won't typically seek out black and white movies and perhaps that is why this one will go unnoticed as time progresses. It's almost as if the absence of color forced me to pay closer attention to the storytelling rather than the screen itself.\n\nAll About Eve has been a gift that I am indebted to my mother for showing me because each time I watch it, it's like being in the presence of some of the greatest actors to have existed. For anyone who is willing to go on this rollercoaster of emotions, in the words of Margo Channing, I encourage you to \"fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!\"\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/all-about-eve, and was written by Brittney Sharae.

Joseph L. Mankiewicz; the screen writer and director has done some appreciative work but his sheer effort to create this character driven feature with a wafer thin script shatters the feature into bits and pieces of some good material that fails to make a definite point or even bind it all. Bette Davis is the actual winner in here that is supported amazingly by George Sanders but unfortunately one of the lead actors Anne Baxter's performance is what itches all the way through.

Taking pity on the girl, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long, it becomes apparent that na\u00c3\u00afve Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodedly uses Margo, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill), Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm), and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap. Also appearing in All About Eve is Marilyn Monroe, introduced by Addison De Witt as \"a graduate of the Copacabana school of dramatic art.\" This is but one of the hundreds of unforgettable lines penned by writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the most famous of which is Margo Channing's lip-sneering admonition, \"Fasten your seat belts.

I don't think it's in a 'best ever' type of discussion, or worthy of its 14 Academy Award nominations, but its sharp dialog, predatory manipulation, and overall bitchiness make it entertaining, even if it's hard to like the characters.  \n\nThere are some great lines here; in addition to the famous \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night\", I loved it when Davis exclaimed \"I'm not twenty-ish, I'm not thirty-ish.  Three months ago I was forty years old. Forty. 4-0. That slipped out.  I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.  Now I suddenly feel as if I've taken all my clothes off.\"  Davis herself was 42, and this line and others ring true.  George Sanders (as Addison DeWitt) is also fantastic, at one point saying \"You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I. We have that in common. Also, a contempt for humanity, an inability to love and be loved, insatiable ambition, and talent. We deserve each other.\"\n\nThese quotes capture the spirit of the movie, which to me is simply about the difficulties that aging women face, and the cold and calculating world of the theater.  There is supposedly a homosexual element, a theory put forth and apparently confirmed by writer and director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but it's so subtle, perhaps because of the Hays Code, that it didn't even register with me, and I think it's irrelevant.  These characters are in the best cases rough around the edges, and in the worse, simply awful people.  We see Margot being slowly replaced and want to feel sympathy for her, but it's tough because she's so abrasive.  We see the evil side of Eve slowly unveil itself as it becomes apparent she's far from being a starstruck fan or even who she says she is.  And at the end we see that she, too, will be replaced.  It's all a bit grim: time, a machine that grinds them down, and competition for glory that leads to Machiavellian backstabbing.  It's ironic that Davis was such a diva that there was discord amongst the actors, and Baxter pushing her way into a 'Best Actress' nomination instead of 'Best Supporting Actress' would lead to a division of the vote and neither of them winning.  I was happy to see Marilyn Monroe in a small part at age 24 and before she was big, just to bring some lightness into the film.  This is certainly a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it's not one I'd watch again and again as I would my favorites.",

However, it might be one of the best implementations of that plot-line. Huge credit has to go to Anne Baxter because she plays the part of Eve so brilliantly that I was genuinely surprised at her turn in the third act, despite the familiarity of these tropes. The rest of the cast is spectacular as well, but I think the effectiveness of the film hinges on Baxter's performance. The way the climax of this film plays out is positively brilliant and it resolves each character's story in a way that I didn't anticipate. The final scene might be one of the most fitting I've ever seen. I did find there were moments that the film dragged a little, particularly when they continued to drive home a point that they had already established. I'm not sure I was entirely sold on the flashback storytelling, either. It was particularly odd because they kept changing narrators for the flashbacks, which seemed pointless. Most of my trouble with All About Eve was relatively minor, though. This is a sensational film that has aged well, because it explores timeless themes that still apply today. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",

The film's fundamental premise--a stalker immediately accepted into a theater star's inner circle--is completely unbelievable.  My god, then the film concocts the same premise a second time!?#@  The entire film is more contrived than an O. Henry short story.\n\n2.

Mankiewicz is sending \"letters to three wives\", and now it's all about Eve. \"I have to be strong, you had to be free, 'cause it's all about Eve!\" I'm symphonic prog-rockin' here, Kamelot style, and I'm supposed to be talking about a film which predates any kind of rock. I don't know what to say, because, come on, just how interesting can a drama which got nominated for 14 Oscars - scoring six, including Best Picture -, b and supposedly features a lesbian be? I can practically feel my eyes drying out, there are so many men somewhere out widening their eyes when I say that Anne Baxter is playing at least a pseudo-lesbian, but again, this film is from 1950, so that's the only thing they're painstakingly subtle about. The only kind of homosexuality that we know for certain pertains to this film is among men, because Bette Davis has quite the role in gay subculture, probably because her voice has just the right amount of depth for gay men to do impressions. It doesn't exactly hurt that this film is pretty good to begin with, and yet, as worthy as this film is of all of its praise, there are indeed aspects to shake up its intrigue.\r\n\r\nThe film's plot is so well drawn and handled that, to see the turn into the 1950s, this film is surprisingly unpredictable, but it can transcend conventions for only so long before succumbing to narrative tropes, if not moderate Hollywoodisms of the time. What distinguishes this film is its subtlety and depth as a drama of the '40s and '50s, but there are occasions of superficiality which might not be too glaring, but feel as though they are, in contrast to the subtleties, and under the pressure of the histrionics. I've heart warming of campiness, and although I hardly find cheesiness on that level, the razor-sharp dialogue occasionally gets improbably heavy-handed with its theatrical wit, while near-trite characterization thins down the depths of generally richly written and portrayed, to the point of being supplementary to a melodramatic plot. The plot is driven by melodramatics as a portrait on pursuing stardom through a companionship with, if not the overthrowing of an aging idol, and it's not entirely easy to buy in on them, partly because it seems as though they're compensating for natural shortcomings, which are obscured by inspired storytelling, but challenge one's investment even on paper. You have plenty of time to ponder upon the natural and consequential shortcomings, because among the bigger issues of the film is a length of almost 140 minutes which gets to be repetitious, maybe even aimless after a while, demanding quite a bit of patience. With entertainment value and dramatic intrigue, this film ought to firmly secure one's investment time and again, but its grip is loosened by subtle missteps whose betrayal of inspiration make it all the harder to disregard. The final product hasn't age completely with grace, but to be a film of its type and time, it's solid, and even to this day, it thoroughly compels, even in concept.\r\n\r\nFeaturing the occasional tropes, and driven by melodramatics which attempt to compensate for natural shortcomings, this story concept is not especially meaty on its own, but its thematic value is rich with intrigue, exploring the ambiguities of the intentions of an aspiring actress working with an idol she may be aiming to succeed, and the paranoia of an aging talent who fears that her best years are behind her, and that she is to be overpowered by new talent. This story, for all its histrionics and natural shortcomings, is conceptually solid, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz tells it very well, at least as a director, structuring scenes more tightly than he does as writer, to where entertainment value is kept consistent, until the slow spots come in right when they need to, and grace this film with something that was a rare gem to find during this time: subtlety. Subtlety isn't entirely there on paper, but Mankiewicz's direction is rich with taste and generally defiant of Hollywood superficialities of the time, to where it explores dramatic and thematic potential thoroughly, with the help of worthy scripted material. Mankiewicz's writing is more flawed than his direction, arguably because it might be more ambitious, - to the point of bloating plotting into repetition, maybe even a hint of cheesiness - yet even it stands out for the time, and still impresses by today's standards, with generally crackling dialogue and an effective portrayal of the artistry of and corruption within the theatre. As for the individual characters, although some of them feel like types, most all major roles are distinguished, with depths and layers that bond with the melodramatic characterization generally organically enough to augment human intrigue, which is augmented best by quite the solid cast. About as consistently impressive as anything is the acting, which is realized across the board, with anyone from the charismatic George Sanders and the relatable Celeste Holm, to the lovely, if a touch dated and sometimes unevenly used (Maybe it isn't really \"all about eve\") Anne Baxter - who is initially endearing as an aspiring talent and innocent young lady who slowly, but surely begins to show dark colors when she finds her dreams realized, possibly at the expense of others' - and, of course, leading lady Bette Davis, who charismatically captures the sophistication of a more grounded starlet, brutally humanized by the fear of being replaced by a fresher face, and coming to terms with her age and humanity, and how she affects her peers, both positively and negatively. Davis' effectiveness is limited by now-dated material, but her nuance and dramatics layers are relatively spot-on, driving the depths of this surprisingly subtle drama, but not alone, as there is enough realization on and off of the screen to drive the final product as consistently compelling.\r\n\r\n\"All\" in \"all\", if you will, occasions of convention and superficiality are a little hard to ignore in the context of surprisingly tasteful storytelling, whose subtlety and grace are still challenged firmly by melodramatics which join repetitious dragging in emphasizing the natural shortcomings of this story of limited consequence, which is still rich with dramatic and thematic intrigue that is handled with enough effectiveness within the entertaining and engrossing direction, intelligent writing and strong performances which make \"All About Eve\" an uncommonly and rewardingly effective drama of cinema's golden era.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "The winner of 6 Academy Awards out of 14 nominations, All About Eve sounded like a classic I couldn't miss.\n\nAll About Eve has a distinctly classical feel to it due to the style of the film, so any appreciator of classical cinema will find appreciation with it.\nThere are a few minor issues I would have with the film, with the main one being that the title of the film is rather misleading because while it is called All About Eve the focus is actually significantly more on the life of Margo Channing. Although the story is very interesting and has a lot of firmly complicated yet realistic characters to it, I just presumed that the story would focus more on Eve because the title suggest that the film is all about her, and that just did not prove to feel like the case in the end with All About Eve.\nBut still, All About Eve is memorable simply on the basis of the fact that it exposes everything in the true nature of Hollywood in the year 1950 during a time when everything was being glamourised. For one of the first times in Hollywood history, All About Eve depicted the true nature of what it is to be an actor and how we live in a dog-eat dog world, and with an excellent script it manages to tell nothing but the truth through its characters while capturing the realistic language of the time that the film was from. All About Eve is one of the most honest depictions of society in the 1950's Hollywood scene and took a significantly less optimistic approach to things than the more cliche of Hollywood films should, so it sort of touches upon the ideals of the counterculture era before such a time even existed as it would not come fourth for another decade. All About Eve is a rather prescient film for its time, and its messages still carry today so it truly is a great example of a classic that gets better with age. And while the story is rather simplistic with the focus being all on the characters and the script, it is still and intelligent and thought provoking film which is chock full of great dialogue and strong characters for the actors to work with, so All About Eve serves as an example of some of Joseph L. Makiewicz's best directional skill as he handles the material very finely and breathes some stylish direction into the film as well so that it maintains a strong sense of art direction and nice cinematography all throughout, as well as an effective classical musical score.\nBut the finest element of All About Eve which makes it an unforgettable film is the strength of the cast, especially the lead performance of Bette Davis.\nBette Davis' lead performance as Margo Channing is absolutely excellent. You can see that the true nature of Margo Channing as she starts of strong but gradually deteriorates in terms of her mental stability as well as age over the course of the film, and Bette Davis acts it all out perfectly. While the film is called All About Eve, with the incredible acting talent that Bette Davis presents to her character Margo Channing, she manages to make it all about Margo without trouble. At an age of 42, Bette Davis boasts the beauty of a woman in her early 30's while in certain scenes they intentionally emphasise her age for the sake of her character. And it makes her perfect for the character, yet it is overshadowed by the fact that with her acting talent she just sinks straight in to the role. She has the feeling of a Golden Age Hollywood actress because that is exactly who she is, so the role is no challenge for her as she is essentially playing another version of herself. She manages to give an unforgettable performance, one clearly well deserving of the Academy Award nomination that she scored for the film. Bette Davis is a very impressive actress, and it is hard to walk away from All About Eve not having felt the full effect of the film solely on the basis of her performance in how she delivers her lines with passion and a sense of wisdom as well as despair, and the way that she conveys her emotions to the audience. Bette Davis is spectacular in All About Eve.\nAnd the performance of Anne Baxter in the titular role of Eve is a great one as well. As she starts of rather friendly but gradually develops into a subtle yet effectively antagonistic character, she makes the transition of development a very good process. Anne Baxter allows everything about Eve Harrington to come to her naturally in All About Eve and it proves to be one of the strongest performances of her career simply because she has a fierce dedication to succeeding in the role just as her character does, whatever the price may be. In her performance, she reveals the true nature of what you have to do to succeed in Hollywood and she lets nothing hold back the best of her strengths as an actor, so her performance is an easily memorable one.\nThe strong supporting performance of George Sanders makes everything in the experience a lot more dramatic, as do the efforts of both Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter.\nThe brief appearance of the young Marilyn Monroe is also a nice touch for All About Eve considering that her image would later go on to make her more internationally recognisable than anyone else in this film.\n\nSo all in all, All About Eve is a definite classic due to the fact that it is stylish, it takes an honest and meaningful look at Hollywood with the strength of its intelligent script and above all the fact that it is undeniably flawlessly acted from a list of talented actors who scored the film five Academy Award nominations for acting, although none of them outshine the immense skill of Bette Davis.",

I couldn't help being captivated by Bette Davis's performance as Margo Channing, her presence in the film is actually the film's main merit. Davis was an incredible actress, and while not exactly pretty compared to Maaureen O'Hara and Rita Hayworth and not very easy to work with at times, she always brought a sense of command to all her roles, especially in this film. I still think that All About Eve is her best film, I honestly do, and she is well supported by a terrific supporting cast with the likes of the idealistic Anne Baxter and the suave George Sanders. All in all, a beautiful film, that is a must-see, if you haven't seen it already. It is quite long, but it is well worth watching for Davis's performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
