            "content": "Still one of the finest movies of its genre, this original film version of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" features excellent atmosphere, memorable characters, and a first-rate cast. John Frankenheimer's direction shows a very good understanding of the material and its potential, and indeed it is a rare example of a top quality movie being made from an average novel, rather than the other way around.Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey carry the bulk of the movie, as former members of the same military unit in Korea, who slowly learn the truth about their shared past. Both give fine performances, with Sinatra's character perpetually nervous and fearful of what he will find, yet compelled to get at the truth, while Harvey as Sergeant Shaw is coldly self-composed, and contemptuous of anyone else's weakness.The supporting cast is also excellent. Angela Lansbury's icy presence as Shaw's mother is unforgettable, Janet Leigh makes an intriguing woman of mystery, and James Gregory is flawless as a pestilential, brainless Senator. Khigh Dhiegh also has some fine moments of refined cruelty as evil mastermind Yen Lo.Some of the finest scenes come from the dream sequences, which are crafted very well from a technical viewpoint, and which also ring true with the story as it comes out. They produce some chilling moments, as well as making the plot concept - which in itself is pretty far- fetched - seem more believable.With the passage of time and the dissolution of Cold War tensions, it's now possible to watch this without any political baggage, and to allow the excellent production to stand on its own high quality, rather than on any contemporary sentiments.",

            "content": "There are works of fiction whose very name can conjure up images and meaning for people who have never even experienced them. The Manchurian Candidate, the 1962 film based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel, is one such example. The film's title has entered into the public consciousness, a term for brainwashing and seemingly incomprehensible betrayal in common use. Yet how many of those who use the term have seen the film and experienced what is likely to be one of the best thrillers of its era or any other?Part of what makes the film so successful is, perhaps paradoxically, the fact its based on a novel. Having read Condon's original novel a couple of years ago and then coming back to the film a couple of times subsequently, it is amazing to see how much of it makes its way into the film. It's not just brushstrokes that make their way in but entire scenes with large portions of dialogue presented with little edits made to them (the much discussed first scene between Marco and Rosie is a prime example). Even some of the costuming choices are drawn straight from Condon's novel. Scriptwriter George Axelrod is able to take the dark comedy of Condon's novel and put it into what is essentially a thriller that satirizes the McCarthyism of the previous decade and makes it all work together. Not everything makes it into the film of course but much of what makes the film memorable (the plot and dialogue especially) is owed to its source material and the wise decision of Axelrod in keeping as much of it as possible.Axelrod's script is only part of what makes The Manchurian Candidate the film that it is. Part of it is, of course, the cast. Frank Sinatra was a solid choice for the role of Major Marco who finds himself first facing a potential phantom from his past before realizing that he, and the country he serves, is facing a much larger threat. Laurence Harvey was likewise a good choice for the always odd and never quiet normal Raymond Shaw whom is at the center of the film's plot. Though given a top credit, Janet Leigh's Eugenie Rose Chaney actually doesn't have much to do in the film except perhaps be a romantic foil for Sinatra and a bit of a red herring but Leigh shines in what scenes she does have thanks to her chemistry with Sinatra. The supporting cast is solid as well from James Gregory as the bombastic McCarthy like Senator Iselin to John McGiver as his rival Senator Jordan with Henry Silva, Khigh Dheigh, and Albert Paulsen in roles of varying villainy. There is one other name that needs to be mentioned though.Because, perhaps oddly, the real star of the film is credited fourth in the film's title sequence. Angela Lansbury's performance as Raymond's mother has become something legendary and not without good reason. Despite being not much older than Harvey was when the film was made and made to look the part thanks to what must have been some excellent make-up, Lansbury was perfect casting for the role. For those who only know her from Murder, She Wrote will be in for a shock as they see the same often quiet determination give in to bouts of conniving manipulation across much of the film's running time. Mrs. Iselin is the power behind the throne, quietly moving pieces around while those around her (namely her senator husband and son Raymond) take the credit. Yet few things will prepare the unsuspecting viewer for the revelations that pile up towards the end of the film including a scene that is every bit as recoiling now as it must have been in 1962. It is no surprise that she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as it still stands as one of cinema's greatest villains.Last but definitely not least, are those behind the camera. The stark black and white cinematography of Lionel Lindon serves the film well with its neo-noir feel that uses shadows and interesting angles to suggest how 'off' things often are. That is especially true when combined with the editing of Ferris Webster and when the two are combined during the film's lecture scenes or with the climactic sequence at the convention, the results are truly stunning. Director John Frankenheimer brought together a fine team to help him bring Condon's novel to the screen and his work on the film stands as among the best of his long career and there is little doubt that it stands up so well as a result of his work.All of this combines to make The Manchurian Candidate both an excellent thriller and a fine film. From Axelrod's adaptation of Condon's idiosyncratic novel right down to its dialogue, the performances of the entire cast, and the direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a masterclass on how to adapt a novel to the screen faithfully and yet tell a tense and utterly enthralling story at the same time. It's no wonder that it has become not just a touchstone for films but in the culture at large for it is simply a well made and enjoyable piece of work ever after fifty-five years.",

            "review_title": "The Garden Party From Hell",
            "content": "While many cast members did an outstanding job in this disturbing and often violent political thriller, it is Angela Lansbury who stands out in her superb portrayal of a woman who not only dominates her son and husband but who wants to take over the entire country, if not the world! In the end, this is Angela's triumph, and I don't understand why she took second billing behind any of the other actors.As much as I love Janet Leigh, she was handed a bizarre and somewhat minor role here which I believe only served as a deliberate distraction in that she never influenced Major Marco (Sinatra) as an agent working on either side. And don't get sidetracked by the fact that \"Pinocchio\" was playing at the Manhattan movie theater that she and Major Marco passed in the cab because that was probably a deliberate \"red herring\" too. Granted that Leigh and Tony Curtis, including their sensational divorce, were quite the rage at the time, but Angela deserved top billing here.When I read that Lansbury has only appeared in 54 full length movies to date, it seemed like a number too small only because she leaves such a strong impression in so many of her performances dating back to Nancy, the maid, in \"Gaslight\" and Sybil in \"The Picture of Dorian Grey\". To this day, I am haunted by the memory of poor Sybil singing \"Goodbye, Little Yellow Bird\" in the latter. Lansbury masters a wide range of effective acting from the kindly, unassuming Miss Marple to the powerful, detestable Eleanor Shaw Iselin here. In addition to a towering Lansbury, the excellent portrayals by Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, John McIver, Henry Silva, and James Gregory as the annoying buffoon of a step-father contribute to the success of this political thriller. I think that director John Frankenheimer and screenplay writer George Axelrod should be commended for staying close to Richard Condon's original novel, and the stark black and white photography enhanced the gloomy and ominous atmosphere. The filming of the three separate interpretations of the brainwashing sequence alone was a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.What a dish like Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish) ever saw in Raymond Shaw is beyond me, and we have surely witnessed Harvey as the dark, brooding character before (\"Room at the Top\", \"Butterfield Eight\", etc.), but who else could play this morose character more accurately?As to that newspaper headline \"Violent Hurricane Sweeps Midwest\", did you folks in the Midwest ever experience a direct hurricane? I know about the tornadoes and the floods, but a direct hurricane? Was that another subtle attempt at humor by the director? Anyway, I'll never look at another hydrangea without much trepidation and dread.",

            "content": "By the dawn of the 60s America had not been through with McCarthy-ism, the Korean War, and Communist witch hunts when it was already aiming towards a Cold War situation and ultimately, Vietnam. So much plays into this movie which came out at exactly the right time and place that even years later, layers of subtext can be garnered from its paranoiac, frightening images.Power is a deadly thing to deal with, especially when it falls into the hands that should have it the least, and the word seems to dominate every angle of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE like a glowing ball of fire. The power to control minds and bend them to darker wills. The power to control the people into believing what the powers-that-be want. The power to demolish anything or anyone considered an even remote obstacle. The power to seize power, extend it outward, blindly, into a waiting globe.And so does this disturbing, dark tale of the search for power in the political world takes place, with some of the most indelible images ever transferred onto the face of cinema. Frankenheimer amps up the paranoia already oozing from the story and with some truly nightmarish sequences brings forth a Creation that always seems like it will disclose some hideous, unseen force playing behind the scene -- the deceptive hydrangea scene at the beginning of the movie and the train scene where a shaken Sinatra meets Leigh who seems to be sincere are two very uneasy sequences to follow through, for example, because both disorient and succeed in sticking needles of doubt into your mind in more ways than one. You know something is completely wrong here and what lies beneath is always unsettling than what is eventually uncovered.This is a character study as well as a political satire: while there is plenty of tension throughout, deep characterizations come through, and needless it is to me to state Angela Lansbury's terrifying performance as Mrs. Iselin, or Laurence Harvey's chilling portrait of a non-entity, a victim and a puppet who's design is to serve as a killing machine and a false hero. Much can be also said of Janet Leigh's Rosie, since her part suggests she also knows and is more than what she reveals, but sadly the film drops what might have been an interesting side story from the moment she appears on the train and talks in that coded language. It seems she only serves to be Sinatra's \"controller.\" As for Sinatra himself, he's an asset and a weakness. He's too old to be Laurence Harvey's equal in combat, and his persona often comes through, but he does tune in a measured performance as the damaged General Marco.MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of those stories that detail the loss of innocence in America (with its killing of the more honest Senator Thomas Jordan and his almost pure daughter Josie, done without music, but in two long takes) and its transition to a super-power bent on political domination, and it chills to the bone to see it still today, 42 years later.",

            "content": "Intense Cold War era masterpiece that seems to grow bolder and more intelligent with age. A group of U.S. soldiers are captured one night during the Korean War in 1952. Next thing the group remembers is arriving home with Laurence Harvey (one of the troops) being given the Medal of Honor for some unknown reason. He immediately decides to go to New York City to get away from his over-protective mother (Oscar nominee Angela Lansbury) and her senator husband (a solid turn by character actor James Gregory). But nothing is quite what it seems. Harvey, obviously with no experience in journalism, becomes involved with a publication that is sympathetic with Communist propaganda. Meanwhile several other soldiers from Harvey's battalion (commanding officer Frank Sinatra in particular) start to have disturbing dreams where the group is in a room during a dull women's meeting where the main topic of discussion is botany. Flashes occur however where the women actually become Korean and Russian delegates that are all listening to a crazed doctor (Khigh Dhiegh) who is discussing brainwashing techniques and total mind manipulation through various kinds of hypnosis. The dreams are rough and frightening. It seems that Sinatra has a rare form of war fatigue, but there is no way to explain how others are having similar night-time delusions. As he tries to cope he falls in love with the beautiful Janet Leigh and they start to have a relationship. Eventually Sinatra begins to put the jagged pieces together just as Harvey becomes serious with a beautiful young woman (Leslie Parrish) whose father (John McGiver) happens to be one of Gregory's main obstacles to a possible vice presidential nomination in the next national election. Who is really controlling everything from the inside and what is Harvey's main purpose for being brainwashed? Richard Condon's paranoid novel comes to life vividly in a truly outstanding motion picture. Screenwriter George Axelrod's adaptation keeps the momentum of the book at a fevered pitch throughout. Director John Frankenheimer (only 32 at the time) completed the one film that he would always be remembered for. His career honestly had a lot more lows than highs, but his full potential as a first-class film-maker is easy to recognize here. The performances are top-notch with Lansbury (actually only three years older than Harvey) doing the best work of her career (albeit in a somewhat small role). Laurence Harvey's tortured character is also a sight to behold. It is an immensely interesting role that keeps the whole production glued together. Harvey, an actor I really never thought had much talent, proves that when everything else is working well that he can be a reputable performer. And of course Sinatra is solid as he always was throughout a film career that hit its peak from about 1950 through 1965. Once again he adds a certain depth and an amazing complexity to an already rich role. Smart, stylish, at times nasty and always impressive, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" is one of those pictures that continues to be a fixture in the American cinema as time goes by. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "It's not the most memorable moment of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" but it is too delightfully and subversively goofy to be ignored: an inebriated Senator John Iselin (James Gregory), disguised as Abraham Lincoln, is dancing the limbo, George Washington would rap in a Simpsons' episode but that was three decades later, here we're in 1962 and the film's statement about politics isn't just ahead of its time but also plays like a stinging retort to all the patriotic, flag-brandishing and crowd-pleasing Capra messes that anaesthetized the masses.\nTo be fair, Capra also highlighted the corrupting effect of political ambition, but the Iselins would have convinced Mr. Smith to emigrate to Argentina. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" doesn't just satirize politics, it writes as words of Gospel that power in politics isn't a mean but an end, which means that the right and left distinction is rather sterile, the whole point is to reach power by denigrating the enemy and brainwashing the masses. Under the armor of apparent cynicism, the script, brilliantly written by George Axelrod, fabricates its own alibi. When you have a demagogue using the Red Scare to intimidate his adversaries and his mastermind wife implicated in a real communist conspiracy, say what you want but it's a fair trade.\nOn that political level only, the film is a triumph of writing, so ahead of its time it was deemed prophetic a day of November 1963. And that's something no one could ever foresee, not director George Frankenheimer, not the screenwriter George Axelrod, not Robert Condon who wrote the original novel and not Frank Sinatra who was rumored to have limited the diffusion of the film in respect to Kennedy's memory. It would be hard to imagine that the film inspired the assassination, but it did nourish the wildest theories about Lee Harvey Oswald being an agent of the Soviet, if not brainwashed like Raymond Shaw (Lawrence Harvey) in Manchuria, but being manipulated with extreme prejudice.\nIn our world where Internet became a beehive of conspiracy theorists, it's not difficult to grasp the appeal of a movie like \"The Manchurian Candidate\", it is not just modern by today's standards, but it's disconcertingly relevant. And yet; this a movie of many, many layers on brilliances and the political aspect isn't even the showiest one. In fact, I'm only going to quote the tag-line, \"If you come in five minutes after this picture begins, you won't know what it's all about! When you've seen it all, you'll swear there's never been anything like it!\". Indeed, I can think of a thousand movies like \"The Manchurian Candidate\", but none of them preceding it.\nThe statement about missing the five minutes is also true, in a subtler way. The first minutes aren't about the operation that get the whole platoon knocked out with the complicity of the interpret (Henry Silva), the point is to show that Raymond Shaw is the one who doesn't have fun and even in the next scene, warmth isn't his strongest suit as he doesn't display it either with his parents. Granted the poor man's McCarthy is only his stepfather (as he loves to mention) but she's his mother! Yet the perpetually malcontent is awarded the Medal of Honor, recommended by Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and is described by everyone as the \"warmest, bravest, most charming man they ever met\".\nThey all repeat the same expression and all have the same dream involving a mysterious demonstration session lead by Chinese people and showing the \"bravest and warmest\" man casually executing two soldiers. It's not much the killing that is disturbing than the fact that it involves the two who didn't make it. If Shaw did kill, he didn't let it exude from his attitude and with good reason, as he was not only programmed to kill, but to never remember that he did. Shaw couldn't pass as a guilty man because he would know it himself. The programming is brilliant and brilliantly displayed through a mix of dream sequences and solitaire games where the Queen of Diamonds play like action-buttons.\nThe directing and the visual symbolism is so straight-forward that we never perceive it as surrealism, the film maintains a very straight and legitimate aspect despite a few creative digressions that could have been borrowed from Hitchcock, which encompasses an atmosphere of suspicion where every moment of awkwardness can be rightfully or wrongfully suspected. When the interpret wants to be hired as Shaw's cook, our suspect-radar is engaged but when Sinatra meets Janet Leight on the train, the dialogue is so bizarre that we suspect something codified behind. We'll never know but we sure wouldn't have remembered the scene had they exchanged banalities.\nIn the end, there's also this constant feeling of an impending doom all through the film, anyone can be a spy, a mind-controller, an evil force, and this is where \"The Manchurian Candidate\" gets its ticket to cinematic posterity. Indeed, for all the malevolent forces it inhabits, forcing a man to commit murders, one of them being pretty hardcore for the time of the film, or the level of corruption that shows absolutely no regard for the dignity of human beings, for all the bad guys who populate it with their sinister smiling face, the bigger bad of all comes from one woman. As the evil and domineering Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin, not the woman behind the great man, but THE \"great man\" of the whole scheme, Angela Lansbury portrayed one of the most iconic villains of history, a woman who knows no bounds when it comes to satisfy her selfish impulses. She's so creepy that it's not just the way she hates that is disturbing, but the way she loves, too.\nIn a movie that goes so far in terms of originality, we're not even shocked by Mrs. Iselin's behavior, we're just fascinated. And what I said could apply for the whole film.",

            "content": "Wow!  I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda: I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all.  Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like \"communist!\" or \"fascist!\" or \"racist!\" at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought.  At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.Here's another bit of advice: don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point.  He knows exactly what he's doing at all times.  Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means.  How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much.  Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve.  One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one.  Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life.  Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too.  It permeates down to the minor roles. Leslie Parrish as the charming innocent is certainly charming, but also subtle.  \"The Manchurian Candidate\" would easily be the best of its kind even if it weren't the only of its kind.",

            "content": "I remember seeing The Manchurian Candidate as a teen back in the day in theaters. Good thing I saw it too because after the Kennedy assassination it was withdrawn from circulation. I then got to see it again in the theater when it got a re-premiere back in the late eighties.For those who believe that conspiracies control the world, this film is for you. The ultra-right has a game plan to take over, the international communist conspiracy is given life and credence in this film and there's one character here who's got a conspiracy to beat all.When The Manchurian Candidate first came out the theater owners were instructed not to seat anyone if they came after the first 10 minutes of the film. If you buy the video or DVD, fast forward it about 10 minutes and try to pick it up from there. It won't make any sense, I guarantee.A platoon led by Captain Frank Sinatra and Sergeant Lawrence Harvey is betrayed by their Korean guide, Henry Silva, and captured by Chinese Communists. They are flown to Manchuria where Russian scientists from the Pavlov Institute experiment with revolutionary techniques in the newly developed science of brainwashing. Minus two men who are killed, the patrol is taken back to Korea where all of them have been implanted with a story about how Harvey saved the rest of them and led them back through enemy lines to UN lines.As for Harvey, he's the one who actually killed the two soldiers and he is now a brainwashed assassin ready to do the bidding of his handlers. Harvey is the son of Angela Lansbury who is in a role that's ten galaxies from Jessica Fletcher. She's the rich wife who is the brains and money behind her second husband James Gregory. Gregory is a Joe McCarthy like Senator who is forever yelling about Communists in every nook and cranny. He's a buffoon, but he's actually not aware of how right and how organized they are in The Manchurian Candidate.Gregory and director John Frankenheimer caught one aspect of McCarthy's persona in his role. McCarthy never took any of this seriously. There are many stories about him performing for the TV cameras and the press and when they were away offering to buy a round of drinks for the same person he might have been denouncing as a traitor minutes earlier. The difference between McCarthy in real life and Gregory in this film is that McCarthy had no manager and no real ambitions other than to retain his Senate seat. Gregory if anything is managed.Frank Sinatra in having The Manchurian Candidate withdrawn robbed fans of one of his best screen performances. Only in one scene when he refers to someone as a 'cat' does he slip into the hipster Rat Pack image. Sinatra is the one who starts to unravel everyone's plans because of the recurring dreams he's having about what really happened in Korea.On the way to New York to question Harvey about it, Sinatra meets Janet Leigh who really doesn't have a role crucial to the story, but functions as an Alfred Hitchcock type cool blond. With what little she has to do, Leigh does well.Lawrence Harvey is the key here. He's really a weakling and that's the key to the story. He was carefully chosen to be the manipulated assassin because of his inability to break from Mom's iron grip. Of course there have been few screen moms as evil as Angela Lansbury. She and Gregory really own this film and Angela blows everyone else off the screen when she's on. For her mesmerizing performance I recommend The Manchurian Candidate.",

A great film, for me, should contain with it some sequence or scene which recurs in your memory maybe years after you last saw it, but when you think about the film at all, just comes immediately to mind. I'm referring of course to the brainwashing scene which sets up the whole premise of the movie. The film also has an almost literally heart-stopping climax and just for good measure the in-between content is gripping, involving and also has shockingly unexpected developments too. The fact that it proved tragically prescient of the JFK assassination the next year only adds a topical edge to proceedings when what seemed at the time fantastical and possibly far-fetched on the screen manifested itself into grim reality a year or so later on the streets of Dallas.Said brainwashing scene, where we see exactly to what extent the Communist enemy have control over Lawrence Harvey's character, is brilliantly written, edited and filmed, the deaths of the two unsuspecting troop members, as devastating to watch as they are seemingly casual to commit. Even more transfixing later on is Raymond's double-slaying of his new father-in-law, where a spilling milk carton stands in for the bloodletting of Thomas Jordan and immediately afterwards the unthinking slaughter of the latter's daughter Traci, his own wife, as he stands over the prostrate father, caught in the horrific act of delivering the kill shot to the head.Yes, coincidence plays a big part in proceedings, like Raymond's love for the daughter of his detested mother's political nemesis Jordan or Traci's wearing of the trigger-point queen of hearts dress to a fancy dress ball but these are easily excused especially with the back story echoing the rise of the McCarthy communist witch-hunt. Incredible to think that such a vulgar, loud-mouthed buffoon as Johnny Iresden could get so close to the White House, or is it...?Of course it helps that the acting is so consistently good by all the cast members. Sinatra as the main starring name holds the film together with a commanding performance and Harvey is brilliant as the distant but disturbed Raymond and of course, Angela Lansbury is unforgettably cast against type as the devious and devilish would-be power behind the throne as Raymond's mother and Johnny's wife. However even the casting of lesser characters is spot-on as are their performances all of which helps keep the film grounded and credible as it progresses. This particular film is one of my dad's favourites and he's rarely wrong is my old dad. It's one of mine too and a film that repays repeat viewings. I don't rule out watching it again sometime in the future so good is it.",

I would like to put in a word of praise for the academy award winning editor Ferris Webster. Webster's crowning achievement was the famed 'garden party' sequence in which the malevolent communist agents are transformed into ladies at a garden club and back again, the vertigo of the circling camera draws us into the actual mental state of the brainwashed captives. Each camera movement, each shot was so exquisitely timed and placed that this is almost equal to the shower-bath scene in Psycho as a classic of modern editing. This scene is still studied in film schools by future editors. Also, the cutting in the finale scene at the convention expertly creates a Hitchcockian suspense totally dependent on the editing.Another aside, Angela Lansbury 'cut her teeth' for this role playing the ruthless newspaper owner in the Tracy-Hepburn film State of the Union. In that film she managed to upstage Hepburn herself! And it was obvious that she should play the 'biggest, baddest mother of all'.",

I have to say it was worth waiting a year to see this particular, amazing film. John Frankenheimer made what is with no doubt one of the finest thrillers in cinema history: Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) has recurring nightmares about a mission in Korea two years earlier. But what happened during that mission? And what's all that got to do with war hero Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), his mother (Angela Lansbury) and some political murders?Like Alfred Hitchcock, Frankenheimer manages to create tension with everyday stuff (a solitaire game has never looked so unsettling), depicting a bizarre yet utterly realistic conspiracy (the nightmare sequence and the shocking climax are breathtaking and impossible to forget). He also directs an amazing actor-threesome: Sinatra is perfectly convincing as Marco, and Angela Lansbury is... well, just perfect! But it's Harvey who deserves more attention: he's chillingly superb as the conflicted, almost android-like Raymond...New to Frankenheimer, conspiracy flicks or great '60s thrillers? The Manchurian Candidate is an excellent way to begin the acquaintance.",

            "content": "Is there one word to describe \"The Manchurian Candidate?\" Certainly there are several contenders: audacious, macabre, stark, gripping, pulpy, morbid, dark, hilarious. The film so stubbornly resists categorization that it's all of these things at one point or another, and frequently several of these things all at once.I don't know what audiences made of this film at the time of its release, though, according to accounts, it bombed at the box office, primarily because it was pulled from theatres when life (the assassination of JFK) too closely imitated art. Add its prophetic quality to the list of reasons that \"The Manchurian Candidate\" deserves its unique place in cinema history and should be seen by everyone.Director John Frankenheimer was at the top of his game here. His genius with this film resulted from his realization that the source material was pure camp, so he treats it as such. This same story played straight would have landed with a bone-crunching thud (as it did in the 2004 remake). But Frankenheimer injects the film with liberal doses of ghoulish humor, so the film ends up being grotesque and funny at the same time. For a premier example of this, refer to the brainwashing flashbacks sprinkled throughout the first half of the film, that through some of the most cracker jack editing ever done on screen juxtapose a deadly demonstration and a convention of female botanists to nightmarish and shocking effect.And of course, no review of \"Candidate\" would be complete without mentioning the supremely harrowing performance of Angela Lansbury, who lords magisterially over the film and will drive all memories of Jessica Fletcher right out your head. If this film were a deck of cards, she'd be all four queens rolled into one.Grade: A+",

The movie tells a story I would never would have known that was put onto film and that was the story of a former Korean War POW (played by Laurence Harvey.) who gets brainwashed by communists and becomes an assassin when his fellow officer Major Bennett Marco (played by Frank Sinatra). Frankenheimer is very interesting with his visions that he wanted to put onto the screen during his career as a director one of them including this masterpiece. For this movie I really thought that the movie deserved more Oscar nominations than the only two it got especially for Sinatra and Harvey for their equally wonderful work, which this is Sinatra's best work since his Oscar winning turn for From here to Eternity.

Having never seen this before, I found myself riveted to the story, and absolutely great performances by Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, John McGiver, James Gregory, and Leslie Parrish.Coincidently, I had just recently finished reading some previously published works about the cold war, in particular the Chambers-Hiss court cases.It might be accident, but I wouldn't doubt it might have been intended by Frankenheimer to choose Harvey, who resembled Hiss, in appearance and McGiver who resembled Chambers appearance. When this was released in 1962, the Hiss-Chambers spy fiasco was still fresh in the public's mind.Other American political images are not for want of satire either, since Lansbury and Gregory seemed to have reminded me, in appearance, of Mary and (honest) Abe Lincoln.The pace, style and non stop tension rivals Hitchcock; it will certainly have you wondering if he had anything to do with this! Truly Frankenhiemer, excels here. Because Sinatra was box office magnet, most of his other roles seemed 'fitted' for him. Not here! You'll have a chance to see the real Frank Sinatra, really working to make the part work, and without a doubt, he too excels in his role.I don't think I'll bother to see the recent version yet.

The story begins in a Chinese Communist indoctrination camp as an officer demonstrates how thoroughly he has indoctrinated a group of American POWs from the Korean War. Then, suddenly, the scene changes to America years later. The brainwashed prisoners are now home and have no idea that their minds were changed. I'd say more, but don't want to ruin the suspense. All I really want to say is that Angela Lansbury does NOT play a nice character like \"Mrs. Potts\" in this film. In fact, she is at her most evil and amazing.

In a nutshell, American soldiers in the Korean War are captured and subjected to sophisticated brainwashing by Russian and Chinese communists, and one of them is programmed to carry out assassinations back in America. Frank Sinatra plays one of the soldiers who has recurring nightmares about the brainwashing, and the sequence where Frankenheimer shows them thinking they're at a meeting at a lady's club talking about flowers, which seems very odd at first, and spins the camera around to gradually show us the horrifying reality of their predicament, and just how controlled they are, is absolutely fantastic. We come to understand the assassin's trigger, the queen of diamonds when told to play solitaire, which is a wonderfully chilling concept, and I loved how the story included a false trigger at a costume party. Angela Lansbury's character evolves over the film, from over-bearing mother and wife, the brains behind her Senator husband's McCarthyism, to the mastermind behind the whole conspiracy - and how this is revealed is as great as her performance. The movie keeps us guessing, perhaps as those swept up in fear of communism guessed at what may be happening around them in their paranoia, and an example of this is Janet Leigh's offbeat dialog with Sinatra when she first meets him on a train. It immediately seems to us as code and a way of controlling him in some way, but it's also flirtatious, and we're left wondering what her role will be.Brilliant as it is, from my perspective, the movie has one major flaw. Frankenheimer was happy to show the dangers of McCarthyism and even commented on this in interviews, and yet there WAS a communist plot to overthrow the government, and there WAS unsuspected (and very dangerous) communist infiltration. So at the end of the day, what was the message \u2013 that McCarthy was right? I don't think it's right to explain this away as satire of both the right and the left, because I don't see the movie as satire, I see it as a political thriller \u2013 but it is a very good one at that.",

The subject matter-brain washing-is horrifying, and the agenda is pure evil. The early 60's was a political circus, with communism, the aftermath of Korea, the Cuban Missle Crisis, Civil Rights, etc., so a movie with serious subject matter like this was not just daring, but a must to tell audiences what could happen if they didn't wake up and smell the Chock Full O'Nuts.There are so many moments of poignancy, particularly for me the speech of the presidential nominee, very close to a speech that JFK made which is still quoted today. As the victim of Communists and surrounding elements, most viciously his mother, Laurence Harvey is brilliant, going from a cold, unfeeling veteran of the Korean war to an unrequited hero who must instantaneously make a drastic decision to prevent political disaster. Sinatra, in the most important film he ever appeared in (as well as one he produced), goes through a plethora of emotions, both hating and helping Harvey at the same time as he begins to see the evil which is about to swallow Harvey up like a demon in Dante's Inferno. The scene where Harvey begins to feel joy over having made a joke (he's happy so therefore he can be lovable) is quite touching.As Harvey's joke of a stepfather, James Gregory is excellent proving that idiocy can be more dangerous than intelligence. And if you want to see the most evil mother in movie history, look no further. Angela Lansbury here is presented as the Bride of Satan who is actually more powerful than her husband. Her almost incestuous love for her son (Harvey) reveals an evil so innate, no exorcism could get rid of it. Her performance is so rich it is like she took her character of the newspaper owner from \"State of the Union\" (power hungry but not sinister) and mixed it with a bit of \"I Claudius's\" Livia.Janet Leigh is the least flamboyant on screen as Sinatra's love interest, but somehow, she manages to make the part rise above what could have been totally inconsequential. The scene between train cars with Leigh and Sinatra is brilliantly acted as if it were really happening, not staged by director John Frankenheimer. As Lansbury's hated rival, John McGiver is almost angelic, and the shot of him standing in front of the large wing-spread eagle is one of the great photographic metaphors of film history. As his sweet daughter, Leslie Parrish (\"Li'l Abner\") manages to avoid being cloying. Henry Silva's portrayal of Harvey's valet can only be compared to the character of Billie Whitelaw in \"The Omen\".This is the type of movie that while not quite flawless is nevertheless brilliant. From the nightmares of the two marines recalling incidents from the war through the Democratic presidential convention at Madison Square Garden in the finale, there is no time for boredom. Try not to flinch the next time you're playing solitaire and come upon the Queen of Diamonds. Just don't get the urge to dive into the lake at Central Park's Bethesda Terrace.",

It is a perfect wrap-up of all that happened during their war imprisonment.The second is between Harvey and Angela Lansbury who portrays his mother, an anti-Communist viper whose extreme ambitions are forced onto her husband (Raymond's stepfather), a dupe of a U.S. Senator. (Back in those days, politically ambitious women - both good and not so good - could not have their own careers so they had to manipulate and groom a man in their place.) As Lansbury uncovers more truth in this scene, she is chilling - not just for the information she reveals but the shocking way she delivers it.The final grand conclusion takes place at a presidential nomination convention at Madison Square Garden . The brilliant use of a crowd scene adds further thrill to an event that is even more shocking than the scenes that precede this one. Despite knowing the conclusion, my heart was pounding before the grand event. This scene alone shows the true mettle of director John Frankenheimer who has done a great job overall. (Another great scene is the brainwashing scene at the beginning.)Among the performances, Sinatra is great as the hero while Harvey is peerless as someone whose mind doesn't fully belong to him.

Also, the directing, cinematography and editing are terrific.My problems with the film mainly stem from its dialogue. The script repeats lines from the book the film was based upon. The result is that the actor's lines are very often stilted and not believable. Other less important problems involve Lawrence Harvey who while he gives a fine performance needed a dialogue coach. He begins the film with an American accent and slowly takes on a English one. The Janet Leigh character is also troubling. It seems she is a Soviet agent but this is not explained. Her character is too subtle and clashes with the very straight forward presentation of the rest of the film.The flaws of The Manchurian Candidate would sink a lesser film.

There are many who feel this film portended, or perhaps patterned, Kennedy's assassination. Others who see John Iselin as a crafty Nixon-type, or a buffoonish Bush-alike. Still others see Angela Lansbury's character as Hilary Clinton, concocting world domination. The idea of the \"red menace,\" played to the hilt (perhaps overly-so, even for 1962), has its modern-day parallels in our views of terrorists, and the brainwashing techniques conjure up images, at least here, of suicide bombers. Second, the acting is impeccable. I replay this movie expecting to see a crack in Laurence Harvey's mannerisms, or some sly nuance to Sinatra's demeanor, but there is none. Angela Lansbury is perfect in her role as the queen hornet, and the supporting cast hands us pearls as well. Third, the writing. While there are a few objections to logic, such as Eugenie's (Janet Leigh) impetuousness, the main framework is really quite flawless. The background and reasons for Raymond's company's abduction, and the use of Raymond, all makes sense. The brainwashing techniques have not been undermined. The political scheme is brilliant. The subplots are developed without becoming clunky or puzzling. As well, the fervor and fluidity of the screenplay is obvious without pandering. Quite astounding, really. Fourth, direction. All of the aspects of good film-making are here, for use in classrooms, if you will. Lighting, camera angles, editing techniques- it all clicks. I have a hard time delivering a less-than-perfect score.",

It's arguably easier to enjoy this if you can ignore the demonizing and political overtones, but if you consider when this was made, it's to be expected. While the story-telling can be a tad... all over the place at points(it especially seems to struggle at the very beginning), the plot is excellent and rather compelling, from start to finish. The pacing is good, and you're never bored during this. There are great surprises and twists in this, and it is exciting and engaging. The editing and cinematography are impeccable. Acting is marvelous, Sinatra, Harvey, Leigh and Lansbury are spot-on. Every role is well-cast, and the characters are interesting, credible and consistent. Tension is skillfully built up, and this takes something that could easily have come off as silly and manages to render it as unforgettably creepy. There is a little violence and even less blood in this; however, the entire concept is quite disturbing. I recommend this to anyone who likes the idea of it, and/or is a fan of someone who took part in making it. 8/10",

Frank Sinatra plays a war buddy who has nightmares about a particular incident where lives were taken yet all traces of knowledge and guilt are erased. Sinatra becomes involved in an investigation that could lead to assassination and the reality of what the nightmares were really about. Director John Frankenheimer places elements just outside of view while analyzing the brainwashing factor and its effect on the victims. Sinatra brings anguish and determination as he slowly pieces everything together. Harvey plays a man oblivious to his sudden nature. Angela Lansbury plays Harvey's mother whose wickedness knows no limits. If there is a weakness then it can only be the role played by Janet Leigh, which seems misplaced as a woman Sinatra meets and romances on a train. The role comes off as a prop and only serves Leigh as a superb successful followup to her superior work in Psycho. James Gregory plays a Senator who will be discovered as a communist. Theme demonstrates how we may be controlled without recognition of such acts. Score: 9 \u00bd / 10",

            "content": "John Frankenheimer's jazzy, hip screen adaptation of Richard Condon's bestselling novel, The Manchurian Candidate is one of the strangest and most mercurial movies ever made in Hollywood \u2013 a rare film that truly is so ahead of its times. A veritable concoction of various genres and emotional textures, this exciting black-and-white cold war thriller never flags for an instant. The sordid tale gets off to an early start: a small American patrol is captured during the Korean War by Communists, bent on dominating the uppermost echelons of American politics. Whisked off to Communist China, the platoon becomes subject to brainwashing techniques that wipe their conscious memory and plant a cover story for Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), the man chosen to be a sleeper assassin. Shortly thereafter, he is seen being welcomed home in Washington as a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for his gallantry. The platoon members are soon haunted by dreams that reveal the truth of what occurred: though decorated as such, Shaw isn't the hero who saved their lives; rather, he's just another victim of a terrible, traumatic violation. The platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) senses something amiss and, determines to unravel the seemingly vicious conspiracy. Meanwhile, Shaw plays his part, manipulated by Soviet agents and his coldly calculating mother (Angela Lansbury \u2013 motivated by her husband's political agenda) as the plot he's been programmed to carry out draws closer to fruition. The captain's subsequent pursuit of the truth comprises the unusual plot which takes us from the halls of Congress to a stunning climax at a Madison Square Garden political convention. Angela Lansbury, as the scheming, caustic mother is sinfully captivating while Laurence Harvey is pitch-perfect as the docile, disturbed son/war-hero. Sinatra along with the rest of the secondary cast is never less than effective. Frankenheimer's direction is nothing short of masterful, achieving maximum subversion of the audience with a blend of unsettling compositions and fly-on-the-wall photography. The quick cuts and tricky juxtaposition of scenes match the flamboyance of the script. Especially brilliant are the dream sequences that toggle between objective and subjective points of view on the brainwashing demonstration. The political paranoia may, at first glance, seem far-fetched, but when you figure that reality is just as bizarre, you realize the story's sobering clairvoyance.The fascinating thing is that, from uncertain premise to shattering conclusion, one does not question plausibility: the events being rooted in their own cinematic reality. Chilling in the extreme, The Manchurian Candidate is a sensational paranoid thriller: a lurid tale of high-level subterfuge, depicting, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.",

            "content": "The first time I saw this film, about 10 years ago, I thought it was really fascinating. One year later, I still enjoyed but was a bit perplexed: was this the usual Liberal Hollywood taking shots at right-wingers or is this actually the reverse with the left-wingers, the Communists really being shown as the \"bad guys?\" After a third and final viewing a few years later, I felt it was both but the leaned toward Liberal, which is par for the course. The general plot had left wingers brainwashing an influential American family into looking like extreme right wingers and gaining access to the White House through political influence and assassination. Most of the movie featured a Joe McCarthy-ish senator (James Gregory) and his conniving wife (Angela Lansbury) as the villains. They were portrayed as right wingers, of course, but were really just dupes of the Communists (left wing)! Got that??!Suffice to say the movie had messages from both the Right and Left but politics aside, the film boasts an involving story that keeps your interest for most of the two hours and six minutes, and had some very interesting characters who are fascinating to watch. That includes the supporting roles. It didn't hurt to have John Frankenheimer direct, either. His films usually were outstanding.I thought Lansbury and Laurence Harvey had the best parts of the film. The only really stupid and/or annoying character in the movie was played by Janet Leigh. Her romance scenes with Frank Sinatra added nothing to this riveting film. Eliminated, it would have made for a tighter, even better movie. Also, Sinatra found out too easily where Harvey was hiding in Madison Square Garden. Nobody could figure it out that fast! Nonetheless, the ending was a bit surprising and I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen this.The movie has endured the test of time and, from what I hear, would have been best left on its own instead of watering down the name of this film with an insipid re-make.

            "content": "The early 1960s marked the beginning of the most turbulent period of time in both America's and the world's history, as the battle between America's brand of democracy and capitalism and the Soviet Union's communism heated up and almost exploded with world-ending results. And perhaps unsurprisingly, Hollywood was right there with at least four hugely significant movies that broached on these Cold War themes and fears with incredibly memorable results. Three of these films, Doctor Strangelove, Seven Days In May, and Fail Safe, were unleashed in 1964. The first of the quartet, released in 1962, was the chilling and disturbing political thriller The Manchurian Candidate.Under the intense direction of John Frankenheimer (who would later direct Seven Days In May), and based on Richard Condon's 1959 best-selling novel of the same name, The Manchurian Candidate stars Frank Sinatra as a Korean War veteran who keeps having nightmares from his time as a prisoner of war where one of his fellow soldiers, one Raymond Shaw (Lawrence Harvey) shoots and kills two other men in their platoon under the brainwashing of a truly sinister Red Chinaman (Khigh Dhiegh). Harvey has become a decorated soldier because of his bravery in battle, but Sinatra suspects something deeply wrong about his comrade, especially when he finds out that his other fellow platoon members have had the exact same nightmares as Sinatra, involving a Chinese garden party.In the meantime, Harvey has a lot of issues of his own, involving his toadying father-in-law, a wanna-be Joe McCarthy type (James Gregory) and a very icy, rabidly anti-Communist mother (played by none other than Angela Lansbury). And Lansbury has got something in mind for her son to do. It's not exactly pleasant.Both Sinatra and Frankenheimer, along with co-producer and screenwriter George Axelrod, collaborated very closely on this film; and not only does this professionalism show up in spades, including (ironically) with the playing card motif (the Queen of Diamonds), but it also shows up in the way it skirts the rather thin line between black comedy (the moments between Harvey, Gregory, and Lansbury) and political horror (the unfortunate deed that Harvey has been brainwashed by Lansbury to carry out, and which Sinatra must stop). For a very long time, it was thought that The Manchurian Candidate was withdrawn from circulation following the assassination of Jack Kennedy in Dallas in 1963 because the plot of the film seemed to presage real life all too presciently. This isn't quite the case, but the issues raised in the film, including brainwashing, whether from Communists like the Khigh Dheigh character or McCarthy-inspired neo-fascists of the stripe portrayed by Lansbury or Gregory, political manipulation within the mass media, and personal demonizing of \"The Other\" are things we are still dealing with even up to this very second, and likely will still be dealing with for years, maybe even decades to come. In this respect in particular, The Manchurian Candidate remains incredibly important, and a film to be preserved, even in light of its being reworked by director Jonathan Demme in 2004.Clearly, this deserves a '10' (of diamonds, of course).",

I'm a huge fan of John Frankenheimer (\"Seconds\" is one of the most underrated and un-acknowledged films of all time in my opinion) and his directorial style here is just as distinct as always: the cold distances, the skewed close-ups, etc. His presence is in every frame, and I continue to be baffled by the fact that even many film critics don't consider him to be a great director.Frank Sinatra gives a worthy performance, although it is inferior to Denzel Washington's in the remake. Angela Lansbury is totally creepy and convincing but the real scene-stealer is Laurence Harvey. As in the remake, it's his character who is the most fascinating, multi-layered and believable - Harvey gives a terrific performance (and Shriever, too, in the remake), which is unforgettable.Overall this is a classic movie and it still holds up well today - it's a big step forward for film-making (violence, swearing, and sexual content in a 1960s film that certainly paved the way for the movies of the '70s), and from its performances to direction to script to entertainment value, it's an A+ all around.Highly recommended. 5/5",

I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it.Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988).Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens.

The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story.The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences.The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother.

            "content": "Is there the least doubt that John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate remains the nerviest, most flamboyant political thriller ever made in America? It came like a blast of thawing warmth after the chilly caution of the Cold War years, when political 'thrillers' were either the dour and dutiful lectures of the anti-Communist cycle, or so heavily coded they were uncontroversial (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). The Manchurian Candidate takes the conventions of the Red Scare movies and stands them on their head \u0096 or kicks them right up into the lunar orbit of what Richard Hofstadter termed the paranoid style in American politics. It opens, in flashback, in the dreary trenches of Korea, where a U.S. officer (Lawrence Harvey) would garner a Purple Heart for rescuing most of his platoon from an enemy attack. But back in the States, recurring nightmares plague the survivors. In them, the matronly members of a ladies' garden club, all print dresses and brash millinery, melt into a sinister praesidium of Russian and Chinese functionaries demonstrating the success of their newly developed brain-washing techniques. (The circling camera-work is virtuosic, and when an African-American veteran experiences the same dream, the club women are all black.) Army intelligence officer Frank Sinatra is one of the dream's victims, and so incapacitated by it that he's been demoted to public-relations work.That work takes him into the Senate hearing rooms where a drunken, buffoonish demagogue (James Gregory) strews accusations of Communist infiltration of the government. Though the press finds his charges inconsistent and erratic, they inflame the country (as his wife and power-behind-the-throne Angela Lansbury sensibly remarks, 'Are they asking 'Are there Communists in government?' No, they're asking 'How many Communists are there?'). As it happens, Harvey is Lansbury's son and Gregory's stepson, though he claims to abhor everything they stand for and, spurning the hero's welcome they've arranged, announces that he plans to work for a powerful liberal columnist in New York.Things happen fast. The columnist if founded murdered in his bed. Harvey falls in love (again) with Leslie Parrish, the daughter of one of Gregory's staunchest adversaries (John McGivern), who's trying to block Gregory's bid to be vice-presidential candidate. Sinatra meets up with a forward Janet Leigh (peripheral to the plot but, in a measuredly kooky performance, a welcome respite). And he finds that the Harvey he knew is no longer what he remembered \u0096 or that what he remembers is not what actually happened. Those aforementioned things come to a head at one of the parties' (interestingly, it's never said which one) nominating convention at Madison Square Garden....The dizzy spiral of murders and reverses and revelations leaves the familiar fingerprints of novelist Richard Condon (and those fingerprints can be found in two more dazzling movies made from his work: Winter Kills and Prizzi's Honor). Screenwriter George Axelrod and Frankenheimer don't pull many of Condon's punches, either. And the cast they assembled to bring this wickedly entertaining yet frightening parable to life was stellar. Its Queen of Diamonds, however, is unquestionably Lansbury, in what must be acclaimed her most powerful appearance on film. With a steely gaze and a mouth puckered into a permanent hen's hole, she steals her scenes with bravado, as she schemes and manipulates and plays her global game of cards for keeps. She's the unforgettable centerpiece of an unforgettable movie.The Manchurian Candidate disappeared for decades. Sinatra had starred in two movies that dealt with presidential assassinations (the other being Suddenly) and he withdrew them from circulation following the death of John F. Kennedy (another story has it merely a dispute over rights). Released again in the late 1980s, The Manchurian Candidate reached audiences for which the turmoil of McCarthyism was but a distant memory (if they knew of it at all). But the appeal and the importance of The Manchurian Candidate apparently transcended the topical. In its wake came a nest of thrillers that raised questions about the benevolence of American power and those who wield it:: Frankenheimer's own Seven Days in May, The Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor. But, even with the threat of a heavy-duty remake (to be released within days of this writing), The Manchurian Candidate holds on to its championship title \u0096 and under all its outrageousness, for all its being tied to a particular era, it's still a dead serious piece of work.",

It really is an absolutely marvelous experience unlike anything I've ever seen. Along with this riveting thriller is a subtle satire on the morality of government that is marvelously done. It's not over-done and doesn't take any focus away from the story of Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) which is why I love it.I've heard that the film is slow-paced so I went in expecting that, but it was the complete opposite. It wrapped me up in the first scene and refused to let go until the shattering finale. The ending is breathtaking and completely stunning. I had no idea what was about to unfold before me and it had me speechless. I have no hesitation in calling Raymond Shaw the most tragic character of all time. I really connected with him and this relation made his story so much more devastating. But even if I couldn't relate to the character, his story is deeply upsetting and unnerving.It certainly helps that Laurence Harvey's performance is one of the most immersive and one of the greatest that I've ever seen.

She soothingly explains to the transfixed Harvey exactly at what point during the ceremony he must take aim at his target--and kill. It's the most chilling scene in the movie, except for the finale which is really spellbinding, as it takes place in a crowded Madison Square Garden with FRANK SINATRA hot on the trail of the would-be killer.Sinatra's almost immediate discovery is what throws reality off a bit at this point. He sees a pinpoint of light in the far distance and knows exactly which stairway, which exit, which floor to go to in a matter of seconds. Well, it's called taking dramatic license for the sake of art, I suppose.All in all, a very chilling reminder of the time Americans were living through in the McCarthy era, only occasionally flawed by distracting things like the love interest for Sinatra (JANET LEIGH) in a totally unnecessary sub-plot that does nothing to further the action.John Frankenheimer gets every ounce of suspense out of pivotal scenes and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the final scene unfolds.A final word about the performances: ANGELA LANSBURY has never been more mesmerizing.",

It's literally immersed in the atmosphere and paranoia of the Cold War, and the best way to relate to this movie if you don't have that background might be to reflect upon the fact that some of the paranoid reactions to Muslims in the current so-called \"War on Terror\" is not unlike the reaction to suspected Communists in the era this movie was made in.The performances in this are all top-notch. Totally out of character (at least as I've ever known her) was Angela Lansbury as the completely evil mother of Raymond (Laurence Harvey) and wife of the bumbling and incompetent Senator Iselin (James Gregory.) In a field of great performances, Lansbury really does steal the show, particularly because this is so unlike the type of character you expect to find her playing. I don't want to downplay the other actors, though. From Harvey and Gregory to Frank Sinatra this cast was superb. I had a bit of trouble figuring out Janet Leigh's character of Rosie, who ends up marrying Sinatra's Major Marco. She appears all of a sudden; they get married all of a sudden. At first, I thought she was part of the conspiracy - but I guess I was just getting caught up in the paranoia.The story is wonderfully bizarre - and difficult to follow if you miss too much of it. We know from the start that it's about an American patrol captured during the Korean War and brainwashed, but you're never sure where it's going in the end. It's not the type of movie where you can fall asleep for fifteen minutes and pick right back up. (Not that you'd be tempted to.) It has twists and turns, and you can never really be sure who the good guys and bad guys are. It all leads up to an absolutely stunning and shocking ending. It's great entertainment and - if you can make that connection between the Cold War and the War on Terror, it still has a message. 8/10",

For the first time since he won it back in 1952 in the Korean War Raymond really felt that he earned it, and so did everyone else in the theater watching the movie.Raymond never really felt right with that medal and disliked having to wear it he felt that he didn't earn it and that everything about his war record was false. Saving nine fellow GI's from the Communist Chinese by whom they were held captive and also wiping out a North Korean and Communist Chinese patrol as the GI's under his leadership fought their way back across the border into South Korea was more then enough for Raymond to get the Medal of Honor but something deep inside his mind told him it was a lie. But this time there was nothing at all phony about what Raymond did. He saved the United States from a covert Communist takeover, but by doing that it cost Raymond his life.Powerful Cold War thriller that never lost it's punch since it's release back in 1962 with it's story about an attempt to overthrow and take over the United States government from within. Super American patriot and closet USSR & Communist Chinese collaborator Mrs. Iselin, Angela Lansbury, is positioning her drunken and buffoonish husband, and her son Raymond's step-father, Sen. John \"Johnny\" Iselin, James Gregory, to become President of the United States. Mrs. Iselin first plans to get \"Johnny\" nominated Vice President and then have the president of the party out of office assassinated which will catapult \"Johnny\" into the White House due to the sympathetic and emotional volcano that would erupt all over the country following that tragic event. Secretly working with the Soviet Union for ten years Mrs. Iselin has used her position as Sen. Iselin's wife and head of some fifteen American Patriotic organizations where she is now within reach of her goals. But Mrs. Iselin has other ideas about what she'll do as the power behind her husband the future President Iselin when he takes office. Resenting both the Soviet Union and Communist China Mrs. Iselin didn't forget what they did in making her beloved and only son an instrument of murder to achieve their aims. And even worse treating her with disrespect and not as an equal she'll make sure that they won't forget that either. Mrs. Iselin maniacally plans to use the full force of the US military to destroy those two Communist powers, for what they did to Raymond and how they treated her, in a Third World War. The \"Manchurian Candidate\" starts out with a bad dream and ends with an awakened and walking nightmare with a double-assassination and suicide at the Presidential Nominating Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Frank Sinatra, Maj. Bennett Marco, gives one of the best acting performances of his career as a troubled Korean War Vet. who's nightmares of what happened to him and his comrades as prisoners of the Communists Chinese in Manchuria becomes real, all too real.The one thing that Raymond Shaw ever wanted in his life is to be both loved and lovable. The most disliked man in his unit in Korea Raymonds former comrades-in-arms, including Maj. Marco, began to see Raymond in a much more different light after he \"Rescued\" them from their Communist Chinese captors. When ever asked about what they thought of Raymond they would say with a blank stare and emotionless voice that Raymond \"Is the kindest bravest most wonderful human being that they ever knew in their lives\"!. Angela Lansbury as the power hungry and psychotic Mrs. Iselin in one of the most weirdest and scariest roles even seen in the movies. Who's so obsessed with gaining the power of the Presidency of the United States and using that power with deadly results is both unnerving and hypnotic to watch. The Soviet Union and Communist Chinese who together devised a way to manipulate Raymond's mind with the Queen of Diamonds as a trigger. This diabolical plan is later countered by Maj. Marco with an entire deck of 52 Red Queens that overloaded and blew out the circuits that were installed in Raymond's brain by them. Thus changing him from a helpless zombie under communist control into a potent killer with a hatred and vengeance against those who programed him to kill others.The only flaw that I found in the movie \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was that of Euguine Rose Chaney, Janet Leigh. She seemed to have no reason for being in the movie unless her role was drastically cut down to where it made little or no sense at all in order to shorten the movie to it's already over long 126 minute final print. The movie \"Manchurian Candidate\" grabs you right from the opening credits and never lets go and even when it's over you just can't, like Maj. Marco and Raymond Shaw and every one else in that US Army unit in Korea, get it out of your mind.",

            "content": "Speaking of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, contemporary audience may still recall the 2004 remake headlined by Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, directed by Jonathan Demme (a 6/10), which is a proficient political thriller and grafts the time-line from Korean War to Gulf War. Now it is time to revisit the original version directed by John Frankenheimer, the only film I have watched among his prolific filmography before this one actually is his final big screen feature, the romance-thriller mixed-bag REINDEER GAMES (2000, 5/10), Frankenheimer passed away in 2002, and this 1962 black-and-white stunner is no doubt above a few notches over its comparatively problematic remake, substantially due to the Harvey-Lansbury pair's Oscar-worthy performances.This outlandish brainwashing plot can be gauged as a fantasised product of the heightened McCarthyism conjoined with the widespread paranoia towards Communism at that particular era in the USA, based on Richard Cordon's 1959 novel of the same name, the conspiracy is undeniably ahead of its time, even now in 2015, half a century later, it still looks rather preposterous to believe in the first place, and all its technical explanations have been dumbed down to the hypnosis provoked by the sheer appearance of the \"Queen of Diamonds\" card and becomes an unwitting assassin, also our victim Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Harvey) is not literary \"unwitting\" to his merciless deeds, as it turns out, induced by Major Bennett Marco's (Sinatra) deck trick, afterwards, he is able to memorise what he has done in the hypnotic mode. Don't know what is the accurate medical term for his condition, in fact, Raymond resembles a man tormented by his uncontrollable transformation into another personality who is nothing but a killing machine, a multi-personae case maybe, but how on earth, North Korean scientists can pull off such a potent technique? The film never care to expound on that and Raymond's wake-up call is also a moot point without any definitive clarification about the theory of Bennett counteracting the effect with his cards trickery. But thankfully, all these puzzles do not shackle the film's engrossing vibrancy, Frankenheimer is such an imposing conductor at the helm of a layered conspiracy, stresses soldiers' PTSD quandary, juggles with the buffoonery of the so-called \"diplomatic\" political system, unblinkingly stages the abysmal tragedy we all fear to happen and its impactful ramifications on Raymond's mental breakdown, and last but not the least, lures viewers into the love-and-hatred manipulation executed by Raymond's scheming mother Mrs. Eleanor (Lansbury) with an incestuous allegation between them. Angela Lansbury is righteously honoured with an Oscar nomination for her starry vehemence as the super-villainess steers a vicious political campaign and is unscrupulous in her endeavour to achieve what she wants even if it has turned her beloved son into damaged goods, Lansbury is a magnificent attention grabber in her slightly elderly make-up and conveys the pernicious verve of a woman much older than her real age since in reality she is only three years senior than Harvey. Frank Sinatra is quite compelling in his saviour's character design, bestows audience with a pretty vintage fighting sequences with Henry Silva, who plays the Korean Chunjin, regrettably the casting director didn't have the gut to hire a real Asian to play him. In spite of her third-billing, Janet Leigh's entire presence is brief and unhooked to the major plot, the part where she gets instantly moonstruck by Sinatra's Bennett is so bogus to swallow, a red herring or not, her character is plain nonsensical. Laurence Harvey is the unsung hero in this picture, upstages Sinatra with his \"I'm unlovable\" monologue and his polarised personae are contagiously affecting out of his usual handsome dispassionateness. He is rapt with his sweetheart Jocelyn (Parrish) and her father Senator Thomas Jordan (McGiver), and utterly standoffish with his mother and even with Bennett, his tragedy looms large inevitably in the end, while the last-second turn of event is pretty much anticipated, his twist of fate still gives a lump in the throat. To a large extent, the film is a tall-tale engineered with the uppermost flourish with cinematic stunts and camera gimmicks, stands the test of time as the go-to pick of its genre.",

Movies usually don't succeed leaving so many loose ends, but then there is no movie quite like \"The Manchurian Candidate.\"During the Korean War, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is awarded the Medal of Honor for leading a combat patrol to safety, killing an entire company of Chinese soldiers at the cost of two men. One of the surviving comrades, Bennett Marco, is haunted by a dream in which Shaw is made to strangle one of the lost soldiers in front of a ladies' garden club.Is it possible that Chinese and Russian Communists kidnapped the patrol and played with Shaw's mind? To what purpose? Might it have something to do with the fact Shaw's stepfather is Sen. John Iselin, the famous anti-communist witch-hunter?Though Harvey has the title role, Marco is the lead character, played by Frank Sinatra in the autumn of his Rat Pack period. It's a surprise seeing how seriously he takes the role of Marco, shedding his sharkskin cool for a twitchy persona of muttered comments and hooded stares. Early on, we see him visited by a commanding officer who notices all the books he has scattered around. Marco admits to reading them all, and as he explains how interested he is in banking, horse diseases, and the novels of Joyce Cary, his face just falls because, deep inside, he doesn't know why he's reading such a bizarre selection, and he's too burnt out to pretend.Sinatra is great not just because he plays against type but for the way he commands the screen at key moments the way only a handful of other stars ever could, none of whom would have been right for Marco. But he is only one piece in this magnificent jigsaw puzzle, which also includes Harvey as the cold, mechanical, yet lovably unlovable Shaw, Angela Lansbury as Shaw's domineering mother, James Gregory as the buffoonish, Lincoln-fixated Sen. Iselin, and Janet Leigh as a mysterious woman who is another one of those elements of the film that leaves people wondering.Someone else who deserves to be singled out is Khigh Dhiegh as Chinese Communist control agent Dr. Yen, the one character in the film except for Sen. Iselin who seems to be able to laugh, even though his mirth comes with a body count. \"With humor, comrade, always with a little humor,\" he urges a Russian colleague while plotting the use of their joint \"mechanism.\"Is \"Manchurian Candidate\" anti-communist, or anti-anti-communist? Iselin's McCarthyistic behavior is a source of brilliant satire, but the communist menace in this film is not only very real, but bigger than life. The Soviet Union was on famously bad terms with Red China, yet here they get along fine. It presents a deeper sort of paranoia, but perhaps it is meant as satire of the whole Red Menace thing.You don't know what you are to think, because director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter George Axelrod never tell you. Taking their cue from Hitchcock and other pioneer auteurs (during his \"hydrangea symposium,\" Dr. Yen references a 1941 work by someone named Welles), Frankenheimer and Axelrod throw red herrings at you from all directions, and enmesh you so deeply in a life-or-death mystery you need to watch it a second time just to pick up on how funny it all is.Add to that the dissonant score of David Amram and some very clever camera-work (the cleverest being a real-life mistake when Sinatra was filmed in a crucial scene with Harvey out-of-focus, thus lending a perfect touch of ambiguity to one of Sinatra's best moments on film), not to mention four or five hundred other things, and you have a movie classic, one that works both for the casual viewer and the film buff. Other films may try to play with your mind, but \"The Manchurian Candidate\" really does, in a way that leaves you grateful for the treatment.",

His commanding officer Maj. Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has been having nightmares where he is seeing Raymond and other officers are being brainwashed to carrying out orders, and superiors send him on leave telling them this. He goes to visit Raymond, they have a fight, and gets arrested, and when let go he goes to see another officer who has his same nightmare. Marco knows that this nightmare is true, and that Raymond is key to a plot to kill a presidential candidate with his brainwashed mind being controlled by his mother! The trigger to give Raymond orders is to make him play a game of solitaire and finding the queen of diamonds, and he will anything he is told. Thankfully in the end he is released from this brainwashing, he kills the people who made him try and do the terrible deed, including his mother, and he shoots himself.

            "content": "The Manchurian Candidate is a chilling story about how the national security of the United States is compromised. The story includes several memorable characters: Sergeant Raymond Shaw, Major Bennett Marco, Senator John Yerkes Iselin, Senator Thomas Jordan, and Jocelyn Jordan. However, one character dominates the story: Senator Iselin's wife, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin, played with exceeding effectiveness by Angela Lansbury. Mrs. Iselin is one of the most detestable characters in the history of Hollywood cinema. She is a cold-blooded manipulator and murderer. Sam Spade and Mike Hammer would have had no chance against her. She is too ruthless. She is a Fifth-columnist, a Quisling, and a Benedict Arnold all wrapped up into one, but worse because she is essentially apolitical, which makes her actions seem even more irrational. She is not preaching the party line. She believes in one thing only: Mrs. Iselin. She will stop at nothing to achieve her aim, which is absolute power. She is a megalomaniac. There is nothing too low that she won't do to achieve her goal, which includes committing incest with her hapless and troubled son, Sergeant Shaw, whose surly yet pliable nature fits perfectly into her sordid and nefarious plan. Mrs. Iselin is even more sinister in the way she wraps herself in the mantel of patriotism to disguise her wicked scheme. Who could ever suspect that such a patriotic flag-waving American, married to a loud, brash, commie-baiting US senator, would be plotting her country's downfall? Only one person knows: Sergeant Shaw. But is Mrs. Iselin really in control of her actions? As the movie depicts, victims of brain washing are not even aware that they are being controlled. Indeed, it is unclear whether Mrs. Iselin herself is acting on cue from her handlers, or is she taking the initiative and using her handlers for \"technical support\" instead. Is she the master operative or the tool? The idea that outside forces hostile to the United States could plant operatives inside highest levels of power gives cause for concern, because it could happen. Such concern is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War, which is why, in the post 9-11 world, this movie, although released in 1962, would resonate with today's audience. Is this movie film noir? It has the trappings of film noir \u2013 the black and white photography, the dysfunctional characters, the violence, the odd camera angles \u2013 yet deals with such a wide range of sub-textual themes \u2013 political, international, social, societal, familial, military, and psychological \u2013 and tells a story set in locations so far-flung \u2013 from Korea to Washington, DC to New York City, that it may not fit in the film noir genre. This movie is not a crime drama. There is no detective getting caught up in a quest for a McGuffin and the bad guys are not street hoodlums, but rather Soviet operatives using a radical method of behavioral conditioning to infiltrate and subvert the government of the United States. This makes the movie either a political drama or a war movie depicting a new and insidious kind of psychological warfare based on mind control.This movie makes you think about how our government can be insidiously infiltrated and subverted by outside elements that want to destroy us and and do so in a manner that is so cunning and devious that we won't even know that it's happening. It also makes you think about how a highly suggestible and vulnerable individual can become an unwitting shill for those outside elements who are plotting to overthrow the government. The plot seems fantastically improbable, but it isn't. When a man can be conditioned to respond to a certain cue, and then do the most improbable and outrageous acts, like jumping into a lake or assassinating someone, then there's a definite problem, as portrayed in this movie. Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, James Gregory and the rest of the cast are excellent in this real Cold War thriller. Indeed, this movie causes one to re-examine the entire McCarthy era. Senator McCarthy may have been right in his warning about the infiltration of Communist subversives into the U. S. government; he was just accusing the wrong people of being the subversives. This is a movie to take seriously because it's credible ... maybe too credible. By the way, if you are a fan of hypnotism or are attracted to the Queen of Hearts then this movie is definitely for you.",

            "content": "Raymond Shaw, stepson of Sen. John Iselin, a highly vocal anti-Communist demagogue, returns from the Korean War decorated for war heroism. The sullen, withdrawn Shaw is described with robotic precision by all the surviving members of his platoon, including Army lifer Bennett Marco, as a warm and wonderful human being. But Marco is having nightmares about what really happened in Korea, and when he finds out others have been experiencing the same disturbances, he sets about to uncover the truth - that the entire platoon had been captured and brainwashed by the Chinese Communist enemy. As opponents of the rabidly right-wing Iselin and his wife, Raymond's fierce, controlling mother, begin to be destroyed politically or killed outright, Marco discovers Raymond's deadly mission and the horrifying reason they were brainwashed years earlier.The Manchurian Candidate is one of those rare pictures that enjoys a reputation and cult status that extends far beyond its effectiveness as a superb entertainment. The controversial subject matter and unique combination of genres and tones (ranging from nerve-shattering thriller to wildly fantastic political satire), flawlessly executed by all involved, earn it a place in the pantheon. But the picture has also gained in cache thanks to the historical events that came on the heels of its release, an era of political unrest and horrifying assassination that seems to be foreshadowed by the film's story. On top of that, the film's unavailability for viewing for more than 20 years, fueled by speculation for the reasons it was being withheld, added an air of mystery to this volatile and terrifying parable of American political life.The true mark of an essential film is how well it stands the test of time. When it was re-released in 1988, The Manchurian Candidate caused as much, or more, of a sensation than on its initial theatrical run, finding an entirely new generation of admirers. Since that time, it has taken on an almost mythic importance due to the events that transpired in its wake and the fact that both Frankenheimer and Sinatra were close friends of the Kennedy family. Seen today, it is as exciting, creepy, and darkly humorous as it was in 1962. And despite a 2004 reworking and updating of the story, the original's power and influence have not been diminished.",

I didn't know that Frank Sinatra could act so well. He gave an outstanding performance here. His range was remarkable. He goes from loud to reserved to confused to depressed to in love, etc. All the acting here is just top notch.Laurence Harvey's Raymond is cold, angry and very bitter. Consider one of the earlier scenes with his mother in the airplane, where he doesn't even try to mask his contempt for his mother and step-father. When asked what he and his employer have in common by he replies: \"We found that we both loath and despise you and Johnny!\" However, he isn't as cold as he seems. There is a dark secret inside him, one so dark he doesn't even know it himself. He has been brainwashed to be a killing machine. Whenever he plays solitare and sees the Red Queen, he goes into a trance where he'll kill anyone they want him to and have no memory of it, and therefor, no guilt. Now, hard as this may be to believe, there is also a very soft side we eventually discover. \"I'm not lovable. But to her I was.\" He's referring of course to Josie, the love of his life, which his mother destroyed. He then becomes sad and depressed over his lost love. I could talk for days simply on his character because there are so many levels to him, so many chambers of his mind that I could explore.As a political thriller it works brilliantly. The corruption of the Johnny, the fear of communists infiltrating the government, the lies, the under the table deals, the scams. All of it makes for an intense thriller. What makes it even greater is the threat and suspense created by Raymond, because we don't know who they'll have him kill next, and who's telling him to kill whom. But for me, what pushes this movie over the top is the Angela Lansbury character. This isn't some nice tea pot, or the crafty old woman from \"Murder She Wrote.\" The thing that is so great about this character is that while the character of Noah Cross in \"Chinatown\" will forever remain as the most chilling father figure in a film (a good runner up would be the Donald Sutherland character of 2000's \"Panic\") Lansbury's character is the most despicable, horrid mother character I've ever seen. No question. Imagine if the two of them had married, what kind of a family they might have produced. But she alone is enough to make us cringe all throughout this film.\"The Manchurian Candidate\" is a magnificent political thriller, yet it is so emotional and the characters so interesting, so varried and so well acted by everyone in the movie, it is simply one of the best films of all time. Once you see this movie, you will not be able to get it out of your mind because of how rich the dialogue is, all that is lost in it, all that takes place, and all that is represented here.",

            "content": "\"The Manchurian Candidate\" is an offbeat political thriller which tells the story of an elaborate plot to assassinate an American presidential candidate. Bizarrely, the people who jointly devise the plan are a group of very powerful communists and the wife of a right wing U.S. politician. Furthermore, the assassin is a brainwashed Korean War veteran who happens to be the son of the American conspirator! The fact that this all sounds a bit far-fetched is completely intentional as this movie is wonderfully satirical, full of black humour and very effective in portraying the politicians, whether they're communists or McCarthyites as being equally evil and ridiculous.George Axelrod's screenplay is based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel and the tensions of the Cold War period are captured very successfully in the story which, at the time of the movie's release, was clearly both original and controversial. The significance of brainwashing in the plot is redolent of the era in which the book was written but in retrospect, the way in which the assassination was to be carried out looked prescient, as it was strikingly similar to the way in which President John Kennedy was killed in the year following the movie's release.During the Korean War, a platoon of American soldiers is captured by Chinese Communists who take the men to Manchuria where they're subjected to a variety of mind control techniques. When the men return to the United States, Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is awarded the Congessional Medal Of Honor for bravely saving the lives of most of the men in his platoon.Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) who had been the platoon's commander in Korea suffers recurring nightmares which make him suspect that he and his men had been brainwashed and that the official account of Shaw's exploits may not be accurate. The torment he suffers because of these dreams leads him to undertake an investigation to find out the truth.Mrs Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury) is Raymond's overbearing mother who's now married to Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory). He's a Vice Presidential candidate, a politician who makes a lot of noise without saying anything of any substance and a man who indulges in a great deal of anti-communist rhetoric. Mrs Iselin is a communist agent who's working on a plan to deliver the presidency to her husband so that the United States can then be brought under communist control. She's also the person who's responsible for activating the brainwashed Raymond when it becomes necessary for him to carry out an assassination.Raymond is a cold character who was disliked by the men in his platoon and yet when asked about him they automatically reply by saying that \"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life\". In fact, he hates his mother and his stepfather vehemently and is totally unaware that he's been programmed to be an assassin.Major Marco's investigation reveals the significance that a playing card (the Queen of Diamonds) has in stimulating Raymond into action when he's required to shoot someone and he then uses a pack full of these cards to try to nullify Raymond's response to this trigger. It's uncertain how effective Marco's action has been until Mrs Iselin primes Raymond to assassinate her husband's party's Presidential Candidate so that Senator Iselin will then be called upon to take on the role of his murdered colleague.Laurence Harvey's demeanour and way of talking emphasise his character's lack of warmth and spontaneity and make him convincing as someone who's functioning in some kind of hypnotic state. Frank Sinatra is impressive in conveying Marco's combination of confusion, despair and anxiety and Angela Lansbury excels as an incredibly evil woman who's ruthless, manipulative and very controlling. Her son's emotional development had undoubtedly been harmed by her domineering behaviour and in one of her most egregious actions she even used him to kill a political opponent and his daughter who happened to be the only woman that Raymond had ever loved.\"The Manchurian Candidate\" was not a great commercial success when it was first released and it was then rarely seen for a period of nearly 25 years. The success and appreciation that it's gained in the years since is attributable to its intrinsic quality and its wonderful blend of humour, intelligence and edginess rather than the cachet that it unquestionably gained from being out of circulation for such a long time.",

            "content": "This is one of those movies that no matter how many times I have seen it, I can always watch it again.The ideas that make this 1962 film so intriguing were in Richard Condon's book published in 1959. The director, John Frankenheimer and the filmmakers, left some of it out, and changed the ending a little, but for the most part followed it quite closely. They came up with a movie that still has a modern edge, helped considerably by David Amram's punchy, jazz infused orchestral score.A platoon of U.S. soldiers commanded by Captain Marco (Frank Sinatra) is captured in Korea then brainwashed before being returned to America. One of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), is planted as a sleeper to eventually assassinate key political figures. At first glance, it all seemed pretty far-fetched until real events in 1963 blurred the line between fact and fiction.Bizarrely, in his description of the relationship between Raymond Shaw's mother and his McCarthyesque stepfather, Condon has been accused of plagiarising Robert Graves' novel, \"I Claudius\". Although there is possibly something to it, knowing this doesn't detract from the brilliance of the plot.The novel and then the movie seemed quite prescient considering that they both came out before the assassination of JFK in Dallas in 1963. One of the conspiracy theories, which claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been programmed to kill, seemed eerily like \"The Manchurian Candidate\".Although these days, not so many Occidentals would be made up to look like Orientals, the main casting was interesting. Frank Sinatra might have been a touch old to play the officer in charge of the platoon, but he brought a big presence to the movie. Laurence Harvey, who hardly altered his English accent, brought class and a certain aloofness that was perfect for the role of Raymond Shaw.Harvey has always copped a lot of flack from critics and actors, especially from British film and theatre; they felt that he was a poor actor. Nevertheless, the public and Hollywood producers seemed to disagree because he cropped up in a lot of good movies around this time. While certain critics claim that this film was the one and only classic film in which he appeared, they also state that he was not the reason for its success. But surely the opposite is true, his intensity and that sense of the troubled outsider are a big part of the reason why it stays in the memory.Although the love interest between Sinatra and Janet Leigh's characters seemed a bit stilted, John Frankenheimer's direction was inspired; there are a number of great scenes in the film. But in the end, history meshed \"The Manchurian Candidate\" with unforgettable events, marking it as a film for the ages.",

One of the captives Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is brainwashed by his holders to be an assassin.Shaw becomes a U. S. hero awarded the highest medal in the U. S. the Medal of Honor as he seemingly saves the lives of the platoon risking his own life in the process.The liberated prisoners return to the U. S. after the war however Shaw's dangerous brainwashing continues with lethal consequences as he murders several politicians in the process.The film features Angela Lansbury as Shaw's power hungry mother Eleanor Iselin who enjoys a fraught relationship with her son and is now married to a Republican Senator.Lansbury is perhaps best known as television sleuth from the 1980s Jessica Fletcher off Murder, She Wrote. A do gooder character with questionable relatives!Well in this film Lansbury is a villain. A good one at that.She conspires with the Communists to elevate her husband's political career and her own power.She uses her son's brainwashing for her own purposes toward the end of the film in an assassination sequence at the Republican Presidential nomination convention at Madison square garden.The film was released only a year prior to the assassination of John. F. Kennedy. There is a theory that another actor in the film, Frank Sinatra purchased the rights to the film shortly after release and kept the film unavailable until 1988 as guilt for Kennedy's death. Did the plight of character Raymond Shaw inspire Lee Harvey Oswald?A film I had never considered viewing is not a film in a blockbuster sense. It is more of a satire of the 1960s climate of the United States that I had only paid lip service to.Definitely worth a viewing.",

            "content": "In the early '60s, this film shook audiences to the core. Imagine a film about a military hero brainwashed into becoming an assassin to be used as a weapon by a power-hungry group of politicians who yearn to replace democracy with fascism. And the brainwashed weapon turns out to the son of the woman behind this political movement. A woman who calls anyone who criticizes her \"a communist,\" a \"socialist,\" or \"un-American.\" Sound familiar? This may have been far-fetched for some viewers in 1962 but rings absolutely true in 2021. And following the assassination of JFK in 1963, star Frank Sinatra had the film pulled out of circulation, as it hit \"too close to home.\" It was re-released in 1988 to art houses throughout the country, on its way to becoming the bonafide classic it is considered to be now.If the chilling plot isn't enough to recommend this film - it is also a brilliant black comedy. Although the laughs are mixed with anxiety. Take Johnny Iselin. He is an absolute clown, but married to Eleanor, brilliantly played by Angela Lansbury. Johnny is a tool in both senses of the term, pushed out as the Vice Presidential candidate who will be President if the current, extremely popular Presidential candidate is assassinated as plotted by Eleanor (using her only son as the weapon) and her anti-American group of fascists. Johnny can never remember the number of \"communists\" in any political group that disagrees with Eleanor. While pouring ketchup on his burger, Eleanor settles on the number 57. This was all meant as a statement against McCarthyism, but what has changed, really? In 2021, we have a new McCarthy who, along with the usual suspects in one political party, declare anyone who disagrees with or challenges them \"communists,\" \"socialists,\" or \"Marxists\" (the terms they use vary based on the day of the week). So the film is more timely than ever. Provocative, powerful, and captivating, and beautifully acted by all. Frank Sinatra gives arguably his best performance. A must-watch.",

            "content": "\"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.\"This quote, the most memorable quote in 1962's The Manchurian Candidate, is a quote used to describe the brainwashed Raymond Shaw. This satire/drama is a politically charged movie that you will never forget. Nearly sixty years after the film's release and more than twenty years since the end of the Cold War, this film remains as shocking and prevalent as ever. Perhaps that is a reason why the film was remade in 2004. That said, the film takes no side. Conservative, liberal, independent-the film goes after these parties. I certainly liked the depiction of McCarthyism here. The film does the job showing how the political spectrum works and how the mass and individuals could be brainwashed by this system.The film is based off a Richard Condon novel which has a heavy bite to his words. Condon admitted that he was surprised when writer George Axelrod transferred the biting satirical tone from the novel. The film was also directed by John Frankenheimer, a notable television director. He gave the movie a distinct visual style with the use of odd angles and black-and-white photography. There is shot towards the end which is very famous. The shot itself is out of focus but was kept in because star Frank Sinatra's subsequent takes were not as good. Instead, audiences and critics felt like they were viewing the scene from Sinatra's distorted view which received heaps of praise.Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the men in his Korean platoon. After arriving back in the United States, he tries to stay clear of his commanding mother, Eleanor Shaw (Angela Lansbury) and her second husband, Senator John Iselin (James Gregory). His commanding officer, Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has these weird, recurring nightmares which leads him to believe that the events which transpired Shaw for winning the medal are circumspect. His superiors fail to believe him and in fact, dismissed him. Eventually, another platoon member has very similar nightmares which leads Marco's superiors to believe something is up. Could, perhaps, Eleanor Shaw be behind all the political madness?I never really considered Frank Sinatra as an actor, although he has been in quite a handful of films. That said, he gave a very convincing performance as the man slowing beginning to lose his mind. I also liked Laurence Harvey's performance. His character was cold and selfish, and Harvey captured that demeanor. The film's winning performance, however, is that of Angela Lansbury. Her villainous performance is one of the greatest in all of film history-yes, it's really that good. Her scheming political ways are very reminiscent of modern politics. That infamous kiss scene shows/tells it all. Janet Leigh also has a role of Eugenie, Bennett's romantic interest. Her character is very mysterious, and I loved the conversation the two had when they first met, about her leaving her fianc\u00e9e. I wish there was more to her character, but the performance was great.This film also received attention for coming out just before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Keep in mind the ending of the movie focuses on a presidential assassination. There was a long-standing rumor that Sinatra took the film out of distribution in 1964 and kept anyone from seeing it until 1988. He did deny that ever took place. Regardless, people wonder is this film was in any way at all associated with Kennedy's death. There are, of course, many conspiracy theories that were floated including the use of this movie.The Manchurian Candidate did receive a remake in 2004, one that I still think is really good. However, the original film is a tense, politically charged film that is a must-see. Frankenheimer made very bold, risky choices that paid off big dividends in terms of quality. People in 1962 are not used to these sort of films, which I know increased the shock factor. The scene where we are introduced to the brainwashing soldiers for the first time still scares me. Just imagine after being hypnotized, you are given the order to casually shoot someone in the head, and then you cannot recall it. It's super scary, and one that the American government claimed communist nations such as The Soviet Union or China would do. In the end, the American government can be just as bad. Anyway, this is a great, tense film!My Grade: A-",

            "content": "John Frankenheimer absorbs us and exercises our minds by simultaneously showing multiple perspectives of the same dream and the real-life effects of it. It is a mystery where the process of deduction comes not initially from physical proof but from decoding and analyzing a dream. This dream is at the heart of the movie, a redefining political thriller responding in a moody and sensory way to the Cold War paranoia of its time. Its problem is that it also responds with pat plot tunes such as the needless romantic interest in the form of a rather wasted Janet Leigh.At the film's roots is a premise suggesting the brainwashing effects of political ideology: The soldiers have Pavlovian responses for opinions and they struggle against the dissonance they sense that they have with them. Indeed, the pivotal character is an assassin, an unwitting assassin, who blindly executes his deed at the sight of a playing card, an inanimate face to whom he endows all command of his conscious mind. The focus of the story is not political conflict but the deepest cognitive turmoil of those involved in political conflict. That is what is scary about politics, that it controls our points of view and our feelings. And if the only truth we can sense in our buried feelings, what proof do we have that anything is wrong? There is a bombastic right-wing political figure much in the tradition of Joe McCarthy, and yet is he the driving force behind all of his actions? No; it is his wife. His wife looks like any other affluent American family woman of the 1950s and '60s, but there is something about her, an effect she has on those closest to her, her husband and her son, where whether they like it or not, they find themselves doing her bidding. And even still, their relationship goes so much deeper than that.Sinatra was an extraordinary actor. When he, Major Marco, is having the same reoccurring nightmare, we don't just see a sleeping man jerking around and scrunching his eyebrows saying, \"N-no, no\u0085\" He gives us a candid-feeling rendering of a guy dozing off, eyes open, shut, open, and the words he says in his sleep have less to do with the dream but how his subconscious would feel about it.There is such gravitas in this deeply paranoid story that to have any characters extraneous as that of Janet Leigh's, and to have her played by a name actress, a very talented one, is to diffuse the resonance of the subtext. When the dejected Captain Marco, played so persuasively by Frank Sinatra, happens upon her on a train, she approaches him in spite of all his apparent reluctance to be social, and trades contact information. It could be read as an exchange of signals of some sort, that there is something about her identity buried beneath the unassuming surface of a charmed-at-first-sight encounter. Is she working for the Communists? Considering the nature of the story's diabolical Communist plot, there is truly nowhere to run or hide from their operatives and their influence. Alas, however, this is never followed through, and she is reduced to not only a romantic foil for the leading man but a piece of scenery.Nevertheless, The Manchurian Candidate is a haunting and unique film. There are moments in the earlier half of the film that feel like black comedy, mostly owing to the nature of such passive men, who've been hypnotized into believing they are at a tea party, committing ruthlessly violent acts by the orders of who they see as caricatured old ladies, as if to have just been told to fetch more napkins. And yet this dark humor germinates into horrific tragedy. As a matter of fact, the film ends on one of the saddest notes of any film of its kind. Just as it pointedly unites right-wing politicians with their perceived left-wing enemies, the movie unites tone in a way only Frankenheimer seemed to be doing at the time. The film broods, chuckles and creates an equal parallel third of tension, as in what was the first karate fight in an American film, or the climactic scene which, at the same time it seems baffling, it also feels inevitable.",

            "content": "I've always considered The Manchurian Candidate to be the film to have set the bar for political thrillers, one of my favorite genres, and as far as I'm concerned that bar has never been met since. The script from George Axelrod, working off the novel by Richard Condon, is a labyrinth of conspiracy and intrigue, making the motivations of each character unclear and putting the truth of every moment constantly in question. You can never be sure if what you are watching is a fact or a deception, thoroughly absorbing you into a dizzied state. Frankenheimer has created a rare film that is able to keep it's atmosphere going through every scene. From the first deeply unsettling dream/memory that we experience, everything becomes immersed in this eerie tone, that haunting world somewhere between fantasy and reality.Condon's characters come alive on the screen, as portrayed by an ensemble of compelling actors at the top of their game. Raymond Shaw is one of the most tragic characters ever put to film, and Laurence Harvey's portrayal of him is an all-time favorite. Harvey creates a deeply sympathetic figure out of a spoiled boy, torn by his desires and his duties, torn apart on all sides by people who want to use him for their own gain. Every moment with him is a rich character study, as Harvey portrays the deep anguish and unrequited desires of this broken man. The Oedipal subtext between him and one of the most terrifying screen mother's, played with sinister skill by Angela Lansbury, adds yet another layer to this remarkably realized performance.The story is rich with political commentary on McCarthyism, but it's social relevance still manages to resonate today. Frankenheimer's direction is some of the best ever put on screen, fully in control of his entire picture, staging everything exactly how it needs to be. Scenes that appear insignificant early on are given great importance, there isn't a moment that is wasted whether we are building characters or setting the stage for the ultimate showdown. Using innovative angles and shooting techniques, Frankenheimer heightens the tension beyond what was already on the page, creating a thriller that makes it's audience think while also keeping them on the edge of their seat.",

            "content": "I've watched 'The Manchurian Candidate' several times over the years and it never ceases to impress me. I just bought it on DVD, recently released here in Region 4 (no Frankenheimer commentary though - shame on you!), so of course I watched it again. For me it gets better and better with each viewing and more and more pertinent. Now I know some people glibly dismiss it because of the dated Cold War theme, but they miss the fundamental point that it doesn't matter whether it's the extreme Left or the extreme Right we're dealing with, the methods displayed in this movie are still timely, especially the use of the media to emotionally manipulate the public. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is still the best political thriller ever made in my opinion, but it's more than just that. It's a very complex movie yet incredibly easy to watch. Everything about it is very cool - the direction, editing, dialogue. And the cast are all first rate. Laurence Harvey is the perfect choice for Raymond Shaw, cold, unlikeable but still somehow sympathetic. I'm no fan of Sinatra as a singer, but he's an underrated actor. This is his best performance along with 'The Man With The Golden Arm'. Angela Lansbury is chilling and very believable as Shaw's ruthlessly ambitious mother. Janet Leigh's role is a bit slight, but I always enjoy watching her. 'Touch Of Evil', 'Psycho' and this, what a run of brilliant movies she had! I also got a kick out of seeing cult favourites Henry Silva ('Thirst', 'Chained Heat') playing a Korean(!), and the late Whit Bissell ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', 'Soylent Green') in supporting roles. I would really love to hear Frankenheimer's commentary on this, as it really is a fascinating movie. Frankenheimer had a long and uneven career, but in 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'Seconds' he gave us two of the most extraordinary movies to ever come out of Hollywood. Both are masterpieces in my opinion, and neither gets the attention they deserve.",

            "review_title": "A Modern Thriller still",
            "content": "It's still kind of shocking to me how well made this is almost sixty years after its release. John Frankenheimer really found ways to push his camera into odd angles film scenes in disconcerting ways to increase tension and anxiety all while translating a story that's compelling and populating it with great characters. It's rightfully held up as one of the great American political thrillers.One of the things I find most interesting about how the story is built is how we know within fifteen minutes that the kidnapped Shaw and Marco were brainwashed by Chinese communists in North Korea, that Shaw is a weapon trained to kill no later than the thirty minute mark, and that Shaw's American handler is his own mother by the hour point. The movie only holds back the specifics of the plan Shaw is in the middle of until the end, revealing it to us when it gets revealed to Raymond Shaw himself. It's really the only bit of information that gets held back on the audience. Everything else up to that point has been on full view for the audience. That lack of deception on the part of the filmmakers demonstrates a shockingly strong trust in the audience to stay with the story even as the movie lays its cards out on the table (heh).Anyway, the stepson of a US Senator, Joe McCarthy John Iselin, and his entire troop gets captured in North Korea and brainwashed. Raymond Shaw himself becomes the weapon, but the rest, most prominently Ben Marco, his commanding officer, get brainwashed to heap nothing but praise on their unlovable corporal while reciting, word for word, the events of a fictional event that lead to Shaw's receiving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Going back home, life tries to return to normal, but everyone realizes something is wrong.The story is mostly told from the perspective of Marco, now a major in the intelligence wing of the Army, and how he follows his sleepless nights wracked with nightmares of a gardening party where Shaw strangled one of the two men lost in the enemy action to death. But the dream is fractured with images of Chinese and Russian officials. Another member of the same squad is having similar dreams, and the way all of this is filmed is just fantastic. Keeping all of players in the same place but changing both sets and even actors, there's a shockingly clear line of sight into who is talking to whom and where everyone is, even as everything changes around them. It's a really complex scene to put together, and it feels so completely effortless at the same time.Marco can't shake the feeling that what he says about Shaw, that he's the kindest, bravest, warmest human being he's ever known in his life, is all a lie and that the action he describes where Shaw was just so brave isn't right somehow. Things go further after Shaw gets checked on by his Russian handlers before his handoff and he kills, under orders, the nice newspaper man who had given him a job after he resigned from the military. In an effort to get closer to Shaw, Marco shows up to New York to try and bond with the man he thinks is so warm but knows is impossible to like, and it's here that we see the only place that Shaw was loveable, and that was with the daughter of the senator most opposed to Iselin, Senator Jordan.It feels like everything Shaw does is an action to the desires of his mother. He wants to undermine her and her precious Johnny by refusing the goodwill tour from his return from North Korea and taking the job with the \"communist\" newspaper man, and by asking the daughter of Senator Jordan to marry him. It seems like just a happy coincidence that Shaw actually loves the girl, and with every action comes an equal and opposite reaction. Shaw's mother does not take any of this well as the actions function as implements against her will to power, and she uses her status as Shaw's American handler to fix her problems with Jordan, who will work to prevent Johnny's ascension to the vice presidential nomination at the convention (meaning Jordan and Iselin are in the same party, which I never really realized before). Something must be done.At the same time, Marco gets closer and closer to the truth as he watches Shaw get accidentally activated when he throws himself into the frozen lake in Central Park. It really should be noted that Frank Sinatra is really great as Marco. The way he conveys Marco's tenuous hold on his own sanity with wild eyes and a broken voice as he pieces together his own nightmares with the reality of what conspiracy has entered the highest levels of government is great. And the scene where he tears out the wiring of Shaw's programming is amazingly tense for what is essentially a back and forth conversation between two men in a room. Really, the final thirty minutes of the film is a remarkable building of tension that builds and builds until the resolution.Lawrence Harvey plays Shaw really well, making him an unlikeable bastard and managing to turn it around when he's in Senator Jordan's daughter's presence, but it's Angela Lansbury who makes that relationship work best. Her conniving, amoral mother is the manifestation of the worst of Norman Bates' mother from Psycho, pushing her son into murder to protect herself and her own power. James Gregory plays Iselin as a complete buffoon in the only performance in the movie I don't like. He's a caricature of Joe McCarthy and little else, and I find him grating. Janet Leigh as Eugenie, as has been noted many times before, never really feels like she fits into the movie based on how she's introduced (randomly falling in love with Marco on a train to the point of ending an engagement for him), but she does provide a rock for him to work from in the second half of the film.It's not a perfect movie, but it is a great movie made great by fantastic performances, great editing, and an incredible final act that pulls everything together and makes the audience squirm. As a final tangential note, the final convention sequence reminded me a lot of Hitchcock's two Albert Hall sequences in the two version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. They're so similar with the main character scanning the upper areas of an indoor open area for a shooter, unable to move because of music, that it feels like homage. I don't mind, it works on its own and this is the first time I've noticed the connection coming right off of the whole Hitchcock filmography.Anyway, it's really stood the test of time, feeling decidedly modern thanks to a fairly cynical air and inventive camerawork that feels at home in the 21st century as it did in the more experimental corners of 1960s cinema. It's a great thriller.",

Brilliant and harrowing; very much a product of its time, with its brainwashing theme, it holds up well for successive generations. The film was nationally released on Wednesday, October 24, 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

            "content": "For those who only know Angela Lansbury from her Disney connection and her twelve years as TV's Jessica Fletcher, her bold, brilliant turn as the Machiavellian Mrs. Iselin, a role alarmingly slated for Lucille Ball, will startle you. It's a powerhouse performance in a velvet glove, and she is but one of the fascinating characters in John Frankenheimer's prescient, off-balance 1962 masterwork. Obviously a scathing indictment of McCarthyism which has reached mythic proportions, this taut political thriller initially revolves around a platoon brainwashed by Soviet and Chinese officials after their capture in Korea. The plot then settles on two of the soldiers \u0096 one is Raymond Shaw, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, whose mother craves power for her Joe McCarthy-like senator husband; the other is Captain Bennett Marco who is haunted by jarring nightmares about the interrogations and a nagging feeling about Shaw. Their story lines eventually merge but not before several unpredictable turns that leads to a breathtaking last half-hour.The writing by veteran scribe George Axelrod (based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel) is shrewd without ever tipping the story's surprising denouement. Of all people, Frank Sinatra plays Marco with often dynamic conviction, though I think he plays the role a bit more heroically and less ambiguously than he should have. Laurence Harvey, on the other hand, plays Shaw, the film's most difficult role, effectively teetering on the cusp of insanity throughout. But hands down, the movie belongs to Lansbury. Whether belittling her buffoonish husband or icily explaining her motivation for attaining power to her son, she refuses to chew scenery and lets the sharp dialogue spew right out of her pouty mouth.Smaller roles are filled interestingly though not entirely successfully. Janet Leigh has a smallish part as Marco's love interest, the best part of which is her seductive pick-up scene on the train. As Iselin, James Gregory captures the bluster and innate naivet\u00e9 of a character about to be devoured by his far sharper wife. The stunning Leslie Parrish, an actress who never fulfilled her initial promise, plays Shaw's beloved Josey with a Monroe-like combination of innocence and sensuality. I just wish there was more complexity to Leigh's and Parrish's characters. There are a couple of casting errors \u0096 comic character actor John McGiver overdoing it as Iselin's liberal nemesis, Senator Jordan, and Henry Silva, made up as a Korean, as Shaw's manservant Chunjin, who has a wild kung fu fight with Sinatra.Frankenheimer paces the film beautifully and Lionel Lindon's cinematography tightens the close-ups of the characters as the action escalates. The 2004 Special Edition DVD has several extras though none all that outstanding. Frankenheimer's commentary is unfortunately sparse but interesting when he does speak. There is an eight-minute three-way conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer and Axelrod filmed in 1988 \u0096 too short but interesting, especially for the insight provided on why the film was pulled from circulation after JFK's assassination a year after it was released. Two rather perfunctory featurettes are included \u0096 one focused on Lansbury with the actress participating, and the other on Frankenheimer but only with commentary from director William Friedkin. Regardless, the film is a must-see for anyone.",

Its hard to discuss this without revealing major plot points, so stop here if you don't want to know..Laurence Harvey. Frank Sinatra.  Two vastly different acting styles have some amazing moments together, not the least of which is when Bennett Marco (Sinatra) breaks the 'links' that have been brainwashed ('installed' is more like it)into Raymond Shaw's (Harvey) head.  This is done so that he will become the killer his jewel of a mother (more on her later) ordered. Laurence Harvey is usually a heel in everything else - reference \"Butterfield 8\" and \"Darling\" and here he is, by his own definition, 'unlovable.'  But he does find true love and actually smiles on screen!  To top that, he cracks a joke!  But this makes his downfall all the more poignant, as Mother is still in charge.  So she uses him to kill his wife and father-in-law (John McGiver) who is a direct threat to Mother's pawn/husband, John Iselin, getting a Vice Presidential nomination.\nAngela Lansbury is amazing as Raymond's mother.  She got an Oscar nomination and if Patty Duke would not have been more amazing in \"The Miracle Worker\", Lansbury would've captured the gold.  She is unforgettable and shows more sides than a monster normally does.  When she tells Raymond she did not know he would be the killer she needed, you believe her.  But she's a woman on a mission, so if it has to be her son that contributes to her crusade, so be it.  I disagree with the reviews below that suggest Janet Leigh's role is tacked-on or unimportant.  True, her character does not contribute to the plot at all, but Leigh's confidence in her role and her sense of humor is appreciated in a relentlessly cold and dark movie like this.  When she says upon meeting Marco on a train, 'I was one of the original Chinese workers who laid this track', she's apparently more than 'the girl.' She and Sinatra have some great chemistry in their three/four scenes together. \nGreat & memorable scenes abound.  Great acting and story and delivery.  This one has it all, and is a timeless classic.",

This movie should follow much more Frank Sinatra. He's the more compelling character anyways. This should be solely his movie.

Regardless, when I rented and watched the film, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed either.The plot revolves around the strange case of Raymond Shaw, a sergeant who wins the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the cold war. Two of the men in his company, however, have strange nightmares that suggest Raymond is not as deserving of the award as he seems. One of these men, Major Bennet Marco, led on by these recurring nightmares, unravels a sinister Communist plot. Set against the cold war paranoia of the sixties and McCarthyism, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" does an excellent job of recreating the intense suspense and tension of the time.The acting in this film is superb. A great script is heightened by excellent acting in this movie. It's hard not to like Frank Sinatra in his role as Marco, who is the protagonist. Laurence Harvey as Raymond does a good job showing us a character that is wholly unlikable and snobby, yet pathetic and sad at the same time. And of course, Angela Lansbury in her role as Raymond's malicious and plotting mother is excellent.Some stand-out scenes in the film were the nightmare sequences that brilliantly interlaced dream and reality, the all-queen solitaire game with Marco and Raymond, and the supremely tense climax at the political convention. The cinematography in the movie was very well done as action, romance, and tension all mixed together smoothly. All the scenes managed to keep my attention and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. As a thriller, the film works remarkably well, and it is quite easily the best political thriller I've seen to date.Keeping me from giving the movie a perfect ten are one or two little nagging problems. I wasn't a big fan of the music for the movie, and it even disrupted the mood for me at one point in the film. It was okay, just not great. Also, the whole plot is sort of unlikely. I wont go into it here, but I don't think that the Communist plan for world domination would fall into the hands of one relatively uncontrolled person, no matter how well trained his mind was. That's just my opinion, however.The movie is sort of long, and isn't exactly action packed, but it is very interesting, insightful, and even chilling. I had a great time watching it, and I definitely recommend it if you are interested at all in seeing a gripping Cold War era political thriller. Besides, the cultural relevance of the film alone is enough to see it.9/10",

Most stars these days seem content to walk through their roles, unless they're throwing themselves off buildings, through fires, amid a blaze of special effects.

Not because of spoilers; the plot is such a labyrinth that I could lay it all out and it would not spoil a thing. It's hard to describe because it has to be experienced.Frank Sinatra, in one of his best performances, stars as Major Bennett Marco, a member of a platoon that was taken prisoner during the Korean conflict and subjected to some really scary brainwashing techniques. At the outset, Marco and some of his former buddies are having terrible nightmares about their experiences, and Marco is eventually affected by it enough that his commanding officer orders him to take sick leave. He decides to visit his former sergeant, an unlikeable man named Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who is not suffering from nightmares but who reacts strangely when confronted by a deck of cards.One of the films strangest scenes takes place on the train to New York, where Shaw lives. Marco, so upset that his shaking fingers cannot light his cigarette, leaves the club car and stands in the vestibule. He is followed by a woman who was observing him. Her name is Eugenie Rose Chaney, played by Janet Leigh in one of her best performances. I will not reveal the dialogue that passes between them; suffice it to say that it is so strange as to be utterly incomprehensible, but these two end up falling in love.The other two major players in the piece are Raymond's stepfather, Johnny Iselin (James Gregory), a thinly-veiled Joseph McCarthy, and his overbearing wife Eleanor, played by Angela Lansbury. At first, Mrs Iselin simply seems to be an annoyance; she drags her husband around by the nose, irritates her son at every turn, and in general is a pain in the ass. It is not until much later that Lansbury shows her cards, as it were, and we are treated to the portrait of one of the most evil mothers ever put on the screen. Lansbury is brilliant; one of the most versatile performers of her day, she would only a couple of years later go from this dark character to being the toast of Broadway as the life- loving socialite Mame Dennis in the musical MAME. She was nominated for an Oscar for this role, but lost to Patty Duke for THE MIRACLE WORKER. A tough call; I think Duke's performance is equally amazing.I am not sure anyone born after the Berlin Wall came down will quite get the level of paranoid hysteria that drives the core of this film. I don't know what Jonathan Demme did with this story in his unnecessary remake, and I never shall, because I have no desire to see it. But if for nothing else than Lansbury's performance, this one demands to be seen. And like the best of Hitchcock's work, this one rewards multiple viewings. A true American classic.",

That's only a starting point of a very dark, disturbing but spellbinding motion picture. Harvey is very good as a brainwashed killer and even Sinatra (who I never liked) is pretty good. But Angela Lansbury is beyond belief. She is letter perfect as a cold, calculating, cruel woman. If you've just seen her in the \"Murder She Wrote\" TV series, you're in for a big surprise. She was nominated for an Oscar for this film--too bad she didn't win. Great direction--again and again I was astounded by the shots Frankenheimer pulled off. Only one minor complaint--what was Janet Leigh doing in the movie? Nothing against her, but there's no reason for her to be here. Other than that, the film is flawless.

            "content": "I got the same feeling watching \"The Manchurian Candidate\" as I did as a fourth grader going through those 'duck and cover' air raid drills in the mid 1950's, the threat of those Communist Russkies ever impinging on a precocious young mind. The film is claustrophobic and sinister, a holdover from the McCarthy era where a Commie was to be found behind every bush, and maybe worse, holding high political office.Not having seen the movie before, I didn't know what to expect. I found the early scenes demonstrating the effectiveness of the Chinese brainwashing techniques on the captured American patrol to be uniquely original. Obviously disorienting from the start with the discourse on hydrangeas, the periodic shifts between the contrived and real audience was very well done; the touch with the all black floral society was a master stroke.Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are terrific in their roles, but the real scene stealer is Angela Lansbury as Shaw's manipulative mother. Lansbury is so good in fact, that you begin to question how she would have fallen in with a sop like Big John Iselin (James Gregory), who wouldn't even dare to address the whole 'just how many communists are there' question for himself. There's a quite revealing insight into her controlling nature when early in the story she addresses John and son Robert as her 'two little boys'.What's probably too bad though, but as the film progresses, more and more elements begin to surface that tend to exaggerate the entire premise of the story. I was intrigued by the issue of Shaw having all guilt and fear removed from his psyche as he was built into a perfect assassin. However his selection as that assassin was never properly explored, only to be further convoluted by that overwrought and borderline incestuous kiss by momma. His soon to be bride showing up in that queen of diamonds costume also contributed to odds defying circumstances, causing this viewer a 'what the ?' reaction.I got a couple of inadvertent chuckles from the story, the first when Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh) checked in on Shaw (Laurence Harvey) at the converted alcohol treatment center now operated by the Russians. With glee, he chastises the Russian Zilkov (Albert Paulsen) for the facility making a profit; the Russian didn't find it amusing. The other was the martial match up between Major Marco (Sinatra) and Chunjin (Henry Silva); they really should have taken a few lessons. Sinatra's stance at one point was almost comical.As a political thriller, one would do well to concentrate on the first half of the film, up to about the point when Janet Leigh makes her appearance as the Major's romantic interest. That basically comes out of nowhere, and seemed at the outset to play like it might have been a part of the whole subversive mind game plot. It comes to naught however, left dangling like an unresolved story element. The trail to the political convention, especially following the assassination of Shaw's wife and father, is fraught with major demands for suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer, the major one being, how did Shaw manage to elude the authorities for his crimes while under hypnotic control? By the time he sights in his rifle, one has a pretty good idea how it will all end, and with just the right symbolism. The Manchurian conspiracy falls as if constructed of a stack of cards. I'll never be able to look at a queen of Lansbury in the same way again.",

            "content": "Based on Richard Condon's 1959 book of the same name, John Frankenheimer's adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate is considered to be one of America's greatest political thrillers. Now, normally, politics, and being thrilled are two very different concepts, but Condon's book, written a few short years after Senator Joseph McCarthy's accusations of Communist infiltration of the Federal Government helped fan anti-Communist suspicions and paranoia in the US, hit a nerve. To make the story thrilling, Condon and film director Frankenheimer created a narrative that was part murder mystery, part science fiction, and all political allegory. TMC is something of a historical fiction, and a bizarre and surreal mystery. You'll find yourself wondering \"what the heck is going on,\" but you won't be able to give up on it. You'll want to know why Marco keeps having his dreams of the Ladies' Garden Club, why Raymond hates Johnny so much, and what the deal is with \"passing the time playing a little solitaire.\"When the movie was released in 1962, eagerly awaited by the readers of Condon's novel, including President John F. Kennedy, viewers were stunned by what was then considered brutal violence, and they were shocked by that kiss, the nauseating implications of that kiss. The Manchurian Candidate has its flaws, but they are nitpicky at best. The black psychiatrist seems out of place for the mid-1950s and the lax security at the convention come to mind, but the audience may only pick up on those upon repeated viewings. The best part of TMC is its implied message of not letting vigilance morph into paranoia. News flash: Joe McCarthy was an evil man, but even an evil man can be right once in awhile. McCarthy's tactics were so anti-American that the actual need for vigilance against Communist infiltration of government, education, and popular culture was badly damaged. Without realizing it, McCarthy's repulsive antics actually helped the Communist effort to destabilize the United States. Ol' Joe was right--there were Communists burrowing into the fabric of American governance--but using \"McCarthyism\" to reveal the infiltration was counter- productive.By now, the average viewer of a \"political thriller\" might be looking for the remote to find an old NCIS on the tube, but Frankenheimer keeps ratcheting up the pressure on the audience. He keeps putting clues, like doggie treats, in our food bowl. And we can't turn away. The performances are almost flawless. Frank Sinatra is a totally sympathetic Bennett Marco, Lawrence Harvey is superb as the emotionally whipsawed Raymond Shaw, Angela Lansbury oozes a distilled and aged evil, and Khigh Dhiegh--who would go on to be the evil Chinese agent, \"Wo Fat\" in Hawaii Five-0-- is a delightfully dangerous Dr. Yen Lo, who cooks up the plan to turn Raymond into the perfect killer, the one who \"isn't burdened by guilt or fear.\"The only fly in the ointment is Janet Leigh, whose character's intentions are a mystery, but who, as an actress, doesn't seem believable, or for that matter, terribly interesting. Leigh's \"Rosie\" is an important part of the story, but she phones in her performance.And if that's all I have for complaints, then I should thank my lucky stars, shut up, and . . . Play a little solitaire.",

            "content": "During the Korean War a squad of American soldiers are captured by communist forces but strangely after the war none of them have any memory of this; they all believe that they fought their way through enemy lines thanks to the skill and bravery of Sergeant Raymond Shaw. Shaw is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his actions but one man has concerns about him. His former CO, Major Bennett Marco, suffers from recurring nightmares where he sees to troops undergoing a brain washing procedure and Shaw killing one of his comrades. Marco believes that it is more than a dream and wants to investigate. It won't be easy though; Shaw is regarded as a hero and his step-father is a senator on an anti-communist crusade. Even Shaw doesn't realise what has happened to him but given the right trigger\u0085 the sight of the queen of diamonds he will follow the instructions he is given\u0085 whether that is to kill his boss or jump in a lake! Will Marco be able to prove his theories and stop Shaw and those controlling him before their ultimate plan can be carried out. Away from the central plot there is some romance; with both Marco and Shaw getting involved with attractive blondes.This is a solid thriller with plenty of tension, some shocking moments and a touch of tragedy. The idea of a hero who is actually an enemy agent (even if he doesn't realise it in this case) will be familiar to anybody who watched 'Homeland' but this was made half a century earlier. It nicely captures the cold war paranoia about communists\u0085 sometimes playing on it by showing the senator who gives a different 'exact number' of communists in the Defence Department; something that makes him look a bit of a buffoon but does serve to keep people asking 'How many communists have infiltrated?'. The cast does a solid job with fine performances from Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey, as Marco and Shaw, although I'm surprised no explanation was added to explain Shaw's English accent\u0085 perhaps it was just how it was done then; much like having western actors playing East Asian characters; something I can't image a modern film doing. Of the secondary characters it is Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin, Shaw's mother, which stands out most thanks to Angela Lansbury's brilliant performance as this unlikable character. The central story is gripping and leads to a great ending but the romantic subplot involving Marco seems a bit tacked on; it is particularly superfluous as Shaw's romance is more interesting and becomes important to the main plot. While there isn't a huge amount of action there are some genuine shocks; I certainly didn't expect a blood splash on the wall after Shaw shoots somebody in the head given that most films of the era didn't show such things. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a good paranoid thriller.",

            "content": "Soldiers are brainwashed, and one is programmed as a killing machine in \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" a 1962 film starring Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, Frank Sinatra, James Gregory, and Janet Leigh.This amazing movie was withdrawn from theaters because of the Kennedy assassination, and it was finally put back into circulation. It is a true masterpiece that turned out to be sadly prophetic. Laurence Harvey is a soldier who wins a medal of bravery for saving the lives of his platoon in Korea, all but two members - except it's all a great big lie. In truth, the entire platoon was flown to Manchuria, and a new way of brainwashing is used on them. Harvey is chosen to become a killer, and he gives a demonstration of his cold-blooded abilities by killing two members of his platoon. When the soldiers return to civilian life, two of them are plagued by terrible dreams of the incident, one being Frank Sinatra, and the army investigates. Deciding that brainwashing by the Russians was involved, the problem becomes how to deprogram Harvey...and what is his assignment.The film is not without its flaws, and it's a tribute to it that it still manages to remain a masterpiece. Laurence Harvey's accent wavers from American to British, finally settling on British. The identity of the character played by Janet Leigh, a young woman who meets Sinatra on a train, is never explained - was this perhaps cut from the film? Critic Molly Haskell felt that two of Harvey's killings were \"too much to recover from\" - they did seem unnecessary.The acting is superb, with the two greatest performances given by Angela Lansbury as Harvey's mother and James Gregory as her Joseph McCarthy-like senator husband, who sees Communists everywhere. Lansbury, a mere one year older than Harvey, is perfect as a mother right out of hell, and the incestuous scene toward the end is chilling. From this to Jessica Fletcher - thank God Broadway knew what to do with this master talent. As her puppet husband, Gregory gives an excellent performance as a boisterous fool. Sinatra is very natural in his role, and though Janet Leigh isn't around much, she's very good. Harvey, always a fine actor, is remarkable as a cold, unlikable, angry man who changes when he finds love, only to find that he is a servant to horrendous programming - and came from the body of the devil incarnate.A great achievement by director John Frankenheimer, and a no miss.",

Such a scenario was established irregardless of the fact that our nation's peoples could find a legitimate enemy or not!! Lawrence Harvey is magnificent in this role, as he exudes a helplessness that exaggerates the intensity of tumultuousness which every one around him has become burdened by!! Angela Lansbury plays Raymond's mother, she has all the free flowing compassion of a refrigeration plant... Her personality is less pleasant than a largess of lagoon algae!! This is an instance where manipulation becomes intrepidly criminal!! Being hypnotically mesmerized ultimately backfires in this movie!!! Major Bennett Marco, (Frank Sinatra's character), must endure the unfortunate task of being the hapless recipient to witnessing an onslaught of heinous ordeals in Raymond's tormented life!! Back in 1962, when this film came out, it brought on a myriad of emotional complexities which had not been delved into until this movie brought them out!! Angela Lansbury's character was one which far exceeded the label of right wing Conservative!! She manifested a personality which was overtly lethal, and, her temperament contained an unmitigated temerity for the slightest concept which advocated even a modicum of non-conventionalism!! I was warned about people like she was!! The vitriolic rancor with the major characters in this movie was predicated on the paucity of trust each and every one of them had for the existing circumstances!! Nothing was simple anymore, war and hypnosis were an ephemeral obsession with Raymond, these tales of agitation resulted in the fact that he no longer possessed the ability to think rationally!! New York City has always been a playground for the counter-culture elements of our society to breed and proliferate!! At one time, rumors were going around about how there were more KGB agents in Manhattan, than there were in Moscow!! Such a venue, like New York, induced an undaunted ambiguity with relation to the motives of any individual embracing one political philosophy or another!! At some point, however, what constitutes a warranted concern, as opposed to what is an invalid concern, should have been dichotomized accordingly!!! The film \"Manchurian Candidate\" is indeed one of the finest films ever made!! The candid responses that this movie makes provision for, bring on the potential to utterly sensitize the movie audience with regard to the film's formidable aspects of ideological extremism!! This website ranks \"Manchurian Candidate\" the 95th best picture out of the top 250 films in the cinema!! AFI (American Film Institute) ranks this film 65th best film out of the top 100 American films ever made!! The introverted belligerence was superbly depicted with this movie, and the political rumination for the film's justifiable ending sparked a seriously pontificating insight for the rationale of cold war phobia!! Ultimately, man's primate instincts, for which he gets severely stigmatized by, sadly resonated with almost every one of the major characters in this film!! \"Manchurian Candidate\" was a harbinger of things to come in the political arena, as it illustrates how people who sought political office demonstrated a repugnant display of greed!! I definitely feel that this movie, \"Manchurian Candidate\" is head and shoulders above most films, particularly in terms of this movie's astute correlation to the complicated storyline in which it presented!! \"Manchurian Candidate\" deliberately articulates a disconcerting premise to the gist of their plot with a very painstaking brilliance!! Based on the novel by Richard Condon, this movie explodes with top notch Hollywood talent!! John Frankenheimer directs \"Manchurian Candidate\" ( He is well known for a numerous list of \"Playhouse 90\" productions), Frankenheimer does a marvelous job with this movie!! The acting for \"Manchurian Candidate\" is sensational!! Frank Sinatra was a box office big wig at the time, and Angela Lansbury plays a character who is absolutely despicable!! Of course, this was the idea!! The '2004 remake of this movie is just mediocre, a little too stilted!! However, I give the original '1962 movie a PERFECT TEN!!! SEE IT FOR SURE!!!",

Now, every man down to the last, says Raymond is a hero who lead the group out of danger. Back in America, Raymond is given the Medal of Honor which pleases his ultra-ambitious mother Evelyn (Angela Lansbury) to no end. She is the energy behind her McCarthy like husband Senator John Iselin and she is looking to put him on the upcoming ticket as the Vice Presidential Candidate. Raymond himself detests his mother and stepfather and finds work as an aid to a liberal publisher. Meanwhile, Ben has continuing nightmares which sometimes show Raymond as a killer. He suspects the hero's story is a fraud. But, what really happened in Manchuria? What does the Queen of Diamonds have to do with anything? Is Evelyn even more manipulative than she appears now? Is the USA in grave danger? This film made long ago from a 1959 book by Richard Condon, is still riveting, intelligent fare of the highest degree.

Take heed, folks! Harvey, Sinatra and the supporting cast is great but one actress rises above all. Lansbury's Evelyn is one of the most evil, manipulative, repulsive women in the halls of moviedom. Sets, costumes, and a strong direction also contribute to the fabulous final product. Want to see a film which seems ripped from headlines of any decade in its depiction of spies, superspies, and regime changers? TMC is colossally smart and fearsome.",

            "content": "There is a reverence surrounding this film that is difficult for the casual viewer to comprehend. It might have been revolutionary for its time, but IMDb users who describe it as timeless seem to have undergone a brainwashing scheme themselves.The plot holes are large and plentiful and some of the acting is diabolical. The story, of a soldier transformed by hypnosis into a murderous automaton, is interesting enough in a B-movie kind of way, but the sheer volume of narrative leaps would test the patience of any modern viewer.Several key scenes are literally incredible. Frank Sinatra meets Janet Leigh on a train and five minutes later, without any warmth on Frank's side, she decides that she is going to leave her fianc\u00e9 for him.Leslie Parrish, playing the leading character's lover, chooses to wear a fancy dress costume that, by sheer coincidence, is the hypnotic trigger to send him into a trance. The likelihood of her wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume is so low that I assumed she must be in on the hypnotist's conspiracy, but it was just a bizarre red herring.Other irritations include the buffoonery of John Yerkes Iselin, the main character's stepfather, who wins the nomination for the vice presidency despite being a hopeless drunk. What was presumably intended as satire merely undermines the plot.And in the final scene, the security at the auditorium where the climactic assassination is due to take place is so lax that any old hit-man could have done it. The evil communists' scheme to groom someone who could get near the presidential candidate was unnecessary, if not counterproductive. If a presidential candidate were to be killed, would the public really support the vice-presidential co-runner if they knew his stepson was the assassin?As for the innovative fight scene, it is terribly unconvincing by today's standards and can't have been that good even in 1962. Henry Silva, Sinatra's kung fu adversary, is downright awful, but even his acting looks Oscar-worthy compared to James Edwards's wooden turn as a spooked GI.The good news, however, is that Jonathan Demme's remake is excellent. The 1962 version is an interesting historical document, but it doesn't work as a thriller.",

Watching it again does nothing to reduce one's enjoyment.

OK, Sinatra was not a great actor -- but if acting ability was the criteria for being in films, the profession would be a lot less crowded! The best thing about this film is the lack of hysteria, the total calm, almost matter of fact way it plays. Being in black & white also adds to the impact. To summarise: if you haven't seen either the '62 or '04 version, watch this one first -- & stop there! If you've already seen the latest one, rent this classic & see how good things could have been!",

            "content": "The central idea behind \"The Manchurian Candidate\" is that a former American serviceman has been brainwashed to assassinate a leading political figure. At first sight this plot might appear to have been inspired by the killing of President Kennedy, but in fact the film came out in 1962, a year before the assassination.The assassin is Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw, the stepson of a leading Senator and the winner of the Medal of Honor. Shaw won the medal during the Korean War, where he saved the lives of several members of his platoon in combat. Or so it is believed. In fact, the entire platoon was captured by Communist forces, taken to a secret Chinese base in Manchuria where they were brainwashed and false memories implant in their minds. The soldiers were then secretly returned to the American lines, unaware of their ordeal and believing Shaw was responsible for saving them.The film was made at the height of the Cold War- it was released at the time of the Cuban missile crisis- and its politics are firmly anti-Communist. Its political message, however, is put over by means of a clever twist. In the early scenes, it seems more like an \"anti-anti-Communist\" satire. It initially seems obvious that Shaw's stepfather, Senator John Iselin, is intended as a satirical portrait of Joseph McCarthy. Iselin appears to be a ranting buffoon, obsessed with a supposed Communist conspiracy to infiltrate the US Defense Department, although he can never remember exactly how many card-carrying Communists are supposed to work there. (He eventually settles on 57, taking that number from a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup). Iselin's political opponent, Senator Thomas Jordan, is portrayed as a decent liberal, concerned to defend civil liberties and the Constitution. Interestingly, Iselin and Jordan appear to be members of the same party, although it is never made clear whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Jordan's daughter Jocelyn also plays a role as Shaw's love-interest.The film, however, actually supports the basic McCarthyite assumption that the Communists are conspiring to infiltrate America's political establishment. The twist is that Iselin and his wife Eleanor are actually the leading lights in that conspiracy, of which the assassination plot is a key part, and his anti-Communist rhetoric is simply a front to hide his true affiliations. Even Jordan, who sees Iselin as a neo-fascist demagogue, does not realise the true situation.The real hero of the film is not Jordan but Major Bennett Marco, Shaw's former platoon commander in Korea. Marco was one of the brainwashed soldiers, and it was his recommendation which was responsible for Shaw winning the Medal of Honor. Following a series of nightmares, however, Marco, who now works for Army Intelligence, becomes suspicious of the whole affair, and begins his own investigations to uncover the truth.The film has a couple of flaws. The odd sub-plot involving Janet Leigh's character Eugenie seems not only unnecessary but also practically incomprehensible. Perhaps the producers felt they needed a big-name female star. (In 1962 Angela Lansbury was largely though of as a character actress). The character of Dr. Yen Lo, the Chinese head of the brainwashing programme, is uncomfortably close to the racist \"Fu Manchu\" stereotype of the fiendish Oriental villain.Those, however, would be my only criticisms. Overall, this was a film I greatly enjoyed. It features three excellent performances- from Frank Sinatra as the dogged Marco, Lansbury as the monstrous, domineering, power-crazed Eleanor who aims to dominate her son, her husband and ultimately the whole country, and Laurence Harvey as Shaw. As in many of her films, Lansbury plays a character considerably older than her real age. (She was only 37 in 1962, only three years older than Harvey who plays her son). Before I saw this film I normally thought of her as a niche actress specialising in elderly female detectives like Jessica Fletcher in the \"Murder She Wrote\" series or Miss Marple in \"The Mirror Crack'd\", but here she takes on a dramatic role of great power. (She was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress).Harvey was an actor who never really achieved the international stardom that was at one time predicted for him, but he did make at least two excellent films, this one and \"Room at the Top\" from four years earlier. His Shaw is a cold, unsociable character, uneasy with the public adulation he receives after his supposed act of heroism, and even more uneasy with his position as a member of one of America's leading political families. (He detests both his mother and his stepfather). Although Shaw is not in himself evil, it is all too easy to see Harvey's character as a mindless, brainwashed killer.Apart from the acting, what makes \"The Manchurian Candidate\" so watchable is its strange, creepy atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion. Although the film is anti-Communist, that does not necessarily mean that it is right-wing. (Its director John Frankenheimer had a reputation as something of a liberal). Its hero is the little man, working outside the system. (Marco's suspicions initially receive no support from his superiors at Army Intelligence). The message, perhaps, is not to trust anyone political, be they Communists or Washington insiders. 8/10",

            "content": "***spoilers are almost inevitable, but i'll do my best to keep them at a minimum*** While Liev Schrieber is one of my favorite actors (consider Ray Donovan, for example), the task of remaking The Manchurian Candidate, a novella from Richard Condon about the paranoia that held a vicious grip on the U.S. during the McCarthy UnAmerican Activities Committee probes, it is best left respected, in honor of the work of the original brave actors who risked their careers in a movie that was actually banned, in parts of the world, for almost 20 years, that no remake should be attempted.The Schrieber/Close remake can only be considered as a well acted reminiscence of the original, but, the fact remains, there is no substitute for the original and absolutely no need for a remake.If anyone doubts that Frank Sinatra was an excellent actor, then make this your first stop. Then, after this, check out any other movie with his name in the cast and ask yourself how it is that you never noticed that before. Ol' Blue Eyes wasn't just a jazz singer or a crooner. He was a performer.That's part of the problem with the remake. The tension that exists and is eventually exposed between the hypnotized victims of capture has a real effect on all of the participants in the investigation of their experience. In the remake, everything is invested in the sordid relationship between the candidate and his mother. In the original, the actual horror at the center of events is that the favored amongst the returned captives--well...watch the movie. To say any more about the plot would to give it all away.Trust me, the original is the best. Laurence Harvey was a very spooky private character to begin with, but a box-office popular personality at that time. Given his thespian success and that of both Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh, they must, all three have been shocked at the ban on the movie, that lasted for a decade (Harvey was already dead before the ban was lifted), which, again, speaks against attempting a remake, given that the ban is, itself, a distinct qualification that can not be carried out of one age of perception to another.I have a particular affection for the original version because the author of the story, Richard Condon, a U.S American living in Ireland, had the option as an Irish resident artist to take advantage of Ireland's income tax exemption for artists--an artist's bonus that Bono and the rest of U2 heartily used to their advantage--but Condon chose to declare his income to the U.S. Treasury, in order to keep his citizenship intact. It must have hurt him that the country to which he showed such respectful loyalty would give in to the same paranoia that he tried to expose and lay bare, so that it could be challenged and resisted.In fact, it is a shame that Condon's work is not on the required list of American author's, instead of boring Paul Auster, who, while he writes well, has never written anywhere near close to this, and whose stories all tend to drift away into nothingness, as if he is afraid to say something wrong.It takes a lot of time and strength to write even a half decent book, and it is not my intent to put Paul Auster down. I just wish that Richard Condon's work was on the same list as Auster. Gun control would, at least, be reconsidered, maybe even prior to the assassination of JFK, MLK, and RFK--but also Malcolm X. None of them should have died and just a little bit more security could have kept them all alive.We have been made to become cynical since then, and that is the problem with the remake. When Christopher Lee heard about the remake of The Wicker Man, he said, Why? A sequel might make sense, but why remake a success? Same thing with The Manchurian Candidate. If you haven't yet seen either, go with the original. It even has the author's blessing, and he paid his taxes promptly.",

I don't think that anymore, because there is really no way to say that this movie isn't good.  One unique thing about The Manchurian Candidate is that it really does feel modern.  The writing is also witty and insightful and superb.  The acting, particularly from  the supposed war hero, is outstanding.  Satire, suspense, greed for power, love, a little action, it's all here.  9--not 10--out of 10, mainly because we have seen the political assassination stuff so much by now--The Dead Zone, etc.",

            "content": "When his unit is tricked and trapped during the Korean War, Capt Bennett Marco and his men are rescued with the amazing heroics of the very well-liked and respected Sergeant Raymond Shaw. On his return to America Shaw becomes one of the few men to be awarded the Congressional Medal Of Honour for his actions. Years pass but yet Marco cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong \u0096 he remembers being in a hotel lobby during a lecture on flower arranging but in his dreams the old women become Chinese military men. When he finds that others have the same dreams he works with military intelligence to uncover their meaning. Meanwhile Shaw's mother uses him to help boost his stepfather's career in the Government, running on a hard line anti-communist ticket.Although the social and political setting is now one of history this film is still a very enjoyable film that serves as thriller, satire and paranoid conspiracy film. I will try and avoid comparisons but naturally the remake stands up better in front of a modern audience simply because it is able to use the more relevant 'big business' slant as well as presenting it as a much more consistent thriller than the original. However this film still stands up well but maybe is not as tense as it could have been because it does take a more balanced approach to the story by building around it as well. This may sound like a criticism but it is only a bad thing in regards a pure thriller, as a matter of fact it makes it a more rounded film. As a satire the film makes good mileage out of the witch hunts over Communism and the political manipulation associated with those who merely accused others with no thought or logic in a manner that swept up the public but also made others afraid to argue. This is well done but my fear is that it will continue to lose its impact as these times become longer ago \u0096 sure the theme still works but the relevance is gone and it is not as involving as (sorry for the comparison) the same strand in the remake; understandably so however. The thriller aspect works well enough and is pretty tense but it is not consistent, instead it is kept for several key scenes and its cold, brutal nature is really impacting \u0096 even if it is naturally dry and bloodless by today's standards. The fact that the film doesn't push the thriller aspect means that it is able to build across the board and plenty of interesting and satisfying aspects that are played down in the remake are stronger here.In particular the film develops the characters well, making more of the political side of things but also adding much needed meat to the characters of the Jordans, making us see their role in Shaw's life but also getting to know them as characters. This makes for a much more satisfying story, even if I personally preferred the more consistent paranoid and tense atmosphere of the remake. The original also brings out the complex relationship that Shaw has with his mother \u0096 we are given more time with this and it is more interesting than the remake, which barely spares the time for it and makes do with a clumsily bit of suggested sexuality.The cast are all pretty good and indeed one of them was the reason I decided to rewatch this film. With Leigh just passing away yesterday, I decided to watch this film (well \u0096 also because I had just watched the remake) and was surprised to find that she had so little time in this. Her character is barely used and could easily have been done away with and why such a well-known actress was put in such a minor role. Sinatra is pretty good in his role but I didn't totally buy his performance \u0096 he should have been more scarred by what happened, and surely he should not have been believed as quickly as he was? Harvey is much better \u0096 cold but with a real emotion underneath and his performance is the core of the film. In the acting stakes though, it is Lansbury that sticks in the memory as the domineering mother type, easily her best role. Gregory is great fun as the manipulated Iselin and Parrish and McGiver are both good as the Jordans. Dhiegh is good and provides a wonderful mix of comedy with the edge of cold menace.Overall this is a very good film that provides a well-rounded story delivering tension, thrills, laughs, shocking cold violence and a good serving of satire. Modern audiences may well find that the relevance of the remake makes it a more enjoyable film but the original is a much more rounded film that succeeds as more than just a thriller. It may not be as sharp as it once was but it is still really worth watching.",

This film was a high-impact very disturbing political thriller that turned in wonderful performances from Old Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, Lawrence Harvey and Janet Leigh. Directed by the legendary John Frankenheimer, the screenplay based on Richard Condon's classic novel, \"Winter Kills\" demonstrates how media frenzy and one person's political aspects could cause a devastating turnaround seen through the behavior of one man's political beliefs. Sinatra's role as Korean War veteran Maj. Bennett Marco as a man who's completely dedicated by his position as a prisoner of war during those three years in hell, is truly a an honorably complex role as man who's after a Staff Sargent who could strike at any moment. Marco is motivated by the traumatic nightmares he's encountered with during the three year war and releasing his conscience in order to unravel the mystery and to question a brainwashed platoon member of the Korean War soldiers that was under this lunatic's command.Sinatra is accompanied by plethora of very talented performers, especially Lawrence Harvey as the titular character, the former drill Sargent Raymond Shaw, who was raised in an upper class American family who is now fanatical about the Korean War, someone who is manipulated into becoming an enraged lunatic at any second, one brainwashing code words are implanted into his head. His over-controlling mother played by Angela Lansbury is played to perfection, while James Gregory who play's her husband who's a McCarthy influenced Senator is working his way to progression to have a seat in the Oval Office.Through further questioning with other POW's, Marco starts to have doubts about his own memories, which feels superficial and somewhat untrue, but through his hallucinations at night, he starts to progressively get closer to the whole truth. The plot really starts to piece together as the conclusion is unraveled with a surprising finale that will shock everyone. The choreography and the cinematography is elegant and brilliantly done with the type flair that Frankenheimer was famous for. as it's well patterned from the twists and turns that were uncovered by Marco. This was a brilliant thriller that will shock you, keep your mid guessing and very real characters.

            "content": "The best thing about political thrillers, in my opinion, is the paranoia that they both portray and generate in their audiences. And `The Manchurian Candidate' has paranoia in spades. Or perhaps I should say diamonds. That is, no one who has seen the film will ever look at solitaire or a deck of cards the same way again. And certainly brainwashing, a frightening concept in itself, has never been as palpably realized as it is here. The original ad for the film reads: `If you come in five minutes after this picture begins, you won't know what it's all about! When you've seen it all, you'll swear there's never been anything like it!' How true. But the genius of film lies in several distinct aspects.The disturbingly prophetic tone of `The Manchurian Candidate,' which was released in 1962, was shatteringly validated when President Kennedy was assassinated less than a year later. It caused so much fervor that the film was banned from theaters for the next 25 years. Aside from the story, the dialogue is crisp and to the point.The second major aspect of the film that bears mentioning is the acting. Sinatra is in top form here, lending a mesmerizing intensity to Bennett. Harvey is chilling as the brainwashed Shaw, while Lansbury delivers a knockout performance as his mother that earned her an Oscar nomination.The real genius of the film, however, lies in the directing, cinematography and editing. The brainwashing dream sequence is one of the most talked-about and highly praised sequences in editing, while several other camera shots are so far ahead of their time that they are just now coming into their own. Director John Frankenheimer (who later directed `Ronin') keeps the pace moving at breakneck speed towards the shattering, mind-blowing conclusion.If you're looking for something to blow you away, something completely unlike anything you've seen before, check out `The Manchurian Candidate.' It has aged well, still providing the same amount of suspense and drama that it did then. In fact, it's so good, it was recently named to the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films, where it placed 67. A thrilling film, topped by an explosive climax, it's one not to be missed.",

            "content": "The CIA ran an illegal \"brainwashing\" programme called MKULTRA during the 1950s and 60s. Though news of the programme was only brought to the public's attention in 1974, MKULTRA's run time coincided with a number of spy, \"secret agent\" and \"brainwashing\" movies (\"Ipcress File\", \"The Manchurian Candidate\", \"The Parallax View\", \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\", \"Seven Days in May\", \"Dr No\" etc), many of which saw unwitting suspects \"brainwashed\" into committing assassinations or acts of violence (\"Clockwork\" does the opposite, its hero brainwashed into passivity).Two of these films, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962) and \"The Parallax View\" (1974), are themselves eerily similar, though they are separated by over a decade and encapsulate very different political periods. Released in 1974, Alan J. Pakula's \"The Parallax View\" is very blatant in its left-leaning politics. One must remember that during this time a number of nefarious news stories were being dropped into the laps of the US public. The Watergate legacy had snowballed, the Pentagon Papers had revealed that Congress had been railroaded into Vietnam, the JFK and RFK assassination theories were in full bloom, the Warren Commision was viewed with much suspicion, the killings of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King - along with numerous bizarre occurrences in which \"All American Boys\" snapped and went on shooting rampages - were filling the public with fear, and reality itself was seen to be a conspiracy, an act of shared pretence. Pakula's film thus captures a very specific historical mood: trust no one and fck the Man. Such pessimism is routine today. We take widespread corruption as a truth. Back then it was a kind of momentary birth of consciousness.John Frankenheimer's \"The Manchurian Candidate\", however, was released in 1962, and though it has on its mind the communist witch hunts and rabid MacCarthyism of the 1950s, its overall politics are harder to get a grasp of. The plot: a US infantry platoon is captured during the Korean war. The captured men are taken to Manchuria where they are brainwashed by a cabal of Chinese communists and Russian KGB agents. The platoon's leader, Sergeant Shaw, is given the specific task of killing a US senator. It is hoped that this will result in the senator's rival, Shaw's own father, becoming President of the United States. Shaw's KGB handler is his mother. Shaw's father is Senator John Iselin. Modelled on Joseph McCarthy, Iselin's a super right-wing, fear-mongering politician who exists to fan the flames of war, paranoia and anti-communist mania. For most of the film the US public views Iselin as an idiot. Once they witness the assassination of his rival by evil commies, however, they will no doubt embrace his politics and swiftly agree to his somewhat authoritarian plans (marshal law and various emergency measures). End result: the communists \u2013 Russia and China \u2013 would thus have a puppet dictator controlling America. Or so they think. Iselin's camp is itself merely using the enemy to get themselves elected into power.So on one hand the film seems to be in the tradition of 1950s and 1960s bash-a-commie movies, which exploited fears of \"communist plots\", \"red invasion\" and right-wing fantasies in which the Chinese and Russians band together and scheme to overthrow the White House. But while the film affirms all these possibilities, it openly mocks such fantasies and paints all these characters as rabid idiots. Even more bizarrely, while the film shows deranged right-wingers working with the Commies, Shaw's mother is herself secretly working against the communists, and Shaw's final action is not to carry out the assassination of his father's rival but to kill his mother and father instead. End result: while there may be a communist threat, rightwingers are largely using commies as bogeymen, the ideological war between Democracy and Communism is ultimately ridiculous and contemptible and the real loser is Shaw, who becomes symbolic of all innocent men who are sacrificed by all sides. The film's many ideological overlaps are encapsulated by the incestuous relationship Shaw has with his mother: everyone's in bed with one another, but he's getting screwed. Beyond this, the film's brainwashing subplot extends to all human behaviour. If all behaviour is unconsciously programmed, then this is doubly true of politics, in which all is performance, all identity is artificial, flat and everyone seems to be a puppet.Incidentally, \"Candidate\" was released shortly before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And like Frankenheimer's sinister plot, Kennedy's assassination, most likely orchestrated by then vice president Lyndon B. Johnson, resulted in a fanatical warmonger entering the oval office. Frank Sinatra, who stars in \"Candidate\" and was good friends with Kennedy, also stared in 1954's \"Suddenly\", a very good film noir in which a group of men prepare to snipe the US president. Replace \"Candidate's\" goof-ball senator Iselin with \"Bush\", \"assassination\" with \"9/11\", \"communists\" with \"terrorists\", \"martial law\" with \"emergency powers\" and you've also basically got the 2001-2009 US Presidency. Iselin's cosying up to communists with the intention of ditching them later is itself always US policy: create or fund your rivals, and then turn them into boogeymen to justify wars. Recognising this, director Jonathan Demme released a remake of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" in 2004.Frankenheimer's direction throughout \"Candidate\" is customarily bombastic. His style is Orson Welles on cocaine, the director mixing a range of styles, techniques (chiaroscuro, wide angles, deep focus, expressionism, jump cuts, overlapping dialogue etc) and genres (war, noir, political thriller, melodrama, satire, Kafka, pseudo-documentary, black comedy, parody, horror, science fiction, action, art house, existential psychodrama, incestuous soap opera) and then leaving it up to the audience to make sense of the mess. The film's constant gear-shifting shouldn't work, but as the film is itself about discontinuity and disorientation, and as most of its characters are drugged, hypnotised, fanatical and on the brink of insanity, Frankenheimer's unstable aesthetic fits fine. The film reflects a kind of widespread ridiculousness.8/10 - Worth two viewings.",

            "content": "Viewed today 'The Manchurian Candidate' still stands out as a brilliant film. John Frankenheimer directed some very good films but this is his masterpiece, with a great screenplay by George Axelrod from Richard Condon's book. It is almost like a black comedy but of the darkest kind. The politics, the paranoia, the pathos and the power plays are effectively brewed together to make a heady experience. It is also brave enough to have a bleak ending. The film doesn't lift your heart. It is an insight into the grim undercurrents of life, still relevant after forty years.There are some justly celebrated sequences that still take the breath away. The dream segment is amazing. The camera movement, the cutting, the decor are all superb. It is a chilling scene because it takes normality and twists it slowly until the two moments of violence almost become acceptable. There is a great fight scene later between Sinatra and Henry Silva that still thrills. The ending of the film at the convention is staged magnificently. One runs out of superlatives.The same could be said for the acting. Sinatra is believable as the intelligent and haunted major. The possible doubtful casting of Laurence Harvey as Raymond Shaw pays off, even with his accent. His account of his love affair is very moving. He is a rounded character. Angela Lansbury as his mother is amazingly good. She has played unsympathetic roles but never like this. She is unforgettable. And scary! I'm not sure that the Janet Leigh character works but apart from her the smaller roles are well played. Khigh Dhiegh as the smiling Dr. Yen Lo epitomises the ambiguity and treachery of the people in power.  The only very minor quibble is the portentous narration at the beginning which I thought could be dispensed. A magnificent film and unsurpassed.From IMBd it appears that a re-make is in the offing.

After the credits, stoic Laurence Harvey (as Raymond Shaw) returns from the Korean War a decorated hero; his arrival is immediately copped for political advantage by manipulative mother Angela Lansbury (as Eleanor) and bombastic step-father James Gregory (as John \"Johnny\" Iselin). A powerful behind-the-scenes woman, Ms. Lansbury has Presidential aspirations for her Senator husband, a red-baiting Republican in the Joe McCarthy mold. Also returning from Korean War service is chain-smoking Frank Sinatra (as Bennett \"Ben\" Marco), who served with Mr. Harvey. Troubled by a nightmarish dream, Mr. Sinatra goes to the US military with his concerns...Apparently, the entire American platoon was brainwashed by Chinese communists! That is not exactly what happened, of course. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (this film version, anyway) is open to several interpretations, and unveils just enough of the Richard Condon story to keep you watching. This adaptation, to quote Lansbury's character, is \"perfectly marvelous.\" John Frankenheimer and George Axelrod juxtapose a unique combination of surreal scenes and bizarre dialogue, resulting is one of those rare films that takes on a life of its own. Even the puzzlingly short appearance by Janet Leigh makes sense, in context. While critically applauded, only \"Film Daily\" gave the film a \"Best Picture\" honor, but Lansbury's mean mother won her several \"Supporting Actress\" awards; she bites into the meatiest role of her career with relish.Sinatra and Harvey (his character obviously educated in England) are also excellent.Relax, the Cold War was only a bad dream.********** The Manchurian Candidate (10/24/62) John Frankenheimer ~ Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, Janet Leigh",

However, fellow platoon member Ben Marco is tormented and suffers nightmares from an alleged brainwashing he does not remember during his time in Manchuria.For me the film could have given more emphasis, in relation to the ambush of the soldiers and especially the brainwashing, I believe that this would be more important than certain moments in the film, which add little to the story. The film has a good twist at the end (Characteristic of hollywood films of the time).

The film was not pulled from circulation after JFK was assassinated, it had run it's course in the theaters months earlier. It was shown at least two times that I know of before it's re-release in 1988: on NBC in 1975 ( I have the TV guide) and in 1979 in an appreciation of film class at college of Marin. It was not re-released in theaters because until 1988, Sinatra didn't realize he dad the rights (he says this on his special feature interview on the DVD).Harvey was chosen after Tony Curtis was considered. It was thought that Harvey's British accent (even though he's a Lithuanian Jew) could be tempered( if you've seen him in other films, his accent in TMC is definitely not as 'British' as he's capable of)and also, Lansbury, who played his mother had a slight British/New England accent. Frankenheimer also says in the commentary that since JFK had an odd accent, Harvey's would not seem that odd.Janet Leigh's character is in keeping with her character in the book although not as fleshed out. If it were, I think most viewers would not suspect her intentions. Frankly, I never thought she was that odd. Most films of that era hooked up the main actor with the \"girl\" who's primary function was to be the \"girl\" and support the main actor.Finally, the remake bears only faint resemblance to either the novel or the first film.

            "content": "Legend has it that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was withdraw from distribution in the wake of the Kennedy assassination. This is not true. 1962 reviews ranged from lackluster to savage, with Laurence Harvey's performance the focus of critical ire; box office was tepid; and in the end the film vanished from screens of its own accord.Legend also has it that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was not seen again until 1988. This is not true. The film was broadcast on television on at least three occasions between 1965 and 1975--but although critical response was more positive, audience interest remained low. What is true, however, is that star Frank Sinatra, who controlled the rights, had become extremely disenchanted with distributor United Artists, and by 1975 he was no longer willing to allow the film to be shown under their banner.Like some films that are briefly seen and then hidden from public view, the longer THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remained off the screen the more it came to be considered an important film, a classic film. When Sinatra and United Artists resolved their dispute in 1988, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE went into a limited theatrical release, and on this occasion it did not disappoint: it received a critical reevaluation that was overwhelmingly positive.Seen today, it is virtually impossible to watch the film without the ghosts of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald haunting the screen. Consequently, it is very difficult to evaluate the film in a purely critical sense. The story concerns Sgt. Raymond Shaw, stepson of Senator Iselin (James Gregory), who returns from the Korean War with a Medal of Honor. But something odd occurs: the men that served with him, including Major Marco (Frank Sinatra), begin to have nightmares about Shaw and about what really happened in Korea. It soon transpires that Shaw, and to a certain extent his entire company, were captured and \"brainwashed\"--and Shaw has been turned into an unwitting assassin.The 1959 Richard Condon novel was as much a wickedly funny satire on American politics as it was a suspense thriller, and screenwriter George Axelrod keeps that quality intact. The film is very witty in an extremely perverse way, and while director Frankeheimer has been praised for his cinematic technique, his real triumph here is the way he balances this darkly comic edge with the film's plot: instead of balancing them, he allows them to grate against each other. You are never quite sure how you are supposed to take the film from scene to scene, and the result is a mounting sense of unease.In terms of the cast, Angela Lansbury's performance as Shaw's mother Mrs. Iselin is justly famous, and it will come as great shock to those who tend to think of her in terms of her television work. She is easily one of the most evil characters ever put on screen, a horrifying combination of stridency, ruthlessness, ambition, and Freudian nightmare. But in truth the entire cast is extremely good, all the way from the star players to the bit parts.This is easily Frank Sinatra's best film performance, and although Laurence Harvey received poor reviews in 1962, it is today impossible to imagine any other way to play the role. Janet Leigh also scores in a small but smartly written role, as does James Gregory, whose role is clearly based on the notorious Senator Joe McCarthy. Also particularly memorable are John McGiver and Leslie Parrish as Senator Thomas Jordan and his daughter Jocelyn.The cinematography is remarkably stylish with too many memorable set pieces to count; seldom has Frankenheimer so effectively used his talent for creating a newsreel-like tone. The score, the editing, and the production values are also quite fine, and taken as a package the film has been tremendously influential; one can see it in the work of such directors as William Friedkin and Oliver Stone, particularly in the latter's controversial film JFK.But there is a flaw here. For all the expertise, the film becomes less engaging as it progresses. The film has a very detached tone and the major characters tend to be unsympathetic, and both Frankenheimer and Axelrod are just a shade too careful to spell out all the details. In the end, the deliberately uneasy mixture of comic and dramatic elements seem to play out just one step too far, and the film becomes just a shade too cool in tone for its own good. By the time the film ends you are having to work a bit too hard to stay with it. I'm giving the film five stars; it deserves that, and easily. And I think everyone who sees it will enjoy it--but I suspect that one viewing will be enough for most.THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is presently available to the home market via VHS and DVD. The \"Special Edition\" DVD release is quite good, with crisp elements. It includes a commentary by director Frankenheimer and various interviews, including a short conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer, and Axelrod; an interview with Angela Lansbury; and a short comment by director William Friedkin.Gary F.

At the end of the war, the men return to the States with no knowledge of what happened. The jaded Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honour for bravery in combat and hailed as a hero whilst Marco begins working for military intelligence. The latter is plagued by sinister nightmares and he begins an extensive investigation, re-uniting with Shaw in the process. A horrific truth is soon uncovered that will change the lives of both men forever...Apart from the above synopsis, you should know NOTHING about The Manchurian Candidate before watching it for the first time. It will strike it's most bruising blow if you are ignorant to the details of the plot. Based on a novel of the same name, George Axelrod's script is intelligently constructed and the premise just as brilliantly conceived. The script will pull you into the clever depths of the story and have you hooked for the entire duration of the film, allowing you to engage with the plot. However, the otherwise magnificent script is wrought with quite a few plot holes, some of which are big enough to drive a bus through. Unfortunately, the film suffers slightly because of this. Still, the script contains a substantial amount of memorable dialogue and the plot never becomes convoluted. The Manchurian Candidate s definitely a product of it's time. It exploits the number one threat to the free world which was prevalent throughout the latter half of the 20th century. As a tried and true realist, I strongly doubt that the event depicted in the film could have taken place, even in the 1950s and 60s. Although, it's an extremely curious thought at the same time. The film is a Thriller verging on political satire which feeds on the crazed paranoia of American and British audiences of the time and despite being far fetched, is terrifyingly real!. The film boasts one of the most impressive casts I've ever seen. Laurence Harvey plays the tormented soul that is Raymond Shaw exceptionally well. At the beginning, I was unsure about the idea of a British actor playing an American character, but as the film progressed the role could never have been filled by another actor. With his tawny appearance and piercing demeanour, Harvey was able to embody the character with overpowering intensity. Frank Sinatra provides sturdy support as Major Ben Marco in what I consider to be a milestone in Sinatra's acting career. Janet Leigh also gave a first rate performance, as did Douglas Henderson as Colonel Milt, Major Marco's superior officer. James Gregory and John McGiver turned in staunch portrays of the two rival senators. However, the best performance in the film without a doubt comes from Angela \"Murder She Wrote\" Lansbury. Her portrayal of Mrs Iselin is the greatest performance from a female actor that I've ever seen in film or TV. Her restrained portray crackles with intensity, making her character deliciously frightening.Both the cinematography and editing are inspired. In terms of the cinematography, the occasional use of diagonal shots make certain scenes feel dreamlike and were extremely effective. The several large close-ups also worked excellently, making me feel as if the characters were addressing me personally. The inclusion of various point of view shots as well as both subjective and objective camera angles were incredibly stylish. The nightmare sequences were truly commendable indeed.Here, Ferris Webster(the editor)turns the process of editing into an art. They were shot and edited in such a sophisticated manor that I found myself looking twice in order to interpret fully what was going on in these scenes. The masterful cinematography and brisk editing are at their peak during the gripping climax. John Frankenheimer cranks the suspense up to dizzying highs in what I consider to be one of the most taut sequences ever filmed. I will say nothing more, but the climax and ending of The Manchurian Candidate are what puts the capital T in Thriller.The Manchurian Candidate is a significant and though provoking slice of classic(or maybe even modern)cinema. Providing a momentous \"what if?\" scenario as well as a riveting insight into the obsessive politics of a bygone era, it deserves to be seen by all. 8/10.",

The Manchurian Candidate is a milestone film in American Cinema, and a film ahead of its time. When it was finally re-released in the late 80's, it was still fresh and memorable. An entire army patrol is kidnapped and brainwashed during the Korean War and then sent home to do who knows what. One of them grows suspicious about the shared nightmares the men have and sets out to find out. We spend the length of the film finding out. Humorist George Axelrod adapted the screenplay from Richard Condon's biting Cold War novel. The film is simultaneously farcical, frightening, funny, mysterious, political, and suspenseful. It also contains some elements of film noir.Frankenheimer's direction is sure, and the film utilizes a combination of locations, set pieces, and astonishing wide angle lens photography (by Lionel Lindon). Most incredible is the Orson Welles-like filming of the brainwashing sequence where soldiers think they're attending a garden party club lecture. While they are being brainwashed, the camera does a 360 degree pan and segues to the enemy perpetrators in seamless fashion. It happens so subtly that the viewer barely notices. There are several zoom shots to close ups used effectively also. The film contains several noir-like qualities: above average dialog, a femme fatale (Angela Lansbury), contrasts between light and shadows, editing that quickens the pace (Oscar-nominated Ferris Wheeler), loss of innocence (symbolized by the shootings of John McGiver and Leslie Parrish), psychological manipulation, and tough violence.Frank Sinatra is stunningly good as Bennett Marco in his second career role of a lifetime (the first was From Here To Eternity). Laurence Harvey is equally good as Raymond Shaw, the war hero who may not be a war hero. Janet Leigh is Rosie, the new girlfriend or is she only a girlfriend of Marco's? Angela Lansbury, who was Oscar-nominated, plays Raymond's mother and is one of the most terrifying villains in screen history. James Gregory is Senator Iselin, the Joseph McCarthy-like red baiter with no clue as to what he's doing but will stop at nothing to grab the spotlight. Leslie Parrish is Jocelyn Jordan, Senator Jordan's daughter whom Shaw once loved and now has returned to. John McGiver is Senator Jordan, a liberal politician representing the common sense balance missing with extremist politics. Henry Silva is Chunjin, a link to the nightmare that sets Marco off. Of course, the events which unfolded following the film's release have only added to its luster. **** of 4 stars.",

Expertly made, this film presents several plot twists but manages to make the surface story easily manageable.Beneath the suspenseful story of Sgt. Raymond Shaw and Major Ben Marco, underlining concepts become apparent.  Along with there platoon, the two men are captured during the Korean War.  The men are brainwashed by Russian and Chinese doctors and officers.  Shaw is the focus.  He seems to have qualities desirable for an unconscious assassin.  The plot swerves from here, as Marco becomes both advocate and opposition to Shaw. \nSenator and Mrs. Iselin(Shaw's stepfather and mother) are tools for lampoonery.  McCarthyism is attacked by comparisons of it and the unsubstantiated accusations of communism made by the Senator, who is probed to make them by his wife.  It is a direct attack on a known fallible idea but also assails other less obvious evils of politics:  Especially those associated with elections.The subplot hardest to understand completely is the love affair between Major Marco and the woman he meets on a train, Rosie.  The scene in which they meet hints at the idea that Rosie is an operative for the enemy.  This theory never materializes, but this may be purposeful, to add mystique to an already remarkable movie.Angela Lansbury is quite dislikable as Shaw's mother, Lawrence Harvey is a perfect brainwashed zombie as Sgt. Raymond Shaw, James Gregory plays a drunken puppet well as Senator Iselin, and Frank Sinatra surprises with a complex role as Major Marco.  The supporting actors give stellar performances as well.

It follows two former Korean veterans, one of whom has received the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in saving his unit.Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and others from his unit have a recurring dream years after returning from the war. The dream co-mingles a women's flower show and Chinese agents who force American soldiers to do things against their will. Much seems to revolve around former Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), the step-son of anti-Communist Senator John Iselin (James Gregory) and son of Eleanor (Angela Lansbury), a domineering woman who manipulates both her husband and son.The film reveals that Chinese soldiers have actually brainwashed the American soldiers and follows Marco's efforts to ascertain what exactly happened to Shaw. Along the way, Marco develops a relationship with Eugenie Rose Cheyney (Janet Leigh), and Shaw reignites a relationship with Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), daughter of liberal Senator Thomas Jordan (John McGiver). Finally, there is a climactic ending when the Communist plans are revealed as an assassination plot.This film became famous and important because it was released at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and was immediately pulled from distribution after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. If not for these coincidences, the movie would not have garnered the praise it did. Much of the plot is implausible, even in 1960 terms, and especially Marco's love interest has no explanation or rationale. Harvey, Gregory, and Lansbury were good in their roles; Sinatra was OK. The problem is with the script and possibly the original book.The best I can say is that the film didn't age well.",

It's directed throughout by a man who's obviously an expert. There's no showboating but it contains many moments of quiet brilliance, most notable in the first dream sequence where the old ladies seamlessly switch characters back and forth with the Soviet military brass.Lawrence Harvey is perhaps too effective as the stone cold Shaw. The fact that there's nothing to like in the character means there's nothing to like in the performance; consequently when tragedy befalls him it's difficult to feel the sympathy one perhaps should. But if I wanted to find real things to gripe about it'd be the infamous plot holes that abound. Still, they don't really detract from the story if you don't think too much about them.",

            "content": "Why haven't I already written a comment on this movie? I love it so much I have not been able to watch the Denzel Washington/Meryl Streep remake. Just as many believe that sacred texts should not be translated, certain landmarks of world cinema should not be touched (imagine a remake of \"Citizen Kane,\" \"Gone With the Wind,\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"). \"The Manchurian Candidate\" is an example of what the late psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung called synchronicity, a rare meeting of the minds when everything came together: producer/star Frank Sinatra, screenwriter George Axelrod and director John Frankenheimer were in complete harmony. It was a courageous film to make in 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when America (and the world) teetered on the brink of destruction. The film has a \"plague on both your houses\" attitude toward the Cold War, mercilessly skewering the lunatic fringe conservatives while portraying the Chinese and Russian communists as diabolical, almost Mephistophelian schemers. At the time of the Korean War the Soviet/Chinese split had yet to occur, so it made sense for a Chinese psychologist (Khieh Digh) to work with the Russians. The film is almost science fiction in its exploration of brainwashing techniques that are hopefully still years beyond us in application, reminding me of Isaac Asimov's Mule and Second Foundation. Angela Lansbury is perhaps the most evil mother in screen history as the Red Queen, a superpatriotic grande dame secretly in cahoots with the Commies. The incest between her and her son, Raymond Shaw (the brilliant Lawrence Harvey) is barely hinted at but disturbing nonetheless. Frank Sinatra gives the finest performance of his acting career as Bennett DeMarco; there's not a false note in his portrayal of a man undergoing post-traumatic stress disorder. Janet Leigh shines as the stranger on the train who becomes his shelter from the storm; I cannot believe those commentators who suggest she was a communist agent. This film was so powerful that Sinatra withdrew it from circulation after the Kennedy assassination, fearing it might have influenced Lee Harvey Oswald (along with another Sinatra thriller, 1954's \"Suddenly\"). My only criticism is that I would like to know more of the back story: how did Mrs. Iselin make contact with the Soviets? What exactly were the experiments performed by Yen Lo? That aside, this is an immortal classic that I will always treasure.",

            "content": "This is one of the most insightful, penetrating, prescient, prophetic movies ever made. It is simultaneously thrilling, tense, humorous, emotional and tragic. The plotting, direction, performances are beyond criticism, but there's a great deal more to it. Where to start? Listening to the BBC this morning, it is clear that McCarthy was right about the infiltration of Communist agents into American government and life in general. In fact, there were more hidden Communist agents in the USA after WWII than in any other country in the world. Next in line was France. Was Richard Condon aware of this? He published his book, on which the film is based, in 1959. His works are known for his \"loathing of those in power\", and often \"have elements of classical tragedy\". The story told is very similar in many ways to the tragedy of Hamlet, and throughout it there is a pervasive sense that \"something is rotten\" in the state. In both Hamlet and the Manchurian Candidate there are strong psychological undertones: both can be interpreted in Freudian terms.Another book, published in 1963, helps towards an understanding of the background to the political situation. This is \"The Techniques of Persuasion\", by J.A.C.Brown. It reveals that the brainwashing techniques developed by the Chinese (or Russians) in Korea were more successful in converting American prisoners of war than prisoners of other nations. The reasons for this are complicated. American POWs returning from Korea generally received an extremely raw deal from their country.The film has in the past been severely censured by both right-wing and left-wing intellectuals alike. These diametrically opposed criticisms indicate the film's exceptional subtlety. The role played by Janet Leigh in the film has sometimes been obtusely dismissed as irrelevant. This film was not made by idiots, however, and anyone genuinely interested in the plot will do well to ruminate deeply on why she is there, and what part she may be playing. The film doesn't tell us, but there are strong hints that she is a kind of minder, planted by US intelligence.Senator McCarthy/Iselin/Claudius was on to something, almost unwittingly. He was not a clever politician, however, nor very bright, and was perhaps being used by both sides in the real cold war. The film is undoubtedly somewhat misogynist, or at least mother-hating, like many post-war films of the noir variety. Shaw is constrained to kill both his mother/Gertrude, and his stepfather; as well as Jocelyn/Ophelia along with Jordan/Polonius.The Manchurian Candidate is one of the most intelligent, bravest, most wonderful American films I've yet come across. Goodnight, sweet prince, concludes Sinatra. I'm not going to bother with the remake in these dumbed-down days.",

            "content": "As much as I agree with all the praise I have seen in regards to \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (one of JFK's favorite movies, so I'm told; ironic that he apparently lived out his own version of the tale, yes?), I still feel like that there is one point about the film that is easy to miss. To wit, what all can go wrong with conspiracies. A flaw that I have seen in too many conspiracy theories I've heard is the suggestion that everything went according to the grand design of the plan. There is always one vital element missing in such theories as this: human error.So MANY things go wrong with the great Communist takeover portrayed here. For starters, there's the nightmares that haunt Sinatra's sleep, clueing him into the conspiracy to begin with. The tryout killing of Raymond's boss, unnecessarily taking a risk that raises the profile of the conspirators. Someone at a bar suggesting Raymond play solitaire and then mentions offhand (with Raymond on the Red Queen, of course) for the guy he's talking to to go jump in a lake (which Raymond promptly does). Raymond's would-be girlfriend wearing the Red Queen card the night Raymond is under orders, breaking the spell. Sinatra figuring out Raymond's trigger circuit for the brainwashing program. Finally, there's Raymond himself, full of pain and self-loathing so intense that when he finally finds an outlet for it, he dives in...headfirst. When he loaded his final three bullets, there was no question in my mind who the targets would be. Pay attention to the whole film from beginning to end and I doubt one would fail to realize what they are.Now, on the subject of Janet Leigh's admittedly nothing role, I believe that her purpose is to be what is called in mysteries \"a red herring\". What that is is something that looks like it's important enough to be a clue, but actually isn't. By the time she's introduced, my paranoia level was running sky-high. It's one thing to know who the bad guys are; it's another to not know who's working for them and who isn't. Therefore, you wondering if she has anything to do with what's going down. I can certainly think of no other reason why Leigh was in there.In conclusion, while \"The Manchurian Candidate\" does anticipate the paranoia of the '90s, one of it's more important lessons lies in realizing the pitfalls of all grand conspiracies.",

I think Angela Lansberry steals the show with her performance as the the mother from hell. I have actually read some put down remarks about the acting of Lawrence Harvey, but in my opinion he was outstanding as Raymond Shaw. I really don't see how any other actor could have played the role better. And until I saw this movie, I never realized what a great actor Frank Sinatra was(he once remarked that singing was basically acting - no doubt that is true). I have read the book, but in this case I think the movie was better. Kudos to George Axelrod for his great screenplay based on the book. Frankenheimer is probably the one of the most underrated(or at least not known to most of the public) directors of all time. But this is his greatest achievement. The movie is very tightly written and edited - the story always moves forward.If you have never seen this movie, don't see the remake first.

The Manchurian Candidate is about a platoon of soldiers from the Korean War who, after strange occurrences and having repeated nightmares that are eerily similar, realize a decade later that something horrible may have happened during their tour of duty.  The story itself is first-rate - compelling, thrilling and intelligent.  One of the most phenomenal aspects of this film is that theme is completely terrifying, yet there are no cheap thrills to back it up.  The dream sequences are horrifying because they are straight forward, not because of standard horror imagery.  Frankenheimer's genius lies in the fact that he can take these kinds of scenes and weave them with the Red Scare theme without being heavy-handed.Probably one of the more humorous aspects of the film, and this isn't anything intentional of course, is the fact that the generations who only know Angela Lansbury as the mild-mannered (a vaguely irritating) Jessica Fletcher from `Murder She Wrote' will be surprised to see her role in this film, because she is the embodiment of evil. An entirely new generation will be able to see another interpretation of The Manchurian Candidate that has been remade by Jonathan Demme and stars Denzel Washington in the Frank Sinatra role.  From what I have seen by the trailer, there seems to be some major theme changes, which can be somewhat excused due to the topical nature of the original.  However, I think it will be hard pressed to even come close to matching the original because Frankenheimer's version is an intense, relevant and incredibly intelligent film.  This is film is definitely a must-see if you haven't already experienced it.--Shelly",

            "content": "THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a suspense thriller drama, which is full of disturbing anxiety and intimidation in a \"colorful\" political game. It is based on the novel of the same name by Richard Condon.During the Korean War, the Soviets capture a U.S. platoon and take them to Manchuria in Communist China. A few days later, most of the soldiers have returned to American lines, and one sergeant has received the Medal of Honor, because, according to a report of a captain, he has rescued his comrades. However, unsympathetic character of a young sergeant, which is mentioned in earlier reports, is now under question. The soldiers are behaving pretty strange. They suffer from a recurring nightmare in which a hypnotized sergeant demonstrates murder. The captain wants to investigate that strange phenomenon, but has no solid evidence to back his claims and thus receives no support from Army Intelligence. Meanwhile, a sergeant mother drives a political career of her husband and his stepfather, who is a demagogue and widely dismissed as a fool. A desperate captain will have to connect all the strings in a dangerous and dirty political game...This is a very intelligent story, which could cause determination consequences to the viewers, given the political environment. A brainwashing has a double meaning in this case. It is trapped between political conflicts and fear of a certain ideology. A political manipulation is in contrast with the logic and free thinking. That topic is fairly well covered in the film. A tension is a consistent segment, but the direction is uncertain, because some key scenes are not convincing. The balance between the main protagonists is lost through satirical reflections or ironic attitudes.A paranoid-depressive atmosphere is very good, while the characterization could be a lot better. The plot has lost its sharpness and direction in the second part of the film.Frank Sinatra as Maj. Bennett Marco is a generator of a turn in the story. He is a quite unconvincing character, although well developed, especially in the second part of the film. Laurence Harvey as Raymond Shaw is impressive as a hypnotized killer. He is a victim and villain at the same time. Mr. Harvey has offered a very good performance.Their support are Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Iselin) as a dominant and intense character. She is a mother, wife and agent \"of dark forces\" at the same time. James Gregory (Sen. John Yerkes Iselin) is her puppet and a vulgar politician with a fake and unconvincing stance. Janet Leigh (Eugenie Rose Chaney) has, given the timing of her appearance in the film, received too little space in the film. There is a romance between her and Maj. Marco, which is on the verge of absurdity.Frankly, I do not like this idea, but this shocking conspiracy thriller is not bad.",

            "content": "I've said this before: the 1960s were a wonderful decade for film-making, so many powerful and influential films emerged from the turbulence of those times: The Miracle Worker, The Graduate, Rosemary's Baby, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, etc. These movies and many more were groundbreaking films, and I don't think there has ever been a time when film meshed so perfectly with the collective consciousness. As weird and twisted as the plot might seem, The Manchurian Candidate is no exception. To anyone who doubts the influence of film in the 1960s, one need only look at its ugly cousin, television, which spared no idea no matter how wacky: genies, talking cars, talking horses, munsters, martians, rich hillbillies, suburban housewife witches, and special agent wild west matadors.The premise of the film is way out there, but you see a film to suspend disbelief and be entertained. It doesn't matter if you can't swallow the notion that a man's sense of morality could be so badly compromised that he would blithely shoot his fellow soldier upon command, what gives the film credibility are the strong, powerful images that it portrays. It is a small leap of logic to believe that powerful interests really are controlling our minds, for example look at how biased and narrow-minded the news media are: the same five stories are reported over and over on all the networks, on all the news websites, in all the magazines, and on the radio. Why is this? I think at the very least this film should make us question authority, and who has the right to control the information that goes into our brains. In other words, stop being a sheep.Much has been written about Angela Lansbury's bravura, over-the-top performance as the monster-mom queen of diamonds. Pushy, ambitious, arrogant, and downright nasty, she steals every scene she appears in. If all you know of her acting range is the lovable, easygoing Jessica Fletcher from her TV show, here she will knock your socks off as Jessica's exact opposite. Her husband, Senator Iselin, is basically a patsy, a figurehead that she manipulates to say whatever she wants him to say. It is amusing that, twenty years after this film, the U.S. would have a president and first lady who so closely resemble these two people. Life imitating art.This fascinating film is not without its flaws. I found myself wishing that someone other than Frank Sinatra was cast as Marco. I'm sure he's okay in other films, but here his hamhanded delivery and meatball facial expressions are ill-suited to the task at hand. Imagine Peter O'Toole or Rock Hudson in the role, trying to carefully figure out what's going on; you can't see the wheels turning in Sinatra's head because he's basically playing himself. I'm sure Frankenheimer was secretly frustrated at Sinatra's limited range, but whom could he complain to without getting whacked by the mob.Janet Leigh is in here for some reason, she just appears out of nowhere, dumps her fianc\u00e9e, and moves in with Meatball. No backstory, nothing. The reptilian Laurence Harvey is perfectly cast as Raymond Shaw, the engineered assassin: cold, friendless, soft-spoken, he gives you the creeps every time he appears on screen. It's difficult to imagine such a character as a protagonist, but Frankenheimer actually manages to pull it off. You really want to see Shaw emerge from his brainwashing as his own man with his own life.",

The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor.The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience.The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war.As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real.John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin.The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued.A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor.www.lagsreviews.com",

Oh, right, you can't, because if you did I would KARATE-CHOP you Sinatra style! Tiger paw, Frank.6. SINATRA ONLY DOES ONE TAKE!!! - So everything is out of focus and crazy! So very cool!7. ANGELA LANSBURY!!! - INCEEEEEEEEEEEST!8. THE SCORE!!! - David Amram writes a simply great classical/modern score for this film, which you can't stop humming in all its atonal glory.In conclusion. this film is FREAKIN AWESOME! Get a copy! Or five! Send John Frankenheimer a thank-you letter!",

The plot is something Hitchcock might have used; the son (played magnificently in a once in a life time performance by Laurence Harvey) of a prominent, right-wing political family has been brainwashed as an unwitting assassin for an international Communist conspiracy. Frank Sinatra is also extremely good as Bennett Marco, proving once and for all, that apart from singing, he can act very well. Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin, and James Gregory as Senator John Yerkes Iselin are all very good (Lansbury was nominated for a Academy Award), but its Laurence Harvey who is absolutely fantastic. How he never won the Best Actor Academy Award beats me. A edge of your seat movie. Well worth seeing.",

            "content": "This is a great movie. It starts out, slowly at first. It builds the suspense by showing you the various pieces of the puzzle, and then starts to put them together right before your eyes (this is done so seamlessly). Frank Sinatra plays the role of the Capt. Marco (soon to be Major). He adequately portrays the role of the officer with a \"loose\" memory. I don't think the terror aspect of brainwashing came out as much in his performance, as it should have. The two outstanding performances definitely belong to Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey. Everyone who thinks of Angela (Raymond's mother) as the nice, old granny fiction mystery writer from New England, is in for a surprise. She is manipulative, accusatory and quite pushy. Laurence Harvey plays the Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Raymond Shaw (who returns from the Korean War a hero). This movie was made prior to the death of JFK and several years after the McCarthy era. In a way, it deals with both those elements in a fictitious yet realistic and quite plausible manner (very much relevant even now). The film has very much a film noir quality in the choice of scenery, lighting and the mood. This film is dark and cynical in its portrayal of patriotism, politics and human behavior. After a while, the toned down performances of most of the actors, seem to put you in a \"brainwashed\" state. You don't feel .. you just sit there and watch .. helpless. This is juxtaposed with the subtle yet visibly humorous performance of New Jersey born actor Khigh Dhiegh (Dr. Lo - the washer) and the over-the-top nonsensical actions of Raymond's stepfather Senator (played by James Gregory). The ending is the shock to wake us up from the slumber and get us thinking for ourselves again. This movie should be watched by all <period>.",

A stain on the reputation of all concerned. A graphic illustration of the decline of Jonathan Demme as a director.I also scanned a few \"1\" reviews on here and can only say that they reflect either a total lack of taste, or perhaps a lack of sophistication.The Manchurian Candidate is one of the very few movies that are nearly perfect, in my estimation. Best film performance, ever, for Frank Sinatra. Perhaps the best of Angela Lansbury and one of the screen's definitive villains. My favorite Janet Leigh performance. A really astonishing performance by Lawrence Harvey, simultaneously obnoxious and pitiable. Perfect supporting cast. Cracking script by George Axelrod.What really sets this film apart from the vast majority of thrillers is its ability to evoke willing suspension of disbelief. Like any thriller, if one thinks about the plot too hard, the plot becomes absurd. The best directors of thrillers--Frankenheimer, Hitchcock--manage to keep the plot plausible by never going too far. The plot of The Manchurian Candidate bears more than a passing resemblance to Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday, a classic of \"both sides are the same\" plot. Nevertheless, the plot remain plausible, particularly in the Alice-in-Wonderland atmosphere engendered by the dream sequences and the black and white photography.Is there a great shock in the movies than when Angela Lansbury asks Lawrence Harvey to \"pass the time with playing a little solitaire\"? Unless it is Lawrence Harvey's final assassinations? Is these anything more disturbingly surreal that the dream sequences shifting seamlessly from garden party ladies to Soviet generals? I have seen it at least 20 times, first at its initial release. It is always fresh.See it and burn a copy of the remake.",

At the time, I was in Chicago, and dragged a friend to a theatre to see it. The next night I went back with another friend, and the next night after that, I went by myself. This is the ONLY film I have ever gone to a movie theatre to see three times in a row, three days in a row.  It has been with me ever since.  Arguably it is one of the best films ever made; top-notch acting, superb direction, riveting story. If you ever get an opportunity to see this film in a theatre, in the dark on a big screen, do so.See the original before you see the remake. Remember when Hollywood remade 1963's \"The Haunting\" in 1995 or so?  BAAAAADDDDD....But back to the Manchurian Candidate.  It is a film that introduces many questions as it tells its story; it is a fascinating, complex study of psychology and politics, and it is a forever-frozen-in-time moment of a depiction of American life in the early 1960s.  It is a film that opinions and discussions will continue on for as long as the participants can muster...so many interesting observations and angles presented.While all the acting is excellent, Angela Lansbury's performance is the one that stayed with me that night when I left that small theatre in Illinois, and though it is rare to find female characters in classic films in such magnanimous positions of power, her performance undoubtedly will go down in history as one of the best, if not the best,  of such performances.  No one has come close.Many, many great comments about the film are contained in these summaries and on the message boards, attesting to the film's stamina and excellence. But if you've not seen it, do yourself the favor of watching it first...maybe even two or three times, as there are so many details to pick up on, then come in here and read through all the interesting observations, peruse the message boards and join the discussions.

There, the Communists implant false memories in the soldiers' minds to cover their capture, and to provide a subconscious trigger in the mind of Sergeant Shaw made by Dr. Yen. Brainwashed, the soldiers are released back to America, unaware of what they have been through. Raymond's unconscious actions are triggered by the Queen of Diamonds.I've seen the remake starring Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep. Although I'm quite fond of the up-to-date remake, I found this film quite compelling. The film starts off slow, at first, but when the ball gets rolling, the movie really does get a whole lot better. True, I saw the twists and turns coming, with an exception of the different ending. However, I was still in the edge of my seats waiting for the inevitable to happen. But, like I said, the ending was different, with one surprise after another. My jaw dropped when the credits rolled.I love conspiracy films. The plot made me feel paranoid, much like Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his \"red scare\" out lash. The film demonstrated the fear of outsiders by having Communists implant things to one's body, along with unknown people who could also be a Communist. \"Don't trust anyone but yourself.\" I praise this film for the originality. Even though I liked the \"name calling controlling your brain\" change from the remake better, I still found the playing cards quite interesting. The film is also relevant today, especially since it has been connected to Kennedy's assassination. The black-and-white photography works quite well on building up tension.With that being said, there were a few things that bothered me with the film. First of all, the performances weren't quite strong as I hoped for. In fact, the only person that stood out from the cast was Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury. They play each other quite well with the hating mother-and-son relationship. Lansbury really deserved her Oscar nomination for her role, as well. She plays a fantastic villain. Frank Sinatra doesn't have much to do here, along with Janet Leigh, whom I hoped would be more involved with the plot, but, instead, turned out to be a filler role.There was also one scene that bothered me. A fighting scene between Sinatra and a Communist Russian/Chinese (couldn't tell) was quite laughable and a bit unnecessary. I'm sure it could've been choreographed better. But overall, with its few faults, I enjoyed this sophisticated, paranoid thriller. The film has some great surprises that will leave you stunned. Please watch this movie before you die.",

The acting is rigid and wooden, a trait with which although I am accustomed unfortunately was on this occasion yet another sign of the film's age. I found the characters to be distant and unrelatable, however this works in favor of Angela Lansbury's character because that's exactly how she is supposed to be.The plot is contrived, and reeks not only with Cold War paranoia of communists abroad, but the \"subversive\" right wing hard-liners at home set out to put all of Hollywood in forced labor camps as \"Sen.

            "content": "The recent death of John Frankenheimer is perhaps an appropriate moment to comment on what was undoubtedly his masterpiece and reflect on his place in American cinema.  His greatest achievement was to extend the Hollywood golden age, which in so many respects reached its natural end in the 'fifties into the early years of the 'sixties.  Admittedly Hitchcock was still around, but Hitchcock was a legendary figure and far from spent as \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie\" were triumphantly to prove.  But Frankenheimer was a comparatively new talent with a very special gift for the conspiracy/political thriller.  He gave us two superlative films in this genre, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and \"Seven Days in May\".  Thereafter his work became increasingly more uneven although there were some good things in \"The Train\", a French resistance wartime thriller and \"Seconds\" an interesting but overlong piece of science-fiction.  I have always dated the eventual demise of Hollywood as we knew it from the release of Peter Yates's \"Bullet\" in 1968, a film in which the superficiality of a spectacular car chase was the raison d'etre rather than character.  It was sad that a director as talented as Frankenheimer joined the cheap thrills brigade with \"The French Connection II\" after which we rather lost sight of him.  Still, at least we can continue to derive enormous pleasure from \"The Manchurian Candidate\", a conspiracy thriller about Cold War intrigue that has never been equalled, much less surpassed.  Others such as \"Arlington Road\" and \"The Parallax Factor\" are just light years away in comparison.  Just to hint at a plot so diabolical in its concept and implications would involve so many SPOILERS that is is best to leave it alone and simply say that it has the most fiendishly cunning villain in film history, a wonderfully witty script (that reference to a sauce bottle and the consequences of a character thinking he has been told to jump into a lake), an exquisitely tender romantic interlude - almost a film within a film - of a summer when an \"unlovable\" character become \"lovable\", the finest performances Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury ever gave and a superlative score by David Amram, all of which add up to one of the most entertaining films of them all.",

            "review_title": "Communists, Communists Everywhere!",
            "content": "The Manchurian Candidate is one of few films to really portray communism as a sinister force, compared to many other films which even if they don't portray communism in a favourable light, they fail to go the whole hog. In the director's commentary for The Manchurian Candidate, director John Frankenheimer states the film is a response to Joseph McCarthy but goes into no details regarding this or any of the political themes present in the film but rather talking about the technical aspects of the film. With all due respect to the highly talented director, this leads me to believe he is not fully aware or interested in the thematic significance of this film he directed.From one angle it appears The Manchurian Candidate, whether intentionally or not is a validation of McCarthy and the Hollywood blacklist. The Manchurian Candidate shows communism infiltrating the higher echelons of US society, all the way up to brainwashing a candidate for the US Presidency and his wife while at the same time making anti-communists look like a bunch of paranoid loons. However, one of the major characters in the film, Senator Johnny Iselin (James Gregory) is a cartoon-like version of Joseph McCarthy - a puppet of his wife Eleanor Iselin Is of whom is secretly a communist infiltrator (as revealed in a twist near the film's end) passing as a rabid anti-communist. Not the brightest tool in the shed, Senator Iselin keeps giving the media different numbers on how many communists are in the Defence Department and eventually settles on 57 - being the only number he can remember in a clever reference to Heinz tomato ketchup. At the end of the day, it appears The Manchurian Candidate is trying to have its cake and eat it too in taking down both communism and McCarthyism all at once.Well in the interest of advancing an agenda one is hamstrung by the fact that the communists in the film are using methods which are science fiction as brainwashing (mind control) does not actually exist in the real world. As Jon Mixon of Slate sums it up:There is no scientific proof that brainwashing (a theoretical form of mind control) exists or is even possible. The term itself is no longer used by mental health professionals (well, reputable professionals, that is), and no peer-reviewed experiments or studies have been done that demonstrate that it is even possible.Terrorist groups, cults, religions, and others seeking to influence people often look for those experiencing personal or professional setbacks and offer them sources of comfort, financial or moral support, or (at first) a nonjudgmental audience that will listen to their problems. As the person grows closer to the group, he becomes aware that to remain in the group he has to align his public statements, words, and actions with those of group. If he doesn't, then he is ostracized from the group or increased pressure is placed upon him to do so.Many people don't do this and leave the group entirely. Some remain with the group and mimic the necessary public displays, words, and actions but don't really believe the group's core message. A relatively small number of people do believe the message, and they make up the backbone of the organization. They aren't \"brainwashed\"-they simply chose to believe that the group meets most or all of their wants and needs.Protagonist Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) does not fall under that category but really is an individual who's mind has been put under the control of others, making The Manchurian Candidate is a borderline science fiction movie. That said, if brainwashing was real is there any reason to believe The Soviet Union of Mao's China would have not taken advantage of it? You can decide.It's Angela Lansbury who steals the show as quintessential highly controlling, domineering mother Eleanor Iselin, who has a tendency to call anyone she disagrees with a communist, even when they are a Republican (rings a bell in the modern-day culture war). The movie doesn't state if the Iselin's are Republicans or Democrats. The regular appearance of bust and portraits of Abraham Lincoln in their home as well as people (including Mr Iselin) dressed as Honest Abe at their party may hint to them being Republicans. However, there did exist a conservative, anti-communist wing of the Democratic Party back then so their party allegiance could go either way.Laurence Harvey is an actor with a real dignified aura to him (and in comparison to Sinatra, it's clear who the superior actor is). Raymond Shaw is real a snob and sour puss, \"not loveable\" as he memorably describes himself. He even almost turns into Alan Rickman in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves when becoming drunk and ranting about Christmas with his mid-Atlantic accent. Likewise, I feel the casting of Janet Leigh as Sinatra's love interest Eug\u00e9nie Rose Chaney to be a determent to the film, not out of any wrongdoing by the actress, but for a minor part which only has a small bearing on the plot, having a major actress cast in the part comes off a waste. Angela Lansbury and even the portly, comic-looking John McGiver play roles of far greater significance yet are billed lower - an unknown actress would have been better suited to the role. The Manchurian Candidate is also one of the earliest films to feature black actors in which their race has no bearing on the plot with the desegregated military present in the film and James Edwards in the small but memorable role of Cpl. Allen Melvin.Frankenheimer directed some of the most visually striking black & white films ever made with Lionel Lindon providing the cinematography for The Manchurian Candidate. Those dreams sequences are a master class in editing and set design (not to mention the unease that comes from having a gun directly pointed at the audience). Also observe how the murder of Mr Gaines (Lloyd Corrigan), is very similar to the murder of Eldon Tyrell in Blade Runner. The scenes from both movies take place at night in the victim's bedroom as they are lying in bed reading. Both are wearing a robe, have a chessboard, statues of animals and candles next to their beds and both are about to be murdered. I can only guess this scene really stood out for Ridley Scott.The Manchurian Candidate is fascinating if imperfect political thriller. One has to suspend their disbelief when watching the film, no more so than when Shaw just happens to be in a bar when the bartender in a conversation with patrons just happens to say the trigger phrase \"play a little solitaire\" - a remarkable coincidence to say the least. The film's climax is the blueprint for the political, conspiracy thriller in which a sniper plans to take out a candidate in a convention arena amongst all the electioneering apparel and giant posters and the candidates, and all this one year before the untimely demise of JFK.",

There is much more going on in the film. The techniques used by the Communist brainwashers subtly parallel the mind-control techniques used by Madison Avenue. The completely misunderstood scene between Janet Leigh and Sinatra is, in fact a parody of the banal language of everyday life. John McGivers character is, in fact , parody of Adlai Stevenson( Even though in the film, it is hinted that he is a liberal Republican.), just as John Ickes Iselin is Joe McCarthy with the social standing and wealth of William Fife Knowland, ( In fact, \"Big John Iselin\" bears a a startling physical resemblance to \"The Senator from Formosa\").

Angela Lansbury is only 2 years older than Lawrence Harvey, but yet is believable as his mom!! This tells you something about how great an actress Angela is. Janet Leigh is here too and does fine but her role is more limited than other films. Brainwashing is the subject matter here, and this conspiracy involves an intricate brain washing & set up over years to pull off. Trust me, if your patient & love drama this film fits perfectly. The queen of diamonds theme is just perfect. All the cast fits this film very well. Master filmmaker John Frankheimer is in fine form with this thriller. I have not seen the recent remake of this film but I can't believe it can be any better than this original. In fact, I bet this is the one to watch.It is so rare to see Sinatra fit so well in a cast as this one. His role here is just right to fit the film.

            "content": "One of Frank Sinatra's best efforts, in which he does not play the Chairman of the Board but a neurotic Army major who needs desperately to discover why he's having such terrifying dreams.He finds out that he and the half dozen other members of his unit were captured and brainwashed in Manchuria during the Korean War. The object of the brainwashing was to have a Medal of Honor awarded to Lawrence Harvey, a sergeant, for saving all but two members of the detail.Harvey was not only brainwashed but \"dry cleaned.\" Without knowing it, Harvey has been programmed to obey any command he's been given by communist agents in New York. Mainly, these involve murders and are designed to culminate in the assassination of a newly elected anti-communist president, which will then hand the reins of the nation over to Harvey's stupid blowhard of a step father -- or rather to Harvey's incestuous mother, Angela Lansbury, who is in charge of the entire enterprise.It may sound more complicated in this abstract than it is on screen. You're not likely to be confused.Condon's novel was a triumph of irony and at times extremely funny, if a little sloppily written. The movie isn't sloppy at all. It condenses the story just enough, so that we're never lost. And it captures some of the more amusing of Condon's scenes. Sinatra's nightmare, for instance. He and his squad are stuck in a New Jersey hotel having to listen to the meeting of a lady's garden club. The speaker, and all the club members, are high ranking communists from China, North Korea, and Russia, but in Sinatra's dream they're all well-dressed elderly suburban ladies talking about hydrangea. We see the nightmare of another member of the patrol, the African-American James Woods, now a civilian in Alaska. The dream is identical except all the members of the Lady's Garden Club are black.There isn't space enough to detail all the virtues of this film, which would include the melodic dissonance of David Amram's musical score. But I have to mention three stand-out performances. Sinatra has never been better than he is here. One doesn't think of FRANK SINATRA as capable of projecting despair but the scene in which he suffers an anxiety attack on a train, drops his cigarette into his drink, and has an elliptical conversation with Janet Leigh is classic, packed with the non sequiturs that Richard Condon was so fond of.James Gregory is Harvey's step father, a U. S. Senator, and here he enacts the kind of role for which he's singularly suited: the blowhard, braggart, drunken, cowardly self promoter whose pupils are always \"pinned at f11\" from all the drugs his wife is pumping into him. The role goes back to the comedies of Ancient Rome, the Miles Gloriosus. Bue Gregory was born to play it, as Thelma Ritter was born to play tough, plain-spoken maids. His character here has the rough edges smoothed off for the censors. In the book he was at an Army weather station in Greenland, starved for sex. \"It's not a question of poon-tang next year or poon-tang next week; it's a question of poon-tang NOW!\" He trudges miles across the frozen wasteland to get at an Eskimo girl and crawls back, hallucinating, screaming about foot odor. \"The feet! Oh, my God, those FEET!\" Of his evil wife, Lansbury, it can be said there were few better actresses of her generation. She's splendid here in a very dramatic and complex role, as she was exceptional in a black comedy like \"The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" on Broadway. Gregory is so spaced that he keeps confusing the number of card-carrying communists in the Senate, so Lansbury pins it down to an easy-to-remember 57, since Gregory is fond of Heinz ketchup, made in \"57 different varieties.\"I won't go on about this. It ends tragically but it's impossible not to be gripped by the story.",

            "content": "SpoilersJohn Frankenheimer's greatest film, \"The Manchurian Candidate\", is one of those rare political dramas that is still relevant after its release date-which, for this film, would be about 40 years ago. This film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, an arrogant and obnoxious army officer who is brainwashed, along with all of his platoon, by Communist higher-ups on an overseas mission. When he returns to the United States, it is revealed that he is the key to an intricate assassination plot that involves his monstrous mother and her odious husband (Raymond's father in law), a senator with deadly ambition. What these schemers never factored in was Bennet Marco, a member of Shaw's platoon who has managed to fight through the brainwashing and is forced to stop this insane plot that will put a Communist pawn in the White House. This is one of the films, along with \"Chinatown\", that defines the genre of \"thriller\". Suspenseful and shocking, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" plays off the era's anti-Communist hysteria, and although the Cold War is long over, it still stands as a powerful representation of a nation's fear of outsiders and the dread of the effect these outsiders would have on our moral, economic, and political beliefs. But more than that even it is a character study of two men who couldn't be more different but are thrust into this terrible situation by forces beyond their control. Raymond Shaw has been cruelly manipulated by the controls the Communists have over him-but his character is already tragically warped by his mother's hostility and coldness. Marco is an ordinary man who takes on a huge quest all by himself, and his final speech at the end of the film provides the perfect closing note. The three principle actors are at their best in this film. Sinatra showed that he could act in \"From Here to Eternity\", but here he is given the starring role and he shows how well he is able to carry a movie. He gives Marco layers beyond \"the hero\", he shows him as a man who was never close to Raymond Shaw-in fact, he doesn't even like the guy-but is willing to put that aside to help a tortured man and, in effect, save his country. Lawrence Harvey was the only person they could have cast as Shaw, a humorless dirge of a man without any real redeeming qualities. He is not a likable person, but that is because he has been so utterly damaged by his mother's \"care\" that he is not able to feel cheer. His only hope at happiness, Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), is destroyed by the control of the Koreans and the Queen of Diamonds (more on that later). The famous scene, where Sinatra destroys the \"links\" in Shaw's head using the Queen of Diamonds-the visual clue that jumpstarts the links-is an acting lesson in itself. Harvey, who doesn't say a word for most of the scene, is able to convey mountains of emotions through his face and eyes. When Marco asks him \"Who killed Jocelyn Jordan and her father?\", you see realization and utter pain and dismay in Shaw's eyes before Marco washes the horrible truth away by saying \"Forget that, forget all of that.\" It is truly a beautiful moment-or is it? Is Marco truly destroying the links, or is he just re-brainwashing the links out of Shaw's head? This is a question that rarely is asked when the film in discussed, but in it lies the true center of the movie. Angela Lansbury is magnificent as Mrs. Iselin, who is at heart a psychotic control freak and is using her son to become the ultimate controller-the person who runs the most powerful nation in the world. Lansbury, who we all know from \"Murder, She Wrote\", performs brilliantly as one of the greatest villains of all time. But, she too is not a one-dimensional character. In a short but essential speech, Mrs. Iselin reveals that she never knew her son would be the one who was brainwashed. Lansbury delivers the most heartbreaking line in the film-\"in a world full of killers they picked you\"-which reveals that she is, in fact, capable of human connection and feeling. That she actually did love her son is a fact that makes the ending even more shocking and tragic. A film with multiple brilliant ideas, images, and characters, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" will remain an essential film-a political parable with a human heart and conscience.",

            "content": "Every time you read something about this film, you're told that it was shelved immediately after JFK's assassination, and was not seen again until a late 1980's (or was it the early '90s?) re-release. That simply is not true. I vividly remember around age 8 -- i.e. circa 1970 or so -- seeing the film on TV, or at least some of it. After Bobby Lembeck was shot, I pleaded with my mother to change the channel, and so she did and we watched something less scary to an 8-year old, like Petticoat Junction or whatever. I never forgot that scene, although I did not remember the name of the movie. Fast forward about 20 years, my boyfriend and I had gone to see the movie in downtown Phila., and THERE WAS THAT SCENE AGAIN. I couldn't believe it.In my opinion, this is one of the 100 or so best films ever made. John Frankenheimer was one of the two or three best directors working in the 1960's. They could not have chosen a better Raymond than Laurence Harvey -- if you read the original novel, you could well assume that the character is based on Laurence Harvey, who was known to be rather cold and condescending in real life. Sinatra does his best work here, Angela Lansbury is freaking brilliant, and Laurence Harvey is really should have received some sort of acting nomination -- while the character is cold-hearted prick on the surface, he also shows you flashes of the pain, and later horror, beneath. The camera work is awesome -- so many images here that will imprint on your brain forever. The script pulls no punches (L. B. Mayer, who venerated the American mother, must have been spinning in his grave) and is far more sophisticated than is common in American films of any era. This is one of those very rare movies that do not appear dated in any way, although it might have somewhat if shot in color. In the current political climate, it is VERY timely, and worth a look on that basis.The Manchurian Candidate is definitely disturbing -- intentionally so, but if you want to see something intelligent and provocative, and you've already seen American Beauty five times, you should really check this out. And if you're REALLY into disturbing, intelligent and provocative, have a look at the Frankenheimer film released four years after this one, Seconds.",

Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow \"the Right\" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the \"real Communists\". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The \"real Communists\" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President?

Raymond Shaw (Harvey) is not a person you would like. Actually the Vietnam veteran and son of the conservative Senator John Iselin (Gregory) should be in bad memory for his fellow war comrads as a sulky, self-opinionated character. That's why it seems quite odd that they praise Shaw after they have returned home. Did he planted the units out of adverse territories in a solo run? Captain Bennett Marco (Sinatra) starts to doubt the exploit. In his nightmares he sees that the troops were kidnapped and brainwashed by the enemy, while war hero Shaw killed two of his own men under hypnosis. Soon, Marco finds out that Shaw is converted into a will-less, deadly instrument without knowing of the actions of his alter ego.The fact that the film disappeared in the sinkings after its release for years and years, speaks an obvious language. Too painful have been the murders of the Kennedy brothers, Luther King Jr., Malcolm X; too pinching have been the depressing prophecies of The Manchurian Candidate, its dispute over the matter of political assassination.It is a grim, daunting film which imparts an irritating coerciveness of its happening on the screen with perfectly arranged and meticulously constructed black and white shots. The architecture of the images seems to be precisely sophisticated: In one scene, Frankenheimer puts a monitor in the foreground to cross various perspectives which are mutually commenting, contradicting and completing - as if the events on the screen are following a secret dramaturgy, only visible for the viewer. The protagonists have to poise in grillingly incertitude. Anyway, cameras and monitors seem to be everywhere. Even the most private things - like Shaws incestuous love-hate relationship to his evil mother (Lansbury with her greatest performance of her career) - appears to become an affair with public significance. In a threatened world you can be with your nation or against it - the problem is, you never know who is on which side.With its imagery full of symbolic references - like the playing cards that even adopt human shape towards the end - the film unfolds an iconographic program with a thoroughly fatalistic message: The viewer is asked to perceive analogies (i.e. between the painting of President Lincoln which gets into the shape of the drunken Senator). Every human being, as Frankenheimer seems to assume, is not more than a will-less playing card, his political leaders not more than externally controlled decals of ideologies without making any sense. Considering that the film was made in 1962, it still and undoubtedly holds an explosive issue for today's controversial political world.",

            "content": "This is one of the great political drama and suspense films of the 60s, a film that essentially addresses the subversive communist threat on American soil, a topic that was at the top of American concerns at the time. In fact, the film was even withdrawn from circulation after the assassination of President Kennedy, which shows us how plausible it could be, for the people, the idea that the communists had killed the president. Of course, such a film was never authorized on Soviet soil, and it was only shown in Russia after 1991.The script is based on how a platoon of American soldiers was captured by communist forces during the Korean War. This platoon comprised Major Ben Marco and Sergeant Raymond Shaw, among other soldiers. After the war, Shaw is decorated as a hero for allegedly saving his comrades. However, Marco and other survivors are haunted by a recurring nightmare, where they see Shaw, under hypnosis, killing captured American soldiers, and several of his companions being brainwashed. Given these facts, Marco begins to suspect that something really dark has happened in Korea and Shaw is not as innocent as he may seem.The best thing about this movie is, really, its complex and appealing plot, and all the mystery that goes around involving what happened to the soldiers. Topics such as hypnosis, behavioral control, subversive warfare, paranoia and the corruption of power are discussed. Expertly directed by John Frankenheimer, the film is good in many ways, though not perfect. For example, I felt the pacing is uneven, being too slow in its first half...in fact, the first half of the movie is grueling, with an exaggeration in the introductory effort that gets us bored before things really heat up and get interesting. I think the movie would have gained with a cut of about thirty minutes on the editing table. The dialogue isn't particularly well written either, and there are a lot of scenes where I feel like the movie is just wasting our time. Romantic subplots aren't particularly happy either.The great singer and actor Frank Sinatra confidently holds one of the main roles in the film, and it's really fascinating to see him here, as most people only know him from his songs. This is, by the way, his great contribution to the seventh art, being considered his most important and memorable acting work. Laurence Harvey brought Shaw to life in an intelligent and charismatic way. The film also gives us the impeccable Angela Lansbury, in an exceptional dramatic interpretation of an excessively controlling and rude mother.Technically, the film has some great value points, especially when it comes to cinematography, which seeks to express the latent paranoia in some characters with tighter shooting angles and framing and well-defined close-ups that give different moments in the film a feeling claustrophobic. The sets and costumes also seem to be fine, and the soundtrack is tolerable.",

But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed.The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns.Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.",

            "content": "'The Manchurian Candidate' came out in 1962, and was one of the most provocative and thought-provoking films mainstream Hollywood had produced up to that point. Before addressing the film itself, a few words about its co-star, Laurence Harvey. Harvey became a star at an awkward time in cinema history, the late fifties and early sixties, when so much of society and entertainment were in transition. He might be considered the last of a breed: the dashing leading man who was a mainstay in films of the thirties and forties but was rapidly becoming out-of-date. With his British accent (he was actually born in Lithuania) and matin\u00e9e-idol good looks, Laurence Harvey was ever the suave, debonair, well-spoken man of taste, equally adept at portraying a tragic figure or a heartless heel, and he played each type on several occasions. When he did play a hero, he did so with \u00e9lan, never more so than in 'The Alamo,' where he was cast to perfection as Colonel William Travis. Without a doubt the best part of that film, Harvey's interpretation of Travis, with all the gallantry, conceit, and courage that it entailed, puts to shame the later one by Patrick Wilson. Harvey starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor in her Oscar-winning 'Butterfield 8,' and it is a testament to his abilities that he maintained his dignity even while spouting some of the worst dialogue imaginable. His career declined in the late sixties; one of his last performances was on an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery entitled 'The Caterpillar,' a memorably creepy tale. He died all too young at the age of 45. And 'The Manchurian Candidate' was certainly a high point in his career, as it was for the rest of its stars; Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury.The plot concerns an American soldier, Raymond Shaw (Harvey), who is captured during the Korean War and programmed via brainwashing to become an assassin. The other members of his platoon are brainwashed as well, but only to forget what happened, their memories replaced with one of Shaw bravely rescuing them singlehandedly, which leads to Shaw becoming a Medal of Honor winner and national hero. His mother (Angela Lansbury) is married to a U.S. Senator whom she controls completely, just as she has always manipulated Raymond's life. Eventually, we learn that she is in league with Shaw's communist controllers, and the plan is for Shaw to assassinate a presidential nominee, thus propelling her husband to the top spot and ultimately the presidency itself. The film is audacious in suggesting that it is a right wing political operative who collaborates with the Chinese and Russian communists, though Angela Lansbury's character almost certainly uses that political affiliation precisely because it provides the perfect cover. She is a pure monster, and Lansbury's smooth, reasonable manner makes her deviousness even creepier. Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, Shaw's commanding officer in Korea and the one who eventually unravels the mystery. It's easy to forget that Sinatra could be a very fine actor on occasion, and this is surely the best movie he ever appeared in. He underplays the role effectively, and much of his time on screen is spent listening to or reacting to other characters. Janet Leigh's character Rosie is somewhat mysterious; she and Marco get married (after what seems about a half-hour courtship) and they have a couple of very strange conversations that critics to this day are at odds to explain; one can't help wonder what the purpose of Rosie's character really is. But it is Laurence Harvey who is the focal point of the film and his character is the glue that holds the disparate elements together. I mentioned the tragic characters Harvey became known for portraying, and there certainly was none more tragic than Raymond Shaw. There is an irony in that he was a man who was tortured inside before he was ever brainwashed; by the end of the film, he has been run through the ringer so many times, by so many different people, he is all but hollowed out. And yet from somewhere deep within himself, Shaw finds just enough strength of purpose left to do the right thing; for once in his life, to set a great wrong right, by killing the corrupt senator instead of the nominee, and his mother. Then he puts on his Medal of Honor and kills himself. Marco remembers him and eulogizes him as, \"poor friendless, friendless Raymond.\"",

            "content": "The Manchurian Candidate is a film that I knew nothing about going into. I would highly recommend that anyone else do the same, as I think it really enhances your enjoyment of the film.The movie starts with an American platoon in the Korean War being captured and taken away. The soldiers then return home and mysteriously don't remember much of anything except that Raymond Shaw had heroically saved all of their lives. Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor for his supposed brave actions. The plot picks up when we learn of the strange recurring nightmares that Bennett Marco, one of the members of Shaw's platoon, has been having. In this dream, Shaw kills two members of his own platoon as a demonstration in front of an audience of old ladies. Marco's thoughts are dismissed by Army Intelligence, who think he's just going crazy. However, the movie gets going once Marco learns that another member of the platoon has been having the exact same nightmares as him, and now knows for certain something is wrong.The rest of the film mostly follows Marco as he investigates what has been going on with Shaw. The more he learns, the worse the situation seems to get. Director John Frankenheimer does an excellent job of not revealing too much about what's really going on, and we slowly find out bits and pieces as the film progresses. There isn't much that happens throughout the film that isn't necessary to the plot, which is a relief, as an overly long film of this nature would be exhausting. At a 126 minute run time, just over 2 hours, it's almost a perfect length for the story it was telling. The only thing that could maybe have been removed was Marco's love interest, Eugenie Rose. I cannot recall any real significance that she contributed to the plot; if anything, she significantly slowed things down in a way that almost hurt the film. Other than the one completely unnecessary character, though, I feel that the movie was perfectly executed, and the story told in a very effective way.Due to the subject matter of this film, it can often be quite disturbing. This movie is ultimately about the brainwashing of soldiers. It succeeds in showing the fragility of the human mind in a way that really makes the viewer think. It also has some political intrigue, and raises some questions that may have been ahead of its time. Senator John Iselin is an example of how easy it is to rise in the political world by simply attacking your competitors and playing to the fears of the general public, whether or not what is being said is actually true. There was, of course, no truth to anything he was saying, but the media ate it up and used it as headlines everywhere, swaying public opinion about certain people or groups. There are many thought-provoking themes surrounding this throughout the movie, many being still relevant today.The film does have a few pacing issues. Right around the time Marco meets Eugenie Rose, the pace drastically slows down. It is overall a slower movie, but at that point, it just slows to a crawl. There were about 15 minutes or so where I could have fallen asleep, and that is something that rarely happens with me. I just feel that the whole character of Eugenie Rose was so pointless to the overall film, and could have easily been taken out with no real consequences. Other than this part, though, the slow pace did work quite well.The black-and-white visuals took very little away from the film; if anything, it felt more charming and fit the mood of the movie much better than color might have. It was quite refreshing to watch, especially because of how heavily visual effects are relied upon today. This film had no real CGI, no flashy explosions, just an intriguing story that kept your attention almost the whole way through. This kind of quality storytelling is so much more uncommon today.As for the cast, the acting was excellent in this film. Frank Sinatra in the lead role as Bennett Marco was very enjoyable to watch. Laurence Harvey plays both sides of Raymond Shaw well, being fittingly creepy as the killer. Janet Leigh gives a good performance, but, as I mentioned before, she was quite underused and had no real purpose in the film. Angela Lansbury gives an incredible performance here as Raymond's mother, as she completely transforms into her manipulative, power-hungry character. Without her perfect portrayal of this complicated and very important character, the film could have quite easily fallen apart. Her performance is easily the best and most believable of the entire cast.The Manchurian Candidate is overall a great film. It's a bit slow for my personal taste, but I can appreciate the great storytelling and excellent acting, among other things, that make this movie the timeless classic that it is.",

Raymond Shaw believability and considering the depth and emotional range of his character that is truly an achievement. I cannot help but see Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Iselin) and John McGiver (Sen. Thomas Jordan), who hate one another in this movie, in their more familiar Disney roles ... but in retrospect I am not sure they ever played in another movie together? Both play their parts well in this flick about brainwashing and the evils of communism in the fifties and sixties. At any rate The (1962 Version) Manchurian Candidate is full of people conquering their inserted demons through friendships and strong wills. It will be very difficult for the remake to match the original's groundbreaking success. A real surprise ending awaits those who watch. Highly recommended.",

Indeed, his 1962 film, The Manchurian Candidate, endures as one of the more unique and interesting American films of its period.The film follows a group of soldiers who've recently been released from the Korean War effort. While Major Marco (Frank Sinatra) suffers from strange reoccurring dreams, his friend Robert Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is even more disturbed as he embarks on a sort of unconscious political killing spree. When Marco learns that Shaw is at the center of a right wing-communist brainwashing conspiracy culminating with the assassination of the presidential incumbent, Marco ultimately realizes he must stop his fellow former soldier before it's too late. The film is also complimented by performances by Janet Leigh, James Gregory and Angela Lansbury.With its use of everything from montage to Cinema Verite-style filming, Candidate was one of the most stylistically bold American films this side of Citizen Kane. Additionally, the film serves as a worthy time capsule of the cold war paranoia that existed during the Kennedy administration (also proving eerily prescient with Kennedy's later assassination in November 1963). With a recent Criterion re-release and the turbulence of today's political situation in the US, now's as apt a time as ever to revisit this seminal classic of American cinema.",

The film's pessimistic view of American politics and unexpected satire of the presidential campaign trail were years ahead of their time, and the baroque styling (stark lighting, oblique camera angles) still makes it look ridiculously modern. The plot is little more than pulp fiction, made legitimate by some far reaching implications about political manipulation and the self-destructive danger of unchecked ideology. And the strange cast of characters (including a brainwashed Korean War veteran transformed into the perfect assassin, his ruthless, ambitious mother, and her right-wing nincompoop candidate husband) keeps it always unpredictable, which of course is the aim of any true thriller.",

Is it shell shock? Is it a premonition? Larry is also struggling with his return to civilization, since his overbearing mother Angela Lansbury is a very powerful force in the political realm.If the title or plot sounds familiar to you, Hollywood remade The Manchurian Candidate in 2004, with Denzel Washington, Liev Shrieber, and Meryl Streep as the three leads, and updated to the Iraq War. The remake was also a great film, although perhaps not quite as chilling during the time of its release, since political corruption films were a new genre in the 60s. And the plot is so complex and confusing, even if you've seen one version, chances are you can watch the other without being able to guess or untangle the twists and turns. I have a soft spot in my heart for Frank Sinatra, so I'd recommend watching the original first, but Meryl Streep is frightening in her Hillary Clinton-esque portrayal in the remake, so if you want to watch that version first, that's fine.In addition to the tension-filled plot and scary setting of American politics, the acting in The Manchurian Candidate is fantastic. Both Frankie and Larry give wonderful performances, but only Angela Lansbury was honored with a nomination by the Academy in 1962. In a very sad scene, Larry buries his head in his hands and cries. \"Some people are lovable and others are not. I am not lovable.\" He made a career out of playing heartless cads, so when you see him in this different type of role - a victim - it breaks your heart. He never did play someone lovable, and it makes you wonder what kind of career he would have had if given a second chance.If you haven't yet seen it, rent at least one of the versions. It really is a classic. It's very upsetting and extremely dark, especially when you consider the time period and the very recent demise of the Production Code. And when you think about it, it barely squeaked by in time. Had the film sat on the shelf for a year, it wouldn't have been released at all.",

Maybe its' the rather clich\u00e9d dialogue, the trademark camera zooms or the unimaginative editing. Whatever I love about them, they never fail to give me a bit of B-movie fun. However, on the downside they rarely feel real. Even when dealing with working class characters, the stories are always imbued with a sense of haughtiness, of moral righteousness. The villains always get their just desserts, and of course the hero runs off with the girl into the sunset.But the Manchurian Candidate, the landmark political thriller is one of the most shocking, emotional and intelligent films I've seen in a long time. I don't know how it feels so real, but it does. The camera work is pretty by the numbers, and some of the supporting cast overact but there's just something that marks it out from the other rather more artificial films of the same time period.And for a political thriller it sure packs a punch. I've never been a fan of the action/adventure genre, but I love this film. The emotional core is Lawerence Harvey's exceptional performance as Raymond Shaw, a political chess-piece exploited by powers he can't control. Thanks to the wonderful screenplay we get a real insight into his hopes and dreams and as a result, Raymond is never a staple hero or a villain. He's a real human being, and this is what makes the film so exceptional.On top of that the movie has a very unhappy ending. At the time of course this was almost unheard of. Films had to end with the bad guys getting what they deserve, not with heroes having their lives ripped to shreds. I don't want to ruin the film's denouement, but trust me, it's anything but upbeat.",

            "content": "`The Manchurian Candidate' is the best political thriller\u0085ever.  Really, nothing before or since can really match up to the excitement, intrigue and verve of this film.  All elements; the acting, the direction, the script, it's all perfect.  The film itself is near perfect.The plot starts with Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) and a group of soldiers - including Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) - in the middle of a trek through Korea when their guide Chunjin (Henry Silva) betrays them and they are captured.  Flash forward a few years and we have Shaw accepting the medal of honor for valiantly rescuing the rest of the group from their pickle (all but two casualties).  Marco recommended it, but he secretly believes that not all is as it seems, and he doesn't quite trust Raymond Shaw.  I wont go any further, all I'll say is that it involves communism and Shaw's extremely right-wing mother Eleanor (Angela Lansbury) and her vice presidential candidate husband (James Gregory).The way director John Frankenheimer and screen writer John Axelrod create intrigue and suspense is delicious.  A very strange dream sequence that Marco has, the surprise reappearance of Chunjin, the strange fixation on the game solitaire.  We're practically drawn to the screen as more and more is revealed.The acting is terrific.  Frank Sinatra has a sort of style that makes him more likable and less freakily neurotic than your usual run of the mill conspiracy theorist.  Harvey's performance - basically a leading role - is one of the best in the movie, if not the best.  He is a pessimistic, cynical man who loathes himself almost as much as he loathes his domineering mother. His performance reaches a peak when he tells Sinatra about a time when he was once `lovable', a summer when he fell in love with the daughter of a rival senator to his mother.  His mother, predictably, ended the relationship, causing Harvey to give up on himself.  But he's not completely hopeless, and he tries to do the right thing and stand up to his mother at one point, a goal ending tragically.If Harvey's performance isn't the best than Lansbury's definitely is.  She is a horrifying mother, probably the scariest mother in movie history.  Her manipulations and mind games on her poor son (and others) are the harshest I've ever seen in a movie.  She has absolutely no empathy for her son, he is just a tool for her to use in her schemes and agendas.  When she expresses sorrow and guilt in a late scene we begin to sympathize with her, but she tears it all down with a disturbing new development that completes the whole story arch with Harvey and Lansbury: at this point we understand completely all the reasons he     s his mother.It has some delightfully cool touches too.  The solitaire aspect is awesomely delivered.  We even have a fast, energetic martial arts match between Marco and Chunjin.  It's things like this that make the movie both intriguing and fun.By the ending there has been a resolution, but we think that maybe, just maybe, there is still an evil lurking under the surface.  It is never verified, but I'd like to think that there is something still afoot, and not much has been resolved.  If you desperately want a happy ending, think otherwise, you have a choice, thanks to Axelrod.A landmark in thrillers, copied by many, matched by none, 9/10.",

As it is a costume party, Senator Iselin dresses as Abe Lincoln, (no caricature could be further from the truth, it turns out).There are also some very disturbing scenes where Sinatra has flashbacks during the brainwashing sequence, and Henry Silva, as Chunyin, is appropriately menacing and sinister. The servicemen from the war have all been brainwashed, in some form or other, and it remains a mystery as to why until the end of the film.This film is timely and haunting.

It's very good, especially for its age. That's about all I have to say about it, but IMDB has a minimum character limit. In summary, this is a good film that you should watch, and I should probably think of more things to say about a film before I post another review on this website. Thank you very much for reading this needlessly dragged out review that i have to keep dragging out because the character limit is very annoying, so annoying, in fact, that i have to keep drawing this review out until it is at the minimum limit, therefore the Manchurian Candidate is a very good movie that you should watch, even though it is quite old, it holds up remarkably well.",

Mrs. Shaw was a brilliantly manipulative complex character using her sex appeal and cunning brain to move events characters around like a game of chess.The haunting music sets the scenes adding to the ominous feeling that a wave is about to strike. There were Oscar worthy performances from Frank Sinatra, Janet Lee and John mcgiver that made this into a master piece that needs to be cherished for all time.However after the assassination of JFK many viewers have tried to compare the film as being an omen of the future and was banned from television for many years because of this. Like Oliver Stone's JFK I don't see it and will leave the speculation for the conspiracy theorists.The Manchurian candidate will change your views about politics forever and makes you want to take a closer look on policies coming from the government ever since 9/11. Who you boys for really matters and to know the candidate which was mocked during the film as senator Shaw spoke gibberish to an applauding audience.10/10",

Now, it seems a funny overblown, too long in its running time, too boring, too cardboard cutout, too clich\u00e9d and too baloney. Frank Sinatra? No, he is not good here, he, like almost all the other characters, overplays hugely and thus creates a comical effects, which borders both on being utterly silly and hilarious. This is a mere propaganda film, made in the heat of Joe McCarthy's frenzy and it suffers from this fetid stigma. Moreover, its possible plausible merits are washed away by protruding slow pacing and awful, almost unreal dialogues that land in the realm of pure parody. IN the 50 and 60's there are far better films than this, and the recent awfully dismal remake shows that. When the basic material is poor the end result will limp along as well.",

I picked it up last night on the sole basis of it being a cultural iconic movie - one which everyone has seen and is universally acclaimed as great. I had no familiarity with the plot other than the description on the DVD box, but I wanted a sure fire movie that I wasn't going to regret renting.Well I can't say I regret renting it, but is this movie hokey or what?*** Spoilers below ? ***The dream sequence was unquestionably great. I loved it and was entirely willing to suspend my disbelief to allow the movie to tell it's story.\nWhere it started to fall apart for me is when Sinatra is ordered to take sick leave. Give me a break with the train scene and Janet Leigh. Here we see a sweaty, vacant eyed, spastic middle-aged man, who can't even light a cigarette in front of a pretty girl. Now I never tried that ploy before, but it apparently worked for Janet because she can't wait to follow Franky out of the car and give him her home address, telephone number and where she works. Maybe guys who sweat, shake and talk without looking you in the eye once during the conversation appeal to some women, but I doubt that the technique would work well today.Equally as inane as the train scene is cab scene after the police station pickup. Janet explains to Sinatra that as soon as she got home after meeting sweaty Frank, the first thing she did was to tell her Fiance that their engagement was over. The girl was obviously smitten.Almost as unbelievable is the snakebite sequence where Lesley Parrish fortunately has brought along a supply of razor blades during her bike ride, so as to come to the aid of Harvey after his incident. I have no problem however with her removing her blouse to fashion an improvised tourniquet.One of my favorite parts of the movie was what must have been one of the first movie Kung-Fu action scenes ever filmed, when Frank takes on the yellow peril with oriental fighting techniques he obviously picked up in Korea.Aside from a few highlights in the movie: the dream sequence, blouse removal and kung-fu segments, I seldom found myself 'riveted to my seat'. It was pretty obvious to me WHO Harvey was going to kill and when - well ahead of the actual killings. Trite and hokey - yes. Suspenseful? Nah.*** Spoilers over ***I can't say this was a terrible movie, but for me it sure wasn't a great one. It made me think of a Sinatra version of an Elvis movie - where the star vehicle is more important than any significant plot or character development.",

            "content": "Few things are as disappointing as watching a \"classic\" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone.The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fianc\u00e9e to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained.Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong.Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that \"shocking\" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.",

Thrilling and chilling film deals with Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra , in 2004 rendition played by Denzel Washington) , an intelligence officer in the U. S. Army . He served valiantly as a captain in the Korea war and his Sergeant , Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey , subsequently performed by Liev Schreiver) , even won the Medal of Honor. Marco has a major problem however, he has a recurring nightmare, one where two members of his squad are killed by Shaw. This Raymond Shaw is an insufferable man, who came back from the Korean War awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor . Shaw for his part eventually leaves the Army to start a job in New York City as the confidential assistant to well-respected political journalist Holborn Gaines (Lloyd Corrigan) and he has established himself well , despite the misgivings of his domineering mother , Mrs. Eleanor Shaw (Angela Lansbury , later acted by Meryl Streep). Along the way, Ben Marco has been having nightmares that lead him to believe that the circumstances that led to Raymond getting the medal are not true . However, Marco learns that another soldier (James Edwards , subsequently performed by Jeffrey Wright) from the platoon , has had the same nightmare .While his superiors don't think he knows what he is talking about, he is sent on leave . When he goes to see Raymond, he is arrested ,he aware that also has the same dream. When the officers learn of this they decide to give him a chance to find out what's going on . Some very powerful people appear desperate to stop him from finding out. Ben Marco have to face off an enemy with even more sinister designs .Everything is under control.....is anyone seeing the truth?. In this election everything is under control !. When you've seen it all, you'll swear there's never been anything like it! Once unbelievable. Now unthinkable. The chilling classic returns. If you come in five minutes after this picture begins, you won't know what it's all about! When you've seen it all, you'll swear there's never been anything like it!Bold political thriller about the mind control of the prisoners Americans in Korea War dealing with experiments applied to soldiers to modify behavior patterns. The picture packs thrills , suspense , emotion , intrigue , plot twists and is quite entertaining. The film raises a disturbing theory well performed and slickly developed and it was re-released theatrically in 1987 .Top-notch acting from main cast as Frank Sinatra who gives a superbly controlled interpretation as a war veteran who begins to believe that the honored heroics of a former member of his squad may be the product of brainwashing . Frank Sinatra that only a year later surprised with the death of President Kennedy , directed John Frankenheimer a producer for its realization, appeared excited Frank Sinatra with a script of \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" which could have a role as an officer of the bunch of prisoners Americans, Sinatra was formed as co-producer and introduced the idea before the president of \"United Artists\". And Laurence Harvey is pretty good as an unwitting assassin for an international Communist conspiracy.Furthermore , a terrific support cast , such as : Janet Leigh, Henry Silva , James Gregory, Leslie Parrish , John McGiver, Khigh Dhiegh , James Edwards , Albert Paulsen , Barry Kelley and special mention for Angela Lansbury as mean mother who executes nasty machinations to promote her son's career , she has some moments of real brilliance . With an excellent script by George Axelrod and director Frankenheimer himself , based on a novel by Richard Condon and it has a splendid narrative rhythm. The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Frankenheimer . Rating : 7.5/10. Better than average. The movie leaves you feeling of having a good cinema.",

            "content": "War is hell, but sometimes the horror doesn't start until you come back home. The psychological horrors of war is the setup to the 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate. A platoon of Korean veterans come home after being being detained in China, seemingly under the heroics of Staff Sergent Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). The circumstances that surrounded the entire affair seem askew, and takes on a greater strangeness when everyone in the platoon has nightmares about a New Jersey Botany club becoming a brainwashing session lead by Communist Chinese. Captain Bennett Marco, played by Frank Sinatra in a surprising convincing role, was in the platoon, had the same nightmares, and is leading the investigation into the matter. What propels the movie, however, is the Cold War paranoia that is exploited by those who turn out to be the masterminds of the plot. The movie also features Angela Lansbury as Shaw's overbearing mother who remarried to a Republican Senator who has Presidential aspirations, Senator John Iselin, played in McCarthyian brilliance by James Gregory. One of the funniest lines of the movie is banter between Senator Iselin and a reporter over the number of Communist supporters there were in the Department of Defence. There are clues throughout the movie to the conclusion, but the ending is so well done, it is still a surprise, and an exercise in suspense. The final scenes occur at the Republican Convention at the old Madison Square Garden, and director John Frankenheimer finds a way to portray the chaos of the convention versus the impending danger that is posed by a mindless zombie, under the control of brain washers wanting to take over the US government. The film also features Janet Leigh, after her untimely death in the shower at the Bates Motel, as Sinatra's lover interest, but if you listen to her dialog closely, questions arise over her role in the entire movie. This movie not only plays as a Cold War paranoia film, but also a political thriller, with as much behind-the-scenes politicking as there are sinister plots.",

Many viewers of today with their short attention spans will probably not fully understand it and that is because this movie respects the audience's intelligence as great movies should. But you don't need to look too deeply into this movie to see who the good guys are and the bad guys to enjoy it thanks to John Frankenheimer, a great action director, for making the visual cues of the movie so easy to follow. Plot: a patrol during the Korean War is captured by the Korean communists and brainwashed to take over the American Presidency by one of them, who happens to be the Vice President candidate's son, assassinating the other candidate to ensure they win the election. And although, the ball busting wife of the vice president made the deal to happen to try to have communism take over, she did not know they were going to use her son to be the assassinator, even though he is probably the best shot of the squad. Meanwhile, the other men in the patrol each of the same recurring dream nightly about the three days they were brainwashed, and that is because men were murdered during the brainwashing to prove it worked. Frank Sinatra plays the smarter of the patrol (apparently, the brainwashing doesn't go deep enough for some) and gets an investigation going with the help of another smart member who identify the same photos of a Korean Diplomat that applied the brainwashing. This leads the saving of the candidate but many others are in danger of the assassin and aren't so lucky.

It's quite modern with its approach and story and definitely a movie that seemed to be decades ahead of its time.It's really a movie that gets made by its story. It by no means is an exciting movie action-wise, simply because there is more talking and set-up in this movie than anything else really but the movie itself manages to still become exciting nevertheless, all due to its well written and original story. It features lots of classic thriller themes in it and of course also takes advantage of the cold war scare that was very much alive among the people, during the '60's. It plays on some of the fears and paranoia aspects of that period. The actual story itself is actually being far from likely but yet it works out all within the movie, due to the way it all gets told by director John Frankenheimer and its wonderful cast.The movie also has plenty of surprises in it and chooses to tell its story slowly and reveal not too much about its main plot from the start on already but instead do so in a more slow but steady way. Step by step the movie its mystery gets revealed but not without adding in plenty of surprising twists as well, as well as its unforgettable awesome ending.It's a very serious movie, which actually does make the movie a realistic one, which in return enhances the movie its tension and other thriller aspects. In lots of ways this movie is being very similar, in its style and set-up, to political thrillers being made this present day.Frank Sinatra never was a person that impressed as an actor, not even with his Oscar winning performance for \"From Here to Eternity\" but I must say that he was being simply great within this movie. He's not being a typical or classic hero within this movie and he's actually being a very humane character, so also with all of its flaws. Laurence Harvey is also great and he plays the true main character of this movie, in my opinion. Also really fun to see Angela Lansbury already playing a mother character in this movie. A role she could still play just as well and convincingly now, almost 50 years later. Was this woman ever young?But I really don't regard this movie a a perfect one. The story gets to confusing for that at times and there are also lots of moments in the movie that just coma across as pointless and completely redundant, such as the entire Janet Leigh character. Seems that the movie had too much story to handle and to cram in, which might very well be the case, since this movie got based on a novel. Still a special thriller after all these years, due to how 'modern' and effective it is with its story and overall approach.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Can this really be a thriller?  I'd always thought that thrillers might be great entertainment but couldn't be great movies, yet this one led me to alter my opinion.  The only other ones I can call to mind are the very best Hitchcocks like Vertigo.If you're not American, you might at first imagine that a lot of the movie would be lost on you (Korean war, McCarthy references, Abraham Lincoln). Well I didn't particularly know a great deal about any of these, but actually it doesn't at all detract from enjoying and appreciating the film. If anything it heightens the paranoia.  If you don't know too much about the background, you can imagine anything could happen.Wonderfully atmospheric - I can't think of another movie that induces paranoiac feeling in the audience as well.  This comes to a head when Marco meets Rosie on the train - and I think that is the reason why Janet Leigh's character was included.  It's so well handled.  Their first comments could be flirtatious chat-up lines or they could be passwords to recognise each other.  Even when Rosie says something not quite right, and Marco tells her: you should have said..., we are not sure whether this means she is an opposing agent who knew only part of the intro routine.A lot of people commented on the wonderful techniques that compare with the very best, especially the swirling camera-work, and the uniformly excellent acting.  Few people mentioned the score, which (in my humble opinion), is one of the best of all time, beautiful but somehow heightening the tension. It tends to appear just before you are going to become even more paranoiac and is part of the movie's subtle conditioning I think.All in all this is a most excellent movie and very enjoyable too.  It was placed around position 60 in the American Film Institute top 100, but personally I would have put it about 30 higher.",

It's a most interesting movie an it was a very original too back in the early 60's (in my opinion it still is).John Frankenheimer achieves a perfect political thriller full of intrigue and tension all along with moments of real impact. The initial sequences when the captured American soldiers are in a sort of fine ladies meeting that forth and back turns into a military auditorium are most creative; so are the cold blooded murders scenes and the final ones at the candidate's convention.Frank Sinatra was indeed a very talented man; a great singer indeed but also a first rate actor. He renders here a most accurate performance as the officer that discovers that something is very wrong. Though I never thought much about Laurence Harvey as an actor, he is correct here as the tortured war hero that is being used by his own mother. Janet Leigh is very good also as Sinatra's romantic interest (away from her usual costume and adventure damsel's roles of the 50's) and so are John McGiver and James Gregory. But in my opinion it is Angela Lansbury who steals the show with her remarkable performance as Harvey's dominating and mean mother; she's perfect all the way.The sequence of the fight between Sinatra and Henry Silva is a highlight too and even more if you notice they both use a sort of oriental martial arts style very appropriate for military trained men as both are (I think this must have been one of the first times in movies where martial arts appeared in a man against man fight).\"The Manchurian Candidate\" stands as a classic in its kind that certainly didn't need a remake as the recent one with Meryl Sreep and Denzel Washington, a definitely inferior product that perhaps would have come out as an acceptable picture if the original didn't exist. But it does exist and there's no possible comparison.",

There is some kind of muddled and non-committal comment about McCarthyism in here but the film shies away from any critical analysis of the era.The love interest is established in the most unconvincing manner when Janet Leigh enters the film. She seems to serve no other purpose than to reinforce Sinatra's heterosexuality and to add a little femininity to the rest of the macho lunkhead proceedings.As far as the plot is concerned all the main characters have the necessary information required to prevent the weak and predictable ending with about 20 minutes to go further robbing the proceedings of any dramatic tension or logic.Among other things a truly good film ( or even an average one ) must have some kind of internal logic, sympathetic characters, a consistent plot and some kind of internal dynamic.This film seems to continue to amass plaudits despite the fact that many of its apologists acknowledge themselves that these elements are absent.I can only ask why?",

Janet Leigh was a pleasant surprise but one note and overwrought Angela Lansbury less so with James Gregory as her husband completely out of his depth.

I cannot imagine why, unless, a la Citizen Kane, the myth about the film becomes greater than the film itself. It is ponderous, long, stifling, claustrophobic and unpleasant. It's an obvious product of the Cold War, but as a complete antithesis to say the wonderful 'Dr Strangelove', it has nothing to say about the period and serves only to reinforce the awful anti-Communist prejudice of that dark era.Sinatra gives a heroic performance but is let down by a ham-fisted script and some hyperbolic direction.

However I find this movie terribly overrated. I have to still recommend that you see it for the cultural relevance but don't expect a fast paced thrill ride because this one is a slow burn, with what in my opinion was a predictable ending. Don't however let that stop you. See this movie. Graphically interesting the film has a stylish look.The minor flaws of this movie really do an injustice to the biting nature of the political commentary. I felt some of the acting was truly dreadful with Laurence Harvey's accent switching from blueblood east coast to British depending on the scene. Annoying. Also, I understand it's a thriller and there are a lot of stressful situations but would people really sweat constantly? I suppose AC wasn't as widespread. I got the vibe that the set of this film must have smelled like someone's dirty gym locker. The amount of mustache twisting that went into the evil scientists plan was a caricature in itself and was I suppose, a symptom of the hysteria in that age. NO way would someone we are supposed to believe is a mastermind and is that intelligent would act like such a gloating jerk. At least don't expect me to take it seriously. I'm being a bit harsh and I realize a certain amount of disbelief suspension is needed but would the communists really underestimate their ring leader that much? I guess it's neither here nor there but at this point I could care less.After a friend pointed it out, Angela Lansbury did seem terribly like Ann Coulter in the way that she was an annoying, ruthless, power hungry doppelganger quick to chide the hired immigrant help as well as dominate the minds of weak willed men. I found the handling of her character heavy handed possibly due to the era this was written. I'm not even going to get into the fact that the author and filmmakers felt the need to make her incestuous to hammer home the point that she wasn't just a power hungry woman but pure evil (lest you confuse the two). Sign of the times? Credit where due however, she chews up the scenery in every exchange and the film is better off.Frank does inject some needed amount of masculinity into this film. The karate scene with the Korean operative however, made me laugh out loud. While the scene was laughable it did mark the point where the film starts to turn and pick up speed. The film gets more taught after the initial groundwork is laid and if the directors had found a better way to ratchet this up (it's called editing my boy) in the first 30-40 minutes I might have been even more into the rest of the film.Interesting to wrap your mind around but far too overrated. However, still a landmark and this is still a 7/10.",

Brilliant film. But, with the election of Donald Trump, it's starting to seem like a documentary. The continued revelations about the ties of his inner circle to Russia are chilling.

Back in the US, the killer is prepped by his control agent, who also happens to be his mother, to assassinate a presidential candidate.Based on a novel by Richard Condon, this is a terrific story which works as an exciting thriller, a political satire and a weird kind of domestic drama. There are other movies about brainwashing (Split Image is my favourite), but this is the original and it uses the idea to mess with your head wonderfully well - scenes are presented from multiple points of view, characters talk in strangely stylised ways which may be secret code or may just be the way they talk, and you're never really sure of anyone's motivation. The cast are an odd but intriguing bunch - Harvey is perfectly dislikeable as the unlovable puppet, Sinatra gives probably the best straight acting job of his career, Lansbury is simply terrifying as Harvey's power-mad manipulative mother (although she's way too young), Leigh is divinely beautiful and extraordinarily enigmatic, and a very young Silva has a great bit as a pesky commie agent. Brilliantly directed, the film is a very witty contradiction - it eviscerates the myopia of the gung-ho Republican right within a story about a communist plot to infiltrate a wealthy American political dynasty !! Made the year before, much has been made of the film's link to the JFK assassination (a weak-minded loner with leftist links stakes out a rally to shoot a presidential candidate with a rifle), and this does give it an eerie quality.

The local P.B.S. station showed it a week ago, I think to thumb their noses at the \"re-make\" if that thing on steroids can be dignified with the name.The cinematography was stunning, and the black-and-white gave the film a balefulness from which colour might have distracted. There are some small items which even my uneducated eye caught, however:Senator Iselin is rather too much the hapless buffoon, why in a moment. I found the depiction of the character so central to the \"plot\" hard to swallow. True, the director/ writers wanted to make Mrs Iselin a powerhouse, but it was not necessary to create a flaccid man to make her the puissant woman.-Raymond was so wooden that he was at times unbelievable (note the fine head of hair rarely mussed), again no doubt to set off his dynamic mother. Almost by way of contradiction, Mr Harvey was a good choice. I recall in BUTTERFIELD 8 that when he tried to show emotion, Harvey always looked like he was going to split a gut, so this unpleasant version of a STAR TREK Vulcan was a role made for him.Does anyone REALLY think a woman who meets a border-line mental case in a train is going to give him her address and telephone number? (That said, it is one of the most charming scenes in CANDIDATE.)Returning to Iselin. The novel was published in 1957, the same year Joseph P. \"Tail-gunner Joe\" McCarthy died. This story is a satire on McCarthyism! \"Tail-gunner\" was nothing like Iselin, rather as nasty as the Missus. The thesis turns right-wing paranoia -- a salient feature of American political culture -- on its head, to-wit: how to use American political culture against itself. A jab from the \"right\" is really a haymaker from the \"left.\" The science fiction angle of post brain-washing manipulation is just the vehicle to make larger social commentary. Note how Americans bend over to make themselves vulnerable to a cynical element \"within,\" a story especially for our times.",

The film is about a group of American soldiers who were captured during the Korean War, and then, after thorough brainwashing and reprogramming with hypnotic techniques developed at the Pavlov Institute, returned to America as a secret weapon. Until the collapse of the USSR, the film was banned in most countries behind the Iron Curtain. Visually, it left no impression on me, and the tempo in the first half of the film makes it seem like a year. If it didn't have such a good reputation, I might have given up. Only in the middle does the film take off, the main characters and their complicated and dramatic relationships begin to reveal, there is a real plot and the atmosphere is tenser, all the way to a great, although quite predictable final twist.

Another term such as 'political thriller' could also be used in today's culture, as this film serves as an eerie precursor on how the general public perceives politicians behave behind the scenes.  There is also an unhidden attempt to ride the anti-McCarthyism train, which fits very well into the plot, without overshadowing any other aspects of the film.The Director's presentation of the film can only be rated as excellent, with an extraordinarily unique scene in the first 20 minutes of the film -- the fact that this scene is the theme for the entire movie serves to increase its effect even moreso.  If you liked the opening sequence in \"The Player\", you will definitely enjoy this scene.There are some slight problems with acting, although not blatant enough to take away from the film.  The only other negative thing that could be said (which may have caused some of the minor acting flaws) is that the dialogue seemed a bit stale and didn't flow well at times, but again, these instances are more than overpowered by the rest of the film's dialogue, which keeps the viewer pulled in.",

            "content": "It's a frightening thought. But back during the Cold War, the idea of hypnotizing someone to carry out some sinister political act, like assassination of a foreign leader, was tossed around, originating probably from the \"black ops\" of the CIA or the KGB, or some such. Programming the mind of one Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), a Korean War soldier captured by an enemy nation of the U.S., is the premise of \"The Manchurian Candidate\", a film wherein the underlying theme is potent, but the story is not.The plot here turns domestic, with Shaw's mother and stepfather playing central roles in the drama. The parental influence negates real potency that the film might otherwise have had. Neither Shaw's mother nor his stepfather has the level of political power that we associate with acts of subversion. Toward the end we see what all of this has been leading up to. But the overall plot is too indirect and circuitous to live up to the power of the underlying premise.Senator Iselin (James Gregory) is too much of a buffoon. His presence weakens the story. Janet Leigh's character is more intriguing. But we never learn much about her. Assorted peripheral characters take hits, but again, they're too unimportant to have any political significance.The script is very talky. Lots of back story and exposition in the dialogue dilutes suspense.By far, the best element of the film is the sequence near the beginning, which shows us the brainwashing of the captured soldiers. The editing here is just terrific. Scenes cleverly alternate between the reality of the Chinese man giving a demonstration of hypnosis, and the delusional POV of the soldiers, listening to a lecture about hydrangeas.Casting is okay, except for Laurence Harvey, whose British accent belies the fact that his character is supposed to be an American, and James Gregory, an actor who does not project well on screen. Overall acting trends melodramatic. The film's overall tone is cold and very impersonal, consistent with the Cold War era.Overall, although it has its good moments, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" suffers from a plot that is too domestic. As a result, the political force of the underlying theme is lost. For truly riveting political intrigue and drama, I much prefer \"The Day Of The Jackal\" (1973).",

Harvey's character's conflicts with his mother are so real and immediate they almost make you think you're in a different kind of film. One striking note is how well James Gregory, playing a kind of pseudo-McCarthy senator, imitates the original. Uncanny. Overall, the film scores some surprisingly sharp political point. The twists and turns are expertly handled, even if the whole premise must already have been far-fetched in 1962. Sinatra reminds us he really was an actor, whatever his side gig.

They are asides to the audience which ask \"Do you really believe this? How silly is this?\" If you think our collective intellect in the US has caught up with this, go look at some political forum where there are (incredibly) still so many red-baiters or individuals who are afraid the free enterprise system is collapsing, even now, with billionaires in Russia and China. We know how many of us have read \"Mein Kampf\" or \"The Communist Manifesto\", or smoked a doobie (and inhaled, although with today's improved marijuana, you hardly even have to do that to get totally zonked!), but we are still so intellectually primitive and hypocritical in this country that we can't admit it without fear of being slandered as a subversive or a threat to society. Yet we have the first president and vice-president who were actually arrested before they took office, and the first president who was ever known to have used cocaine. His political strength was gained mostly by calling the other party socialists and communists long enough and loud enough. This movie is about anti-communist insanity. It laughed in our faces, but still we took it seriously, just like the guy who says he never beat his wife but he used to punch her down all the time....Those who made the film laughed all the way to the bank.The United States is still sick from the irrational fear of social equality posed by socialist thinkers. Even as I write this, the US is still in the grip of this hysteria, and to that extent the comedy in this movie is still relevant. It is indeed a classic of the cinema, but most people don't have a fig of an idea what it's about. They don't even come close to \"getting it\". Almost every character in the movie was an avowed opponent of Mc Carthyism. The whole thing was tongue in cheek. What's doubly interesting, however, about the plot of this story also makes a good template for a straight ahead political suspense thriller, focusing real attention on the workings of a government not unlike the current Bush/Republican administration; but then you could make anyone the bad guys. In addition to the Communists or insane right wingers, the \"bad guys\" could be the National Rifle Association, the Red Cross or the Lost Boys of Never Never Land. A political thriller is what the public bought as the original, although it was clearly NOT intended that way. The remake is actually what this 1962 original was mistaken for, kind of like \"Destry Rides Again\" to \"Blazing Saddles\", only in this version, the comedy came first, then the more serious version.",

How his ascendance to the Presidency would further the aims of Russia is never explained. His wife, Angela Lansbury is the true Queen of Mean and her son, Laurence Harvey is trained to kill anyone she orders him to kill. It's up to Frank Sinatra to save the world. Silly as it all may sound, it's not much sillier than American politics in those days. In the opening scene, we get a parade of heavyweight \"baddies,\" Reggie Nalder, Madame Spivy, and Henry Silva as \"Chunjin.\" (These Commies sure mean business!)

Sinatra and Harvey are superb, and the storyline gets high marks for originality. Yet one comes away with the sense that it all could have been just a bit better.

Some speculate her character must be an operative; others a waste of time in an otherwise spectacular film.  I have to disagree with the former -- in order for Leigh to be on the train at that time would require a depth of surveillance intelligence by the Communists that would have undermined Marco's attempts to uncover the problems with Raymond Shaw. And since Marco talked freely with Rosie about his plans for Shaw, wouldn't the Communists tried to stop Marco from destroying their ultimate plan, which, but for Marco, would have succeeded? I must disagree with those who find Leigh's character pointless -- she provides a lighter tone to the picture and allows us to see the gentler side of Marco -- this serves to provide some relaxing moments before racheting up the tension. What is initially jarring is the light speed rate of their romance, and her initial attraction to Marco.  But remember -- Sinatra was playing Marco -- one of the most charismatic, virile men to walk the planet. Even in his shaky state on the train, it's not surprising that a strong woman like Rosie would be drawn to him.  Leigh gives a great performance, given how sketchy the character is.2.  James Gregory as Iselin -- is his performance to broad.  Is it unbelievable that a clown like him could be nominated veep? Iselin is the major comic relief throughout the film.  Moreover, look at the plastic nature of Gore and the bumbling aspect of Bush and I don't think it's that farfetched.",

Despite the fact that his over-powering mother (Angela Lansbury) and her dim-wit, Senator husband (James Gregory) welcome this wonderful award, it doesn't stop Raymond turning into a thoroughly loathsome human being! Forget the remake (with it's very fine actors but so-so director) this film is AS GOOD AS THEY SAY. OK - the Janet Leigh character is ambiguous at best best and Sinatra is in sometimes emotionally above his depth... But what a film for 1962! And what a well made - extremely well made - thriller for any year. And as for criticism about Senator Iselin being too dumb for office... Hellooooooo!!!! This is a fine, fine movie. The scene when Iselin bullies the press conference; the first karate scrap in Hollywood; the 'rigged' queen of diamonds pack de-brief; the finale (the lifting of the candidates' flag itself is a film student's lesson scene!) - all filmed with great skill and imagination. I'm still not sure whether Janet Leigh's immediately friendly femme is Communist fatale or not. But I'm happy to believe she was there to 'de-brief' Major Marco when the dirty deed was done.And the acting? Sinatra is solid and sometimes inspired. Harvey is as stiff as a fresher in the netball team's showers - which is uncannily perfect for the role. And even when I ask myself: Why the English public school accent? A voice keeps crying: 'Fill me burgers and make clean'; whatever that might mean. And James Gregory is exquisite comic relief.But enough of that. Angela Lansbury is very good throughout the film but, in her final 'Lady Macbeth' speech, she gives as fine a performance in a single film scene as any actress has given. It's now probably (sadly) best remembered for the fact that mother snogs son - but the speech that precedes this Oedipal (or should that be, Jocasta) lust, in which Mrs Iselin declares how great she is about to become (with her son's active acquiescence) and how that greatness will undermine those who have abused her familial ties so gravely, is as perfect an example of the acting art as you will see in a motion picture: 'Then Johnny will really hit those microphones and those cameras, with blood all over him, fighting off anyone who tries to help him, defending America even if it means his own death! Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy!' George Axelrod - you just wrote Shakespeare! Or you just let slip the dogs of war... Congratulations.The Manchurian Candidate is about neither being right (Communism and Capitalism that is) and, inevitably, about both being wrong. That it did not have the answer to the '3rd way' is greatly to it's credit. That it's a stunningly shot, finely acted and frequently sublimely written film is greatly to our good fortune.I think Mr Frankenheimer has smelt foul deeds above the earth - with carrion men groaning for burial...",

There is a glaring hole: Whatever happens to Corporal Melvin (James Edwards), who is suffering from the same nightmares as Major Marco (Frank Sinatra)? He is simply dropped once he has sent a letter complaining of his bad dreams. I also found the idea not particularly convincing to make Senator Iselin and his wife (James Gregory and Angela Lansbury) crypto-communists camouflaged as rabid republicans. And I disliked the way Russian, Chinese and Korean communists are portrayed (or rather caricatured). On the upside, the acting is very good throughout, with Lansbury and Laurence Harvey (who plays her son) standing out.

When this film was re-released into theatres in 1987 (25 years after its initial release),it brought chills down my spine and had me thinking about it very deeply. I got a chance to see it again last night on video,and it still haunts me especially seeing Laurence Harvey's character taken and brainwashed into killing a political conspiractor. The performances here and very breathtaking and every time I see it has me nailed to the edge of my seat. They can say all about Angela Lansbury's villianous portrayal of the sinister mother(in true Mommie Dearest format),but when it comes down to the nitty gritty,the chairman of the board(Frank Sinatra) gives the most famous gripping scene in motion picture history,and it shows in brillant capacity and in startling black and white effects. One of the top 100 films of all time.",

            "content": "John Frankenheimer's `The Manchurian Candidate', like the remake three decades later, is very much a reflection of its time. It was made in 1962 and is set in 1952. When watching the film, it helps to remember the political environment. McCarthyism, the House Un-American Activities Committee, red-baiting and blacklisting characterized the 1950s. The Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis marked the early 1960s. The uses and misuses of psychiatry-and its modern cousin, brainwashing-also fascinated the era. Both could tamper with or unlock the human psyche.The liberal-conservative clash of Senators John Iselin (James Gregory) and Thomas Jordan (John McGiver) is typical of the period. Iselin is but a thinly veiled portrayal of Senator Joe McCarthy himself. There is also a dash of then Vice President Richard Nixon. (Think of Alger Hiss.) Oddly, Iselin and Jordan come across as clownish and buffoonish. They are not to be taken altogether seriously.Then come Dr. Yen Lo (Khigh Dheigh), the Pavlov Institute, and the panoply of Chinese and Russian military brass. They are the other side of the coin. Of course, they are played strictly for laughs. (Yen Lo, in particular, has a wry sense of humor.) Far be it from an American director of the early 1960s to credit the enemy with any real intelligence.Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) are far more interesting. They are complex and thus real characters. Sinatra is remarkably good and controlled in his performance. Harvey is more weepy and maudlin as the tragic, tortured victim of brainwashing and political intrigue. But he transcends the limitations of his role and is eminently watchable.Janet Leigh's role as Eugenie Rose Chaney is somewhat enigmatic. One senses that she is more than a love interest for Ben Marco. Eugenie strangely insists that Ben memorize her address and phone number when they have only just met. (The 2004 remake beefs up Eugenie's character and she becomes a federal agent. That makes a lot of sense in light of the 1962 film.)But the icy core of the film is Mrs. Iselin (Angela Lansbury). Remember that kindly old busybody, Jessica Fletcher, from `Murder, She Wrote'? And the even kindlier Mrs. Potts from `Beauty and the Beast'? Who'd have thought she could be such a cold-blooded, hard-as-nails, cast-iron bitch? In the 1950s, Mamie Eisenhower was First Lady. Women were relegated to being trophy wives. For a film set in that period, Mrs. Iselin's Lady Macbeth is truly unique.Raymond Shaw's brainwashing is triggered by the phrase, `Why don't you pass the time by playing a game of solitaire?' Take my advice. Watch `The Manchurian Candidate' instead.",

            "content": "\"The Manchurian Candidate\" is a landmark political thriller from the cold war era. Its staying power has proved sufficient enough to inspire a re-make five years ago under the direction of Jonathan Demme.The story revolves around a Communist plot to brainwash American POWs and use one of them as an unwitting assassin. Everything proceeds as planned until some of the soldiers begin having strange dreams. The mystery begins to unravel but it may be too late to stop the events already set into motion.The cast is well-assembled from the leads on down to the supporting roles. Frank Sinatra isn't bad as the leading man though I much preferred Laurence Harvey's frequent transformations from chilly war hero to robot-like assassin. Angela Lansbury, in the film's single best performance, secured an Oscar nomination in the role of Harvey's sinister mother. Not faring as well was Janet Leigh, though that's mainly because her character is underwritten and seemingly of little consequence.Frankenheimer's direction is well-executed and shows some very interesting touches at times. Especially noteworthy are the dream sequences which are also undoubtedly the main reason why the film was nominated for an Editing Oscar. The score is decent as well but rarely grabs your attention.As much as I appreciate the film's best elements I have to admit that unfortunately some rough edges hurt the film a little. Mainly I feel that the script could have used some work but the film's problems do not negate the strengths by any means. Thus, I recommend the film though I don't quite concur with its high rating.",

Sinatra is always interesting to watch but he can't drag the whole film by himself. The plot is tough to believe. Hard to understand why the 1962 version got such high ratings.2004 is a bit more sci-fi and the technical parts of the plot make the whole movie more believable (if you accept sci-fi magic). Streep, who I generally abhor, reminded me SO much of HRC. Denzel and Liev gave great performances.

            "content": "I read all these comments about what a great thriller The Manchurian Candidate is, and I have to wonder what people think a thriller is -- or are they easily thrilled? The plot of the film is full of unbelievable contrivances, which stood out like sore thumbs even in 1962 when people were less savvy about everything. The film apparently disappeared for a number of years and legends grew about it, so that people remembered it as being better than it truly was. (I didn't remember it that way since I recalled leaving the theater in 1962 wondering what the fuss was about.) Okay, there are some good performances in the film -- Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are both especially good, despite Harvey's accent being totally inappropriate. Everyone raves about Angela Lansbury's performance but while she was good it was hard to be convinced by her so-called evil because it was based on the unlikely contrivance that this New England rich lady would be in league with the communists and also so powerful she could control them and special order an assassin, who just happens to be her son. (But, oh, she'll get revenge for that!) Janet Leigh is very beautiful but totally wasted; it's too bad she doesn't remove her blouse as Leslie Parrish did. Otherwise, her whole role could be removed and it would have no effect whatsoever on the movie. But back to contrivances -- it's hard enough to believe that the mere sighting of a card would send a man into a trance; we also have to believe that he doesn't even get suspicious when people keep suggesting \"Hey, how about a little solitaire?\" He always obliges! He never says, \"I don't like solitaire.\" Or, \"How about canasta or Go Fish?\" Then his girlfriend, in another contrivance worthy of Hitchcock (the master contriver of absurd situations), shows up dressed as the Queen of Diamonds. No one ever explains exactly why she did this. It's too silly for words. Maybe some of the other commenters are right -- this is supposed to be a black comedy. We can pretend Sinantra is Mel Brooks and Laurence Harvey is Gene Wilder. Now all we need is someone to be Richard Pryor. But as for thrills, I sat on the edge of my seat all right -- so I could get up quickly as soon as this was over! One final comment -- the so-called martial arts fight between Sinatra and Henry Silva (what happened to his character anyhow?) was so embarrassing to both the men and their stunt doubles, I had to fast forward through it! I've seen better fighting on a Get Smart episode (more realistic too). Other than these few carping remarks, I have to agree -- what a classic!",

I have to applaud how John Frankenheimer balances suspense and humor like a master.  Note to Oliver Stone: you don't need to bludgeon your audience over the head with conspiracy theories, subtlety works much better, and is infinitely more disturbing.There are so many fantastic performances in this movie.  Frank Sinatra provides a good hero, a man who starts out doubting his own sanity, then gets caught up in the desperate race to save Raymond Shaw.  Laurence Harvey's Shaw is a paradox: he is about as unlikeable a person as you would ever want to meet, but you can't help but feel sorry for him as his life flies apart.  Angela Lansbury's character is so far away from the kindly image we have of her today, it's hard to believe it's the same person, but she pulls it off.One minor quibble: just why is Janet Leigh in this movie?  The whole romance subplot between her and Sinatra felt tacked-on, obligatory.  If she were in fact another Communist agent, Sinatra's controller (as some have suggested), then they should have fleshed it out.  As is, her scenes seem like an afterthought.  Oh, and the Lincoln imagery was a little heavy-handed, too. C'mon, Frankenheimer, we get the point...In spite of that, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" succeeds as a fast-paced, intelligent thriller.  This is the sort of movie I'm going to need to see over and over to catch everything.  After all, it has Raymond Shaw in it, and he's the bravest, kindest, best character I've ever seen...",

The film I saw was a good film, but certainly lacked that little oomph necessary to take it to great.But there was a lot about it that I liked. The casting/acting continually surprised me throughout the film. The characters are all a little... angular, but despite that, the performances are quite good and one of the highlights of the film. Indeed, despite seeing his name boldly credited, I completely forgot that Frank Sinatra was playing the lead character in the film. The story itself is nice too, complete with a few twists to keep things interesting. I even liked the dialogue writing.But I don't feel like all the components were strong. In particular, I felt like the overall direction of the film was a little stale. I often felt like everything I was watching was set up in front of me, rather than flowing naturally. Okay, that's a little vague, but the directing choices, including framing, mis-en-scene and the editing just kept things seeming just a touch artificial. The story, I can tell, is trying to go for paranoia, but the because there is little that's hidden from the audience, it ends up being a drama until the end, where a little suspense comes in. But since the film mood is that of suspense, it's hard to say whether the film really managed to get the whole thing right.I certainly wasn't convinced and halfway through the movie, I started getting fairly bored. It's not that stuff doesn't happen, but that the drama wasn't fully there. And then I had to keep wondering whether or not Janet Leigh's character had any significance to the film, because she seems a little like an afterthought. I would've excised her character entirely from the story, since she has no impact on the main characters.But I did finish it and the few twists that the film has were interesting enough to keep me from giving up on the film. That and I was still impressed by the underlying story as well as the acting. I just wish it were all presented better. It's still good, despite my complaints, but after having seen it, I don't get why the film gets so much praise. 7/10.",

Imagine a film about Nazis to see Churchill secretly the villain. Someone should have sent all involved a book about the real horrors which were unfolding day by day.Beyond failing as propaganda (its chief objective, it fails as a story. Several plot points are unconvincing and contrived.

I would have been prepared to accept the implausibility of this if it had led somewhere but sadly it does not. Next the fist fight between Sinatra and Harvey's servant, which is never fully justified and never mentioned afterwards.Nor is it never explained how Harvey waltzes into a secure area and is able to find the perfect vantage point, an unguarded room, to shoot from.

            "content": "An excellent idea turned into a witty script, dynamically directed and expertly performed. Even after all these years, the set pieces do not disappoint: in fact, with the passage of time, they elicit more and more admiration. For example, the breathtaking 360-degree pan; Sinatra's dialogue with Leigh on the train; the confrontation at the fancy dress party between McGiver and Lansbury, followed closely by Lansbury's thoroughly chilling mother-and-son scene with Harvey; and of course the superb finale at the convention.The tone of the film is unsettling throughout - often slyly comic, just as often scary and disquieting. It's as if it's an expression of Marco's muddled mind. Yet it never quite fits neatly into the comedy-thriller mould: Axelrod and Frankenheimer were much too canny for that. There is something wonderfully unreal about the world in which Sinatra's character moves, making his intense, anguished, thoroughly real performance - surely his best - all the more sympathetic.Harvey's limited gifts are put to good use. His peculiar lack of sincerity makes his attempt to escape his mother's grip, through an affair with Leslie Parrish's Jocelyn Jordon, doomed from the start.I guess, though, in the end, the abiding memory is of the wonderful gallery of performances - James Gregory's spineless senator, Khigh Dhiegh's smiling villain, and of course the magnificent Lansbury, for whom not even La Streep was a match. The remake, in spite of its many good qualities, is too bloated, simply not a patch on the spare, intense, original.",

It's always been a controversial film, banned in all of the 'Iron Curtain' countries and even taken out of circulation in America after John Kennedy's assassination -- on Sinatra's own wishes. This is easily John Frankenheimer's best film.

            "content": "A film far ahead of its time. Its themes of thought control, political assassination, and a multinational conspiracy were hardly common currency in the 1960's.Still probably one of the most shocking films ever.Sinatra is just flawless, probably his best role. What is really remarkable about the part is how vulnerable he could play the character of Marco.The real standout to me though is Laurence Harvey as the war hero son, Raymond Shaw.It is interesting to note all of the the little things that he does in each scene. For instance, in the first scene in which he appears, Shaw is repulsed by the prostitutes and GI's.The entire sequence revolves around Shaw's problems with women, and how much his mother (Angela Lansbury) has destroyed his personality.....Just who is this man? And what is left of him? As to my favorite scenes from the film? I'd probably have to start with the brain-washing scene. It is just something you just don't see much of. The whole 360 * shot around the room, is balls to the wall brilliance.I also really love the scene at the end of the film with Marco at the Convention Hall, trying to stop \" a time bomb\" as he puts it...Also the whole karate fight scene between Sinatra & Henry Silva.However, the scene that still has me the most intrigued and puzzled is the sequence on the train between Sinatra & Janet Leigh's character.During their weird, oblique conversation, they talk about US states, Columbus' football team, railroad lines, and her two names (Eugenie and her nickname Rosie) - are they speaking in cryptic code? Is Marco also brainwashed as a Manchurian pawn - and is good old innocent looking Rosie his controlling operative? Or is she just looking for a little loving? Hmmmm.",

            "content": "The Manchurian Candidate has some good points and bad points. I rented this movie due impart to the reviews, and the classic cast. The movie started out good; but then it got too long. The movie takes place during the end of the Korean War. A group of G.I.'s are ambushed the Manchuria boarder, near Russian/china. Once they are captured, they are taken to garden club/training center. It is a place where they show an audience the effects of brainwashing, on these Korean soldiers. Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) is the key. They have effective turned him into an assassin. His fellow G.I.'s are there to witness the experiments. Shaw's trigger is though the game of Solitaire. Once he plays he is under complete control. When the Queen of Diamonds appears he does what his operatives tell him to do. Among the group is Major Bennett Marco(Frank Sinatra. When the experiments starts Shaw is told to shot one of his fellow G.I.'s in the head; and he does.When Shaw comes home from Korea, he is viewed as a war hero; by the public; but it is all a cover. The only ones that know what he really is, is his operatives; even Major Marco is fooled. His operatives are his mother, Mrs Islin(Angela Landsbury) and his Father Senator Islin(James Gregory). They appear to be a power hungry couple who believe some Americans are Communists. Raymond hates his mother, because she has always been so controlling and mean. When two of the G.I.s start having nightmares of the capture and experiences at the garden club, Marco starts to suspect something has happened to Shaw. Marco and Cpl. Allen Melvin( James Edwards)are called in to identify subjects. They both identify the same men. They appear to powerful government agents, who are involved in experimental research.Shaw tries to put his life back together again, he meets Jocelyn Jordan(Leslie Parrish). He wants to start over again, but his mother doesn't like the Jordan's especially her father Senator Thomas Jordan( John McGiver). Islin thinks they are communists, but later she has a change of heart, but involves a diabolical plot. Shaw is trying to get back to normal, but whenever he plays Solitaire, and the Queen of Diamonds appears it has an effect on him. He does strange stuff, like jumping into a lake, while Marco wonders why? Shaw also eventually kills Jocelyn, his wife; and Sen. Thomas his father-in-law, in the Jordan's home. Near the end of the movie Shaw's mom pulls out the cards for one final time, for assassination so they can work their way into the White House. When Marco( Sinatra) finds out what has happened to Shaw he tries to reverse his brainwashing hoping for positive results. Once Shaw is at the Stadium for the Presidential speech, it looks like Shaw is going to complete the mission. Instead he kills his operatives, his mother and father. The ending turns out to be tragic anyway, because of the abuse, and being brainwashed, Shaw turns the gun on himself.I liked the movie because of the storyline. The reason why I gave it 6/10 is it was boring in parts; and drawn out. I haven't seen the re-make so I can't compare it to this one. To those who see it be prepared for a great storyline, but being slow moving kills the rating. Still this movie is worth the rental and shows the dangerous effect of brainwashing.",

It's great not just as an A1 political thriller but as a reminder of what a genuinely good actor Frank Sinatra could be-and how white-hot Laurence Harvey was in his day, sort of a Jude Law for the late 50s/early 60s.The plot is quite simple, however the storytelling and dialogue is occasionally a challenge, but one you want to get your teeth into: In the Korean War, a US platoon is kidnapped by the Chinese and the Russians. They are brainwashed, and returned home. Raymond Shaw (Harvey), the leader of the pack, returns to a hero's welcome and his overbearing mother, who in turn is now married to an obnoxious senator. Ben Marco (Sinatra), one of Shaw's men, is plagued by terrifying nightmares though, ones that could unlock murders, treason and a massive political plot.

Shaw (Laurence Harvey)has won the Congressional Medal Of Honor, and everything is peachy. Except that Ben Marco (Sinatra) wakes up screaming every night. And thereby hangs a alternately funny, frightening, satirical and tragic tale.I'd always viewed Frank Sinatra as a singer who merely dabbled in acting. Then I saw this movie and was picking my jaw off the floor. The train scene with Janet Leigh is mesmerizing. Sinatra as Marco looks like a man about to completely disintegrate while trying not to show it in front of Leigh. It's so good that I didn't even question until after the movie why Rosie (Leigh) would give her address and phone # to a guy twitching so badly he can't light a cigarette. People have questioned what Leigh's character is for in this movie, as she's not in the armed forces, or politics, or a victim. It's simple... she's the sounding board so Marco can talk to somebody who doesn't think he's nuts, so he can get what he suspects off his chest before he does go nuts.Anglea Lansbury as Raymond Shaw's mother is one of the scariest political creatures you'll ever meet. She yanks her senator husband around like a dog, sets up his speeches, yammers at Raymond until he just covers his ears, torpedoes his one true love affair for political revenge, and slanders any opposition as \"communists\". James Gregory as Senator Iselin is a cartoon caricature of Joe McCarthy who asks his wife to please give him just one number of known communists in the defense department so he can remember it and not look like an idiot.And then there's Laurence Harvey as Raymond Shaw. For the first half of the movie, the unknowingly brainwashed Shaw is icy, disdainful, kills 2 people in the first 1/2 hour, and still a more sympathetic character than his mother. And then his walls come tumbling down while drinking with his new \"friend\" Marco. Starting with a typically Raymond cynical commentary on Christmas, a progressively drunker Shaw then spills the story of how he, a man who knows \"I'm not lovable\" fell in love with the daughter of Iselin's political enemy, Senator Jordan, only to have have his mother break them up. By the end of the scene, Shaw has crumpled into a hunchback on the brink of tears saying \"I did love her, I do love her\" Which makes what his mother does to him after that even more chilling.The final dominoes (and bodies) fall leading up the party nomination convention, as Marco races to find Shaw before this man who Marco now really does consider a friend destroys himself along with his victims.Although I do like Denzel Washington, this film never should have been remade. Some things you simply can't top.",

I did not quite get it in the first few seconds of the demonstration sequence, not because I could not follow a complex editing or screenplay but I just did not see it coming in a movie of that era. This is one of the most elaborate and beautifully written scripts I have ever come across.Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and his team were termed heroes and showered with medals and awards when they fight their way back home through a deep enemy territory during the Korean war. Shaw's mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury) is a manipulative power broker now married to Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory) with a full intent to put him on the pedestal. Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) a member of Shaw's team and few others starts to have nightmares that contradict their daring escape story all pointing to something skeptical about Shaw. When Marco begins to lose his mind over this, he starts an unofficial inquiry until he finds something solid.The writing, editing, screenplay and performances were top notch for its time with a lot of emphasis on character development. But the narrative style did put me off sometimes especially Sinatra's piece. The girlfriend/wife character is out of the blue and does not serve any purpose than for him to go on narrating instead of having a conversation. Though it was brilliant for the writing to show the handlers do a lot of mock tests on their brainwash project before a real approach, the whole thing somehow looks messy and too fictional. The movie could've been easily been 20 minutes lesser in its runtime and action sequences were too dated. I can only speculate what a chilling resonance it could have had after JFK's assassination only a year later.Not without its glitches but a brilliant writing with a complexity that is not seen in its era",

Later following an arrest of Sam, it turns out he had remembered the phone number and called her to bail her out; and that Eugenie has, without any intervening contact between train and bail payment, turned out to be what seems deeply in love with Sam. Then in the film's final scene, Eugenie is shot (filmed) sitting quietly in the background while Sam speaks some final word in summary of his experience with anti-gay Raymond Shaw. All this has seemed utterly senseless to many commentators on the film without assuming that something more was intended --like the appearance of Eugenie as some sort of intervening agent of one of the film's evil cabals. But this view is not reinforced by any cues that Eugenie has ever acted against Sam's interests.In the book, details are less cryptic, Eugenie' \" good woman\" love for Sam is affirmed in authorial exposition and EUGENIE makes appearance in the final scene. Thus, there is no felt enigma, and one's sense of enigma in the film might be viewed as a playful directorial red herring or fallout from a directorial gaffe. HOWEVER, another view comes to mind. Troubled Sam's meeting on the train is reminiscent of a troubled Cary Grant's meeting on train with the quickly affectionate, blonde EVA Marie Saint in Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST, who ultimately turns out to be a CIA agent sympathetic to the Grant character's fight from Soviet and other pursuers (as well as quickly in love with him). This adds a hint of even deeper conspiracy than ever becomes apparent, a protective one!My hunch is that the cryptic presence of Eugenie is intended to add complexity by evoking some mysterious design, most consistently that Eugenie is an agent of some sympathetic intelligence agency sent to watch over Sam.",

Only later did it begin to occur to me (and, of course, to many others) that there is possibly much more to Rosie than we (and Marco) are led to believe at the outset.Ms. Leigh was a major star when the film came out, so why would she be given such a relatively small supporting role? How, really, does she happen to be on that train to begin with? Why, indeed, do Rosie and Marco carry on this bewildering conversation? Are these two merely playing an insipid, \"meet-cute\" scene to soften the tone of an otherwise-consistently acerbic and caustic film for awhile, a film which never, otherwise, loses its satiric-tragic tone (and how many movies, short of RoboCop, to name one, are able successfully to present a sustained balance of satire and tragedy)? How can Rosie so precipitously jettison her fianc\u00e9 without a second thought and with no apparent pain or regret? Is there, in their conversation, Marco's version of Shaw's trigger question, \"Why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?\" When Marco proposes marriage, why does Rosie never unequivocally answer his question?Every character in the film is being somehow controlled by someone: Dr. Yen, toeing the Party line he clearly views with contempt as being beneath his virtuosity and cunning; Raymond's mother, who has discovered to her horror (and, probably, delight), in a magnificent perversion of the pieta, that her own, only son had been given over to the Grand Plan and who then, straight from Macbeth, vows both complicity and revenge; Senator Iselin, a (willing?) pawn to Raymond's mother and (unwillingly?) to his alcoholism; Marco, enslaved by two PtSD triggers: combat and brainwashing; but who remains a loyal Army officer saved (or later sacrificed?) by his beloved Rosie; Shaw, an unwilling pawn to brainwashing and (perhaps willingly) to his mother and who suffers from a third PtSD trigger: incest, until he is saved (or would he, too, later have been sacrificed?) by his beloved Jocie (yes, the names rhyme), who, like Rosie, also appears seemingly out of nowhere with a superficially-insipid manner.It may just be that the film ends with the death of all the characters, even if some of them--up to the point the narrative stops--continue to walk and breathe. Were any of them ever, really, alive to begin with, or are we witness to an exquisitely crafted ghost story?",

Harvey spends most of the movie in a trance-like state, and he is so convincing that it's almost unnerving.  Lansbury plays a villainess with obvious relish, and it's got to be one of the all time b*tch roles of them all.  As for Sinatra, he won an Oscar for From Here To Eternity, but I like him much more in this film.

The thing that makes his character so intimidating is not how he affects other people or events, but how other people or events affect him. We have a lingering feeling that at some point Raymond Shaw is going to explode, but we don't know when.The most chilling aspect of the story isn't the actual horror or mayhem that is occurring on screen, but the fact that it all seems so REAL.

Though most of the American characters are upstanding and unflinchingly good, this is not uncommon for the time and they are at least fairly well characterised, with depth in their motivations and perceptions of life.The acting is powerful for the most part, with good direction and cinematography.

Laurence Harvey's platoon commander returns a war hero, idolised by his men, who nevertheless have nightmares in which he murders their comrades in a sedate ladies gardening club, and vague memories that he wasn't as a sound as he's supposed to be. Harvey's mother Lansbury (of Murder She Wrote fame) is  the ultra-right wing power behind her hick senator husband.Any more of the plot would be a give-away, although highlights include Hollywood's first martial arts fight, Sinatra's first encounter with Leigh on a train (the romantic subplot is otherwise rather superfluous), Harvey's desperation and confusion, and the whole edgy, paranoid atmosphere of the piece. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" has the reputation of being a liberal, slightly counter-cultural film, but its politics are ultimately quite right wing, and while Senator Joseph McCarthy would have despised the brilliant lampooning of right-wing US politics, he would have been pleased with the final pay-off.

I understand that Frank Sinatra tried to buy up and destroy all prints of this film following JFK's assassination. I have discovered that a remake is in production as I write.

A rather spacey Janet Leigh shares playful dialogue with a tough as shoe leather Frank Sinatra, involved in one of Hollywood's best fight scenes (beating up the always beat up Henry Silva, years before Steven Seagal did).

Following the Kennedy assassination, Frank Sinatra took his film off the market, keeping it locked away until releasing it on video in 1988. The wait made interest in the film grow and it is thus seen today as a true political/science fiction classic.\"The fact that people have read all kinds of connotations into this thing is funny, because we set out to do Dick Condon's book and that's what we did,\" producer George Axelrod noted in 1988. That people would read connotations into the film is natural given the allegories involved in the story. The most obvious lies in the character of Senator John Yerkes Iselin, a McCarthy clone whose is universally called an idiot for his savage anti-Communism. The punchline comes in that Iselin really is on to something, for Soviet Russia and China have teamed for an audacious scheme beginning in 1952 Korea with the capture of a US patrol lead by Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), as unctuous and full of himself in his own way as his father-in-law Iselin, a father-in-law Raymond hates without letup.Shaw's familial connections are key to the scheme hatched in Manchuria at a place called Tong Wa, which leaves the squad with two members killed and the rest rescued by Shaw. Raymond gets the Medal of Honor upon his return to the States - except that his actions were manifestly not what the Medal of Honor claims they were.Now a Major, Bennett Marco is the first to realize something is amiss, as recurring nightmares stress his ability to perform his duties, to the point of being placed on indefinite sick leave. But when another surviving member of the squad reports the exact same nightmares, the Army now must assign Marco to investigate Raymond Shaw.Marco's most pointed question lies in a motion by Raymond's hands in the dream - a motion that Marco suddenly remembers when Raymond suddenly asks to play a game of solitaire, then acts with supreme oddness upon completing the game. When Raymond suddenly gets married to a love thought lost, then she and her father (a famous Senator who leads opposition to Iselin) are gunned down in their home, Marco must act to try and deduce what will happen next - and learns not only what the real plot is, but who is the real American brains behind it.",

Laurence Harvey is disturbingly effective as Shaw.  (No Oscar nomination? Shame, shame!)  Frank Sinatra is also good as the general who was brainwashed along with Shaw but later uncovers the secret.  And then there's Raymond's mother, a cold, calculating, manipulative, power-hungry, ambitious shrew, played by, of all people, Angela Lansbury, who is excellent and very chilling.  The cheif flaw in this film is the inexplicable romance Sinatra has with Janet Leigh.  What's she there for, anyway?

(For one of the worst, see \"My Son John\".)A certain suspension of disbelief is necessary in \"The Manchurian Candidate\", which will forgive some plot holes here and there. The most serious flaw is James Gregory's cartoonishly-overacted, overdrawn performance as Senator Iselin. I could never believe that an oaf such as Iselin, as Gregory portrays him, could rise to such heights of political power. Furthermore it's clear that the character of Iselin had precious little respect from his fictional colleagues to begin with, and suddenly there he is, a sitcom-like clown, up for the office of vice-president. The small part of Iselin could have been given great sensitivity, even pathos, by an understated performance. (I think Gig Young could have pulled it off well.)As for Janet Leigh: any excuse to include her in any film is acceptible, in my book. Her two main scenes lit up the screen, whether directly-relevant to the plot or not.

The husband is a ludicrous copy of Senator McCarthy, ranting and raving about \"245 Communists in the U.S. government\" and causing an uproar in a congressional committee meeting. One liberal senator, invited to her house party, calls it \"a fascist party\" and Angela decides to have him taken out -- after all, he is \"a communist\". We learn her ultimate goal is to have her husband elevated to the presidency by assassination, whereupon they (she) will turn the U.S. into a totalitarian state and in a bloodbath, eliminate her communist enemies. Her home is tastefully furnished, and there are a number of Abraham Lincoln busts which the camera remains on for an inordinate amount of time. (Hey!

However, with all of the current hype calling the 1962 edition a classic, I decided that perhaps I was wrong not to have seen it in '62. So I took advantage of a PBS airing and watched it today. I wasn't wrong in '62!The plot was thin and totally predictable. For example, in one scene, during train ride Sinatra's character has an anxiety attack that's so bad he can't even light a cigarette. He knocks over a dining table and staggers out with the sweats to a compartment at the end of the car - Janet Leigh, (they've never met before) who witnesses this sweaty attack (and who's also engaged to be married to someone she has met before)follows him out to the compartment and falls in love with him and runs home to dump the current boyfriend! C'mon.....(And that's one of the better scenes.)I wont go into the other scenes, but there are roadsigns throughout, with big arrows pointing to the next event.",

To read the reviews of \"Manchurian Candidate\" on this data base you would think Orson Wells and Richard Condon never existed.  While a bold effort by John Frankenheimer in his staging and shooting of the dream/hallucination sequences, he owed much to Wells for many of the slanted angles he employed.  Further, George Axlerod dropped the ball at several key points in his adaption of Condon's original work, creating completely ludicrous character jumps for Bennet Marco & Rosie Chaney.  Even so, the \"Manchurian Candidate\" stood out for many as a political thriller that allowed them to see the fluidity of political rhetoric.  For some, this created a discerning eye that could see when the manipulators were domestic as well as foreign.  Frankenheimer's best work (\"Seven Days in May\")  was yet to arrive, but Candidate surely made that film possible.  From a cinematic point of view, Candidate should be remembered simply as tour de force for Angela Landsbury and Laurence Harvey, yet we all know that the determination of a film's legacy goes way beyond its technical merit.  Thus, Candidate holds water today despite its mediocre craftsmanship.",

            "content": "One the most prescient political thrillers ever made, John Frankenheimer's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE found itself withdrawn following the assassination of President John F Kennedy, not to reemerge again until the late Eighties. By the time it appeared on videocassette, the film quickly found a new generation of audiences who would recommend it to their friends, like I did.Based on Richard Condon's incendiary novel, the movie rights were purchased by United Artists, but there were concerns over how the public would react. Although Joe McCarthy had been dead for five years the toxic anti-communist legacy associated with his name still festered. Studio head Arthur Krim sought the advice of Frank Sinatra's then friend, Jack Kennedy himself, who encouraged them to proceed. In fact, the only concern the president voiced was \"Who was going to play the mother?\"Sinatra was not a producer, nor even an executive producer, but that didn't stop him from trying to influence the casting. He wanted Lucille Ball to portray Mrs Iselin, but Frankenheimer was dead set on Angela Lansbury because he had just directed her on a recent picture. Trying to win over the stubborn Sinatra, he privately screened the picture for him, saying \"If you still want Lucy after it's over, I won't say another word\". It's safe to say that once Sinatra finished watching, he acquiesced to Frankenheimer's judgement.For the central part of Raymond Shaw, Laurence Harvey was currently hot after his Oscar nomination for ROOM AT THE TOP. But his acting style left critics and co-stars divided; Jane Fonda once described \"acting with Harvey is like acting with yourself.... only worse\". In spite of the naysayers, Harvey launched himself into the role, going so far as to personally perform a stunt where he plunges into Central Park Lake's ice water in the middle of winter. A precursor to the polar bear dip on New Year's Day if you will.",

Laurence Harvey did Britain proud in this film.His performance is down to his 'subliminal hypnotised state'.Frank Sinatra is equally omnipotent as the co-sufferer trying to make sense of it all.Both of them push out a static-charged chemistry.Angela Lansbury as the evil political-mother is frightening.The era of the cold-war & the threat of Asian 'Reds' had put America in a state of paranoia by the early 1960s.This film does nothing to dispel it & in a way that is a negative.But the brain-washing scenes are handled deftly with the G.I.'s as guinea pigs in an experiment that results in the complete control of their minds.The Film handles violence so tactfully that it becomes agonising when it occurs. The sequences when the Laurence Harvey character begins assassinating kinfolk are deeply heartbreaking to watch. This is the kind of Film you wake up in a cold-sweat with!!!!.",

I can tell you it has great cinematic moments and indeed every film lover should see it. At the same time, it has some slow segments that a modern audience may find dull. The final 1/3 is very exciting though and certainly wort the wait.Our director is John Frankenheimer. He is known for many classic and modern films before his passing in 2002. I recognized \"Ronin\" on is list which is one of my favorite action films. It took a skilled and visionary director to make \"The Manchurian Candidate.\" There are two stories running side by side and yet the overall plot must be told with subtlety and care.Since the story is about a brainwashed puppet being used by forces hostile to the USA, the subject matter is close to home for an American. Still, it's easy to see how this sort of thing could be happening behind our back without us knowing it. The acting is incredible along with the writing making this a definite must see for movie fans and/or fans of the actors. The fight scenes unfortunate make me laugh. This is ironic since Frank Sinatra considered it some of his best acting ever. It is in fact dated in its pace and some of the effects look fake. It was avoided by many audiences for some time after its release due to the political public response to the film. 7/10.",

            "content": "First off, great movie, especially for its time. But it is the message of this movie that concerns me. Spoilers:First, we are shown a scene in which two murders take place. Yet, the killer was hypnotized, remembers nothing, and thus feels no guilt. He does not feel he has done anything wrong because he cannot remember doing anything wrong, an amnesic moral nihilism: every action is as morally acceptable as any other, but only due to memory loss. This amnesia is used to sooth the anxious viewer who has just seen a man brutally strangled and a young boy shot in the head. \"Yes he is a killer,\" they say, \"but he was not aware of his actions. He had been brainwashed by evil Russian/Chinese communists.\" So it's not really a moral nihilism.\nOr is it? The murderer gets cured of his brainwashings, and guess what? He again kills two innocent people. He shoots another man, and instead of shooting a pure little boy, he even more horribly kills a woman who happens to be his mother. You may say that these last two victims were not innocent, you are partly right. They were corrupt city officials who had taken good notes while reading Machiavelli, but their only crime was slander, and perhaps conspiracy to murder. For they were not the two who ordered the murder of the first two victims. They may have been accomplices, but they had never committed any crime even closely worthy of the death penalty they received.\nSo, just as with the first two murders, two innocents are killed and no moral guilt is shown. The killing was premeditated and coldly enacted, and what's more, he no longer had the excuse of amnesia and hypnosis to justify his actions. Full of his faculties, he had chosen murder: moral nihilism.\nAgain, you may say that the suicide proves that he had felt guilty. In reality, the premeditation shows that he had taken everything into account. It was the fact that he would be perceived as guilty that he chose to end it. Moreso, the love of his life had just been heartlessly murdered as well. With nothing to live for in a life of prison, he had nothing to live for in the hope that he may have been someday released either. Thus the suicide did not show moral guilt, but judicial guilt. So then, not only is this movie a historical must-see because of its entertainment value, it is also a piece of the puzzle in understanding our presently deteriorated morality.",

Sergeant Raymond Shaw, one of the 77 people who took medal of honor because of the duty in Korean War, saves nine soldier's life. At least it is announced in this way but no one knows the reality that he is brainwashed for some purposes. But Major Marco has the nightmares that explain the condition of Raymond.Furthermore, Raymond's mother is married to Senator Iselin and his mother uses the story of Raymond for the purpose of taking the presidency. In this way, Raymond is imposed for lots of murders including his fresh wife and employer. Now candidate of president must be killed by him and but it doesn't work, in other words Raymond does the things which he wants to do mostly.The director uses the queen of diamond in the scenes in which Raymond starts to action by the effect of brainwashing. But, his mother still believes the effect of it and she waits for action. Most people ask why the Major Marco didn't arrest him after killing his wife and her father but the reason appears in the last scene. The scene that Major opened the playing cards (52 queen of diamond) to Raymond before convention is a sign that Raymond tries to escape.If I leave logical explanations, it was a very funny joke that Rosie told to Marco. Rosie leaves her engaged for Marco and says \"I said I wasn't married, but I didn't say I was engaged\". Also the fighting scenes among Major and Chunjin is remarkable. Sending Chunjin to Raymond is important not to cut relations with him for some people.According to the comments that I read related to it, a new version was made. Although I have never watched new one, I think it can't be fantastic for this Lastly, most critical point is that : To become the president of USA, there is no need for intelligence. Nowadays Bush verifies this sentence unfortunately.",

The concepts invoked (hypnosis, conspiracy, ruthlessness) give the tale more clout, as far as innovation in cinematic themes are concerned. I think the storyline and characterization speak for themselves, so I'll focus on some other technical aspects of the film. \tThe dream sequences are, at first confusing but always eerie. Frankenheimer beings the scene with a full 360 degree shot that allows us to see everyone in the room. Many of the character's actions are deliberate and obviously meaningful. Many of the older women are either displaying action, or their physicality is exaggerated in some fashion. These traits are essential for the doubling of action for the \u0091mirror-side' of the dream/lecture. The male spectators and the chief doctor are all \u0091palindromes' of the women's orchid society. The brilliance of this concept can be found in the fact that although this idea is not critical to implement, it serves as an opportunity to bring more ingenuity into an already pioneering picture. \tAnother interesting element that is constantly played with is the use of Abraham Lincoln to incorporate political distinctions. Before a news conference Sen. Iselan strikes a pose in front of a Lincoln portrait. The camera focuses on the painting, but we are meant to see the senator's reflection. Later, Raymond's mother seems to casually walk by a marble bust of the former President, and the ironically enough, the senator is dressed as Lincoln at a costume party. I believe we are meant to infer that the senator probably has decent intentions to be a major contributor for \u0091this great nation', but we also understand that he will be cut down before even the slightest degree of any greatness can be measured. Although Lincoln was killed after he triumphed over a national dispute, Sen. Iselin will be eliminated before his tendencies can be invoked.Simply Amazing.**** (of ****)",

To the best of my knowledge this was one of the first (if not the first) to deal with the topic of a \"sleeper agent\", a concept that was visited again in the film Telefon (Charles Bronson) and a myriad of others.This was an daring book to consider making into a film at the time. Given the political climate at the time, it could very well have been halted before it began. Allegedly, Frank Sinatra made an appeal to his friend President Kennedy to give his blessing on the film when the studio started to get a little nervous about it.That said, the film was still limited by movie production of the time. The political themes are an obvious element that comes to mind, and towards the end of the film there is a very slight implication of an incestuous relationship between Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury's characters. This (according to an interview with Frank Sinatra that appears on the Australia DVD release of the film) is something explored to greater detail in the book but for obvious reasons couldn't be presented to a 1962 theatre audience.Currently there is a remake schedule for release later this year. This is something that may benefit the story with current productions being allowed to explore the political and personal themes that were presented in the original book (however I will reserve judgement on that until I see the film - could go entirely the opposite direction as well!)Recommended viewing ****",

While not a true story, it did have a touch of McCarthyism in it that would please any history buff. The basic story line....how to take over the Presidency by getting rid of the President and future Presidential candidate via assassination and deception....today we do it by planting 21 year old interns throughout the White House (just kidding). I don't recall seeing Laurence Harvey in any other movie (although he has 57 films in his film biography), but he was great as the brainwashed future assassin. Frank Sinatra was Frank Sinatra....even if you don't remember old blue eyes, go see this film and your appreciation for him as an actor will definitely have a firm foundation. Now I must also say that Angela Lansbury as an evil woman is totally not what I ever imagined...she is totally hard core. Finally, I want to mention some theaters in Milwaukee like the Times Cinema...this is a great theater that brought back memories of going to the old Majestic Theater (Cudahy), the Garden (South Milwaukee), the Avalon (still operating in Bay View) and the Cinema 1 & 2 (Downtown)... you deserve a bit of nostalgia, a bit of history, and a touch of class...check out the Milwaukee Times Cinema...you'll be glad you did!",

The 1962 version sported Frank Sinatra (yes, Old Blue Eyes, although the fact is not readily apparent because this was in black and white) and Laurence Harvey in the respective Washington and Schreiber roles. John Frankenheimer's classic has always seemed to me less of a thriller than a criticism, but what I believe raises it above an instance of political lecturing is how good a story it is independently of its \"message.\" The premise does not promise much: several men on patrol in the final days of the Korean War are ambushed and disappear. Upon their re-appearance, it appears that the young and generally disliked Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) has led his comrades to safety with commendable courage; he is in fact commended, and promptly receives the Medal of Honor. His stepfather, Senator Islen (James Gregory), and the eminence grise behind his congressional career, Shaw's mother (portrayed by a young Angela Lansbury, of Murder, She Wrote fame), are quick to take advantage of Raymond's hero status, and begin a push for a vice president nomination for the senator. Meanwhile, Shaw's commander, Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and several other members of the ill-fated patrol begin having troubling dreams conflicting with the official account of Shaw's bravery. More of the plot, I will not comment on, not so much to keep the secret, but to not appear redundant; most of television viewing population will have learned the secret from the previews for the 2004 version. I will focus instead on the performances: Frank Sinatra is greatly effective in what many believe to have been his best role. As Bennett Marco, he is our link to the events, as confused as we are, depressed by the horrors of war, but optimistic; he befriends Raymond, serves as his watcher, and hopes he can be re-habilitated. As he becomes more and more involved with the sinister intrigues swirling around Shaw, he draws us into them as well. He comes to care for this aloof and vulnerable young man, and Laurence Harvey portrays him with just the right hint of deep set psychological problems covered up with several layers of cynicism and hatred. And once we encounter his mother, portrayed by Angela Lansbury as a truly creepy and manipulative woman, we can understand the depths of those psychological problems. There are also several delectably subtle touches throughout the film; one of my favorites is the obvious idolatry of Senator Islen for Abraham Lincoln. There is also a moment later on in the film between Shaw and Marco, were the confused state of Shaw's mind seems to be reflected by the blurriness of the photography; this was, apparently, unintentional, but could easily join several of the other instances of the cinematography reflecting the state of the character's minds, as the film is chocked full of shadows and strange camera angles. So what about that \"message\"? Why is this film regarded as a political satire as well as a political thriller? Is it pro or anti-communism? I've seen the 1962 version a couple of times, and I've never really seen any evidence of it promoting one political ideology over another; I think what it really criticizes, what it is really against, is politicians using people's fear as a cudgel to bludgeon their freedom, and people's patriotism to foment their own political agenda. Like the 2004 version, its criticism seems to fall equally on both sides of the aisle; unlike the 2004 version, it shows the weakness of the alleged \"enemy\" both sides provide, which is why, I think, it remains relevant, while the social commentary of the newer version, for all its slick cinematography, will date it to 2004.",

            "content": "The Manchurian Candidate is like opening up a long forgotten time capsule. It's a little bit of an embarrassment to realize it is so dated but still enjoyable. While Frank Sinatra as Marco makes far too many mistakes as an intelligence officer: telling details of the case to Eugenie (Janet Leigh), letting Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and Jocelyn Jordon (Leslie Parrish) go on their honeymoon, letting Shaw leave for his assignment without a tail, he still has the distinction of taking part in the first chop socky fight in a Hollywood movie, unless you consider the ass whooping that Spencer Tracy gave to Ernest Borgine in Bad Day at Black Rock. Also, you have to laugh out loud at the dialogue between Marco and Eugenie on the train ride.But it is all worth it to watch Angela Lansbury and James Gregory in their roles as the Washington power couple. Gregory is perfect as bully senator and buffoon husband. Lansbury is dead on as the ultra manipulative bitch, ready to sacrifice friends and foes with equal dispatch.The blurring of sides must have shocked early 1960's audiences and the films disappearance from the movie world following the Kennedy assassination clearly added to the mystique and confusion. We live in a far more jaded time and expect twists and turns and betrayals in every political movie we see. But in its day, the film packed a heady punch.Still, every time I come across the movie on TV, I will dial in, just to see the flipped out dream scene with Khigh Dheigh and the Russian and Chinese running dogs. Too far out: a brain washing garden party with an evil Chinese mastermind who laughs at the absurdity in every situation. They don't make 'em like that any more. Except maybe for Austin Powers. Or In Like Flynt. Or Casino Royale. But wait, those are comedies and this is a political thriller.OK - so dated political thrillers become funny. I can watch that.",

            "content": "One of the most prescient political thrillers ever made, John Frankenheimer's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE found itself withdrawn from circulation following the assassination of President Kennedy, not to reemerge until 1988. When it was released on home videocassette, the film found itself a new generation of admirers who would recommend it to their friends, like I did.Based on Richard Condon's incendiary novel, the movie rights were purchased by United Artists, but there were concerns over how the public would react. Although Joe McCarthy had been dead for five years, the toxic anti-communist legacy associated with his name still festered. Studio head Arthur Krim sought the advice of Frank Sinatra's then-friend Jack Kennedy himself, who encouraged them to proceed. In fact, the only concern voiced by the president was \"Who's going to play the mother?\".On THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, Frank Sinatra was not the producer, nor was he an executive producer, but that didn't stop him from trying to influence the casting. He wanted Lucille Ball to portray Mrs Iselin, but Frankenheimer was dead set on Angela Lansbury because he'd just directed her in a recent picture. Trying to win over the stubborn Sinatra, he privately screened his film for Ol' Blue Eyes, saying \"If you still want Lucy after it's over, I won't say another word.\" I think it's safe to assume that once Sinatra finished watching, he acquiesced to Frankenheimer's judgment.For the central part of Raymond Shaw, Laurence Harvey was currently hot after his Oscar nomination for ROOM AT THE TOP. But his acting style left critics and co-stars divided, with some categorizing him as wooden and mannered. Jane Fonda once described acting with Harvey \"is like acting with yourself, only worse\". In spite of all his naysayers, Harvey nevertheless launched himself into his role, going so far as to personally perform a stunt where he plunges into Central Park Lake's ice water in the middle of winter; a precursor to the polar bear dip on New Year's Day, if you will.It's 1952 in Korea where Captain Bennett Marco (Sinatra) and his platoon, which includes Sgt Raymond Shaw, are captured by the communists and whisked away to Manchuria for three days of experimental brainwashing. Immediately after the director's credit, Raymond Shaw has arrived in Washington DC to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in the course of his service.His fellow soldiers -and Marco- regard Shaw as the \"kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being\" they've ever known. Except we know that's not true, for in one of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE's first frames, it's obvious that Shaw's men hate his guts.....and vice versa. Marco himself doesn't think too highly of his subordinate either.Once the Korean war is over, Marco and his platoon -minus two members- have returned stateside to get on with their traumatized lives. The newly promoted Major Marco has been repeatedly haunted by nightmares which have him and his squad sitting in on a ladies garden club meeting somewhere in New Jersey where a lecture on horticulture is being given.It's a brilliantly conceive and edited dream sequel that juxtaposes a group of middle aged women with representatives of the Communist party from the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic. Marco wakes up screaming at the moment when Raymond Shaw strangles to death one of the two soldiers supposedly killed in combat.As for the cold, jaded Raymond Shaw, he is disgusted with how his mother and his McCarthy-like stepfather (a U. S. Senator) are blatantly exploiting his hero status to score political points. Despising both of them, he accepts a job with a New York columnist -probably patterned after Drew Pearson- to get far away from them.Meanwhile, Marco will soon find out that he's not the only member of his patrol to be having nightmares about Shaw and Communist officials, and we're treated to another superbly directed dream sequence. Not believing in coincidences, Army Intelligence now orders Marco to stay with Raymond around the clock to get to the bottom of the mystery.In doing so, Marco gets to see Shaw in a different light. Over a bottle of wine, Raymond loosens his tongue and reminisces about a young woman he deeply loved....and the role his mother played in breaking them up. Listening to Raymond's account of his Romeo and Juliet experience, Marco suddenly has empathy for him to replace the loathing he had for him during the war.Sinatra later called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE the finest motion picture he'd ever been associated with. As good as he and Laurence Harvey are, it's Angela Lansbury who steals the show as the mother from hell. Mrs Iselin is the flipside to June Cleaver, a dominant personality who's not content to simply ruin any chance of happiness for her friendless son. She also has a strange, creepy incestuous hold over him.Eleanor Iselin also emasculates her husband to the point where she does all of his thinking for him. His every public speech, his every nuance has to be submitted to her for approval. She is central to a startling revelation two-thirds into the film which I won't divulge. Let me simply say that Eleanor Iselin is as far removed from Jessica Fletcher as you can get.John Frankenheimer had a one-two punch in 1962 with BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, though the latter is clearly superior to the former. His innovative camera movements established him as director to be reckoned with. THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was the first of Frankenheimer's Sixties \"Paranoia Trilogy\", the others being SEVEN DAYS IN MAY and SECONDS. So watch it and recommend it to your friends, like I did.",

            "content": "Indeed, this movie is a classic and has a lot of things going for it. Frank Sinatra does a good job as Bennett Marco and Angela Lansbury is outstanding as Mrs. Iselin; however, Laurence Harvey was less than impressive as Raymond Shaw and really detracted from the entire experience of The Manchurian Candidate. The whole idea of this movie is a great one and deserves so much more than it got with the making of this movie; even by early-1960's standards. I can't say I've ever seen a movie by John Frankenheimer that I've really liked; in fact, The Manchurian Candidate is problem the best I've seen of him. The screenplay was yet another detracting point of this movie and was a bigger problem than Frankenheimer and Harvey put together.I cannot wait to see the remake of The Manchurian Candidate with Denzel Washington; who, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors of all time. Daniel Pyne wrote the screenplay for The Manchurian Candidate (2004) which seems like it could be a good thing since the he did the screenplays for both The Sum of All Fears and Any Given Sunday which were both quite well done. Dean Georgaris also worked on the screenplay for the remake which, in my opinion, doesn't mean a whole for either the good or the bad since his work has only been seen in Paycheck and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. Another promising aspect of the remake is Meryl Streep who, although I am anything but a fan of hers, is arguably one of the best actresses of the past 50 years. Jonathan Demme directed the remake and although he hasn't done much high profile work in the past ten years he did turn in some great work in Philadelphia (1993) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). I am curious as to how well Liev Schreiber will portray Raymond Shaw, but I suppose it all depends on his chemistry with the other actors in the film.I am very much looking forward to the remake of this classic movie and I truly hope this new generation of actors and actresses can do more with this truly awesome story.",

And just ignore the Sinatra/Leigh affair because nobody (including the writer, most likely) understands it. It exists because, well, because, if it didn't, it wouldn't exist. Case closed. Then what about the drop-dead gorgeous Josie character instantly falling in love with the insecure, troubled, and tongue-tied Raymond? Happens all the time, right?But forget those warts because the movie actually works in spades (diamonds?): the fight scene; Raymond's heart-wrenching assassination of Senator Jordan and his beloved, Josie; Raymond jumping in the lake; the political manipulation; (Heinz) 57 communists in the government; and the tragic finale. The Cold War defined the '50s and '60s, and to appreciate this film, the viewer need only allow that premise to enjoy \"The Manuchurian Candidate.\"",

It is the apex of just about all resumes involved.Laurence Harvey (who can best be described as robotic and charmless as an actor) actually appears human in this film and acts splendidly. Though better known for his earlier social climbing melodramas like Room at the Top and Butterfield 8, he actually gets to act here. ****SLIGHT SPOILER*** Though he is a conditioned assassin and does, indeed act robotic when under his little hypnotic trance, you feel for him in a way like you would for a friend. ****END SPOILER***Frank Sinatra (who should have given up on singing and concentrated solely on acting) is fantastic here. Though his previous forays into dramatic acting (From Here to Eternity, The Man With the Golden Arm, Some Came Running) were top notch....he is in fine form here also. Though Janet Leigh may seem mere window dressing here....is she really something more? Listen to her conversation on the train with Sinatra very closely and decide for yourself. Angela Lansbury is fantastic also as Commie Dearest to poor Laurence Harvey.Frank Sinatra acquired the rights to the film and had it pulled from theaters after it too closely mirrored the events of close friend JFK's assassination. He held the film out of the public eye for 25 years, not allowing it to be re-released until 1988.Having been born in 1961....I never saw this film until it was re-released in 1988 and was so transfixed the first time I saw it that I immediately rewound the tape and watched it again. (Any time I watch a film completely through and don't utter a word....it is a marvelous film. It only happened one other time...The Deer Hunter). The Manchurian Candidate loses NOTHING upon repeated viewings.This film also is often regarded as the pinnacle of director John Frankenheimer's career. Though he also did a fine job with the widely dismissed and underrated Black Sunday....this is indeed Frankenheimer's finest hour. He laces the film with tension, some necessary humor, and wild believability of a seemingly implausible plot. Everything is thrown in here....military cover-ups, suggested incest, Commie bashing on a grand McCarthyesque scale, Cold War implications.Even though the Cold War has thawed out, the film can still be seen as relevant and pertinent today. Just check out the political incompetents we have screaming at us now and you can identify with the John Iselin character of this film.Some may complain about the film's more-than-two-hour length....but I can honestly say that I can't find anything I would delete from it without lessening the quality of the final product.This film has it all. Crisp direction, a gripping story and script, great acting....and the added luck of the timing with which it was released. Don't think that's important??? Then go talk to the people who released The China Syndrome only two weeks before the nuclear mishap at Three Mile Island.The 1950s paved the way for Hollywood to be more daring with its mainstream releases in the '60s....and The Manchurian Candidate definitely qualifies as such. It took risks and probably is the best film of its kind. It dared to be different and was rewarded for its endeavors.I went to a garden party.....and I learned my lesson well.....After you watch the film....the lyrics to the song will take on relevance.

These subjects could easily form the basis of a long essay so I will stop myself from going off on one, but I must say that there is definitely something weird going on with Janet Leigh's character - she has to be a 'communist agent' or there is no point for her even appearing in the film. however, I haven't read the book so maybe this is just a case of a fully rounded romantic story being squeezed into a film for the sake of it.",
