            "content": "Nostalgic, sour and powerful, Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is one of the most memorable of all his Westerns... It's triggered off, and that's the right phrase, as it turns out, by flashback... The old device works well in the hands of the master... In fact, John Ford couldn't have got the feeling he's after in any other way... Ford seems to be mourning the Old West... It's a mixed feeling\u0097composed of pride, regret, and a sense of the inherent injustice of life, and certain forebodings about the future...When a famous elderly Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), looking every inch the revered veteran political figure, gets off a train at a small Western town with his good lady (Vera Miles) you can tell by the way his eye roves for and rests on bits of time remembered that this is very much a sentimental journey\u0085 He's come to pay his last respects to a friend of the long, long ago\u0097a small rancher in those days, played by John Wayne...Dissolve into the distant story\u0097presenting young tenderfoot lawyer Stewart, eagerly intent on bringing Eastern law-books to bear on the problems of the West\u0085 His first taste of the West is a sound beating up, by a man called Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who is a gunman employed by powerful cattlemen who oppose statehood for the Territory...Nor does Ranse find any real custom even among the law-abiding... He starts his career, in fact, as a kitchen hand in a caf\u00e9 where he's been taken by Tom Doniphon (Wayne) following his nasty experience with Liberty... Ford is at his 'domestic' best in this caf\u00e9 which is run by a Swedish pair (John Qualen and Jeannette Nolan) and where Ranse's wife-to-be is one of the employees... Stewart, wearing an apron contrasted with Wayne, pure frontiersman, is something to see in that kitchen... And there's always an edge to their meetings...It isn't hard to guess that before long the waitress, Tom's girl, is going to fail for the injured tenderfoot who takes on her education... Ranse eventually hangs up his sign in the office of the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, a typical 'character', played by Edmond O'Brien, and from then on it's the story of a territory growing up and seeking statehood, with Ranse Stoddard maturing, too, as the natural leader of 'civilized' law and order aspirations...But none of it could have happened without the removal of Liberty Valance... Ranse confronts him and the bullets fly but the bullet that actually drops him comes from another Winchester in the shadows... Ranse goes to Washington on the strength of ridding the territory of Liberty Valance, but he knows that the shot was fired by another man\u0085 It's another film about the right man being in the right place at the right time in order to advance the course of Western civilization... Skillful, undoubtedly, but in this case the right man never gets his just deserts\u0097if he ever wanted them, because the Wayne character in his way is just as much a part of the Old West as Marvin...Herein lies the bitter essence of the film... Wayne, at heart, is as contemptuous of what Stewart stands for\u0097talk and conferences and thick legal tomes as the gunman is\u0085 And through him you feel Ford saying that the hard men who had it the hardest on the frontier are soon forgotten, and some of the frontier's simple virtues have been buried with them\u0085\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is honest, unpretentious and deeply moving... In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliant\u0097from the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne's style was spare, clean and unadorned; he stood tall, very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents, Ford's, Stewart's, and Wayne's, and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...",

            "review_title": "Ford's Last Big One",
            "content": "It's a sad movie in many ways. Ford is closing the book on his meditations on progress here. The black and white photography itself is rather depressing -- most of the scenes, including all the important ones, seem to take place at night, in the dark. And what do they show us? As Edmund O'Brien puts it, the West began with Indians and buffalo and the only law was survival. Then the cattlemen moved in and took the land over and the law was that of the hired gun. Now the West has been settled by hard-working farmers and turns into a garden, once the power brokers are out of the way. But it's a wistful garden. The cactus roses have disappeared and been replaced by turnips. And the rowdy, raucous, plain-speaking heroes and villains have been replaced by pretentious blowhard politicians of the sort that Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) has become.The framing story begins with Senator Stewart and his wife, Vera Miles, coming back to Shinbone for the funeral of the uknown Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). \"Where are his boots?,\" Stewart asks upon seeing Wayne's body laid out, \"Put his boots on.\" (Ford claimed this incident was borrowed from Tom Mix's funeral.) A few of the old crowd are still around but the streets of Shinbone are empty and are a tired gray. Everyone is now old. Stewart patronizes Wayne's old retainer, Pompey (Woody Strode), giving him a handful of bills and saying, \"Pork chop money.\" Some \"garden\"!Well, if the present is filled with nostalgia, the past is lively enough, and the flashback, which is to say most of the film, is full of action and gusto. People just don't eat in John Qualen's restaurant. They eat huge platters of steaks, beans, potatoes, and deep dish apple pie. The steaks come sizzling from the vast greasy grill and are large enough to hang over the edges of the over-sized platters. Lee Marvin and his henchmen (Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin) enact their villainy with relish. John Wayne is, of course, the hero of the tale. You can tell because, in addition to his John Wayneness, he wears the only black and white outfit in the cast, which draws attention to his figure whenever it is on screen. In fact, though, Wayne does a reasonably decent job of playing Doniphon after his fall. When he enters the political meeting toward the end, banging open the swinging doors, staggering slightly, bearded, shabby, his magnificent white hat replaced by a battered gray one, slightly bleary, he looks and acts like a man who has been defeated but has not yet died, putting up a brave front with nothing left behind to prop it up. He's not bad in this scene. For the most part, though, he plays John Wayne, the resolute, proud man of principle. Edmund O'Brien is the comic town drunk and editor, the Thomas Mitchell part, and is given some amusing lines, including quotes from Henry V. (Actually O'Brien was pretty good in MGM's \"Julius Caesar,\" as Casca, making Shakepeare's lines believable enough.)The principle Doniphon represents, however, is O'Brien's second stage of the West's development. He's not only a rancher but a gunman, soon to be replaced by farmers and lawyers, but it's only at the final shootout that he realizes it. He saves Stewart's life the old-fashioned way, then gives up any plans of marriage to Vera Miles, gets drunk, and drives himself and Pompey back to the ranch he'd planned as a home. He burns the ranch down. He and Strode had a problem shooting the arrival at the ranch. Wayne lost control of the horses and Strode reached over to help. Wayne pushed him brusquely out of the way and Strode fell from the wagon. Angry, he threatened Wayne, and Wayne responded the way Wayne would respond. Strode, a former fullback, was several years younger than Wayne and in good shape. Ford stopped the altercation by shouting that the movie needed Wayne's face in one piece.For all its darkness, however, the movie reflects some of Ford's prejudices in his comic way. A pompous orator at the political meeting (John Carradine) announces in his stentorian public voice that he came here with \"a carefully prepared speech\" but is going to disregard it and speak the truth. Here he crinkles up the speech and throws it contemptuously to the floor. Someone picks the page up and uncrumples it to find it blank on both sides. The rhetoric is extremely funny -- \"The bullet-riddled body of an honest citizen?\" -- recalling Donald Meek in \"Young Mister Lincoln.\" During a carefully choreographed spontaneous demonstration after the cattlemen's candidate has been nominated, a band plays, a cowboy rides up onto the speaker's platform and twirls a lasso, and there is a brief shot of the Chairman staring appalled at the cowboy's horse lapping water out of the chairman's pitcher.But it's still a sad comment from Ford. His earlier work brimmed with hope for the future. Here, the future has arrived and it makes one long for the past. The principled lawyer is now a windbag politician. It's the way an old man might feel about life in general.It's the way anyone of maturity might feel about reviewing his past when faced with an almost unrecognizable younger person who happens to bear his name.",

            "content": "Senator James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles get a telegram from their old home in Shinbone about the death of a friend. They arrive in Shinbone and go to a sparsely attended service. When prodded a bit by the editor of the Shinbone Star, a paper he was once employed at, Stewart sits down and tells the story of just how his political career got its start.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is John Ford's final homage to the western film genre that made his reputation. It's maybe the most nostalgic of westerns he ever did. Beginning with the cast all of whom are way too old for their parts. But if you notice there's a kind of soft focus photography used on John Wayne, James Stewart, and Lee Marvin which masks their age. The skill of these players does the rest.Stewart arrives in Shinbone, a newly minted attorney who has taken Horace Greeley's advice and the stagecoach he's riding on gets held up by the local outlaw Liberty Valance and henchmen. When Stewart protests Valance, played by Lee Marvin beats him with the butt end of a silver knob whip and leaves him on the road.He's found by John Wayne who brings him to Shinbone to get medical attention. Stewart stays with restaurant owners John Qualen and Jenanette Nolan and their daughter Vera Miles who's Wayne's girl. Miles who can't even read or write takes quite a shine to the educated easterner.But Stewart and newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien keep getting on Liberty Valance's bad side, especially when they come out publicly for statehood whereas the big cattle ranchers who hire Liberty Valance and henchmen want to keep this part of the USA a territory for as long as they can. This is all leading to an inevitable showdown.Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance is one evil man. No subtle psychology here, no explanations of a mom who didn't love him or a girl that dumped him, he's just an evil guy who likes being evil. If Liberty has any redeeming qualities, despite repeated viewings of this film, I haven't found any. Marvin clearly enjoyed this part, but he never turned it into a burlesque of himself. That he waited for Cat Ballou to do.John Wayne who by this time was playing more roughhewn types than he did when he was Ringo Kid in Stagecoach, gets back to that kind of a portrayal here. He's more Ringo than he is Ethan Edwards. But that's at the beginning. Over the course of the film he changes into something like Ethan Edwards, his character from The Searchers. What happens to make him that way in fact is the story of the film. But actually the film really does belong to Stewart. He's on screen for most of it, he's the protagonist here and until almost the end, what's happening to him is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is all about. Ford once again rounds out his cast with many of his favorite players in support. Andy Devine as the cowardly marshal, John Carradine as a pompous windbag politician, Woody Strode, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin, all who had appeared in Ford films before.There are two to single out however. This was the last film Jack Pennick ever did with John Ford. You might not know his name, but he and that horse-face countenance appeared in just about every sound John Ford film there is. He has a bit role as a bartender. Pennick died after completing this film.Edmond O'Brien made his one and only appearance in this film as Dutton Peabody, founder, editor, and owner of the Shinbone Star and as he said himself, he sweeps the place out occasionally. He's a regular character in Ford films, the wise friend of the hero who has a bit of a drinking problem. Kind of like Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Like Stewart, O'Brien is an eastern immigrant who came west to be his own newspaper editor like his former boss Horace Greeley. Words are his weapons, like the law is Stewart's. It's no wonder that these two annoy Lee Marvin so. Even the fast draw hired gun can't kill public opinion. When they're both chosen as Shinbone's Delegates to the territorial convention it is O'Brien who makes the nominating speech to draft Stewart for the job. It is one of his finest bits in his long and distinguished career. It encapsulates a lot of what Ford was trying to say about progress and progress in the American west. In the end it is the farmer, the merchant, the builder of cities will eventually triumph just about anywhere. Stewart and he are as much pioneers as Wayne and the others in Shinbone are, they're just the next logical step.Progress always comes at a price. We see the price in the beginning and the end of the film, the scenes of Shinbone during the early Twentieth Century. The paved streets, the electric lights are there because of who came before and what they did. There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin, their time came and went, just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.",

            "content": "I had seen this film many years ago when I was a lot younger, and thought it was a pretty good Western. The passage of time and a keener focus reveals a lot more going on in this movie than a conflict between two good men and the killing of an outlaw gunman. Surface generalities aside, the story is about the passing of an era, with the bullets of a bygone time about to be replaced by the subtler but just as lethal machinations of the political machine.There's another way to look at the events surrounding the death of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Suppose Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) made up the story about shooting Valance to save Ransom Stoddard's hide. It would have been just another savage way of further emasculating Jimmy Stewart's character upon realizing that Hallie (Vera Miles) was never going to be his girl. After all, he wasn't above humiliating Ranse with the mean spirited paint can demonstration where his rage was more palpable. I'm not advancing that hypothesis by the way, but it's an interesting conjecture that fits, and isn't denied by any of the other facts of the story.There's a rather strange moment in the picture that director Ford opted to keep. When Stoddard addresses the town meeting about to nominate representatives to Washington, he walks from behind a desk and hits his head on the bottom of the stairwell. He looks at the stair, and without skipping a beat, keeps on talking to the audience. I wonder if it hurt?Even stranger though is the sequence when Wayne's character leaves town after drinking heavily and arrives home with his ward Pompey (Woody Strode). In town he has a black shirt, arriving at home it's a light colored one. Breaking the door in, the shirt is black again, and when Pompey saves him from the fire, it's not only light colored again, but with a set of buttons that go down to the belt line. Finally, the shirt is black again in the final scene of that sequence.For his final team up with John Wayne, Ford seems to go for caricature with many of the figures here. Most obvious is Lee Marvin's title character, Liberty Valance. He's pretty much allowed free reign as a nut case, and even though Andy Devine's usual persona as a do nothing lawman is somewhat expected, he's totally ineffective in enforcing anything in the town of Shinbone. Liberty's henchman Floyd (Strother Martin) is irritating as a whiny outlaw, and Lee Van Cleef has disappointingly too little screen time to be of consequence. Perhaps the most over the top performance is delivered by John Carradine, with macho exuberance and a name to match as Major Cassius Starbuckle.There's a lot going on in 'Liberty Valance' with repeat viewings recommended to uncover even more nuances. This is one Western that doesn't fit the typical mold, where preconceptions are shot down like cans on a fence post. It's a look at the wild west coming to an end with a blend of nostalgia, romance and grit that offers an effective glimpse at legend before succumbing to fact.",

            "content": "Some films are slow to give up their secrets first time round and need some time to elapse before they are revalued.  An opportunity to see \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" after a gap of several years turned out to be an unexpectedly rewarding experience.  It had never been one of my favourite Ford films; indeed I was always puzzled why many rate it so highly in the canon.  Its rather plain black-and-white visuals smack of low production values and it has little of the grand operatic sweep of many of his other Westerns.  I can now see that I was rather missing the point: \"Liberty Valance\" is that rare thing, a chamber Western, a quiet and elegiac reappraisal of the legends of the West made almost at the end of Ford's creative career with \"Cheyenne Autumn\" the only Western still to come.  A U.S. senator played by James Stewart returns with his wife (Vera Miles at her most attractive) to the small Western town, where, as a young man, he tied to set up a law business, to attend the funeral of the man (John Wayne) who saved his life when he tried to rid the community of its villain, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).  Ford's Westerns had always been the stuff of legend.  Now, towards the end of his career, he began to take the legend apart.  The hero is not the one who goes on to become one of the town's most illustrious sons but the quiet man who fades into the background.  It needs more than idealism to overcome evil, the film seems to be saying,  Brute force has to be countered by brute force; moreover, true worth is not always rewarded or recognised by society.  It is a bleak message that Ford is giving us.  By homing in on character and plot to a far greater extent than usual, he gives us an experience that is often more akin to filmed theatre than cinema.  There are unusually long sequences in studio built interiors, the diner, the bar and a theatre where an election adoption meeting is taking place.  Outdoor sequences are few and far between.  Instead of a large collective enemy such as marauding Indian tribes there is just the one baddy and his pair of sycophants.  The pivotal action scene where Liberty Valance receives his just deserts takes place in a dark street and has none of the climactic sense of drama to be found in such shootouts as \"My Darling Clementine\" of Zinnemann's \"High Noon\".  I can at last see that those very limitations that for so so long prevented me from appreciating \"Liberty Valance\" give it a sense of concentration and strength that the Western rarely achieves.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful and nostalgic western with two great heroes",
            "content": "Westerns aren't normally my favourite so it has to be a good one, and this one starring two legends, James Stewart & John Wayne, is surely one of the best. It ranks with me right behind High Noon.It tells the tale of an aging Washington Senator, Ranse Stoddard, who returns to Shinbone, his (sometime) hometown in the West with his wife, Hallie, for the funeral of their friend, Tom Doniphon. While there he relates his story to a journalist, telling how he came to Shinbone as a young lawyer and met there both Tom & Hallie (who was formerly Tom's sweetheart). He became famous as the man who shot the notorious bandit, Liberty Valence, which kick started his political career. However, Stoddard realizes that this career is based on a lie, and he experiences his own guilt dealing with it. The shot that actually killed Valence came from another gun, not his own. The film emphatically makes the point that perception (or rumour reported as truth) and reality are not necessarily one and the same thing. The public has lauded Stoddard all these years for a heroic deed he didn't really do.The movie has marvelous characters and a stellar cast portraying them. Both Ranse Stoddard and Tom Doniphon, though seemingly opposite, come across as sympathetic, honourable men with great personal integrity. This is a film with TWO heroes, protagonist & antagonist to one another... though jointly opposing the villainous Valence. The legendary James Stewart, such a decent man himself, is perfect in the role of the noble lawyer & Senator Ranse Stoddard, who is initially opposed to gun violence, advocating education and the rule of law. He is not too proud to don an apron and wash dishes to pay for his keep. That great Western hero, John Wayne, is forceful (as always) portraying the rough hewn Tom Doniphon. His philosophy is 'the gun is the law', and he has little respect for either book learning or law courts.Lee Marvin is downright deliciously sullen & evil as the whip wielding Liberty Valence. I love that restaurant steak scene, he's just so despicable the way he holds the terrified citizenry in his grip! Few villains elicit more outrage than his heinous acts against Dutton Peabody, the drunken editor of the Shinbone Star. Liberty Valence...what an absolutely fabulous name for this wretched snake! Can you imagine any other name in the movie title?This film seems to take a nostalgic look at the decline of the Old West and its replacement with modern civilization. Tom Doniphon of course represents the rugged frontier West. He is actually dead throughout this movie, his character revealed only through the flashback retelling of the story. By contrast, Ranse Stoddard brings from the East law and literacy to this Western town. From the time he first comes to Shinbone as a young lawyer, he teaches its inhabitants to read & write. The conflict between the old frontier ways and the new educated society based on law & order is clearly revealed in the love triangle here. Both Tom Doniphon and Ranse Stoddard court the lovely and quietly spirited Hallie (played by Vera Miles). The cactus rose symbolizes her early attraction to Tom and the Old West, the real rose her newfound romance with Ranse and his Eastern sophistication. Her courtship by Tom is eventually replaced by her marriage to Ranse, causing Tom's increased drinking and gradual decline. Other characters include the drunken Doc Willoughby and the cowardly Marshall Link Appleyard, who shrinks away from dealing with Valence. The movie is a compelling metaphor for the decline of the Old West, has a gripping plot, and surely some of the best character depictions ever. All told, it's a wonderful movie for both fans of westerns and for those who are normally not.",

First, it stars BOTH Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne--that's a lot of star power in these leads and both had done quite a few Westerns. While Wayne had done quite a few more Westerns, Stewart's all had the distinction of being exceptional films--that's quite a track record. Second, the story is unusual--and that just doesn't happy often enough in this genre. The idea of a bully intimidating the towns people ISN'T unique, but the way it was told in flashbacks and the resolution of the problem is quite creative.Because this is a John Ford directed film, it is naturally of superb quality--with excellent pacing and supporting characters (a Ford trademark of sorts). While I don't think this film is necessarily his best film with John Wayne (THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE, I think, are slightly better), it is still a great film.The only negative portion of the movie is when John Wayne goes on a bender and burns down his own home. While I understood WHY he was so upset, his reaction just seemed like a big temper tantrum and was pretty unrealistic. A minor quibble, but a quibble nonetheless.",

            "content": "\"This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\". - Maxwell Scott, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance In John Ford's most mournful tale, the legendary director asks the question \"How did this present come to be? Just how did an inferior race of men whose only weapon was that of law and books defeat the old gunslingers of the great West? Just what exactly happened to the Western heroes portrayed by John Wayne when law and order came to town? How did the wilderness turn into a garden? In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Ford depicts a world where everyone has got everything they wanted, but nobody seems happy with it\u0085 sound familiar to anyone? Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to Shinbone on a train with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to visit the funeral of an old friend named Tom Doniphon (John Wayne, remarkably the film opens where this iconic star is dead). The newspaper men have never heard of him, so why would such a powerful political figure visit the town to attend this funeral of a \"nobody\"? Through the use of a flashback, Stoddard tells us the tale of how he came to the town as a young lawyer but was immediately attacked by the psychotic villain Liberty Valance (terrifyingly played by Lee Marvin) who teaches him \"Western law\". The rest of the film tells the tale of how the man of books eventually defeated the race of the gunslinger and what sacrifices had to be made for that to happen.In truth, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is more of a melodrama than a Western. Gone are the vibrant landscapes of Ford's landmark movie The Searchers six years earlier, which was so proudly promoted as being in VISTAVISION WIDESCREEN COLOR and instead the film has given way to a bleak, claustrophobic black and white tale, with so many enclosed sets and not one shot of Monument Valley.There's a lack of a real bar scene, lack of shots of the landscape, lack of horses, lack of gunfights. It's a psychological Western, probably unlike anything ever filmed until maybe Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Why is this movie so good then? In basic terms, it's about the sadness of progression and without giving way too much away the film tells a remarkable tale which truly does examine what Ford's view of the West as promoted in his earlier work truly meant. It's a tragic and pessimistic movie but it's a rewarding one, with huge replay value and one that leaves you with so many more questions than it does answers.Do we prefer the legendary tale of our heroes or the truth? Are tales of people such as 'The Man With No Name' just more interesting than Wyatt Earp? Is living a lie as a successful guy better or worse than quietly dying as a hero? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the most complex Westerns that has ever been put on film and is a remarkable film when you consider it was directed by a guy who made his living telling grandeur tales of the American West. Well acted, very well written and is one of the most rewarding Westerns for replay value in the history of the genre.Matt Holmes www.obsessedwithfilm.com",

            "review_title": "One of the great westerns of all time",
            "content": "John Ford's 1962 film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is an ode to the end of the classic western. It is a satiric look at the civilizing of the once wild American west where Ford deliberately uses stereotypical characters and situations to undermine and reexamine the very myths that he helped create. Ford's world is one of moral certainty and untamed villainy where legends are born and cowboy heroes ride free amidst the broad natural landscapes of America's West. In the west of Liberty Valance, the hero is not made nor born, but manufactured by the media. As the editor of the Shinbone Star says; \"This is the West. When the legend becomes the fact, print the legend.\"The legend concerns lawyer Ransom Stoddard, played in typical earnest aw-shucks fashion by Jimmy Stewart. Stoddard has been brought, bruised and beaten, to the western town of Shinbone following an altercation with a gang of stagecoach highwaymen, led by arch-villain Liberty Valance. As played by Lee Marvin, Valance is deadpan and over-the top evil. His uncompromising performance is one of the pleasures of the film. With his lethal black whip and his giggling and glowering henchmen (played by Strother Martin and Lee VanCleef), Marvin is unabashedly nasty and taunting at every turn. His nemesis is that stalwart icon of the heroic west, John Wayne as Tom Doniphan. His code of honor is as solid as his skill with a six-gun. Doniphan knows that might rules the west, and will inevitably vanquish evil. But Stoddard's mission is to see that justice is done through the more civilized rule of law. Of his nemesis Valance, Stoddard says; 'I don't want to kill him, I just want to put him in jail!' Not likely, in John Ford's west.Into the mix come a parade of character actors whose vivid stereotypes have enlivened westerns for decades: Edmond O'Brien as the drunken but noble newspaper editor; Andy Devine as the whimpering, good-hearted, but cowardly sheriff; Woody Strode as the silent, noble black man, backbone of the west; and last and most essential is Vera Miles as Hallie, for whose heart our heroes compete. It is in that romantic triangle that the real heart of west may be won. In this way the Hallie, like the cactus rose she carries to Doniphan's funeral, becomes a bittersweet symbol for the loss and the hope of the new west.Ford makes Liberty Valance into a western that seems to examine itself as a western. He removes the window dressing to focus on the intricate play of characters and symbols. Gone is the Technicolor of the Searchers. This is in stark black and white. Gone are the outdoor landscapes of Ford's west. Most of the film looks like it was on the back lot, and many scenes take place indoors. He moves his camera in on faces not vistas. The world of 1960's America was changing and beginning to reexamine the usefulness of certain cultural mythologies. The new decade was about people; the grand ideals of postwar America were being reexamined and were about to become even dimmer with the assassination of President Kennedy. America was beginning to be about recognizing unique individualities, about embracing change, about individual rights, strong women, sensitive men. Ford didn't like that much, I imagine. The film's characters are flawed and cartoonish. I suspect his film was a wry satire on his own mythology and a critique of what he viewed as a softening of American society. Some critics didn't get it, while others consider this one of his more remarkable films. There is no doubt that it is nothing short of brilliant the ability to balance the elements of satire and seriousness, comedy and melodrama.As the train leaves Shinbone, the truth forever gives way to the legend. The conductor leans over to light Stoddard's cigar saying; 'Nothing is too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.' In that moment we are incredibly moved. This is, after all, about the creation of stories. But in those stories there live truths about human nature that are universal and forever.",

Since it is filmed in black and white, that will add to it being viewed as an old movie.However, I believe the characters and acting lead to a most powerful movie. While we often see heroes and heroines portrayed as perfect people, the heroes and heroines in this movie seem much more true to life. They are wonderful, but never perfect. As such the movie hits closer to home and is more heart warming than most movies.It did take a few minutes before I saw the greatness of this movie. At the start it almost seems a normal western. But as the characters unfold, coupled with excellent acting, the movie simply becomes much more. While John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart have been in many good movies, it is this movie that I likely will remember them the best.",

            "content": "Anticipating Peckinpah and Eastwood, John Ford's Hamlet-like Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance deconstructs the legends of the Old West as a place where good always triumphed over evil and civilization overcame barbarism, a myth that he helped to create. Ford's 1962 film, based on the story by Dorothy M. Johnson, looks at how myths are created and, in its complex vision of the passing of an era, both pines for the lawless open spaces and eagerly anticipates the railroads bringing paved roads, schools, and law enforcement. The film contains the classic phrase \"When truth becomes legend, print the legend\", cited by a journalist who refuses to print newly discovered facts about an incident surrounded in myth that took place years before.While there are stereotypes and all-too familiar stock characters, Liberty Valance succeeds because of strong performances by John Wayne as the macho embodiment of the old school, and Jimmy Stewart as the man who brings literacy and respect for law to the small town, though unconvincing as a young man just out of law school. Shot in black and white on a studio sound stage, the film opens with gray-haired Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at a small frontier town named Shinbone with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). Met at the train station by a reporter eager for a story, Senator Stoddard tells him that he came to attend the funeral of an old friend, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne).It is there that he reunites with Tom's dependable ranch hand Pompey (Woody Strode) and, since no one remembers Tom Doniphon, relates his story that takes us back to the time before the coming of the railroads. As Stoddard tells it, he was a young law graduate who arrived from the East in a stagecoach, following the advice \"Go West, young man, and grow up with the country\" first made in 1851 by John B. L. Soule, editor of the Terre Haute Express and incorrectly attributed to Horace Greeley. His welcome to Shinbone, however, is not what he had hoped. He is met by a sadistic bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who robs the stagecoach and beats Stoddard after he tries to protect a female passenger.Rancher Tom Doniphon finds him unconscious and brings him to Hallie, his girlfriend's house. When Stoddard recovers, he asks the Marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) to make an arrest but Doniphon soon sets him straight about how justice is done in Shinbone - with the barrel of a gun. Without money, Stoddard works in the family restaurant as a dishwasher and also for the editor of the local newspaper, a man named Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) who is overly fond of the bottle.Ransom develops an interest in Hallie and soon sets up classes to teach her and other locals how to read and write and also to convey the finer points of democracy and its institutions. Threatened by Valance and taunted by Doniphon, Stoddard goes against his ideals and learns how to shoot a gun with the help of Doniphon who \"educates\" him and shows him the error of his liberal ways.After Stoddard and Peabody defeat Valance in an election to be representatives to the Sate Senate and an editorial appears contrasting the goals of statehood with the interests of Valance and the cattlemen, Dutton is severely beaten by Valance who then baits Stoddard into a gunfight. The showdown between Stoddard and Liberty is the centerpiece of the film and the shot heard round the West allows the victor to build an entire career based on the incident.The legend of Shinbone will soon be joined by real-life icons Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill, and Kit Carson and the truth about the West with its corruption, misogyny, domination of the weak by the strong, and Native American genocide will be quietly buried. John Ford helped to romanticize the West and create the myth and, now in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, he allows us to understand its melancholy and its lie.",

Johnson, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE tells the story of Ransom Stoddard, an eastern attorney who has the misfortune to be victimized by notorious outlaw Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery. Left for dead, Stoddard is rescued by rancher Tom Doniphon and brought to the small town of Shinbone. Disgusted by the lawlessness of the area, he determines to use not a gun but the law itself to end Valance's reign of terror.Released in 1962, VALANCE was among the last films directed by John Ford, who was more closely associated with the Western than any other Hollywood director--and in one sense it certainly has the classic \"good guy vs. bad guy\" plot one expects from from a western classic. But Ford was not a superficial artist, and VALANCE is a remarkably multi-layered film that plays much deeper than you might expect.Tom Doniphon is all that is right about the west; Liberty Valance is all that is wrong. But both are part and parcel of the same code, a society in which law and order are merely words on the lips of a cowardly marshal, a world where a man either dominates through fear or is dominated by it. It is a world that is coming to an end--and Rance Stoddard is in the vanguard of the new civilization. Both Doniphon and Liberty must fall before Stoddard if the worst of the west is to be tamed.The cast is superior. James Stewart (Stoddard) and John Wayne (Doniphon) have unexpected chemistry on screen, and Lee Marvin (Valance) is easily one of the most unpleasant black-hats you could ever want to see in a western, vicious to the point of being psychotic. Supporting players Vera Miles, Andy Devine, Edmund O'Brien, and Woody Strode are equally fine. Although the script is occasionally a shade overwrought, it is laced with a very fine irony and sense of loss, and John Ford brings all the various pieces together without beating the viewer to death in the process.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "content": "With the cast of top stars this movie has, I was surprised to learn that \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" was panned by the critics when it hit theaters in April, 1962. I was serving in the Army in Germany then, and I didn't see it until years later \u2013 perhaps on TV. By then, its popularity and success had raised the views of the critics as well. European audiences took to the film much ahead of Americans. Today, I doubt there is a movie fan anywhere who doesn't think this is a first- rate movie and a great Western. That itself, should tell us of the fickleness of the field of professional critics.Movie buffs who haven't heard or read much about this movie and its making would enjoy a bonus feature that Paramount Pictures made in 2009. \"The Size of Legends: The Soul of Myth\" bonus DVD came with the DVD of the movie that I bought. My summary heading above is from that DVD \u2013 it's the title of the third chapter of seven. The DVD is a compilation of interview vignettes with film industry people. It looks at the film and its making, at John Ford and his career, at John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, and at the Western genre. In one of the interviews, a film critic comments that it was too bad that Lee Marvin hadn't come along earlier in John Ford's career \u2013 how Ford could have used him in more films. Film maker Peter Bogdanovich says, \"The fact that the movie was dismissed in America as just another pot-boiling Western shows how shallow the thinking was in critical circles. When I first saw the film, sometime in early '62 in a screening room on Broadway in New York, there were like (sic) four people in the room. Nobody cared. Nobody came to the screening. Over the years, in the '70s, it picked up a great deal of critical support, especially in Europe and France (sic).\"This film is so different from what decades of Westerns had been like up until its time. So, did the critics just presume that Westerns, in general, were a thing of the past? We know they don't enjoy the place they once had, and that's understandable. When I was a kid, growing up in the mid-20th century, we young boys played 'Cowboys and Indians' all the time. I don't recall my boys doing the same, and none of my grandkids do today. My point is that the Western theme loomed large in American culture and folklore in my childhood days. We were still quite close to the time of the wild West \u2013 Dodge City, Tombstone, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and the OK Coral. But today, we are much further away from that time and its lore. So, while occasional Westerns are made still, they have to be of the substance and quality of the best of the Westerns in the past.This movie is about the very change in the face of the West. It's about the men and women who brought about the change. It's about the fights between open range cattle ranches and farmers and growing towns. And, it's about heroes \u2013 unsung heroes that helped bring about the change and who are all but forgotten today. It's about legends and the men behind those legends. It's an excellent movie, and one that should be in any serious film collector's library. I'll share here some of the poignant comments in the bonus DVD, \"The Size of Legends.\" Scott Eyman, John Ford biographer, says that the movie tells us \"that our vision of the West. is based on \u0085 agreed upon misconceptions and half truths.\" But that this film \"insists on the importance of memory \u2013 the past. And Americans don't particularly live in the past. We're interested in what comes next, and that's not Ford's point of view. The past is the foundation upon which the future is built. And, for Ford, there is no present without the past.\"Richard Schickel, film critic and historian, says, \"The John Wayne character is simply lost in history and will remain so\u0085because the newspaper guy's not going to print the story. And that was his last hope for survival\u0085 I mean, this character who does the heroic and right thing is lost to history. And that's the sadness in the movie.\"Eyman says, \"Well, the myth starts with the title. Ransom Stoddard has built a career and a life because he's supposedly the man who shot Liberty Valence. But he knows he's a fraud. So, his entire life is kind of turning to ashes as he grows old.\" And Bogdanovich adds, \"It's exemplified by the line at the end when Vera Miles says, 'Look at it. It used to be a wilderness and now it's a garden. You must be so proud.' And he doesn't look proud at all.\"The melancholy of the closing scene of Stewart and Miles, as Ransom and Molly, says it all for me. They both knew that they would not be where they are today, but for Tom Doniphon (Wayne). They owe their marriage and their lives to him. Tom was the hero for the changes that came about. Yet no one would know his part. He would never be honored, and was already forgotten. Only they, and a few others, will never forget him. And when they are gone, so will be the memory of the real hero. That is, except for you and me and the many others who have seen this movie and can be grateful for all the Tom Doniphons for their unheralded heroics in settling the West. What a fantastic move!",

I see TMWSLV as a tale of a man stepping aside for the sake of a better man and a better world, at great personal cost.I view Tom as someone who has lived a cynical life--kill it before it kills you. With the advent of Ransom he recognizes that there is a better way, and that Ransom, by defying evil from a position of weakness, is far braver than Tom, who has merely defied evil from a position of strength. Additionally, Ransom brings about an answer to the question \"must the sword rule forever?\" with a resounding \"no,\" a denial that at first seems foolish to Tom, but who then realizes that things really should be Ransom's way.And so Tom, knowing that one of them is the better man, allows that better man to receive the fame attendant to heroism; and in fact Ransom, for daring what Tom never did dare, is the true hero of the tale. Like all honest men must, Tom steps aside for the better man, knowing what it will cost him to do what is right.An earlier reviewer said that the depiction of the politics was a parody; in fact, the politics of the early portion of the republics was even more lively (read: pugnacious) than is depicted in the film.",

            "review_title": "John Wayne as Tragic Hero",
            "content": "John Ford was the first to see the potential in John Wayne and helped  shape his image in a series of a classic westerns, including  Stagecoach, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and The Searchers.  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is the most subtle treatment of  Wayne's character, and represents one of his most fully realized roles,  approaching the tragic in its depth. The film deals with the passing of  the American West's values of freedom and independence. In many ways it  is a summation and re-examination of the whole notion of the West as  promulgated by Wayne and Ford.  The story begins at the turn of the 19th century. Senator Ransom  Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart), is traveling by train to Shinbone, the town  of his youth, for the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Stoddard is  a senior senator with presidential aspirations. Doniphon is an unknown.  Stoddard and his wife, Hallie (Vera Miles) go to the undertaker and  stand before the plain box that holds Doniphon.  Enter the local press. They must know why the Senator has gone out his  way to attend the funeral of an unknown cowhand. There is an old  stagecoach on blocks at the undertaker's\u0097a reference to the stagecoach  that marked Wayne's breakthrough role. Stewart hems and haws, dusts off  the old stage. It looks like the one that brought him to Shinbone  decades before. And so the retelling begins.  It is the 1870's. Stoddard is a young lawyer journeying by stage to  make his fortune out west. Bandits waylay the stage and Stoddard is  beaten by the eponymous Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard is the  symbol of eastern civilization, impotent in the face of Valance's  lawlessness. In the next scene we see Doniphon entering Shinbone with  the beaten Stoddard thrown into the back of his buckboard. Between the  impotent Stoddard and the lawless Valance is the figure of Doniphon,  the only man whom Valance fears, and pillar of the town, friend to the  newspaper editor, beau to Hallie, and foil to the inept marshal (Andy  Devine). Shinbone is a dysfunctional town. Legal authority, as embodied  by Devine, is cowardly, gluttonous and corrupt. Stoddard, the man with  the intellectual ability to bring law to the town, is devoid of  authority. Doniphon, the man who has the physical power and respect of  the town to give force to the law and bring order to Shinbone hews to a  code of individualism that keeps him from committing to the notion of a  civil society.  The political climate is fertile; statehood is being discussed and will  change everything, bringing the rule of law and threatening the open  range. At the local meeting to elect representatives, Valance tries to  disrupt the proceedings but is held in place by Doniphon. Stoddard  nominates Doniphon as a man uniquely qualified to represent the region.  If he accepts the nomination, he unites physical and legal authority,  bringing order to Shinbone and relegates Valance to the periphery. But  he refuses. Accepting such a role is incongruent with his notions of  individuality. Stoddard and the newspaper editor are instead elected.  Valance vows revenge. Instead of supporting Stoddard, Doniphon counsels  flight. He arranges a buckboard to take Stoddard out of town before  Valance arrives that night to have it out with him.  Doniphon's abdication leaves Stoddard with the decision: leave the town  in the clutches of Valance, or stand and challenge him. Stoddard calls  Valance out. Valance toys with him, shooting the gun out of his hand.  Stoddard picks up the gun. Valance takes aim. Stoddard fires. Valance  falls dead. Miraculously, Stoddard has liberated the town, also winning  the heart of Hallie.  Wayne goes on a bender, drinking himself into a stupor, then burns down  his home, symbolically burning his own hopes for the future. He has  lost everything. But the depth of his loss only becomes apparent later.  Stoddard goes to the state convention, heralded as \"The Man Who Shot  Liberty Valance.\" On this wave of popularity, he is elected to  represent the state in Washington, launching his career. As he is  elected, Doniphon enters the hall. He is drunk and haggard. He calls  Stoddard into a back room and confronts him.  \"You didn't shoot Valance, Pilgrim,\" he tells Stoddard, \"Think back,  Pilgrim.\"  We dissolve to the gunfight in the street, this time from Doniphon's  POV. He stands in an alley. As Valance makes his final shot, Doniphon  shoots him, the shot simultaneous with Stoddard's, killing Valence, but  in a manner without honor. In doing so, he loses his self- respect and  violates the code by which he has lived.  This illuminates his raging drunk. All is lost. Wayne approaches the  tragic in this role. He was the best, but because of the limitations of  his code, he defers acting against Valance and defers again. When  leadership comes his way, he refuses. When events force him to act, he  must do so in a manner that is dishonorable. Doniphon's only sin is  that of pride\u0097he will not stoop to the needs of the group and holds  himself aloof. For this alone, he fails and ultimately transgresses  against all he stands for.  When Stoddard and his wife return to Shinbone for the funeral, their  solemnity springs guilt. Stoddard has traded on the Valance shooting  his entire career and he knows that he has lived a lie. Ironically, the  reporter tears up the story at the end, saying \"When the legend becomes  the truth, print the legend.\"  John Ford made the western what it is today. Here he gives us movie  that is a complex and, at times sardonic, critique of the genre, while  at the same time giving Wayne his deepest, most tragic role. There was  not to be another western of equivalent depth until Clint Eastwood's  Unforgiven. It rewards repeated viewing and is a capstone to the career  of Mr. Wayne.",

But then it starts to pick up and gets better as it goes along, finishing strong. I liked the black-and-white photography. I haven't seen this on DVD but it must look good.Marvin is always effective no matter what role he plays, but especially as a villain. The usual calm Miles made herself unappealing by shouting the entire movie. Give it a rest, lady!! Stewart and Wayne are their normal selves which is good news.On the whole, the title song was more memorable than the film.",

Call Stoddard the idealist and Doniphon the realist, but don't call him the better man. In 1946, John Ford directed My Darling Clementine, perfectly blending Wayne and Henry Fonda with his usual cast of characters to create a masterwork. Sixteen years later, he put Wayne together with Stewart (plus all the ol' gang) and made another peerless film. There was a time I didn't really \"get\" John Ford and John Wayne.

            "content": "Released in 1962 and directed by John Ford, \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" stars Jimmy Stewart as an eastern lawyer who arrives in Shinbone in an unnamed western territory ripe for statehood. The idealistic \"tenderfoot\" is seriously harassed by a burly outlaw (Lee Marvin) and his followers (Lee Van Cleef & Strother Martin), yet begrudgingly defended by an honorable gunman (John Wayne). Woody Strode plays the gunman's pal while Vera Miles is on hand as the possible love interest of the two protagonists.The first time I saw this movie was circa 1994 and I expected a great Western in light of its reputation and the great cast, but I was immediately let down by the antiquated and stagy tone. Seriously, much older and better Westerns like \"Stagecoach\" (1939), \"Buffalo Bill\" (1944) and \"Broken Arrow\" (1950) seem cutting edge by comparison. Then there's the flat B&W photography, which is inexcusable for a movie released in '62, and the incongruent campy elements that have no place in a supposedly serious Western (where Edmond O'Brien & Andy Devine are most guilty).If you can get past all those negatives, however, it's great seeing Wayne & Stewart together for the first time where the former constantly refers to the latter as \"Pilgrim.\" This, by the way, is the only Wayne film where he uses the term, which is surprising in light of the overdone parodies of him saying it.Also, the story is meaty with mindfood. At its core it's a tale of fascism vs. democracy: the oppression of the strong thug over peaceable honest folk. They all despise Liberty Valance (Marvin), but they're curiously impotent against him and his gang, which actually doesn't reflect the real Old West where, generally speaking, regular citizens were tough, courageous people. A good example is the James-Younger gang, who were shot to ribbons in Northfield, Minnesota, when the townspeople got word that their bank was being robbed. Same thing happened to the Dalton Gang in Coffeyville Kansas. Both of these outlaw gangs were far larger than the 3 gunmen of \"Liberty Vanlance.\" In any case, Doniphon (Wayne) could challenge Valance and does to some degree, but since Stoddard (Stewart) is his rival concerning Hallie's affections it would be counterproductive to go overboard in assisting the man.This is a decidedly political movie as it focuses on the founding of towns, illustrating the myriad operations of government: The important parts a free press and community assemblies play, the deliberations concerning possible statehood and the powerful role of education in civilizing a settlement & purging the lawless breed.The film runs 123 minutes and was shot at Paramount Studios, Hollywood, and Thousand Oaks & Jamestown, California. The script was written by James Warner Bellah & Willis Goldbeck based on a short story by Dorothy M. Johnson.GRADE: C",

            "content": "Senator Ransom Stoddard returns with his wife to the small town where he first settled to practise law \u0096 a small town in the violent, lawless mould of the Old West.  He has returned for the funeral of his friend Tom Doniphon and takes the opportunity to talk to a journalist about the story that made him a legend and furthered his career \u0096 the fact that he shot and killed violent outlaw Liberty Valance.  As he talks the changing times become clear and some truths behind the legend are revealed.The westerns of John Ford will normally have wider issues as their underlying themes and many other Westerns have used the idea of the Old West giving way for new things as their backdrop.  Here the main plot almost appears to take second place to that backdrop as the film is clearly more about the shift from a society solving problems with a gun, to a society controlled by laws and political structure.  The film does manage to bring out a good lead plot but it is the subplot or theme that is of more interest to Ford here.This split focus has negative impacts on the main story at times and slows it down a little too much, one example being the English class taken by Stoddard which seems to be more about trumpeting the constitution than developing the plot.  On the other hand it also serves to strengthen it by taking a fairly ordinary Western plot and adding layers to it.  Happily it does the latter much more than the former.  The hand-over between the old way (Doniphon) and the new way (Stoddard) is clearly done and is handled without underestimating the importance of the `old west' as the road to the new world.  Without this aspect I think the film would have been significantly lesser and wouldn't be held in the esteem it is today.In terms of the branding of this film as a classic I think it is fair.  I wouldn't put this film in my list of favourites but it is definitely a strong entry in the cannon of work from director Ford and star Wayne \u0096 and those works definitely deserve the badge `classic'.The cast is strong and they mainly do well.  Marvin is a real presence as Valance as was required for him to pose a tangible threat alongside John Wayne.  Wayne is good and allows himself to be surpassed by time towards the end, in that he is seen to become obsolete in many ways and become a little bewildered by the world where his values are being left behind.  Stewart has to carry the majority of the message and thus has the harder job to do. Some of his scenes are a little too heavy in the shouting and browbeating department but generally he is very effective.Overall this is a solidly good Western from a great team.  Visually I'm not sure if it would have looked better in Technicolor (although it would have given another way to contrast the present and the past) as the black and white is OK, albeit a little basic feeling.  The central plot is good and is held up well (and passed) by the theme of the changing culture of the west. It is done with some sadness but does well to judge neither Stoddard or Doniphon or the times they represent.",

It is not a role I seek willingly; I'd just as soon love his films as I readily embrace many, many others, but I just cannot.There is a compact between viewer and filmmaker. They set certain rules of the world they create. We enter that world in a relaxed, open manner and what we expect is some reward. If the reward is great, we may relax our expectations on how well prepared the artificial world is.Now, viewers can differ on what constitutes that reward. For me, it is not enough to simply exercise a few jingoistic platitudes. Not enough to have no dimensionality of characters; one single, simple unelaborated plot line; one simple moral. But you, dear reader may differ, but this is not the matter of my complaint. The creation of the world behind that important compact is another thing altogether. A central characteristic of film is the vocabulary that is available to quickly transport you to the world of action, the visual shorthand. And for many years, the Western was a serviceable collection of shorthand cues. We knew we were entering an abstract world, one in which good and evil were crisply defined and in which all intents and actions could be discerned to their deepest depths in an instant. The mythical world of the Westerns were embedded in the popular imagination even before film.We don't use Westerns this way any more. That's because we have universally rejected the abject laziness of the filmmaker, the profoundly insulting pandering that goes with reliance on this device. `Fistful of Dollars' of the very next year was made to demolish this ability. No one. No one has attempted this type of western since. This was the last one which took itself seriously and demanded that the audience does so as well.That's a heavy promise. Not one I am willing to make even for someone who knows his way around. Part of this is my love of film, and the adventure of film, which leads to a sensitivity to cheaters. John Wayne was a cheating actor, one who relied on the purity of the vehicle, on its abstraction, to just as he said `act natural.' Sure, I'm fond of the persona he exploited, who isn't. But since he isn't committed or skilled enough to go halfway to me in creating a world, I'm not willing to make up the difference. The penalties on my imagination are too great.Here is an exercise. Except for a very few details (statehood, cattle barons) this story could take place anywhere, anytime. Imagine it outside the western context to see what I mean.

            "content": "With a remake in the works, it's time now to re-evaluate The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. Wikipedia informs us that the iconic film director John Ford considered it his favorite film. And critic Roger Ebert wrote that each of the ten Ford/Wayne westerns is \"... complete and self-contained in a way that approaches perfection\", and singled out Liberty Valance as \"the most pensive and thoughtful\" of the group.It begins with a much too long expository scene. Senator Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard (played by James Stewart made up to be well into his seventies) along with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) return to the frontier town of Shinbone, to attend the funeral of Stoddard's old cowboy friend, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Oddly, the town newspaper editor never heard of Doniphon, despite his legendary reputation, made clear by Stoddard, who then relates both his and Doniphon's story, at the editor's behest.The presence of a telephone at the railway station in the opening scene suggests that the story begins a little after the turn of the century, possibly 1905. Stoddard relates how he came to Shinbone years earlier as an idealistic young attorney, where he immediately was drastically assaulted by Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery. Can we assume this might have occurred 25 years earlier, perhaps around 1880? Stoddard, as a young attorney, would probably have been about 30 years old (Stewart is miscast here, as he was a little over 50 when he acted in Ford's picture).Now the location of the story is never revealed, but a big part of the plot revolves around \"homesteaders\" and \"big ranchers.\" The homesteaders (which include small landowners, small farmers, etc.) are in favor of statehood and the moneyed interests (cattle barons, etc.) oppose them. While historians inform us that for the most part the wild west was relatively non-violent (especially in comparison to what's happening today, particularly in the big cities), there was one bloody conflict, the Johnson County War, which occurred in Johnson, Wyoming, between 1889 and 1893, which may have been the model for the conflict alluded to in Liberty Valance.One glaringly major omission we notice right away is that the hated \"big ranchers\" are never seen during the entire narrative. Instead, the sadistic criminal, Liberty Valance, is made out to be their enforcer. It's hard to buy that idea since historically, the moneyed interests banded together and created an organization, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA), which hired detectives to police the range\u2014going after rustlers who were poaching on their land. But even if you buy the idea that a criminal like Valance might have ended up as some kind of private contractor for the WSGA, the idea that everyone in the town of Shinbone was a milquetoast (epitomized by the bumbling sheriff played by Andy Devine), and was afraid to stand up to someone like Valance is absurd. Here, only Tom Doniphon has the guts to stand up to Valance, along with Stoddard (who advocates a non-violent approach).After some small ranchers were falsely accused by WSGA detectives as \"rustlers,\" and were killed, the homesteaders formed their own organization, the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA). As Wikipedia informs us, the WSGA hired 23 gunmen and 4 cattle detectives and ended up assassinating the head of the NWFSGA. Various dignitaries including a State Senator joined the gunmen and in response (now read this!) the Sheriff in the nearby town of Buffalo GATHERED A POSSE OF 200 MEN and ended up cornering the WSGA men at a ranch where there was a standoff for two days. Only the intervention of Federal troops on orders from President Benjamin Harrison prevented further bloodshed. So much for wimpy homesteaders!The cowardice of the townspeople in the film is contradicted by history, and the idea that Doniphon is the only man in town who can stand up to Valance, is absurd. There were tough characters on both sides of the range war, and a character like Valance would never have been allowed to get away with terrorizing the populace as is depicted here. Why Doniphon doesn't take Valance out before the climactic duel with Stoddard, makes little sense, considering Valance is already wanted for murdering two people during a robbery (not to mention the robbery of the stagecoach and Stoddard's brutal beating, recounted by the elderly Senator as the beginning of the \"break into Act 2\").Another plot contrivance which I find hard to swallow is the idea that a Senator from the frontier would have taken up the mantle of pacifism during that time. The wimpy Stoddard is such a pacifist that he walks out after being nominated to represent the pro-Statehood forces in Congress. Why does he walk out? Because he feels guilty that he violated his pacifist precepts by shooting Liberty Valance. It's only AFTER Doniphon reveals that it was he who shot Valance, that Stoddard has a change of heart. Now his guilt is assuaged and he can accept the nomination. The only thing good about this film is the twist that it was Doniphon and not Stoddard who shot Liberty Valance. After the duel, the rest is anti-climactic. Wimpy Stoddard goes on to become Senator and Doniphon takes to the bottle, after he fails to \"get the girl.\" It's odd that macho John Wayne accepted the Tom Doniphon part. Perhaps he liked the idea that the macho Doniphon was a flawed character who could so easily self-destruct. I can't but help also suggest that \"Liberty\" is a parable about McCarthyism considering the film's release in 1962. Doniphon might have been a stand-in for McCarthy who took to the bottle after being censured by the Senate. The fight might have been justified but the methods weren't. Doniphon must pay a price\u2014and it's the pacifist, Stoddard, who is ultimately rewarded.",

The film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard returning to the western town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of one Tom Doniphon; a man unknown to the locals but somebody who meant a great deal to the senator. When asked why, the story returns to the time many years before when the younger Stoddard first visited Shinbone. On the way into town the stage coach carrying Stoddard is ambushed by a group of ruffians and he is left for dead; Doliphon rescues him and takes him into town. Here he learns that the man who attacked him was the infamous Liberty Valance. He is determined that he will bring him to trial; even though everybody warns him that the only way Valance will be brought to justice is if he is gunned down! Having lost his money he takes a job at the local restaurant and meets the woman who is to become his wife, when he learns that she can't read he offers to teach her and is soon teaching many of the townspeople, it is this job that gets him into local politics; there is a vote coming up to decide whether the territory should become a state; something opposed by the cattle barons and their hired gun Liberty Valance. Realising that a confrontation is inevitable he learns to shoot but not very well... which leads to it being quite a surprise that it is Valance who goes down when they have their shoot out. Hailed as 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' he is the hero of the town and ends up not only speaking for the town but all the people wanting statehood... and so begins his illustrious career in politics while Doliphon, the man he owes so much to, disappears into obscurity.I was rather surprised that this film was set almost entirely indoors or in the streets of Shinbone rather than amongst the magnificent scenery famously favoured by Ford. This actually works in the films favour as the more intimate settings give a claustrophobic feel; Stoddard is effectively trapped by his surroundings as much as his refusal to run; James Stewart was great in the role; bringing both vulnerability and determination to the character. While John Wayne might have got top billing he is definitely the supporting actor here; he gives his standard performance; plenty of swagger but with a good heart, which is what the character needed. Over notable performances came from Vera Miles who played the woman loved by both leads and Lee Marvin who played the sadistically villainous Valance. Fans of Westerns will no doubt spot Lee 'The Bad' van Cleef as one of Valance's henchmen although the role is unfortunately rather small. If you are a fan of Westerns this should be on your list of must see films.",

But, considering that this is a 40-year-old picture, such doozies are rare.Overall, this is an absolute classic that has aged remarkably well.Teaming the nerdy, decent Jimmy Stewart with the commanding, decent John Wayne for this story was *perfect.* So many great quotes, but probably my favorite is when Pompey, Tom Doniphan's black servant (?), apologizes to his teacher, Stewart's Stoddard, for forgetting during recitation the line in the Delcaration that all men are created equal.\"That's OK, Pompey; a lot of people forget that part,\" Stewart wryly quips -- in a movie released just as the civil rights movement was on the rise (1962).And John Wayne, as usual, is just THE MAN. When Doniphan asks Valance to pick up Doniphan's steak (after Valance had tripped Stoddard, who had been serving it), and one of Valance's toadies bends down to pick it up instead, Doniphan just kicks the toady square in the face and knocks him on his a**, barely even exerting himself or breaking stride.Later, the same toady (I think) draws a gun on Doniphan from point-blank range, and Doniphan simply TAKES THE GUN AWAY with one hand and knocks the dork down with the other, in one move.Also, the newspaper editor was a nearly-constant hoot, and the town doctor summed up my feelings whenever a (to borrow a phrase) towering b*stard dies. Rushing to the scene of Valance's shooting, he snaps, \"Whiskey, quick!\" He takes a big drink, eyes the bleeding, inert Valance, half-shrugs and says, \"Dead.\" Then walks away.See it if you haven't.

But, who really fired the fatal shot?That question is answered in a convention meeting attended by Stoddard as a delegate, where Tom Doniphan (Wayne) reveals the truth of the fatal shooting.This movie is unique in that it was one of the last of the truly great westerns shot in black and white, and the story is presented in flashback sequences.  The viewer can settle back to a truly marvelous story.",

            "content": "A Western like 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)' could only have been produced by a man reaching the twilight of his career. Suddenly, all those gunfights, bar brawls and romantic quarrels, to be found in abundance in John Ford's previous efforts, don't seem quite so exciting anymore, and all we're left with is the lingering melancholy of nostalgia, the memory of wasted years and missed opportunities. Many critics say that Ford reached full maturity with 'The Searchers (1956),' the powerful tale of a cowboy plagued with guilt and racial prejudice. However, even that film required a lighthearted romantic subplot to break up the drama, a typical Ford inclusion that rather thinned the emotional intensity of the primary narrative. 'Liberty Valance' offends similarly \u0096 Edmond O'Brien's drunkenness and Andy Devine's cowardice are clearly played for laughs \u0096 but this does little to detract from the story at the film's heart, a wistful reminiscence of the Old West, before it became civilised, and the untruths that helped build the core of the Western legend.John Wayne and James Stewart were, of course, no strangers to the Western genre. Their casting, aside from adding commercial appeal to the picture, was made with a very deliberate intention in mind \u0096 after years of defining these two actors' Western identities, Ford would then systematically break them down, to reveal the bitter truths about life, love and death in the Old West. But, in a way, Ford seems to prefer the \"uncivilised\" and \"lawless\" lands prior to the arrival of the educated man \u0096 we watch with disdain as a fast-talking politician (John Carradine) carelessly spouts lies to add dramatic effect to his speech, and refers to Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) as \"the bullet-ridden body of an honest citizen.\" Just how did the scholarly law-man, who arrives in town without a gun, manage to conquer the West, to defeat the likes of Liberty Valance? The truth is that he could only have done it with the aid of true men like Tom Doniphon (Wayne), who compromised their values and later lived to regret it.'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' comes at the cross-roads of a radical transformation in the Western genre. That same year, young director Sam Peckinpah released 'Ride the High Country (1962),' a key landmark in the development of the Revisionist Western, a subgenre that critiqued the idealistic themes of the traditional Western, and favoured realism of romanticism. Ford's film is wholly traditional in terms of film-making style, with the majority of filming taking place on studio sets rather than on location. This decision, a departure from the director's other famous Westerns (which often made excellent use of Monument Valley, Arizona) was made to stress the film's greater emphasis on characters. At the same time, however, 'Liberty Valance' is a reflection on the fallacy of Ford's Old West, a mournful footnote to decades of the director's work. Here, the villain isn't killed in a fair fight, but he's gunned down from the shadows; the hero doesn't win the girl, but dies lonely. In fact, I'm not even sure there are heroes in this story. Only legends.This is, without a doubt, one of Ford's saddest Westerns; rather than looking towards the future with hope, its characters are instead looking back with wistful regret. The West, which was once a wilderness, has been transformed into a \"garden,\" and a well-meaning politician has built a career upon an act that he can't claim to be his own. Wayne's Tom Doniphon perhaps comes closer to heroism than any other character, but he shot his foe, unseen, from a side-street, and thus his reward is not the respect and admiration of a nation, nor the love of the girl (Vera Miles) whom he adores. Instead, the courageous but foolish educated man, Ransom Stoddard (Stewart) reaped the benefits of his \"achievement,\" and his life is forever tinged with the guilt of his own success. We can almost see Stoddard's conscience tearing itself apart when the railway conductor good-naturedly quips, \"nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.\" Perhaps Stoddard did shoot Liberty Valance. The legends tell us that this is the case, and so now the truth, whatever it may be, doesn't make an ounce of difference.",

            "review_title": "A Masterfully Contemplative Western That Still Retains The Genre's Grit",
            "content": "Many--dare I say most--western-genre films align together with similar tropes: frontier justice, good vs. Evil, cowboys vs. Natives, characters with the grit/swagger needed to survive in rougher times, etc. Director John Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" has all of that--plus a masterfully contemplative (almost subversive) message regarding the \"taming of the West\". Add in acting talents such as John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles, & Lee Marvin and you have an all-time classic.For a very basic overview, \"Liberty Valence\" tells the story of Ransom Stoddard (Stewart), a lawman looking to hang his shingle in the little town of Shinbone. Before he even makes it to the city limits, he is bushwhacked and severely beaten by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valence (Marvin). Rescued by Tom Doniphan (Wayne) and tended to by Hallie (Miles), Rance brings a different sort of justice--education mixed with law and order--to Shinbone in direct contrast to Doniphan's \"shoot first and ask questions later\" approach. A Stoddard/Valence confrontation is imminent, of course, and its shocking result sets up the film's conclusion.The hallmark of this movie is the way Ford--and writers James Warner Bellah & Willis Goldbeck--expertly contrasts Stoddard's level-headed sense of justice with Doniphan's machismo. For the entire film, those two ideals are at loggerheads and both have their successes/failings. This sets up a remarkably adept finale in which viewers come to realize that both styles were needed in order to \"tame\" the Western Frontier.\"Liberty Valence\" also utilizes a few cinematic approaches that were not common for early-1960s films (and especially westerns). It features a lengthy \"introduction\", of sorts, that ultimate renders most of the viewed material as one long \"flashback\" before returning to the present in the final minutes. Wonderful book-ending. At another point, the filmmakers intentionally trick the audience by showing a \"truth\" on-screen that isn't necessarily the reality of the situation. The way the truth is ultimately revealed is a landmark moment--perhaps the film's high point. For a genre and time-period that were pretty straightforward in terms of storytelling techniques, this makes \"Liberty Valence\" stand out amongst its peers.Of course, one cannot forget the pairing of Duke Wayne and Jimmy Stewart on screen--arguably two of the greatest actors to ever ply the trade. The juxtaposition of those characters and their scenes together absolutely crackle with intensity. Miles is the consummate professional, while a more menacing villain than Marvin could likely not be found. A special shoutout should also be given to Edmund O'Brien, whose newspaper editor Dutton Peabody is an underrated gem.Truth be told, the only reason I can't give \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" the full 10/10 stars is because there were a few times in which John Ford's humor got a bit too strange for my liking or certain stretches (through remarkably few) in which it feels like a more stolid western. Overall, though, this is one of my favorite western films of all time for the way it transcends the genre while still remaining rooted in the basic components of it.",

The film is told in flashback as Stewart, in later years a prominent politician, revisits the town to bury Wayne.

All the characters John Wayne portrayed in his movies were part of the racist Western Big Lie in one way or another, never more so than here as the title character. Wayne's \"Tom Doniphon\" is a total Iago, promoting Mischief for Mischief's sake in Shinbone. He knows that he's a far better gunslinger than the local drunkard terror Liberty Valance, but he gets his jollies by giving Liberty a wide berth while vicariously enjoying the havoc Liberty and the gang wreak. If Tom had a pair, he'd have taken over the gang for himself long before this sordid tale begins, since he has no use for Readin', Writin', and Civilization himself. It's only after it finally dawns upon Tom that he lost \"his\" girl Hallie the instant she clapped eyes on Rance that Tom tardily takes out Liberty (after allowing the gratuitous torture and murders of many innocent neighbors). The mendacious plot \"twist\" here is transparent all along, since this tale is set in the West.",

Link Appleyard the most cowardly sheriff who ever lived.Tormented by Liberty Valance, Shinbone, is just another place that hasn't developed due to lack of education in the city because apparently many people can't read and in a way this contributes to everything in the city being resolved through bullets being therefore a land no law.At that moment our character Stoddard seeks to apply a system of laws in that region and make the city a recognized state and not just a territory and somehow bring progress to that region, beforehand Ransom seeks to teach the people of the region to read and write , which includes Hallie, who at one point was enchanted by Tom's bravery and now begins to fall in love with Ransom's calmness and passivity. This approach obviously makes Doniphon jealous and from there we have the beginning of a somewhat confused friendship between a man who only believes in the power of the law and another in the power of bullets.Given this introduction, what intrigued me the most about this film is that both Ransom and Tom are heroes and anti-heroes in the same film, being practically impossible to say which is the good and the bad of the story, I preferred Tom, in a way he had more honor.

            "content": "\"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that is highly revered today by critics and audiences alike, although when it was released in 1962 it wasn't met with the same enthusiasm. Ironically today it is one of John Ford's most popular films along with The Searchers and Stagecoach. Many even consider this to be Ford's masterpiece and the purest example of the Western genre and the transition it was heading for. The film's greatest appeal was that it starred James Stewart and John Wayne for the first time together. Wayne always did his best work under Ford's direction, but Stewart was the real star and had been at the height of his career for a while. I'm assuming watching the two together must have intrigued audiences at the time because I was definitely interested in catching up with this classic for that very reason. The film was shot in black and white, which I believe had a lot to do with the fact that both Wayne and Stewart were playing characters 30 years younger than their actual age, although it also gave the film a nostalgic quality to it. A nostalgia that works for this film in particular because through this character study we see a shift of power and dynamics from the traditional macho cowboy character living by the way of the gun to the literate and educated character who believes in justice and law. It also has a strong political undercurrent but it is basically a western where the power balance is shifting from one ideal to another. The black and white composition also allowed Ford to focus more on the characters and their relationship, delivering a carefully constructed character study as well. The film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at the train station of a small local town with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). This is the town where Hallie grew up in and where she met Ransom some 25 years earlier. When a local reporter asks the Senator what thy are doing in town he mentions they are in town for the funeral of a dear old friend named Tom. No one seems to recall who Tom was, except of course his personal ranch assistant Pompey (Woody Strode) who is mourning his friend's death next to the casket. Wanting to know why this mysterious man's death is so important to them, the reporter asks for an explanation. And so the flashback begins as Ransom narrates the story of how they met. He was a recently graduated lawyer at the time who was arriving from the East in search of better opportunities. Upon his arrival, his stagecoach was robbed by a bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and he was brutally beat. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) came across his unconscious body and brought him to a local family restaurant where Hallie worked at. Once he recovers, Ransom wants to press charges against Liberty but he soon discovers that isn't the way things are handled in the West. Not being able to make much use of his profession in this town, he offers his help at the restaurant and also begins educating Hallie and some local ranchers in the area. Meanwhile, Valance is still in town causing havoc everywhere he goes, and Ransom sees no other way to stop him but to face him despite his lack of expertise with guns.I'm a huge fan of the Western genre and had high expectations for this classic, but I was underwhelmed by it. I found the pacing a bit slow and the fact that the film was shot on sound stages at the studio took away what I appreciate the most about the genre: the beautiful and vast location. The film is shot mostly in enclosed spaces focusing more on the characters, and although John Wayne and James Stewart were both great, I never felt their characters were developed naturally. The transitions they go through were merely there to serve the purpose of the story which was to expose the shift of our ideals of the western world. The facts are much more boring than the legends and that is exactly how I felt about this film. The villain in this film wasn't menacing at all and he simply behaved like a grown-up bully so the tension there was missing as well. The twists in the story were rather predictable as well so the final revelation never did anything for me either. The fact that Wayne and Stewart are supposed to be playing such young characters was also a distraction. Overall I understand why this film is regarded as a classic, but I just wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I had anticipated. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"We've got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.\" (William Holden in \"The Wild Bunch\")While it's not in the Western Orthodoxy to introduce John Ford through Sam Peckinpah, the quote at least demonstrates that the revisionist spirit that deconstructed all archetypes of the Western myth fittingly started with the director that shaped them all.Indeed, for many decades, John Ford has been building the foundations of a culturally significant genre. Figures that belonged to yellowed pages from dusty books came to life: homesteaders, cattlemen (and not cowboys), marshals, desperadoes etc. Meanwhile, the big screen magnified an iconic imagery such as Monument Valley, a cavalry charge or the more colorful bar brawl in the saloon while \"Oh Dem Gold Slippers\" is playing.Whether it was lassitude, self-questioning or just that he loved Dorothy Jonson's novel, Ford drew the limits of the very frontier spirit his earlier movies exuded in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\". And the tension that inhabits the film, all in atmospheric black-and-white, derives from that opening quote. \"The Wild Bunch\" was about old-school outlaws who became sort of romantic misfits after the turn of the century, Ford' movie starts at the same period with a powerful senator Ransom Stroddes (James Stewart) who used to be a law-abiding tenderfoot, an Old West misfit.Stroddes is married to Hallie (Vera Miles) and came back to Shinbone to bury an old friend: Tom Doniphon. And from the very start, even before the flashback, it's all contrast between the two men. One has become an important and influent political figure, beloved and admired, the other has sunk into oblivion and landed in pine box that couldn't have contained the man he was 25 years ago, only mourned by two relics of that past: friend Pompey (Woody Strode) and cowardly former sherif Link Appleyard (Andy Devine).Whatever connection between Senator Stroddes and long forgotten Doniphon was, it awakens the curiosity of the local press editor, there's got to be something so important it's not to be asked nicely. And looking ready to relieve some big weight from his conscience, Stroddes takes everyone (viewers included) 25 years earlier as if Ford himself was reminiscing over his seminal Western classic and Wayne's breakthrough role...through the emblematic stagecoach.And like a second nod to 1939, we have James Stewart as a young (suspension of disbelief aiding) idealistic newcomer having a foretaste of the law of the West served in full sociopathic mode by the leather whip of local terror Liberty Valance, played by a scene-stealing Lee Marvin, and his two goons, the taciturn Lee Van Cleef and giggling Strother Martin. Valance represents violence in its most Darwinian, reminding of movies like \"Shane\" where cattlemen resorted to bullying and intimidation to coerce farmers into leaving.This conflict is the main backdrop, it shows that the worst thing about men like Valance is that the Old West made them relevant as well as the ineptitude of the good townspeople of Shinbone, from the easily-scared sheriff to the braver but inefficient press editor played by Edmund O'Brien. Stroddes could measure how much progress civilization had to make when the only remedy to the disease named Valance could only be the same use of violence and gun, only as legitimate self-defense. Needless to say that the embodiment of the noblest side of the coin is represented by Duke.Doniphon calls Stroddes 'pilgrim', initiating his iconic catchphrase, seeing him as nothing but a crusader who needs to conform because the West surely won't. Interestingly, the film doesn't side with any of them but allows each to make his point. There's something worthy of admiration in Stroddes' determination and while there's no doubt that Doniphon is the fittest to survive physically, Stroddes' ideals and values get the upper hand on the long term. But the film is more than the clash between two schools of thought, the two men are only the visible tips of the iceberg.Indeed, there's more at stakes on a macrocosmic level: a campaign for statehood in order to get the town out of the grip of cattle barons (and their enforcers) one of them being played by John Carradine. And at the risk of being heavy loaded, there's also a triangular romance centering on Hallie, the woman Doniphon loves but who seems to grow an infatuation toward Stroddes. She couldn't have more opposite men to love, an old-fashioned cowboy who compliments her looks when she's mad, offers her cactus blossoms and builds her a cottage... and a man of ideals who can build a future which means laws and education for everybody, including her.Ideals vs. Nostalgia. All these elements contribute to make the climactic shooting of Liberty Valance a pivotal and interesting moment in the film. One can notice how the rules of the duel are totally subverted when it comes to the shooting, it's not \"played fair\", it doesn't seem like something Duke or the Ford of \"My Darling Clementine\" might have permitted. One can also notice that the shooting doesn't even play like the climax and is followed by twenty minutes where an existential downfall coincide with a career rise.Finally, the classic line \"When the legend becomes fact, print the Legend\" seals the idea that legend can serve the future at the expenses of the truth, with the help of the press building itself as the fourth power and deciding what to publish or not. It's extraordinary how relevant the film is, politically speaking, showing powers in action: both legal and executive while the intricacies between the executive and the press haven't changed a bit.But Ford, in that Western that resonates as the sum of all wisdoms, is still the boss, and remains faithful to the Western spirit. After all, people might not remember or cheer for Doniphon, but we do, and that's enough to cancel the underlying pessimism of a fascinatingly meditative and thought-provoking film.",

            "content": "Recently I gained a fascination with Jimmy Stewart. It has sent me through many classic films that I liked would have never seen. I have been a big fan of westerns for a long time so I was excited to watch Stewart in the first western I had seen him in. I was not disappointed. In many ways The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a very different sort of western. It is more drama than action, more story and dialogue than shoot outs. I was impressed and amazed at the ability of the actors and film makers to show the cast as ageing citizens and then as \"younger\" versions of themselves. It was completely believable and so well done. The film has everything you could possibly imagine from a western behind the scenes and in front of the camera. Shoot outs, western town, an evil villain, romance, the train, the frontier...everything. The story is just so in depth and you become so invested in the characters that each moment in the story will have you cheering for the next. Mixing together the romance and the political story with the frontier justice angle and you have one of the best formed genre films I have seen in a very long time. On top of that it is brilliantly acted and the characters come to life in such a big way and I am saying this from someone who is NOT a John Wayne fan.I am however, a Jimmy Stewart fan. More and more by the minute in fact. Stewart brings a quiet, subtle determination to the character of Ranse. He's very serious in the role but also has that underdog fighter quality we all love about him from his previously iconic roles. He is the hero of the film and is definitely portrayed even above the legendary John Wayne. As much as I like westerns, I can't stand John Wayne most of the time. I think he comes across as pompous and vapid in his performances. However, his portrayal of rough and tumble Tom actually works in this film. The chemistry between him and Stewart is okay...I actually wanted it to be a little better considering the story focuses on their rivalry but also their budding friendship and extreme differences in personality. Wayne is his usual lumbering, slow talking self and it works this time. I still thought I was gonna pull my hair out if he said \"pilgrim\" one more time. Vera Miles is terrific as the vivacious and outspoken Hallie Stoddard. Her chemistry with both Stewart and Wayne is just okay but the romance and love triangle that drives the film works very well. Her character is terrific and a strong and driven female lead. The legendary Lee Marvin is the evil Liberty Valance and is perfect at it. Surprisingly, considering his name is in the title, he doesn't have a ton of screen time but he personifies the western villain and the scenes with him and Wayne are some of the best. Supporting cast is brilliant, with stand out performances by Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine in often comic but solid characters.While the film takes place almost entirely in the close quarters of the small western town it feels epic. Legendary director John Ford knows how to tell a story and Liberty Valance proves that. It does rest on a ton of action or large elaborate sets (and didn't even use colour) but instead is built on a solid story, intense characters, a romance that is far from easy and frontier justice. When you look at the film and start to dissect it I think you'd be shocked at how simple the film really is. Compare this movie to other westerns and I think you'd discover the budget for this was probably very small and yet is told so well that you would never know it. For fans of westerns, Wayne, Stewart, Marvin or just classic films...this is one you can't miss because it is truly outstanding. 9/10",

            "content": "Ransom Stoddard (Stewart) arrives in the unlikely named town of Shinbone having had his arse 'wupped' by local bad-guy, Liberty Valance (Marvin); but does he seek a bloody revenge on his wicked nemesis?  NO.  He seeks justice by the book.  You see, he's an attorney at law, and he desires to see civilised leanings spring up all over 'south of the Picket Wire'.  Laughable really.  The only law in the wild-west is the law of the gun.  That's what's kept tough rancher, Tom Doniphan (Wayne) alive.  And it's the only thing that will work for Stoddard... or is it?!?Ford doesn't pretend that he's got anything new here.  God no!  What he's clearly interested in is the marriage (and divorce!) of the primal and the cerebral.  He set's the whole thing in the wild-west (a genric canvas second to none) and relies on character and emotion to lead us way beyond the obvious plot.  And what he delivers is a sublime debate on the inter-dependency of force and reason.  For there are those not prepared to listen to reason and those disenfranchised by the reliance on force; and Ransom Stoddard eventually acknowledges this, embraces the essence of both codes and thereby supercedes Doniphan as the real 'hero' of the new renaissance of the American West.This is an excellent piece of metaphorical mythology.  The monochrome teases us of a 'black and white' world within which the 'reality' of life is oft contained within the shadows.  Ford's direction of comedy and drama has never been bettered by himself (not even in the somewhat ponderous 'My Darling Clementine') and the dialogue risks allowing wisdom in Doniphon's horse-poke to be matched by an often acerbic, no-nonsense Stoddard.  The characters (and the actors within them) are uniformly excellent.  Stewart never puts a foot wrong and this is the high-water mark of Wayne's dramatic capability.  The scene in which he realises his love is unrequited and subsequently drinks himself into oblivion reveals a depth few could have thought him capable of.  Special mention must also go to Edmond O'Brien's avoidance of (surely tempting) caricaturing the newspaper editor and instead creating a most believable bridge of humanity between the values of the wild west and the civilised east.  Lee Marvin's sullen rendition of the bad guy Valance is also outstanding.  And it is to Ford's credit that you are always left uncertain as to whether Valance or Doniphan was the tougher cowboy.The idea of a developing world allowing us to metaphorise our own understanding of and relationship with existence is as old as Zeus (and the God's that preceded him); and in the developing new world of the American west, nobody examined that potential better or more profoundly than John Ford.  And this film is one of the crowning moments of that examination.",

            "content": "John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a tragedy about the passing of the Old West, represented metaphorically in the passing of Tom Doniphon. That Ford chose to tell his tale of larger-than-life Tom Doniphon, a heroic figure reduced to a pair of beat-up boots and a crumpled hat, as a reminiscence of Jimmy Stewart's Ransom Stoddard only adds to the nostalgia. Senator Stoddard and his wife have come by train to Shinbone, a once rugged frontier outpost, intending to pay their respects and then slip quietly back to Washington. Waylayed by an aggressive newspaper editor who insists on knowing the story behind the story of the senator's sudden and secretive appearance in town, Stoddard agrees to tell the truth about the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.It was here in Shinbone many years ago that young lawyer Ransom Stoddard, seeking his fortune in the West, recovered from a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance, a malcontent and highwayman, well-known as a hired gun for the interests of the cattlemen who run the territory. Valance holds up the stage coach Ransom is riding, and when Ransom intervenes on behalf of a female passenger, he is beaten and whipped and left for dead beside the trail. Tom Doniphon, equally well-known for his toughness and prowess with a gun, stands on the side of law and order. It was Tom who drove out and found Ransom, bringing him into town in the back of a buckboard wagon and overseeing the details of his recovery. Stoddard swears he will have Valance brought to justice by putting him in jail, an assertion eliciting wry amusement from Tom, who chides Ransom for thinking that he can solve the problem of Liberty Valance with anything other than a gun.In time, Stoddard's greenhorn optimism and complete trust in the power of the law are tempered by the realities of frontier life. The local Marshall is a bumbling incompetent more interested in mooching his next meal than in confronting Valance, who openly defies the law by parading around town and bullying the townspeople. Valance is kept in check only by Tom Doniphon, who brandishes the threat of gun play but never has to draw his pistol because Valance fears him. Quietly, Stoddard purchases a gun and practices shooting it.When the political issue of statehood arises in the territory, Liberty Valance tries to intimidate the townspeople and secure the interests of the cattlemen, who oppose statehood, but is thwarted by Doniphon and Stoddard, who supply the muscle and the mind necessary to rouse the town into sending two pro-statehood delegates to the convention. One of these is Stoddard himself, and the other is Dutton Peabody, editor of the local newspaper, the Shinbone Star. True to form, Valance vents his frustration by trashing the newspaper office at night and thrashing Peabody to within an inch of his life. In the subsequent gunfight between Stoddard and Valance, Valance toys with Stoddard and wounds him in the right arm before Stoddard gets off an unlikely shot that kills Valance. Thus, Stoddard's reputation as \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" precedes him at the convention, where he is ridiculed by the pro-territory orator Major Cassius Starbuckle as a gun-wielding yahoo unworthy of being taken seriously as a spokesman for statehood.Anguished by what he perceives as his own betrayal of the principles of law that he so ardently espoused, Stoddard quits the convention only to find Tom Doniphon waiting for him. Here we learn that is was Doniphon himself, lurking in the shadows that fateful night, who shot Liberty Valance, timing his rifle shot to coincide with Stoddard's pistol shot. Doniphon convinces Stoddard to return to the convention, and thus begins the illustrious political career of a man whose reputation as \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is a lie that he never corrects.Until now, of course. Now we understand why the Senator wanted to slip in and out of Shinbone without fanfare, precisely to avoid the circumstances that have led to his confessional tale. But Stoddard is too moral a man to leave so large a lie uncorrected. Hearing the truth for the first time, the newspaper editor refuses to print it, preferring the legend to the reality.The film ultimately becomes a statement about the sadness of progress, and how the rough and ready life of the colorful frontier West gives way to a more modern world marked not by gun play but by wordplay, one safer but blander.The final shot of the film is the train taking Senator Stoddard and his wife back to Washington. We see it from the back, pulling away and leaving us behind. Chatting animatedly aboard the train, the senator and his wife express an eagerness to return to Shinbone, but we know that they probably never will.",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 238I came to a realization about John Ford watching this film. He's a legendary director who can create interesting plots, fill them with meaning and themes, provoke strong performances from his cast, and keep a viewer interested for 2 hours. But between this and The Searchers, I felt something missing. This film is shot in a very conventional manner, so visually it didn't stand out. And there was just a lack of... heart. The minimal soundtrack played a role in that matter. So to conclude, this is a well-made movie with strong features, that played it safe and didn't take many risks.There's very little to spoil in this movie: you know how it ends from the title. There's only really one plot point worth hiding. But knowing that puts me in a different state of movie-watching mind: the point of the film is not what happens, but why and how. The great beginning, set much after the bulk of the film, cemented that idea. We know the fate of all the characters. But how did they get there? This brings me to the strongest point: the dynamic between Ransom and Doniphon, played by the legendary James Stewart and John Wayne, respectively. Ransom is the man of words, a lawyer who wants to solve his problems diplomatically. Doniphon is the man of action, who realizes the importance of guns and confidence in the West. Between them is Hallie, and a sort of triangle develops. It's interesting to see how that love plays out, especially when the other tug-of-war, Ransom's struggle to maintain his principles also unfolds. As I've said, the cast is excellent. The two leads are excellent, in a cool conflict with each other. Vera Miles is, as Wayne says, \"kinda cute when she's angry\", and has some good scenes. Mr. Peabody and the Marshall are excellent characters fully realized to their comic, and dramatic, potential. But the acting star is Lee Marvin, in the role of the titular Valence. He's a bad, bad man and supremely played.I like to review Ford's films, as the meaning he puts into them make great analysis and reviews. If you like westerns, you probably love him, and if you don't know him you need to see his films. They could just be that much better if he would take a risk. 8.1/10",

And whereas myths are purely fictional, legends do have authenticity about them rooted deeply in real-life events. Is Jesus Christ a legend or a myth? Is Robin Hood? That we will never know for sure because once it becomes a fact it loses its magic of gloriousness that surrounded it - such was the legend of the man who shot Liberty Valance.I never fancied Westerns, no matter how many I have watched and tried to I just couldn't see anything special about them when it comes to narrative, plot or any afterthoughts - they were all shallow and superficial shootouts, with brave men riding on horses through the beautiful landscapes of the Wild West and fighting big and scary villains along the way; if you put it into perspective you'll get most of today's superhero flicks or other popular big budget blockbusters that I totally hate with all my guts. But not all of them.John Ford's \"The man who shot Liberty Valance\" is an exception to the rule and a fine one too. It has all of the qualities of a Western but so many more as well; it tells a story of a man with principles but eager to throw them out in order to protect them and beside him are people willing to sacrifice a lot for true justice to be held. It's the same old \"one man against another\" formula played out stupendously through the prism of talents of John Wayne, James Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin and many others who stand out and proudly proclaim what this story is here for - to make a difference, to make a change.It happens so very often when people just don't want to change their lifestyle, change themselves, speak out, stand up and make their voice be heard in this white noise of dumbness all around, preferring to feed off legends instead. Let them be so, it's their choice. I believe that only those who do speak out will become the ones to be talked about in legends of their own.",

In many ways, this tribute (which includes, stagecoach and Tie a Yellow Ribbon) personifies the early pioneers of old west. Ironically it sets the stage for many others which also purportedly 'represenated' authentic characters of the era. During the age of John Ford, few in the audience ever cared to peer beyond the colloid and never doubted it's authentic veneer. Yet, few could expect anything less when you have John Wayne and James Stewart up on the marquee. Those film greats were followed by Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, Woode Strode and of course Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance. The story is of a idealistic young man (James Steward) who is challenged by a vicious rouge character (Marvin) and his gang, (Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin). Steward is supported by rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) in a quest for law and order. If one looks closely, you'll see that Steward is no gunfighter and Wayne does not necessarily wears a white hat. The title song, \"The Man who Liberty Valance\" which enthralled radio audiences, was sung by none other than Gene Pitney. As with any Ford Film. the window dressing of the old west can be overlook if one seeks only entertainment, which this film adequately provides. ***",

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is excellently-scripted, and well-directed (though I think this may not represent Ford's best work). The two aspects that sustained my interest for two hours are the screenplay, and the acting.The screenplay is able to effectively bring out the weirdly interesting characters involved. Liberty Valance is fearsome enough to make viewers feel jittery, while we root for the rest of the cast. Speaking of that, the casting is spot-on. James Stewart, John Wayne, and Lee Marvin are the right actors in their roles, giving incredibly delicious performances throughout. The chemistry between the supporting cast and the main actors are brilliant, everyone knows what they're doing, and they did a real fine job.I need to watch more Westerns to be exposed to the way such films are made. So far none has let me down. Although Liberty Valance is splendid, I rate Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West as the best I've ever laid my eyes on. But both represent what is so good about the Westerns, and they show us what we have been missing in our cinemas for decades.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)**** (out of 4) John Ford's classic about a lawyer (James Stewart) who comes out West to discover that his idea of law and order doesn't carry any weight. This is especially proved when he falls victim to a brutal attack by the thug Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who doesn't fear a law book but only a gun, which is told to the lawyer by gunslinger Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). If THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE isn't the greatest Western ever made it's certainly right up there and I certainly think it's the greatest Western from Ford. There's no question that the director made all sorts of great films but this one here is just pure gold thanks in large part to its story and the wonderful direction but of course there's also the terrific cast that carries everything. Yes, both Wayne and Stewart are too old for their parts but this here really doesn't matter or hamper the film because both of them are just so great in the roles that fans want to see them in. Wayne is playing the typical tough guy, Stewart the lovable weak fellow and then we have Marvin turning in one of the strongest performances of his career as the hated Valance. The three actors are simply so excellent in their roles that you can't help but constantly have a smile on your face and especially during a sequence early in the picture when the three get into an argument inside a restaurant. This sequence here has to go down as one of the greatest and most tense things Ford ever did. The supporting cast also features excellent work from the likes of Vera Miles, John Carradine, Andy Devine, Ken Murray, Edmond O'Brien, Woody Strode and not to mention Marvin's sidekicks played by Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef. The B&W cinematography really captures the era that the film is set and I really don't think the story would have worked as well in color. The bit about \"printing the legend\" works so well here because of the B&W. The film has some great tension but there's also a lot of heart, comedy and a couple great beatings. The film is certainly one of the highlights of the genre.",

            "content": "I almost tried, at least at first (err, for the most part) to resist the worthwhile performance/casting for the character of Tom Doniphan by John Wayne. While it's Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) who has much of the focal point as the lead of the picture, Doniphan (not that I'll be spoiling much saying this) *is* the man of the title, and it's really in the last section of the picture, following the typical climax of the shoot-out, where Doniphan becomes much more captivating and even poignant in his own personal manly tragedy. So far, in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Doniphan has been archetypal practically to a fault, as the true-blue cowboy who pressures and warns the newcomer lawyer Stoddard- who's only in town because he got the hell beat out of him by Valance (Lee Marvin), and who thinks the only way to settle things is by a gun, not by the law. But when the final showdown happens, Ford handles all of this perfectly, as Doniphan sort of self-destructs for a spell, as he drinks himself stupid and basically burns down his house (one might think back to La Strada for a similar masculine display of self-pittance, or even the Searchers). However, there's also an even greater moment when Doniphan himself tells Stoddard outright- and this is when Wayne actually fully delivered the goods- to go to Washington to get full- on into politics. It takes a lot to make a character who's up till then seemed to be the weak link in the picture, but it's a link that grows stronger and more in tune with the most famous line \"when legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" Yet I'm sure Ford knew that he couldn't just rely on the bull-headed force of nature that's more often than not given such a presence by Wayne. So he casts James Stewart and Lee Marvin in the white and black roles of morality, respectively, in this small Western town where the Marshall (Andy Devine) is a hapless tubby with a big heart but little guts. Stewart breathes the full life-force that he can as the sort of good-hearted, conflicted hero of conscience that he made a staple in his career; however much this isn't as pat as a Capra movie, there is the sense that Stewart is right at home in playing Stoddard, who is generous and intelligent and a born leader, but doesn't ever like to get pushed around. So on the flip-side we get Marvin's Valance, who is arguably one of the great, nasty villains in any Western, who's out to make the picket-lines around the town into chaos if he can, and as a kind of sadistic bully with his cantankerous whip he gets fear out of everyone- that is, except Doniphan and Stoddard. There's actually one really devastating set of scenes involving the newspaperman (Edmond O'Brien, brilliant as Peabody) who drunk after being nominated for a political post gets his place of work torn to pieces, and whipped as well. Ford so far has set up so brilliantly the characters that by then its not some exploitive sequence, but where the lines of black and white become even more pronounced...and eventually, after the shoot- out (which in and of itself is quite intense), the lines become a little grayer.So is the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance a must-see? If you're wanting to see all of the essential Westerns, I'd say without a doubt. The cast assembled plays off their respective parts, and each other, with big doses of humor (Marshall), grit (Lee Van Cleef), compassion (Vera Miles's Hallie), and machismo (Wayne). While I wouldn't say Duke is totally spot-on, at least all the way through, it does provide Stewart and Marvin with unforgettable turns, and it has a very fine message to boot amid certain histrionics. Amid the subtle genre-bending motions of the plot and characters, and Ford's dead-on, superlatively-tuned style of traditional film-making, there's even bits about what it is to live in a community in America, and what the highs and lows of the society bring out in everyone, for better or worse.

            "content": "\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962) is essentially John Ford's \"High Noon\". A collection of western film conventions operating on dual levels; at once both reverent and cynical. Although not his last film it is considered the final film in which he invested much of himself; turning it into a commentary on the mythic topics and worlds of his preceding films.Superficially it is yet another \"passing of the old frontier\" movie and it literally juxtaposes Ford's mythic west (an extended flashback) with a recognizably modern west (which bookends the story and serves as a sort of commentary or voice-over). Ford is showing the viewer what happens when individuality is subordinated to the common good; then asking whether the results (i.e. progress) are worth what has been lost. And he stacks the deck a bit, undercutting his celebration of untrammeled individualism by including an individual more corrosive than mythic.Yet \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is not a simple superficial film; despite often being dismissed by those who fail to pick up on its multi-dimensionality. So here are some random things to look for as you view this great film: Note how like a myth, pretty much everything about the early Shinbone is a larger than life parody of film western conventions. Liberty Valance's evil, the cowardly bluster and bumbling incompetence of the sheriff (Andy Devine), the size of the steaks, the perpetually intoxicated newspaperman (Edmund O'Brien) with a passion for the truth. And contrast all this with the modern town: \"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" Watch throughout for the use of paper to punctuate the moments of extreme melodrama. Valance tears up a law book and later stuffs a newspaper into the editor's mouth. Rance (James Stewart) crumples up the newspaper he is holding when told about Valance's plans. Scott (the modern editor) crumples up his notes and discards the truth for the myth.Observe how the lawless evil of the early Shinbone is associated with the night while the modern town is all about the day. The overplayed Valance is a nocturnal figure; so extreme as to be much like a nightmare or hallucination to those who encounter him. And he is typically accompanied by his cackling and squealing sidekick/minion Floyd (Strother Martin); a character almost surreal in his sleaziness.Doniphon (John Wayne) and Liberty are linked to horses; not to the train, which is the catalyst for change, nor to the stagecoach or wagon. Individual horses are the means of mobility for the individualist, the rest of the characters get around by public transport. Liberty is hauled around in a wagon for his final trip to graveyard. A drunken Doniphon (not capable of riding his own horse) is driven back to his ranch in Pompey's (Woody Strode) wagon. The robber and the horseman are both becoming obsolete.Note Fords use in the score of what some call the \"Ann Rutledge Theme,\" (from his 1939 film \"Young Mr. Lincoln\"). Hallie (Vera Miles) is Tom Doniphon's Anne Rutledge, the circumstances of their estrangement are different but equally permanent. And the music first plays when Hallie visits Tom's abandoned ranch at the beginning of the film. During the extended flashback you hear it several times as the romance between Hallie and Ranse progresses; implicitly signaling a receding of the Hallie-Tom connection.The Hallie-Tom estrangement gives the film a great deal of depth. It is a mirror image of the events in \"East of Eden\", as this time the heroine gives up what she had been denying herself and embraces what she thinks she should be. Don't misinterpret Tom's motivation toward Hallie, he is not doing things to win Hallie's love but because he loves Hallie (communicated by the early scene where he watches her working in the kitchen). The former motivation would be simplistic; the latter opens up a host of interesting and ironic interpretations.Miles essentially plays the same character she played for Ford six years earlier in \"The Searchers\" (1956). Laurie was Ford's most enduring heroine and if you watch that film you can see why he choose a reprise for \"Liberty Valance\". And while not as fresh looking as in the earlier film Miles is able to sell the part. Wayne could not have passed for her love interest in the earlier film and can barely do so here. That he is able to make the romantic elements credible is a good argument for calling this his finest performance; at the very least the segments immediately following the shooting are his all-time best work. His Ethan Edwards character in the earlier film had also willingly given up a girl he loved in the interest of her happiness. Miles is better in her scenes with Wayne than with Stewart. The classics are the occasions when Tom tells Hallie how pretty she is when angry. Her reaction the second time is meant to be contrasted with her earlier occasion, and to subtly convey to the viewer Hallie's growth since the introduction of Ranse into the Shinbone community.Miles in this film has always reminded me physically of Shirley Jones in \"Oklahoma\", and it is interesting how watching these two actresses juggle two men soon achieves a dominance over the other dynamics in both features. Neither were typical Hollywood glamour queens but their well-scrubbed persona's were a nice fit for playing this type of heroine. Note also how as in \"The Searchers\" Ford frames Wayne in a doorway for his final parting shot, symbolically separating him from being a part of the each film's nuclear family.Ford ends his bleakest film by revealing that just as Ranse has pretended to be the man who shot Liberty Valance, Hallie has pretended to love Ranse more than she loves Tom. Each has paid a high price for this.",

            "content": "Perhaps it's just because I'm not really into the genre but I just wouldn't exactly call this movie one that stands out or one that is being John Wayne's, James Stewart, or John Ford's best one, within the western genre.This is more the sort of western that is 'clean' and entertaining, rather than purely realistic and gritty. I personally really prefer a western that is being more straight-forward and gritty but simple fact remains that the sort of westerns like this movie, were still far more popular at the time and still had a big audience for it. The more typical John Wayne Americana type of westerns, in which guns form the solution to every problem and in which the hero always saves the day.The story of this movie really isn't that solid or interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make its 2 hours of running time good and entertaining to watch, throughout. In essence it's a story about reasoning versus violence, in which James Stewart tries to resolve everything with doing things by the book and law, while the Wayne character of course prefers to shoot first and ask questions later, so to speak. They try to convince each other that their way is the best and only one to follow, while in the mean time they are also fighting over a girl. I must say, the story sounds quite good actually the way I'm making it sound out now but in the movie it just never gets edgy enough and there never ever is a real clash between the two very different main characters, since neither Wayne nor Stewart are the bad guys of this movie.It besides is a slowly told movie, that takes its time to get to the point. As a result the movie is being filled with some overlong sequences, that in the long run hardly add anything to the overall end result. It all started out interesting enough with its non-linear story-telling at the beginning but this just seems a gimmick to make the story feel more original, while it in fact actually doesn't add much to the actual story.John Wayne never really have been known as a great actor and I also don't feel that this movie features his best ever performance. He's so wooden and purely and only relying on his charisma, while playing his role. Thank goodness things really get spiced up by Lee Marvin who plays a great villain. And when Lee Van Cleef is one of your henchmen, you know he's a very bad guy, you better not mess around with. Lee Marvin really seemed to be having lots of fun playing the hardened villain, of which the movie truly benefits.Of course it's not being an horrible movie by any means but I just feel that it's one that doesn't really stand out in any way and perhaps isn't really worthy of its reputation. But maybe you just have to be a true fan of the genre to fully appreciate this movie. 7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Watching it now for the first time, you may even start wondering what all the fuss was about; the story only attains whatever importance it has in the last 10 minutes (a quite ironic comment on myth-making)). It's too long, and there are sequences (like the territorial session) that ramble on for no obvious reason. And James Stewart is about 20 years too old for his role. But John Wayne gives a standout performance and Lee Marvin provides some lively (and much-needed) villainy. I wish he was in the film more! (**1/2)",

But I never got to see it, so when I spotted a copy - 'starring John Wayne and James Stewart' - in a bargain bin, I bought it. Classic? This 'classic' covers every clich\u00e9 in a Western and then some. I really have no idea how it got its reputation or whether I somehow misheard something along the lines of 'it should have been a classic, but Ford got it wrong.' John Wayne, as far as this reviewer is concerned is can't act. In a John Wayne film, you get John Wayne, whether in a saddle, commanding a boat or in whatever other situation you find yourself in. I suppose that's fine if you like 'the John Wayne performance' but if like me it does nothing for you, you're scuppered. To call his acting one-dimensional would be charitable. James Stewart suffers from a similar affliction, but as, as a rule, the James Stewart persona isn't - for this man at least - as irritating as the John Wayne persona, it usually gets a pass. However, he does tend to play the same character. We also get the Swedish immigrant couple, the drunken newspaper editor who might be an old soak but by jimminy he's honest, the cowardly sheriff and, in Strother Martin, the cowardly sidekick. About the only thing worth your while here is Lee Marvin's baddie, and Lord is he a baddie. But apart from that, forget it. If you haven't seen this for a while and have fond memories, do yourself a favour: don't watch it, just stick with the memories.",

            "content": "I either love or hate John Ford's early movies; there's no middle ground. Anyone who admired F. W. Murnau as much as Ford had to be touched by the great man's fire, but many of Ford's well-regarded films, \"The Iron Horse,\" \"Young Mr. Lincoln,\" and \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,\" seem dreadfully mannered and stylized compared to \"3 Bad Men,\" \"Stagecoach,\" \"My Darling Clementine,\" and \"Fort Apache.\" After 1948 Ford embraced his worst idiosyncrasies, as did his co-dependent John Wayne, who became an enthusiastic promoter of his own \"legend.\"Not heeding the glaring defects in Ford's worst films, the film school generation of directors in the 1970s over-praised films that were rightfully panned by the critics. One of the travesties they promoted to \"classic\" status is Ford's adaptation of the interesting Dorothy Johnson short story \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\"In Johnson's story \"Rance\" Foster is an insufferable eastern snob itching to face Liberty Valance in a gun duel because the outlaw had savagely beat him for no reason, injuring his sense of eastern superiority. Cowboy Bert Burricane saves him from dying of thirst on the prairie, but he repays Burricane with indifference and, on his own, begins pistol practice for his showdown with Valance. He dislikes everyone in town because he's humiliated at having to take a swamper's job in a saloon. And although Burricane's girl Hallie is drawn to Rance because of his education, he conceals his attraction for her because he's embarrassed to show interest in an illiterate girl he's teaching to read. When Valance comes to town Rance jumps at the opportunity to meet the outlaw and gain respect in the eyes of others even if it means his death. Burricane kills Valance from a concealed vantage point just as the two men fire, making it look as if Rance killed Valance. When Burricane tells Rance he killed Valance, he explains that he did it because he loves Hallie enough to let her have the man she wants. After recovering from a wound he received in the gunfight, Rance marries Hallie and is elected Senator in part because of publicity generated by the shooting. Years later when Burricane dies alone and forgotten, Rance returns to show respect for the man who changed him.But instead of making James Stewart's character, Rance Stoddard, an eastern snob, Ford and his writers make him an idealistic young lawyer, uncomfortable with guns, who is beaten by Valance when he stands up for fellow passengers in a stagecoach holdup, and who continues to seek remedy through the law until forced into one desperate, violent act. John Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon, doesn't save Rance from his macho pride for Hallie's sake. He maintains his usual tough guy persona, urging Stoddard to get a gun, a man who is disappointed to find, when he loses Hallie after killing Valance, that the gunman's day is past. In Johnson's story the tough westerner ironically must teach the easterner to be a gentle man. But that's too radical a concept for Ford and the writers, who subvert Johnson's irony to make her story fit the western conventions she was trying to deflate.But aside from the watered-down story, there are still the seemingly obligatory Ford inanities. Wayne and Stewart were certainly too old for their parts, and O. Z. Whitehead, who was one of Ford's Stock Company in '40s, plays a sullen, truant teenager in Stoddard's school, even though he was in his fifties. Then there is Woody Strode's \"Yassuh, Boss\" portrayal of Tom Doniphon's \"boy\" Pompey, and Edmund O'Brien's bombastic, drunken newspaper editor, an over-the-top ripoff of Thomas Mitchell's Doc Boone from \"Stagecoach.\" And Ford insists yet again on having John Qualen annoy us with his best stage-Swedish accent.",

            "content": "Apparently panned upon its release, John Ford's film would quickly look even more outdated with the arrival of the man with no name just a year or too later, and yet over the years the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance has earned itself quite a reputation. In all honesty, it's easier to see how it was originally panned than it is to understand the praise that is now routinely heaped upon it. That's not to say the film is particularly bad \u0096 it's just not particularly great and, apart from the hard work of a solid cast, fails to outshine any number of westerns from the fifties and sixties.A too-old James Stewart plays a lawyer fresh out of law school who is robbed by the villainous Valance (Lee Marvin in the kind of role he was born to play) and ends up washing dishes in the homely caf\u00e9 of Swedish immigrants Nora and Peter Ericson, and their illiterate but comely daughter Hallie (a too-old Vera Miles). Of course it's not long before Stewart and Miles are exchanging affectionate glances across a pile of soapy dishes, much to the discomfort of big Tom Doniphon (a too-old John Wayne)who also has plans for Hallie.At times this looks more like a stage play than a film, and the pace is a little too leisurely for my liking. There's nothing wrong with a deliberate pace if the time is used to add depth to the characters, but when it's used to give us a potted version of the American legal system and US constitution this viewer's eyes quickly start to glaze over. The roles are clearly defined here: Stewart is the optimistic face of the new west, bringing justice and literacy to the backwards west, while Wayne and Marvin are symbols (good and bad) of the old west that must inevitably move aside for the new.As usual with Ford, there's a terrific cast of supporting players. Amongst them Edmund O'Brien and Andy Devine stand out, O'Brien for managing to inject some recognisable human traits into a character who might otherwise have been a typical stereotype, and scratchy-voiced Devine for the distracting annoyance of his cowardly buffoon of a sheriff. Woody Strode also delivers a typical performance of quiet dignity as Wayne's faithful sidekick. For his part, Wayne, although little more than a supporting character for much of the time, is always a welcome presence when he appears on the screen. Only when he is centre stage does the film really come alive.",

A local journalist asks, why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington to attend the funeral of a local rancher. A Senator begins the story of a young and idealistic lawyer, which has occurred 25 years ago. His stagecoach is robbed by Liberty Valance and his gang. When he takes Valance to task, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. In Shinbone, the townspeople help him with his injuries. There is a cowardly sheriff, beautiful waitress and charming rancher, who is the only man willing to stand up to the cruel Valance...Roughly speaking, this is a story about the conflict of a resolute mind and raw power. However, an interesting plot follows the political evolution in one small town.Can a problem be resolved with the talk (by law) or with guns?Although the story occasionally turns into melodrama, Mr. Ford did not underestimate the structure of a classic western. His ironic reference is complementary with intriguing appearances of the main protagonists. An urban legend is hiding the truth, which is a milestone in the lives of the protagonists. The atmosphere is very sad and somewhat poetic. Characterization is very good.James Stewart as Ransom \"Ranse\" Stoddard is a bit confused, but brave and determined at the same time. His character is the epitome of honesty and justice in this film. I think that his appearance is irritating, but Mr. Stewart was again very convincing. Vera Miles as Hallie Stoddard is a very beautiful when she gets angry. She is a girl who has more courage than a local sheriff.John Wayne as Tom Doniphon is a charming and resourceful hero of this story. However, he will not graciously ride into the sunset at the end of this film. His character is, though aware that he has changed the course of a local history, suffocated in their own self-esteem and irony.

He and John Wayne (who is extremely sweet) give Vera Miles a tough choice to make. The first of the swaggering monotone \"Howdy, Pilgrim\" parts marks the final phase of John's career.

Marvin was one of our best film actors, and did a lot of TV work to hone his skills before Liberty Valance was made in 1961(released 1962).Added to the other great qualities of this film is the theme song, sung by Gene Pitney.

While on the surface, it deals with how the 'wrong man' gets the credit for the death of the thug who enforced the will of the vested interests who profit from blocking the march of civilisation and law and order towards the town of Shinbone while the true 'hero' dies in obscurity, beneath the surface it argues the need for a 'dark knight', who can do the things that need to be done, legal or otherwise, that will be required so justice and peace can take hold in a lawless, violent land and time. John Wayne's Tom Doniphon can clearly see that James Stewart's Rance Stoddard is the man the people need to inspire them to stand up for themselves and bring progress and order into their lives, although he also understands that Liberty Valance have to be forcibly removed from the equation. By the time the moment arrives that he makes the decision to eliminate Valance himself, he also realises that not only will he have to live with the guilt of the crime he commits, but that he will lose his girl to Stoddard in the process. As if that wasn't enough, he ultimately has to confess the truth to Stoddard in order to finally push him into fulfilling his role in the deception (granted, the viewer needs the confession scene to make sense of the movie) surrounding Valance's demise, using his reputation as 'The Man who shot Libery Valance' to get elected. In addition, the movie also manages to comment on how the 'legend' of the West has been written by ignoring the unpleasant 'truth' of how it was actually won. So, the hero the people needs depends on the help of the hero they actually deserve. Curiously, Christopher Nolan has apparently never heard of this film!

Maybe that's why, as a non-American, I like this one so much, for the focus of the film is not Wayne's rugged cowboy, but James Stewart's liberal, modern, lawyer. Much of the ground covered in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance had been considered before. The history of the homesetters and the legitimacy of their claims against the men who had originally tamed the area was covered in \"Shane\", while the arrival of an Eastern softie in the wildman's West was already a well-trodden path (eg \"Dallas\"), but by trading grand cinematic shot-making for characterisation and personal detail, John Ford went a step beyond those films in terms of even-handedness and depth of understanding. A film like \"Shane\" provided only clues as to how the West was turned into proper mass-settlement, the message effectively being by a combination of honest toil and honourable violence. On the face of it, \"Liberty Valance\" had the same combination, but with a new and much more revealing emphasis on the role of legal and political institutions, and, most importantly of all, of railroads. What takes \"Liberty Valance\" a level beyond, however, is its sense of ambiguity. Which is the more sympathetic - Stewart's noble but naive humanity or Wayne's equally noble (but beautifully unglamourised) hard cynicism? So many aspects of the film represent its uncertainty on this one key point, and almost all resurface in the final scene. If the film has two main aspects in its double-header between Stewart and Wayne, the first concerns their values and the second their relationship with Hallie. In the final scene we see both. We see Stewart's two-fold sense of guilt at having compromised his beliefs and then taken the credit not only for someone else's deed, but for an act to which he is naturally opposed, and we see the sadness and remaining uncertainty in Hallie. The impression remains that she might have made the wrong choice, emphasised by the resignation in Stewart when he asks her about the cactus rose. Throughout the film, although we sympathise with Wayne, it is natural to support Stewart's inadvertent romance - he is more youthful, and can open her eyes in ways which the old cowboy cannot. Yet, at the end, the question remains, was she any happier? Does an honest, real working life, living by the tenets of common sense, offer more than intellectual fulfillment, expanded horizons and being true to abstracts of right and wrong? Did any of the three main characters get it right? All of them end the film less certain, and probably less happy than they were at the outset, but was there anyway for them to have avoided making the choice? \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" gives no definitive answers, but it asks the questions in comprehensive style.",

Stewart's character gets the girl but also gets stuck with this reputation he hates but he cant do anything about it.

When Ford was solely concerned with the myth-making itself, his movies were much better... well, some of them.Still, of course, every fan of the director, the stars or Westerns in general should see the pic at least once.5 out of 10 dusty stagecoaches",

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Libert Valance is a brilliant film for 90% of its run. It is perfect in direction, acting, writing, and photography. The actors deserve special attention. Jimmy Stewart may only have had one better role than this one, in Hitchcock's Vertigo. John Wayne also had at least one better role, but probably not two; that one, in my opinion, was in John Ford's The Searchers. I haven't seen too many Lee Marvin movies, but he creates in Liberty Valance one of the all-time greatest bad guys that I have ever experienced, whether in the movies or elsewhere. His presence onscreen is enough to make me shiver. The staging of the gunfight between Liberty and Ransom (Stewart) is one of the best scenes I've ever seen.SPOILERSUnfortunately, the film seemed to peter off at the end. I don't know, maybe the film's fame ruins it: I already new that Ransom was not Valance's killer, so the rest isn't difficult to figure out. Maybe if I had no idea, then I wouldn't have had any reason to question it and thus figure it all out. Tom's (Wayne) reappearance at the film's end is sort of a let-down. His penultimate scene is startling and truly affecting, but that quick appearance at the end where he explains everything away disappointed me. I would have liked more, not only with the Wayne character (who deserved a lot more), but even with Ransom and Hallie (Vera Miles, whose role begins a lot stronger than it finishes). Whatever they could have added to make the film fuller, as it stands, the end is too abrupt, as I see it. I wish I could give it a 10/10, but that flaw seems too glaring to me (although I certainly might be wrong and might end up changing my vote anyway later on). 9/10 for now.",

            "content": "This film, and \"Rio Bravo\", are my two favorite Westerns. But I might give this film the edge in terms of really being a Western masterpiece.I am updating my previous review to add information about the recent Blu Ray edition. Is it worth the upgrade. Yes. It's an excellent transfer.But I'll start with the two criticisms I have of this film...and they're minor. First, that in 1962, with 2 of America's greatest actors, John Ford still couldn't find the money to make the film in color. Second, that every once in a while in films, Jimmy Stewart could be guilty of overacting just a bit, and he does here a couple of times.Now, a lot of criticism has been leveled toward this film about the ages of Stewart and Wayne when they made this film, and particularly of Stewart. The problem is that at the beginning and ending of the film, Stewart is supposed to be in his 60's. For the body of the film, Stewart was supposed to be in his early 20s. Stewart was 54 when he made the film. Well, tough luck. I'd rather have Stewart in the role than any other actor I can think of.The story here is simple -- a Western bully terrorizes people, and the question is: who will have the guts to stand up to him? And then, the question is: who really did shoot Liberty Valence? But beyond the basic story, this film is rich in the little details: race relations, the inability of most Westerners to read, lawlessness, not to mention sadism.The other highlight of this film is the acting. This is one of John Wayne's best performances, and here he even doesn't seem awkward in the love scenes. Wayne even looks like he's enjoying the film! Stewart, despite a little overacting in a few scenes is just right for the part of the lawyer.Vera Miles is perfect as the love interest for both Wayne and Stewart. Miles was an underrated actress, but I never failed to enjoy her in any film or television appearance.I never liked Lee Marvin. Not ever in even one film. But, he chews the scenery up here as Liberty Valence. It's a bravura performance, and possibly his best.Edmond O'Brien is another of the underrated character actors who shines here. I always liked O'Brien, even when he had a few starring roles. But I don't think I ever enjoyed him more than here as the drunken newspaper publisher. This should have been an Oscar winning supporting role.I never had much use for Andy Devine, but he's really quite charming here...in his own rough way. He's particularly interesting at the beginning and end of the film.Jeanette Nolan and John Qualen are two wonderful character actors who play husband and wife, and play Scandinavian owners of a restaurant. Woody Strode has an excellent role as Wayne's \"Negro\" worker. And we can't leave out the creepy Strother Martin.I rarely like Westerns nowadays, but this is an exception, John Ford at his peak. John Wayne at his peak. Jimmy Stewart at his peak.And then there's that line from the end of the film: \"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" It doesn't get any better than this.",

Interestingly, Wayne and Marvin represent the two sides of a coin that lawyer Stewart wants to put out of circulation. The large supporting cast of familiar faces is terrific, particularly Miles and O'Brien. The scenes in the restaurant, supposedly meant as a tribute to Howard Hawks, are wonderfully evocative.",

            "content": "This is a cleanly constructed, sturdy Western that uses its theme of the underdog taking on the bully and gives it real depth and a perspective on how we are shaped by a decent society, and how in turn that society shapes us. But it's something else, too, a character study of one man who makes a monumental decision that allows his small part of the frontier, the town of Shinbone, to advance on the road of progress and, at the same time, leave that man by the wayside for the rest of his miserable existence. He knows this, and does it anyway.The man is Tom Doniphon, and may well be John Wayne's single best performance. For those who said the man can't act, their education in reality should begin here. He has never looked meaner in a movie, (perhaps because he was being dogged by John Ford on the set about his empty war record) yet he manages to make us aware of his character's deeper good, even if lawyer Rance Stoddard (James Stewart) sees him as just another cutthroat. Doniphon sees farther. He should probably hate Stoddard, who is winning over his girl, but he sees him instead as the territory's one true hope of achieving law and order. Without Doniphon, Stoddard would just be another pile of carpetbagging vulture chow on the stage road. Without Stoddard, Doniphon would be the boss of Shinbone, with the woman of his dreams by his side, living in that new room he built for her back at the ranch. So what does he do? He makes Stoddard a hero, torches his dream house, and drifts away into drunken obscurity, his obituary not even making the Shinbone Star. Go figure.No wonder Doniphon presses Stoddard's buttons so, drenching him in paint and needling his vows of non-violence. He wants to test his mettle, and hopes in some way the man will chicken out. If he doesn't, Doniphon understands its his duty to stand behind (not beside, he must give Stoddard the pretense of solitude) the man and help him see his quest through. There's that word he keeps calling Stoddard, \"pilgrim.\" Well of course he calls him \"pilgrim,\" you say, it's John Wayne. But this is the only movie of Wayne's I remember him saying it in, and it's a telling term. \"Pilgrims\" after all were the people that first carved out law and order in this new land of ours, and took us on the first steps toward freedom and liberty. Calling Stoddard \"pilgrim\" is one way Doniphon clues us in to the fact he knows what's really at stake here.I really like this movie. I wish I loved it, but its self-mourning, elegiac tone distracts sometimes. I'm so not caught up with Stewart, who seems a trifle windy and overbearing in this one, and Vera Miles doesn't really add much in her central role. The Ford regulars are all eagerly overripe, but that's why Ford movies are so good, because he's not afraid of some broad gestures and low comedy here and there. Shakespeare understood their usefulness, too. A lot of funny bits of business, most featuring Andy Devine and Edmond O'Brien. Liberty Valance's post-mortum is a one-word classic. The message in the schoolroom is a trifle heavy-handed, but it is delivered entertaining and sets up the central message of the movie well.Lee Marvin's is the other standout performance here. His is a world-weary villainy, one knowing like Doniphon that his time is quickly passing, but unlike Doniphon ready to do anything to fight that change. Marvin lets us see the callow fear, the false bravado, beneath the smirk. Like Wayne, it's a multi-dimensional performance that's easy to overlook because we latch onto the character so completely, rather than the actor behind him.Wish they had used Gene Pitney's title song in the movie. It's a great song, written by Burt Bacharach in his pre-paisley days, and would have been a solid compliment to the opening and closing credits. By the way, what other classic film is told in the form of a reminiscence to a reporter, only to have the story's key thrown into the furnace at film's end? C'mon, movie lovers, you must know this!",

Movies such as these are forever emblematic of the constant \"good versus evil\" theme with its companion subplot \"when must the pen be put down and the sword wielded in the name of justice.\"  As I watched my President put forth this question to the United Nation, I was reminded of Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne wrestling with the same issues in this film.  Everyone agrees violence is not good.  Everyone agrees evil must be done away with.  Everyone agrees alternative solutions should be explored.  But what happens when all alternatives to violence fail to eradicate evil??  Is it then that a person born out of law, order, and justice must finally wield the sword and takes a Stand?

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance doesn't bother itself with the vast & beautiful landscapes or crowd-pleasing gunfights but is instead an insightful breakdown of the American hero lore.Directed by John Ford, the film opens with a sombre, funereal scene that sets the stage for the main story and it is narrated with such gripping flair that the drama remains engaging from start to finish. The small-scale setting & limited resources do allow for necessary creativity in the storytelling section, but it is exactly where this film excels so expertly & effortlessly.The black-n-white photography is top notch, with its crisp lighting truly standing out. James Stewart is in prime form, bringing his A-game to the table to deliver a sublime performance that ranks amongst his best. John Wayne holds his own too in a familiar role that's merely functional for the plot. Stewart easily steals all the scenes he is in but him being a far better actor, it is no surprise anyway.Overall, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the best John Ford film I've seen so far and is good enough to rank amongst its genre's finest offerings. More interested in capturing the politics & way of life in the lands where guns n bullets used to do the talking, the film could've concluded sooner but the way it takes a western and makes it seem unfamiliar without subverting any of its qualities alone makes it worth viewing.",

Flashback, and he was a lawyer in Shinbone trying to bring law and order to the town, and he was lucky to survive a savage attack by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Nursed by his wife Hallie (Vera Miles), Ransom is determined to make Liberty pay, but without violence, which Tom, when he meets him, is obviously not very confident about. While he waits for the right time, Ransom teaches the people of Shinbone to read and write, and it is only when Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) is beaten to death by Liberty that Ransom decides violence is the only way. Eevn wounded, Ransom managed to fire a shot that he himself presumed was what killed Liberty, but later, Tom comes out to recall the fateful night, and reveal himself as the real killer.

But James Stewart, the lawyer, would like to see Valance in jail and dreams of schools where children can learn to read. This is easier to accomplish in a law-abiding society.I don't mind Westerns, and it helps if there's a good story.

I think it's the general tone of this movie that I find so annoying. Everything is so over-the-top.The script totally lacks subtlety. The entire production is so in-your-face obvious, so blunt, it's as if Director John Ford targeted the film to kids, or maybe to adults who like dumb-downed movies. Part of the problem is dialogue that lacks subtext.Another problem is the characters; they are all so shallow and two-dimensional. As much as I like Andy Devine, his scared-of-his-own-shadow town marshal quickly becomes tiresome. The cigar smoking newspaperman, Dutton Peabody, is always drunk and bug-eyed; he's a cartoon figure. And what about Liberty Valance? Does he even have a back-story? He just seems to appear, and then disappear ... on cue.The story's climax is quite clever, and arguably the best part of the film. And that climax should have been the end of the film.Alas, no. The story then plows forward for an unbelievable twenty-five more minutes. Viewers must endure an unnecessary, raucous political convention complete with speeches, after which an anonymous cowboy gallops in on a horse that prances around on the speaker's platform, as the cowboy twirls a rope and we listen to \"Home On The Range\". More buffoonery.In addition to the script, the film has other problems, including casting. Both John Wayne and James Stewart are way too old for the roles they play. Further, most of the actors wildly overact, especially Edmond O'Brien, as the town clown. The film's makeup is not convincing; Stewart's toupee at the film's beginning looks like something created by a high school art department. The sets are cheap looking. And the musical score is nondescript.Aside from a clever climax, about the only other feature of this film that I liked was the cinematography. The B&W lighting is sharp and crisp, high-contrast, and generally interesting.Maybe the film's message is deeper than I have perceived. Maybe John Ford is trying to impart some vision of a change in historical eras. But the script, especially its characters and that dreadful structure, along with the film's overall frothy tone and lack of subtlety, overwhelm everything else, including some hypothetical message.

            "content": "The Western in cinema, although it is ostensibly nothing more a category of movie set in a certain time and place, has grown to become something far grander than that; an unofficial reminiscence of a lost era of manliness and the law of the tough. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is perhaps the most knowing and self-aware statement of those themes. It appeared however in the early 1960s, an era in which the classic Western itself had run its course and was beginning to fade from cinema screens.Of course, such an ultimate Western could have no-one less a personage than John Wayne in a lead role. This was just about the last time The Duke\u0099 would be able to play the he-man as opposed to the old man. Compare his physique here to that just six years later in True Grit. Though in his mid-50s, Wayne still has all the presence and charisma that made him the archetypal Man of the West, at least in outward appearance. And who better to play the level-headed lawyer who serves as both his ally and nemesis than good old Jimmy Stewart. Stewart works here because although a similar age to Wayne he has that real ability to inhabit the persona of an even older man in the prologue, and then remember that eager youth he was in Mr Smith Goes to Washington for the main bulk of the movie. This is a typically deep and considered performance from Stewart. Look at the way he places his hand on Doniphon's coffin, conveying so much meaningful reverence in such a tiny gesture.And appropriately enough The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance comes right at the tail-end of the career of John Ford, the man who was to Western directing what Wayne was to Western acting. Let's forget for a moment that this is (for very good reasons) Ford's first black and white Western since 1950. An equally big departure here is the sense of smallness and confinement. Most of Ford's oaters were what I call *plains Westerns*, ones set way out in the wilderness. This however is firmly a *town Western* of saloons and homesteads, and is in fact even more sparing in its use of landscape than such seminal town Westerns as High Noon and The Gunfighter. In fact the only really significant use of Western backdrop is in the prologue where we see the remains of Doniphon's shack, with some typically Fordian framing beneath the bow of a tree. It gives us this little whiff of the great outdoors, and it's enough to colour the rest of the movie, indoor and stuffy as it is. When we return to that location later on, the backdrop is not so prominent. It's only in the very last shot that we receive a pay-off. This is absolute genius on Ford's part.The idea of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is supposedly a mourning for the death of the old tough-guy West before the likes of Jimmy Stewart came along and civilized it. But really, it is more about the death of the *Western* itself (of which Jimmy Stewart was presumably innocent). There's more to Ford's choice to shoot in monochrome than for a bleak, shadowy look. Apart from the widescreen and of course the ages of the various actors, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance looks like it could have been made at any time in the preceding twenty years. The acting is of a style that was fast becoming outmoded by 1962, with Edmund O'Brien and Strother Martin both gloriously theatrical. And although there we seldom see rolling plains or galloping horses, this is still a movie of Western clich\u00e9, epitomised in a brilliant shot of John Wayne and Lee Marvin staring each other down completely motionless. This conception of the West never quite existed in reality, but the classic Western of Wayne and Ford certainly did exist, and this is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance salutes.",

The man who shot L V gives the story of the homesteaders, the town folk, the farmers... i have read about this constant battle between the ranchers and the homesteaders in books by Louis L'Amour. to watch it on the big screen truly gives you an idea of how harsh the life was in the old west. The tough guys - the ranchers fought the Indians, struggled against the forces of nature to make a home in the middle of nowhere. and along came the other folk to claim the land that these cattlemen had fought so hard for. i guess when it comes down to progress the homesteaders and the others were right. but coming back to the topic of this movie, it's really great to see two actors, strike that, icons of western movies acting together. you would be surprised to see another actor holding his own in the presence of The Duke. well Jimmy Stewart does this easily and the two actors complement each other. one a book slinging lawyer, the other a gun slinging tough rancher. trust me on this, you surely will not be disappointed.",

Stewart looks no different from present to past other than some bad makeup and he has withdrawn into the stutter Stuart acting style he did so badly for his last 20 years.

So audience participation becomes part of the film aesthetic.But the movie as character study fails in comparison to \"The Shootist\" a far more complex and variegated film. This by contrast was simplistic and suitable to the mores of 1962--before November 1963--when the tyranny of the 2nd Amendment ruled the day.Lee Marvin--Liberty Valence--is the evil doer--have gun/will bully (the mantra of the NRA) while the na\u00efve James Stewart--Ransom Stoddard--believes that Liberty Valence can be brought down by force of Law. The world weary John Wayne--Tom Doniphon--knows better. Liberty Valance continues to terrorize the town till the town is sick of him. Liberty challenges Ransom to a duel. With his first shot, Liberty wounds Ransom in his shooting arm. Liberty gets ready to fire a final shot, Ransom raises his arm in what appears to be a shaky aim, fires and Liberty falls dead. Unbeknownst to Ransom, The man who shot Liberty Valence was in fact Tom Doniphon. Tom reveals this to Ransom when Ransom expresses doubt about the worthiness of being State delegate based on one deed of shooting to death an evil doer. So in some sense, Tom is releasing Ransom from a sin he does not need to own. And Ransom goes on to a career of successful Delegate, Senator, Governor. And when he returns to Shinebone for the funeral of Tom Doniphon he recites the true story--but the paper prefers the legend.Since the Newtown tragedy of almost two years ago, gun ownership has taken center stage in the American psyche, the American discourse. There are people who believe that a good guy with gun will stop a bad guy with a gun. Sadly what seems to predominate the evening news is a tendency for possession of the weapon to turn some people into pathological killers. (Not mentally ill people with guns, but people who planed in detail a scheme for homicide with that gun they own.) So to me, the 1962 movie seemed simplistic suitable to a more innocent age when mass shootings were not the norm. (Since the Dec 2012 Newtown shooting, there have been some 74 other mass shootings in schools The FBI reports a sharp increase in mass-shootings.) I remember watching the movie when it came out in 1962, and I had seen it several times since. But since the Newtown tragedy, I am less sanguine about gun ownership--both from the mere fact of owning that gun and the mindset of the gun owners--which strikes me as being down right pathological a la Liberty Valance.

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was the last Western that John Ford and John Wayne made together. The film also stars James Stewart, who plays Ransom Stoddard, a young lawyer who later becomes a senator. In the movie, Ford explores the differences that exist between the facts of Ransom Stoddard's life and the legend that has sprung up around him. Ford shows us that people would rather believe a legend than know the truth about a famous person and about the events of his or her life. This is especially true about the heroes of the Wild West era.There may be no era that has been more mythologized and romanticized than that of the Old West. In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Maxwell Scott, editor of The Shinbone Star, proclaims, \"This is the West, Sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" Ford's movie seems to suggest that much of what we think we know about the Old West may not be based on fact. The movie begins and ends with a scene of a train in motion. In the opening scene, the train is seen coming towards the camera and towards the small town of Shinbone, where most of the action will take place. Then, at the end of the movie, after the story has been told, the train is seen riding away from the camera and from Shinbone.The film's two main characters are Tom Doniphon, a rugged frontier's man, who is played by Wayne, and Stoddard who is played by Stewart. Other significant characters include: Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), the snarling, hate-filled outlaw; Hallie (Vera Miles), a young lady who both Tom and Ransom are in love with; Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), Shinbone's faint-hearted Marshal; Dutton Peabody, the lovable drunkard and editor of the local newspaper The Shinbone Star and Doc Willoughby who is Shinbone's physician and who also is a drunk.In the movie these characters come together and mix and clash with one another in Shinbone, a place where the lawless ways of the West seem to hold sway. Link Appleyard, the town's Marshal, represents the power of the Law in Shinbone, and he is a spineless man who cowers every time someone like Liberty Valance comes near. Doniphon tries to teach Stoddard what \"Western Law\" is like when he tells Ransom: \"I know those law books mean a lot to you but not out here. Out here, a man settles his own problems.\"But Ransom Stoddard refuses to accept that way of life. He has come to town, and he represents law and order and the settled ways of the East. It is true that when he first arrives, he is unconscious after having received a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance, and it is also true that next to the stalwart Tom Doniphon and the venomous Liberty Valance, Ransom doesn't seem very strong, but, nevertheless, he has come to stay as he tells Doniphon: \"I'm staying and I'm not buying a gun.\"The movie also focuses on the inevitable conflict brought on by the encroachment of the Eastern way of life upon the Western way. This conflict is seen represented in Hallie who is torn between her attraction for Doniphon, the frontier man, and Stoddard, the man of the East. Doniphon woos her with a cactus rose, a symbol of his way of life, while Stoddard asks Hallie if she has ever seen a \"real\" rose. Hallie says she hasn't and she shows her ignorance of the Eastern way of life when Mr. Peabody tries to teach her \"the proprieties concerning the cutlery.\"\"How many times have I told you the fork goes to the left of the plate? And the knife goes\u0097\" Hallie interrupts him and asks, \"What's the matter with you? You superstitious or something?\"Hallie knows that if she chooses to be with Ransom, she will have to change. But her first impulse is to resist change. When Ransom offers to teach her to read and write, she says, \"What good will that do around here?\" Later, however, she relents and accepts Ransom's offer. Unlike Hallie, who decides to accept the Eastern way of life and the changes that come with it, Liberty Valance and Tom Doniphon both refuse to change, and they both die because of their unwillingness, though each dies in a different way. Valance, who passionately hates Stoddard and all he represents, tries unsuccessfully to destroy, first Mr. Peabody and his newspaper press, and then Ransom himself. In the end, Valance, who has lived by the sword, dies a violent death at the hands of Tom Doniphon. And the latter, after realizing that he has killed a man in cold blood and that he has lost Hallie to Stoddard, self destructs; he starts drinking heavily, and sets his house as well as his life on fire.And Stoddard? What happens to him? He becomes famous because everyone, except for Hallie, thinks that he is the man who shot Liberty Valance, and he gets the girl and goes on to have a successful career in Washington. But without the help of noble, and honest men like Doniphon, men like Stoddard wouldn't have been able to survive in the West.John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an intelligent, insightful, and greatly entertaining movie.",

JEANETTE NOLAN, JOHN QUALEN, WOODY STRODE, EDMOND O'BRIEN, ANDY DEVINE and last but not least, JOHN WAYNE, make up the townspeople who don't think anyone but a gunslinger can take on Valance. Stewart disagrees, becomes the town's teacher when he learns most of them are illiterate, and after some humiliating treatment from Liberty Valance, we know that Stewart is going to have to resolve the problem somehow.Ford makes the most of a wonderful cast and a story that hooks interest from the opening shot. There's lots of rough humor in typical Ford fashion and John Wayne gets to deliver some priceless wisecracks in his own inimitable style. Andy Devine is sometimes over-the-top as a cowardly marshall and Edmond O'Brien chews the scenery as the town's newspaper editor, but Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan and others are excellent in supporting roles.It's an above average story, told in flashback, and Ford turns it into one of his most character driven films with some perfect casting in all of the major roles.Summing up: A western morality tale well worth watching...but watch out for JOHN CARRADINE.

            "review_title": "One of the Great American Movies",
            "content": "Contemporaneous reviews of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance applaud its first two-thirds and then feel like the final third just took too long to get to the point, robbing it of the kind of drama they're expecting. I've even seen comparisons to an episode of Gunsmoke. The contemporary view of the film seems to have been that it was just a Western drama, but it's so much more. This is one of the great American movies. I don't mean that it's one of the great movies made by Americans in America with American money. I mean that it's one of the movies that best explains America, and it does so by attaching that history to a compelling drama that contrasts two men.In the vein of Drums Along the Mohawk and Wagon Master, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the story of the creation of a community that functions as a microcosmic telling of the creation of a nation. Using a flashback structure to great effect, we open the film with an elderly Senator Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) returning to the small Western community of Shinbone. The countryside has been tamed as the train pulls into the clean station, and they're met by the former marshal of Shinbone, Link (Andy Devine). There's a deep sadness to this trip, returning to the place they had both called home and had formed their futures many decades ago, a trip brought on by the news of the passing of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). The editor of the Shinbone Star, the local newspaper, sits Ransom down and convinces him to tell the story of a famous man's connection to this unknown dead man.That flashback does something important in terms of tone. We know based on that as well as the title that certain people are going to survive the events set in the past and some will not. This moves the focus away from the more visceral elements of the story and towards the more subtextual.Ransom arrived in Shinbone as a fresh out of law school lawyer looking to make his way in the West. He's on a stagecoach that gets robbed by the notorious local outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) just outside of town and beaten to within an inch of his life while left for dead. Saved by Doniphon and his trusty black companion Pompey (Woody Strode), Ransom is taken to the house and restaurant of Nora (Jeanette Nolan) and Peter (John Qualen) Ericson as well as their employee Hallie. Ransom, as he recovers, is frustrated at the lack of action against Liberty Valance. He runs around just outside of town, causing harm, and the spineless Marshal Link won't do anything about it, even when Ransom figures out that, according to the laws of the territory, Link does have jurisdiction to arrest Liberty for his crimes. He's also infuriated with Tom's attitude of every man needing to take care of his own business, seeing it as the same thing as Liberty's point of view.What makes this more than just an extended episode of Gunsmoke is that the conflict between Ransom and Liberty gets tied up with the overall effort to approve statehood for the territory. The large ranchers on the north side of the Picketwire (the Purgatoire River) have employed Liberty as a hired gun to help terrorize the smaller land holders, especially when it comes to them coming together to support statehood, a proposition that would greatly diminish the ranchers' powers in the area. When the then owner of the Shinbone Star, Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), helps push Ransom's law business, it catapults Ransom to the height of informal power in Shinbone, culminating with him presiding over the meeting to choose delegates for the statehood convention in Capital City. When Liberty walks in, demanding that he be considered as a delegate, it's actually Tom's presence and insistence on Ransom as a delegate instead of himself that helps bring the people together to stand up against the man who's been terrorizing them for so long.This ignites the final, fatal showdown, and it's where the subtle point of the movie ends up playing out rather brilliantly. Ransom is no coward, but he's a man of books with little use for guns. He abhors the use of force to settle wrongs between people in a supposedly civilized place, but when Liberty attacks and nearly kills Peabody, he finally decides that something must be done. He's the one to do it as well. The showdown ends up being Liberty playing with Ransom until Ransom miraculously shoots Liberty dead with his bad arm, and this tends to be where the contemporaneous reviewers disengaged a bit. They knew that Ransom couldn't have done it, and they saw the next thirty minutes or so as just dragging out the thin fiction. That view is missing the tragedy of the film, though.Ransom's supposed act of heroism is what sets him on his path to great power. Hallie falls for him. At the territorial convention he's lauded as a hero and nominated to be the territory's representative to Congress on the question of statehood, and it eats at him. And then Tom shows up, drunk, having burned his own house down after seeing Hallie embrace Ransom so gently, and he tells Ransom the truth. Ransom didn't kill Liberty Valance. Tom did. He shot Liberty Valance with a rifle from down a side street and simply walked away.Who is this movie about? Who's the title character? In some ways it's about both. Ransom is the man known to have killed Liberty Valance (it's the last line of the film), but it was Tom who actually did it. It was Tom who nominated Ransom to the territorial convention. It was Tom who saved Ransom from Liberty in the beginning. This story is Tom's, and Tom's story is a tragedy.What is this movie about? This movie is about the legend over the fact. This is about how the men who actually made America get forgotten while those who are lucky enough to get the credit are elevated by the history books. John Ford, long before during the production of Stagecoach, called John Wayne the ultimate everyman. He didn't see Wayne as an exemplar of humanity, but a great example of the normal. I think that's key to seeing how this plays out. It was the everyman who tamed the West, but it wasn't the everyman who was praised for it. It was the everyman who killed Liberty Valance, but it was Ransom Stoddard who got the credit and the girl.That core reality is one of the big reasons I call this one of the great American movies. The other is how it uses education and the political process to help tell its story. The meetings and convention are strong examples of politics in drama used to both advance the story and the subtext. They're the American ideal at its most basic form where people in a community come together to elect representatives to advance their interests, where the little guys can find the strength together to fight larger power centers. And it does all that while telling an involving, tragic story of the sacrifices made to create the America of the day.Performances are uniformly great. Both Stewart and Wayne are honestly too old for their parts, but they play them both extremely well. Stewart has that innocent Eastern befuddled charm that morphs into anger while Wayne is firstly affable and nice and ends drunk and broken completely convincingly. Marvin is wonderfully threatening as Liberty. I also have to say that Edmond O'Brien as Peabody the editor is wonderful in his oratory as he finds his own strength through Ransom's example, the best moment being when Ransom is so taken with Peabody's editorial that he decides to use it in class. And it's wonderful to see John Carradine come in for a small part at the end, being the ranchers' mouthpiece at the convention.In a body of work as long, varied, and wonderful as John Ford's, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is near the top. It's interesting that it's so different from his other masterpiece of a western, The Searchers, focusing on small, indoor spaces instead of the wide outdoors of Monument Valley, telling a largely confined story of personal drama matched with wonderful subtext. It truly is, much like The Right Stuff, one of the great American movies.",

However, when the local press find out that an important political figure has made the long journey just to attend a funeral of a 'friend' they assume that there is something more to Stoddard's visit to Shinbone than meets the eye. The local press are determined to hear Stoddard's story and eventually Stoddard gives in and explains his reasons for returning to Shinbone.This, for me, is very much a message film; Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart)is a lawyer who ends up being attacked by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang whilst travelling through Shinbone. He initially calls for Valance to be arrested, but when he learns that the Sheriff is a coward who's pretty much afraid of his own shadow, Stoddard quickly realises that he'll have to take care of Valance himself. Stoddard is befriended by Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) who assists in toughening Stoddard up so that he is prepared for the inevitable showdown with Valance. I believe that the simple message is about standing up for oneself. Even though, the plot twist surrounding who shot Liberty Valance was predictable that didn't really matter to me because again I think that everything leading up to this scene had a purpose. I believe that Doniphon always had the intention of killing Valance. I believe that Doniphon gave Stoddard enough training to give him the confidence to step up to Valance, but he ultimately knew that Valance was too quick for Stoddard and that's why he made sure that he was on hand to kill Valance. I suspect that he may also have done it to help increase Stoddard's popularity and to ultimately influence his political career. Whatever way you look at this film, it does give the viewer a lot to think about and is certainly quite intriguing. The fact that we also don't learn how Doniphon died only adds to the mystery.As great as this film was there were some minor things that did bother me somewhat; James Stewart is usually fairly reliable, but I did feel that he over-acted in some of his scenes (particularly at the start of the film). Some of John Wayne's dialogue delivery was probably supposed to come across as dramatic, but I found some of this dialogue to be cheesy and a bit laughable. I also would have preferred it if there was a little bit more focus on Liberty Valance and his gang - they didn't get as much screen time as I would have liked. As a side note, I thought Lee Marvin was fantastic as Liberty Valance.TMWSLV is a film that is engaging and ultimately very rewarding with some very minor problems. It's a film that still had me thinking even after the credits had finished rolling.",

It is the very first time renowned actors John Wayne and James Stewart appeared alongside each other in a film, and this is only one of the many things that makes The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance a powerfully spectacular film. The film opens with Stewart, who plays Ransom Stoddard, returning to a town where he once lived because of the death of an old friend. Reporters want to know Stoddard's story, so he tells them in one long flashback. This flashback tells the story of how Stoddard came to the town by accident after being held up by the notorious Liberty Valance. Once in town, Stoddard, a lawyer from the East, sets up shop and starts teaching the townsfolk how to read, and about history and politics. However, he's a survivor of the ruthless Liberty Vance, and that threat looms over his head throughout the whole movie. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valnace is an incredible film, and it is absolutely quintessential to the progression of the Western genre from spaghetti to its more modern style of today. It's ingeniously important.This is the film that symbolizes John Ford's knowledge of where his own beloved genre, the Western, was headed. It's a film that represents the maturing of the genre into something wholly new. The town in which the film is set is like any other spaghetti Western locale. It's a lawless gun slinging territory where jurisdiction is not part of the local vernacular, and jail means as much to a man as the word illegal. There are no rules in this dusty Western town, and the rest of the world seems to have no barring on what goes on here. That is, until Ransom Stoddard shows up. He represents the Eastern ideals of lawfulness and government that the Western genre practically pretended didn't exist before. He represents this maturing of the genre into the real world, not some rough and tough shoot em up fantasy land.Of course, with this kind of change you will have those who will hold it back. In the case of this film you have two characters. The first is Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance. He is the epitome of what we know the spaghetti Western outlaw to be. He is afraid of nothing and he plays by his own rules. Beating, robbing, and murdering whoever he pleases. So, as you can imagine, when he comes head to head with the lawman of the more civilized world things get ugly. It's one set of ideals taking over another. Valance's seem to be more outdated, which is why he's the bad guy and Stoddard isn't.But then you have another character which holds back this democratic progression into the lawless West. John Wayne's character as Tom Donaphin. Wayne is the perfect actor for this role because of all that he represents as an actor. He's the face of spaghetti Western. The ultimate gunslinger. The hero of the great plains. So obviously newcomer Stoddard threatens his ideals and is the representation of his face being lost amongst the crumbling of the spaghetti Western. And to drive the point home even further, that is why Donaphin is the character who lies in the coffin at the beginning of the film.This is, essentially, what the underlying theme of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is. It's a transition piece. One that illustrates the fading away of the spaghetti Western as it is replaced with something more contemporary. What was once a lawless wasteland is given government and democracy that allow it to grow into something more substantial. Throughout the film Stoddard resents the use of guns, as he aims to educate people so that democracy can replace violence and so that education can replace disorder and futile discord in these small Western towns.There's a lot more to this film than I could have ever expected, and all this subtext was a welcome surprise to a film that I thought would be nothing more than another fun spaghetti Western. It's pure genius, an exceptional metaphor through filmmaking, illustrating the morphing of a genre that the director himself was so familiar with. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a truly astounding film.",

In this film, John Ford succeeds in telling his audience a story that is universal : how to stand up to bullies even if violence is not your cup of tea. He couldn't have chosen his actors better to mark the different approaches to violence. John Wayne gives one of his best performances here and puts paid to his critics in what is a finely tuned role. James Stewart is perfect as the ever-suffering lawyer lost in the realm of gunsmoke. Lee Marvin is the ultimate sadist in a role remarkably similar to the one he played in The Big Heat. Some of John Ford's favourite stalwarts fill out the cast: Andy Devine as the lovable but cowardly sheriff and Edmond O'Brien as the newspaperman stand out. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance remains a classic for the right reason : no matter how predictable or sentimental the story, it's a timeless testimony to the art of film-making by a great artist.",

No wonder he is always quoted for it.The film wasn't so interesting that I put my phone down, but it was certainly one of the better westerns that I've seen from Steven Schneider's Top 1001 Films list.That must be down to the lead actors, because overall the story is the same as most. A bully doing what he wants in a town and getting away with it, who eventually picks on the wrong guy, who's new to town.I've never understood why these towns full of hard men Cowboys are all such scaredy cats and why it takes one brave man to show them what they can achieve. That seems to be the premise for most of the westerns that I've seen, including 'Carry On Cowboy' (1965), which is actually the best of the whole Western genre in my mind.It also always seems that the American's of the 19th century were such a rabble, that I have to wonder how they ever got to where they are now? Have they really moved on? That's not for me to say, but shooting people still seems to be a popular way of dealing with things for a few of them.It isn't actually a bad story, as I have said, but it could have been a lot better with a bit more thought.There are silly mistakes or inconsistencies throughout. For example - Why is there a newspaper in an illiterate town?I think that James Stewart's character got there just in time, they needed his direction to grow it in to something better and it would have been nice to have seen more of the growth within the town.Whenever I read through the IMDB Trivia for these films, it always seems to be that the directors and the producers and the studios and the actors have never worked well together and I think that this shows a lot with some of them.It's a pity that I can't go back in time and explain that they could make something outstanding if they just put their bickering and penny pinching aside, because John W and James S could be allowed more focus and better direction if everything else was working more smoothly and we all know what they are capable of when they're used properly. It could have been a much more interesting viewing experience for it.It doesn't score as highly for me, because it's just not my thing.378.91/1000.",

A big cowardly brutal bully who has a western Marshall quaking in his boots, is mean enough to just grab someone's steak from their restaurant table (throwing them out of their chair while ding it) and being totally hateful to educated peace loving Easterner James Stewart. Lee Marvin, in pre-Cat Ballou western gear, entered his name into the rogue book of villains with his performance here, the type that silent era audiences hissed and booed.The storyline has James Stewart returning to his old home for a funeral where he lays down the legend of his days leading up to the alleged hooting of the nasty Valance. There, truth be told, the reporter must decide which is the greater legend-fact or fiction. In a major supporting role, John Wayne takes a rare back seat to Stewart's attorney as his pal who tries to teach the peace-loving man the rules of the pre-civilized west: Fight or be beaten; Shot or be Shot; Kill or be Killed. His constant use of the world \"pilgrim\" here has become one of the signature lines of Wayne mimics. Vera Miles gives a delightfully feisty performance as the woman in both Stewart's and Wayne's lives who witnesses the entire legend and teaches both men something in the process as well. Andy Devine, John Qualen, John Carradine and Anna Lee are among the supporting players in this western of human emotions which like \"High Noon\" tell of sometimes that peace isn't always the way to go. John Ford adds another classic western to his cannon of masterpieces, then 50 years of cinema, with still a few more to go.",

Beyond of the excellent narration of the story (mystery, drama, action, comedy) we can see self criticism of his former films (the myth around the hero is collapsing), he comments politics, racism, the turning point that the technology and social life has come and there's no place for lonesome cowboys and fast guns.

Stoddard is such a man, benefitting from an accredited action which he didn't actually commit. That's down to John Wayne's Tom Doniphan character (again, what kind of name is that, why not just plain Tom Donovan?), who, even whilst gradually cottoning on to Ranse's blossoming relationship with his own on again-off again girlfriend, kitchen waitress Vera Miles's Hallie (I won't say it again, but I'm thinking it!), just as he's getting up the courage to propose to her, can't help himself becoming his rival's fairy godfather, especially when the chips are down at the film's climax.This is especially the case after Stoddard upsets the local bad guy Liberty Valance (this one leaves me speechless!), played with snarling cussedness by Lee Marvin, the minute he arrives in Shinbone and it all leads up to a triangular showdown involving all three men which will determine their ongoing fates for good and all.This was the first time Wayne and Stewart had combined in a film and was also Stewart's first film under Ford. I like a thoughtful, moralistic story and I always love a good revelatory flashback, both of which we get here but I must admit there were aspects of the film to which I didn't quite take, most glaringly the lead acting. You can see both Wayne and Stewart adopting their familiar old-man personas, the former playing the slow-walking, slow-talking paragon of toughness in the town, the latter, the modest, yammering, hesitant do-gooder who womenfolk love to mother. If you get bored with the action at any time, you could for fun do worse than try to count the number of times Tom calls Ranse \"Pilgrim\", although if this was meant to point towards some kind of \"Pilgrim's Progress\" allegory, I must have missed something.Behind them you have Andy Devine as the town sheriff whose brand of cowardice would have given the Wizard of Oz's lion a run for his money and Edmond O'Brien as the crusading newspaper editor with a weakness for hard liquor, both overacting their heads off, which isn't to say that Marvin doesn't underplay his part but at least his character seemed to merit exaggeration.The usual Ford pick-and-mix ingredients of bravery, loyalty, romance, humour, sacrifice and redemption are all present and correct but there hardly seemed to be a character in the film who didn't come over like a caricature, a perception encouraged by the over-the-top acting of all and sundry, given free rein by Ford's rather loose directorial style on this occasion.I can understand the film's popularity with others but I personally felt indifferent to its too obvious charms.

Lee Marvin's performance as Liberty Valance is nothing short of brilliant and I have long thought John Wayne's role as Tom Doniphon was his true shining moment as an actor. People tend to stereotype The Duke, claiming that he only ever played himself. While there may be some truth to that in some of his films, he proved himself to be a great actor, too, in movies like \"Liberty Valance\" and \"The Searchers\", to name but two.

            "content": "We debated about this film when I was working on the assembly line at TECHNICOLOR, a video-tape factory. Some young guy in his enthusiasm asked a few of us during our break what we thought was the greatest film of all time. We all volunteered our personal favorites. At one point, after advocating vigorously that thematic content should be valued over special effects and at times even advances in film technology, I offered this film as a candidate for the greatest of all time. The young guy, looked down and thought for a moment, and then gave me a demurring shake of the head.He couldn't see it, I imagine, but I stuck to my guns. I defended my choice by advocating that THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962), was an example of true cinema, a work of art that could not be done as effectively on stage or anywhere else. Furthermore, I insisted, it asserted the true strengths of the medium in manipulating viewpoint, relying upon communication between spaces rather than dialogue and demonstrating as few other art forms can, that illusion can assume a stronger force than reality.Anyway, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it.The theme of Civilization conquering Barbarism is refreshingly told under the mantle and mythos of The Old West. What is also rigorously examined is the value of Rugged Individualism counterpoised with the value of Community Action. John Wayne as Tom Doniphon and James Stewart as Rance Stoddard represent these values respectively. Rance Stoddard bringing books and literacy demonstrates the courage to stand up for the community of Shinbone albeit in an ill-considered and unadvised manner. Tom Doniphon has the strength and skill to stand up to the gleefully fascist Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance, but any confrontation he makes with Valance has less to do with the progress of the community and more to do with his individual, 'personal plans' for Hallie.Similar to CASABLANCA (1942), it turns out that the idealist ends up being the one who experiences the transformative event while the realist disappears into the mists of time. One of the reviewers helpfully contrasted the original short story written by Dorothy Johnson with the film itself, and this highlights several important differences in how the themes are treated in each case.Arthur Schopenhauser was once referenced in my studies as having stated that in matters of necessity regarding the survival of the family and the community versus the survival of the individual, women will choose family and community every time and side with males whom they sense promote these values. This alleged tendency of woman is cited also to be one of the roots of misogyny. The validity of this idea is more than I know. But when it comes to resolving a love triangle, it is a highlight of CASABLANCA and THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE.There is one thing I would like to mention that puzzled me when I first saw this movie in black and white as a kid. At a meeting of Shinbone residents, Dutton Peabody, publisher of the local newspaper, as memorably played by Edmund O'Brien, along with Rance Stoddard nominated somehow by Doniphon himself, becomes one of two delegates elected to attend the Statehood Convention. This makes Liberty Valance and his cohorts unhappy, as they represent the interests of the cattle barons who are opposed to statehood, and now seethe to give somebody a beat down.While the residents are meeting and deliberating the merits of Statehood, which brings with it the right to vote, Pompey, played by Woody Strode as Doniphon's African American handyman, is sitting over on the side with Hallie and the others. He is wearing a long face, and a morose expression with the rest of the women while he clasps his hands together and studies the floor. As a kid, I could not help but wonder why they weren't as happy as the other townspeople about achieving Statehood.Decades later, it dawned upon me. The residents of Shinbone were sending delegates to apply for Statehood and the right to vote. But suffrage would not include Pompey, being an African American, nor would it include Hallie, as she was a woman. Here, the director John Ford was making a subtle statement about racial and gender inequality without one word of dialogue.Later on, towards the resolution of the story, Stoddard begins his unexpected rise in politics from delegate to Governor to Senator to Ambassador to England to the Senate again and finally talk of a Vice Presidential nomination. All this on the basis of True Grit anyway you want to slice it between him and Doniphon, and an illusion mixed with public relations. There may be comparisons and examples you can find in the world of today.Anyway, as one era ends and another begins, I'm sticking to my story. This film is one of my candidates for greatest film of all time.",

As for the rest of the characters, they are pretty much run-of-the-mill types. The film also is bogged down by an awfully slow pace and the courtroom scenes at the end are very weak. There are some good ideas at hand here though - justice in the Old West, what makes legends and what makes good news - and the middle section of the film is quite strong.

            "content": "Seldom numbering amongst any list of favourites, 'Liberty Valance' is actually a very poignant story about the subjugation of the 'wild' west and its passage from truth into legend.The movie begins with one of those interesting back-to-front denouements in which an ageing senator, played by James Stewart, turns-up in a western town called Wishbone. Townspeople ask for an explanation to his visit. The senator begins. An old rancher-friend of his (John Wayne) has died, and he means to attend the funeral. And this is what happened...Stewart reverts now to an idealistic and naive young lawyer, completely out of his depth, turning-up bruised and battered in the - then - remote village of Wishbone. He is planning to establish a law practice. His injuries derive from psychotic hoodlum Liberty Valance, who attacked the stagecoach earlier. The movie charts the lawyer's gradual rise from timid stiff-neck to resolute crusader, as Valance becomes increasingly brazen in his lawlessness towards a town stricken with fear.He confronts the drunken Valance with a gun. Shots are exchanged. Valance lies dead. The lawyer is credited with his slaying and made a great hero, but all is not what it seems...On the strength, of his reputation for both honesty and courage he, the lawyer, is elected senator and his future is assured.Stewart is perfectly believable as the moral fish-out-of-water, whilst Lee Marvin has a menacing and unpredictably violent Liberty Valance to perfection. The joker in the pack is big John Wayne, playing the flawed hero as well as he always does. He and Stewart are in competition for a certain young lady, played by reliable Vera Miles.A number of other regulars do excellent work, not least of which is the quietly competent Woody Strode, as Wayne's sidekick.The movie is shot in black & white, which is unusual for a 1960's western and conveys an appearance of low-budget. Also the set-pieces are economical and rather stagy, adding to the feel of low production values. Yet stars like these don't come cheap.The script is good, dialogue is well presented and the acting everything you might expect. Apart from the 'staginess' other technical matters such as directing, editing and lighting are properly addressed, and I might best describe the movie as a well-grown figure in poorly-fitting clothes.Issues of history and legend, the passage of time and the transience of human life are simply and sweetly addressed without any sweeping moral judgements. And it is the very understated presentation of this movie that tends to conceal its great strengths. I particularly like the ending, in which an old 'iron-horse' steam train rumbles off into the distance as if it is driving into history and taking all of the legends and myths with it. Music is extremely apt to the moment.Unfortunately; the story does rather shoot itself in the foot, because it is highly unlikely that such a momentous duel that put one of the town's own heroes into the US senate would ever be forgotten. Quite the contrary; the townspeople would have traded upon the connection for all that it was worth. It is also highly unlikely that the senator would have neglected his home town so completely for so many years. Senators are not elected for life. Favours need to be curried, and babies kissed pretty regularly.However; this is one of those movies that I always seem to forget how much I enjoy, until some channel or other discovers and shows it again. Highly recommended.Incidentally; last week I found it in an Asda supermarket. Three Wayne movies in one: 'Liberty Valance', 'True Grit', and 'The Sons Of Katie Elder' - \u00a35.00.

            "content": "When we went to see this John Ford picture, this John Wayne, James Stewart co-starring feature, we all thought we were going to see another Western, a Horse Opera, an 'Oater', if you will. Well, we were at best, only partly right.To begin with, we have an adequate looking, yet not overly done, not very fancy or not too ornate. The production has a realistic look about it, but perhaps it did not appear as we thought of and have come to expect in the looks of a Western.The most obviously glaring difference is, that this was 1962. By this time, Color Photography was definitely in. Just about all productions would be in Technicolor, Color by Deluxe, Warner Color, Cine Color, Nature Color, etc., or one of those processes. But BLACK & WHITE!!, give me a break!! But the film started thataway, and went on for the approximately 2 hours of intricately woven screenplay. In short, Tender Foot \"Pilgrim\", Ransom Stoddard(Jimmy Stewart), fresh from Law School, has made his way out to this un-named, semi-arid,Territory in the Old West of the United States. This was probably somewhere in the 1880's most likely, though this was never expressed, it is left to the viewer to create his own locale.Well, young Legal Eagle Stoddard gets a bitter lesson that wasn't taught in college. The World of the West is hard, harsh and highly unlawful. Having been a victim of a Robbery of a Stage Coach and the personally battered victim of one Masked Individual, who is named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin in about as bad a role he's ever played!).Half beaten to death and left by the outlaws by the roadside, Young Mr. Stoddard is rescued by Local Rancher and Good, Tough Guy, Tom Donovan(John Wayne). Donovan sees to it that Ransom Stoddard has food, shelter and medical care. We are introduced to the citizens of this town called Shinbone. Linc Appleyard (Andy Devine) is an ineffectual town Marshall, who we see run out the back way of the restaurant upon hearing that Liberty Valance had arrived.Then, through a series of complicated incidents, Stoddard manages, without trying, to work himself to the position of top citizen. He starts a school program, he works for the Town Newspaper, the Shinbone Star, Dutton Peabody(Edmund O'Brien), Publisher* In an unbelievable occurrence, Ransom Stoddard faces down Liberty Valance in a gunfight and wins, when Valance is incredibly shot dead. Well this event, combined with his 'book learning' and community activity, makes him the perfect candidate for the office of Territorial Delegate to Washington, D.C., his job being to lobby Congress to consider Statehood for the territory.** Well, for Ransom Stoddard, this is only the beginning of a highly successful career in the Political Arena. But the public office is not the only thing that he won, for in the process of becoming Shinbone's first citizen, he has won the Heart of one Hallie Ericson. And she(Vera Miles) had been the Duke's girl.The story opens up years later than these previously mentioned events. We are introduced to a rather elderly Senator Ransom Stoddard and Hallie, who had come back to Shinbone to attend the publicly funded Funeral of Tom Donovan. The Curiosity of the Newspaper's Publisher-Editor, Maxwell Scott(Carleton Young) as to just what was so damn important about this Tom Donovan to get a U.S. Senator back to town.The rest of the story is told almost completely in flashback. We laugh a lot and cry some. But we are all better off as members of the human race. All of this because of this Human Comedy-Drama, character study and work of satire of our society, which Mr. John Ford has cleverly packaged as a Western.Thanks, Pappy!*** * By this time in his career, Edmund O'Brien had become heir to those kind of roles that once been the property of Thomas Mitchell.** Director Ford gives us a little spoof of what a Political Convention in the United States must look like to an outsider.*** 'Pappy' was Ford's nickname to those who became his on screen family. And let us not sign off before we salute a great cast. The very experienced players included:Ken Murray, Jeanette Nolan, John Qualen, John Carridine, Woody Strode, Earle Hodgins, Willis Bouchey, Lee van Cleef, Strother Martin, Robert Simon, ............",

Well made makes a great point questioning about what do people really know about our Western history or history, as they're several points of view about who shot who, what and where did it happen and how many of them saw it if anything happened at all! This is somewhat the western equivalent of \"Rashomon\".The story revolves around a small town when a respected senator Ransom played by James Stewart returns to the town to pay respect to an old patron, Tom (John Wayne) whom he used to know, and what he did leading up to it's final which may had changed it's course on it's history! Great build up to the final which was quite a revelation during it's time. Just a tad too long as viewers get it that Ransom (Stewart) is the non-violent, book worm as opposed to Tom who talks with his guns who does not have a huge vocabulary. The movie can also be interpreted as the beginning or the end of the western civilization. One of the best lines ever \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\".",

            "review_title": "Touching and Idealistic, Bitter and Tender",
            "content": "The Man Who Shot Libety Valance was John Ford's cinematographic legacy even though it wasn't his last film, not even his last western. But it was one of the last blossoms of a dying genre. It represents classical western, perhaps classical cinema -- old life? It's a summary of the genre's deepest emotions. A depiction of a community at the dawn of the new world in which garden and wilderness, untamed west and civilization are against each other. The film is also talks about democracy, the spine of civilization and its significance. It was an untypical film for John Ford, and it was the first film in which James Stewart and John Wayne played together, both of whom had earlier worked with Ford.John Ford's puzzling mystery of history and humanity is built on the relationship between two men but the character of Hallie, played by Vera Miles, turns their relationship into a love triangle as well. A senator, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to a town because a friend of his, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) has died; so discretely that the press hadn't even heard of it. Soon the senator has to tell the press the story; why has he returned to the town and who was this friend of his -- \"it all begun...\" Soon we find out that before Stoddard the town was dominated by a notorious villain, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard desperately tried to end his reign of terror by sowing the seeds of democracy and civilization.The film is both bitter and touchingly idealistic. In addition to its social themes of justice, free speech and education, the film drills down to pure emotion, to the thematics of humanity, love and morality. The characters of James Stewart and John Wayne represent two opposite worlds: Wayne's the old world where the law of the jungle reigns. In turn, Stewart's the new world with its laws and teachings. Stewart's character tries to change the town without order or law into a model of democracy but finds it incredibly hard when Liberty Valance reminds him of the cruel reality of the wild west.The overlap of time levels and perspective technique are masterful and precisely considered; both the gags and the most serious scenes work perfectly. The scene where Liberty Valance arrives to the restaurant is one gorgeous example: Ransom (Stewart) comes to deliver Tom (Wayne) his steak but Liberty trips him up and the steak drops down to the floor. Here picking the steak up appears to us as a drama of power relationships.In the end Ransom has to meet Liberty Valance in order to make the town a better place. He insecurely approaches Valance with his small gun but for the surprise of everyone, including Ransom, Valance loses and dies. This is obviously an act: Ransom, who barely knows how to handle a gun, couldn't have won Valance. Tom, supposedly, comes to the restaurant too late and sees Hallie taking care of the wounded Ransom. Here Tom makes the biggest choice of his life: he abandons the heroism as the killer of Liberty Valance because of a promising lawyer, and at the same gives up the love of his life, Hallie. He enters to the shadows of the street as the cowards of the new world are celebrating -- brilliant psychological depiction by John Ford. History is stripped down from all of its idealistic form to a personal loss. Next comes an extremely powerful and tragic scene where Tom goes and burns the house he was supposed to build for him and Hallie to live in; he gives up of his dream. Ransom is anguished: he has resisted violence for all his life but now has a killing on his conscience. The two perspectives; the immortalized history and the truth are now revealed as Tom tells Ransom the truth that he actually killed Liberty, with a shotgun, from the shadows. Ransom is relieved and ready to continue his career as a senator-to-be. The truth is out, history can be re-written but it won't be. The real man who shot Liberty Valance can step into the shadows of history. In the end, when we return to present day from the flashback, Ransom who is now a senator explains quite clearly to the press that the true hero of the stabilization of civilization was Tom Doniphon. To which the reporter replies: \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" The alcoholic journalist and the lazy sheriff represent the new world which isn't as glorious as it could be. Ford's brilliant cinematic sense is shown in here, and the picture of corrupted political power is grotesque as the election turns into a Chaplinian farce. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is also about the sudden beauty and injustice of life. The cactus blossom is the motive of the film and it grows out to be a strong metaphor of the new world. It collects both symbolic and emotional significance to itself as the story goes by. The cactus blossom equals civilization and education. In the beginning Hallie hopes that one day their town will be full of them, and in the end when Hallie and Ransom are leaving the funeral by train they see a land, which was once cold and vacant, full of cactus blossoms, hopes and dreams.",

            "content": "I am a huge fan of John Ford, but somehow I had missed this one.I was extremely disappointed.  If I hadn't known that Ford had directed it, I never would have guessed it. Extremely set-bound, VALENCE has little of the sense of the Western outdoors that mark films like THE SEARCHERS, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and FORT APACHE.  It's overlong.  It's poorly cast, with both John Wayne and James Stewart--both in their 50s at the time--too old for their roles.  (Stewart is particularly off-putting in this film, fitted with an obvious toupee and most of the time mired in a righteous indignation.  He virtually quivers every time he speaks.)  The female lead is that perpetual cipher, Vera Miles.  (I've seen her in a number of films and still don't understand why she was so often cast in major productions.)  John Wayne attacks his role with his usual zeal, but he's flabby and 55--too old to be convincing as Vera Miles' suitor.  (This is the film in which he calls Stewart \"Pilgrim\".) Lee Marvin is the villainous title character and he's the most effective member of the cast.  Strother Martin plays his chortling side-kick, who gets vicarious thrills out of Marvin's sadistic beating of townfolk.  Edmund O'Brien chews the scenery with impossible speeches about freedom of the press.  He is, in a word, ridiculous.  Lee Van Cleef doesn't have one line of dialogue.  Andy Devine is Andy Devine. VALENCE seems to be  very low-budget.  It reminded me in a large way of the Westerns that were so popular on television at the time--this could have been another episode of Wagon Train. Again, one of the major problems is the over-the-hill casting. I kept thinking how different the film would have been had it been cast with younger stars.The \"surprise\" twist ending is unconvincing and doesn't really add anything. I know many people love this film.  I'm at a loss.",

            "content": "The man who shot liberty valence is considered as one of the best westerns ever made. Personally I don't think it's the BEST western but it is very close! The plot goes like this; A politician famous for shooting a criminal, Liberty Valence, heads back to the town where he shot him. Journalists meet him and ask him questions. Instead of answering them The senator tells them the whole story...The man who shot liberty valence was, what you could call, an \"end of an age\" film. Black and white films were slowly becoming obsolete and colour films were dominating Hollywood. This is probably one of the last GREAT black and white films.John ford cast some of the best actors in history and I think this is why i love the film so much. Lee Marvin, John Wayne, a cameo of lee van clef and my all time favourite actor James Stwert. Because of the confusing advertising, it's hard to know who is the main character- John Wayne or James Stewart. Although John Wayne has some good line, bold acting and plays a fantastic performance, James Stewart really steals the show. He acts like it was the last film he will play in, acting with so much expression and oozing with talent. He acts similarly in one f his earlier films, \"Mr Smith Goes To Washigton\" which would make since because both characters he plays are politicians. In this film he plays the character I would like to be; A justice seeking, kind, generous fellow who is not afraid to stand up to injustice. By and large;One of Stewart's best performances. John Wayne's character,Tom Doniphon. He really pulls it off. Although he is the supporting character, he's plays more like an acquaintance to James Stewart rather than a friend which keeps the film diverse. Tom Doniphon encourages the senator to fight a gunfighter who is causing some trouble in the town. The senator doesn't like the delinquent himself, but shooting him conflicts with his beliefs and this is why he doesn't appeal to Tom Doniphon as many western characters would. They play like chalk and cheese and it's just brilliant to watch.There is no action involved in the film. Instead we get a suspenseful, on edge, thrilling sequence which keeps you wanting to know if James Stewart's character will take up the gun and end the villain or if the villain will shoot him in cold blood. It's rather intriguing and will keep you glued to the screen.This was John Ford's last black and white film. Boy, did he go out in style.If your a action western junky, the chances of you liking this film are low. There are a lot of political moments and it may feel a bit long for some. However if you just like westerns in general this is a enjoyable western that not only exposes the injustice of the west but makes a daring, admirable character who stands up to it.

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)As with most John Ford movies (including many Westerns with John Wayne), this is really well constructed. It's smart and compact and filled with clear logical progression. And it's filmed in widescreen black and white with some classic favorite Ford actors.That's not enough to make a truly great movie, but it gives the slightly simple moral and social problems in the film a brace to avoid being either simplistic (too simple) or sentimental.At first it seems to be about the introduction of reason and educated decency to the wild west. Jimmy Stewart plays the newcomer in town, a young lawyer with a bag of books and no gun. But he learns quickly that this is laughable to the old-timers and the salty locals, one of them played with predictable confidence by John Wayne. Between them, almost literally, is a young woman who has her eye on a good man--or men--for her future.People who have seen a few Westerns and are wary of their simple intentions will not find any surprises here. But this is so well made, and acted with true cinematic integrity, it's a pleasure to watch. There are \"better\" Westerns like Ford's \"The Searchers\" or even his breakthrough \"Stagecoach\" (which features a surprising number of the same actors). And there are other kinds of Westerns like \"High Noon\" which takes a simple tale of ruling by guns and makes it have a different kind of resonance. And I'm not even talking about Spaghetti Westerns which had their breakthrough just as this film was being made. (The Leone movies began in 1964, but precedents go a few years earlier.)But John Ford is a story teller, and so he uses expert crews and writers and photographers to make the story clear and human. He adopts stereotypes willingly--the bad men scowl (Lee Marvin is perfect) and the good women are nurturing (Vera Miles is just fine as well). Many people will find these kinds of clich\u00e9s boring or irritating or both, but if you can go with the flow and see these as part of the toolbox for creating a larger allegory about strength, morality, and an oversimplified American history, you'll enjoy the ride.The one real hitch to the film, for me, is the thing that has made it famous. And that's the kind of trick that happens in the end (the trick was re-worked in the 1973 comedic Spaghetti/American hybrid starring Henry Fonda, \"My Name is Nobody\"). I can't give it away, but you might find the wool has been pulled over your eyes. I'm not sure what the allegory means about America--that we've all been duped and the participants are never going to tell the truth? Watch it. If you like old movies, or just want a fun, well made drama that happens to be set in the unpolished territories of the West, give it a go.",

            "content": "Ransom Stoddard, a distinguished US Senator, and his wife Hallie arrive in the small western town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of a rancher named Tom Doniphon. (That is how the name is spelt in the cast list, although while watching the film I assumed it was \"Donovan\". ). Their arrival causes some surprise, and the local reporters ask Stoddard why he should have come all the way from Washington to attend the funeral of such an obscure individual.The answer is told in one long flashback dealing with the time when Stoddard, then a young lawyer, was living in the town. In those days Shinbone was a rough, lawless place, terrorised by a gang of outlaws led by the notorious Liberty Valance. The local Marshal, Link Appleyard, is an arrant coward who lacks the courage to stand up to the villains. Stoddard is befriended by Doniphon, although the two friends are unable to agree how best to tackle Valance. Doniphon, who is himself an expert with a gun (it is implied that he may be a former gunfighter himself) holds that brute force is the only thing Valance understands, but the more idealistic Stoddard takes the view that justice under the law must prevail. A complicating factor is the fact that Stoddard and Doniphon are both in love with the same woman, Hallie.A political controversy is raging in the area over the question of whether it should remain a US territory or become a State. The local cattle barons favour (for self-interested reasons) remaining a territory and hire Valance and his gang to intimidate the supporters of statehood, such as Stoddard and Dutton Peabody, the local newspaper editor. Stoddard, however, refuses to be intimidated, leading to a showdown between himself and Valance.The film was directed by John Ford, but in some ways it is unusual for a Ford Western from this period. It was made in black-and-white during the early sixties, a time when American films in general, and Westerns in particular, were starting to abandon monochrome for colour, as Ford had done in \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" and \"The Searchers\". It was mostly filmed in the studio, and contains none of Ford's trademark shots of his beloved Monument Valley or other spectacular Western scenery. There have been a number of theories to account for Ford's departure from his normal practice, but the most likely one seems to be that the studio, Paramount Pictures, simply wanted to save money and were unwilling to provide the extra cash needed for colour film or location shooting.During the early part of his career in the thirties and forties, James Stewart had the reputation of being Hollywood's \"Mr Nice Guy\", playing clean-cut, upstanding heroes. In the fifties, however, he made several Westerns, mostly with director Anthony Mann, in which his characters, while never outright villains, were often emotionally conflicted and morally ambiguous. This film can be seen as a return to the values of something like \"Destry Rides Again\", his best-known Western from his early period, as he is once again cast as a straightforward, unambiguous hero- brave, idealistic and honourable.\"Destry\" is generally regarded as a comedy-Western. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is not normally referred to as such, although it certainly contains comic elements. Both the cowardly Appleyard, always trying to find a legally watertight excuse for not doing his duty, and the drunken newspaper publisher Peabody are treated as figures of fun. For all his bravery and idealism, Stoddard himself can occasionally seem comical, as in the scene where Doniphon is trying to teach him how to use a gun. There is even something ridiculous about Liberty Valance himself, played by Lee Marvin as a slightly over-the-top caricature of the standard Western villain, except that standard Western villains do not have names which make them sound like a bedsheet from an upmarket London department store. When \"Liberty\" is used as a Christian name, it is normally a feminine one.Mixing a humorous element into an otherwise serious movie can be a mistake; Ford's final Western, \"Cheyenne Autumn\", made two years after this one, would have been a much better film without that unnecessary comic interlude. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" does indeed deal with some serious topics- the rule of law and law enforcement, political violence, the ethics of revenge and the role of a free press in a democracy- but the comic elements help to illuminate these serious themes rather than conflicting with them. (I was reminded of another Stewart film, Frank Capra's \"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\", which also uses humour to make some serious political points). It also deals with the way in which historical myths can grow up which become more important than historical truth- as one character says \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"There are a couple of flaws. Stewart, at 53, was too old to play the young Stoddard. I would not, however, agree with those who argue that John Wayne was too old for Doniphon, who I think was intended to be an older mentor to the inexperienced young man. (This was the first film in which Stewart and Wayne worked together; they were to do so again in Wayne's last film, \"The Shootist\"). The latter part of the film can be too drawn-out and I have never got the point of that scene near the end in which Doniphon burns his own house down. If, however, this is not a flawless film, it is still a very good one, and evidence that even in the autumn of his career Ford was capable of some excellent work. 8/10",

John Wayne gives his classic line, Pilgrim\", and Jimmy Stewart in his typical emotionally charged performance. But, it's Lee Marvin who steals the film as the sadistic Liberty Valance. For those too young to recall, there was even a hit song entitled, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. However, this classic would be extremely politically incorrect today. The film pokes fun and humor at excessive drinking and drunks. It makes fun of stutters, and stereotypes gay men. There are a number of other \"disturbing\" points including John Wayne's character calling his African-American male servant, \"Boy\". If one can overlook today's thoughts, then this is truly a great acted western classic.",

            "content": "Surprinsingly, Nostalgia already wasn't what it was in 1962, when John Ford filmed what is generally considered as his last masterpiece : \"The Man who shot Liberty Valence\". The west is won, but its spirit is gone and the film shows us that it's not necessarily a bad thing.Cinema appeared at the end of the West that is generally described : cinema has the same age that the railways, that in many movies, symbolize the end of an area (from this one to Leone's \"Once upon a time in the west\"). \"Liberty Vallence\" is the movie that tells this transition from a brutal period, where strength is everything, to a civilized period, where the law primes on force. Lee Marvin is Liberty Valence, the symbol of this brutal force of the West, and James Stewart, the \"Pilgrim\", is the other side of the time : the law. But the transition from one to another needs a mediation, that will bring the biggest Western star, John Wayne, how embodies Tom Doniphon, the man who'll make the changes possible, by using force in order to civilized the West.Ford gives a strong an wise look to this period, in a melancholic movie, that paradoxically explains that there is nothing to regret from the changes and the disappearance of a certain idea of the world. But the characters can't help thinking that they probably missed something, that their lives could have been very different. The movie is very modern, the biggest part of it is a long flashback. James Stewart, who's now a important senator, comes back with his wife to a small village apparently full of memories. They're here to assist to the funerals of an old friend : Tom Doniphon. But their presence here surprises the local journalist, that asked James Stewarts for explanations. It's only after this melancholic introduction that the movie really begins with a flashback : Randson Stodard will tell the story of a man from another time : Tom Donniphon. But, as the journalist finally said in a very famous sentence : \" This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" The last half hour of the movie is definitely the best, all the contradictory feelings are present, and the final duel is most impressive, beautifully filmed in Black and White photography. The twist at the end is unseen in Ford other's movies, and proves that he was still able in 1962 to direct a personal and original movie, even with the old star John Wayne, even in Black and White, even with the same narrative codes he uses since more than 30 years. This movie is still surprisingly interesting and complex, if you can see through its classicism.",

Yet, I cannot compare this one to others since it has such a different feel than films like Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, or The Searchers. It is startlingly more graphic in its depiction of violence, and the setup of scenes has a more modern grasp to them than any of Ford's previous work.And yet, I think that is exactly the point. John Wayne and James Stewart, two of the greatest stars of the Golden Age era, headline this movie, and I believe Ford used them to signal the end of one era and the beginning of another. At the time of its release, the studio system was starting to come unhinged, and it would soon become rule that you don't need rules to make a movie. Ford always worked by his rules in some way or another, but he seems to be going with the flow here. It takes time to establish the characters, but speeds head-on in covering a story with lots of underlying currents. This is an urgent movie.Of course, I don't think the story is what is most important here. What we see when we watch this movie is John Ford, the great American storyteller, going to great lengths to try new ideas and techniques, doing things he hadn't really done before. Everyone steps up their game, and the result is a film that can stand alongside Ford's greatest achievements.",

            "content": "A Western that isn't a Western? Perhaps this is double-talk. Yet `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' can be said to possess all the classic characteristics of the American Western, but with a few twists.While John Wayne and director John Ford teamed up for many memorable Westerns, tossing Jimmy Stewart into the mix in `Liberty Valance' turned the traditional Western formula on its ear. Instead of a tough, but noble Wayne doing battle with a lawless ruffian for honor, life and the girl's hand, we have something a bit different. The tough, but noble Tom Doniphan (Wayne) does indeed do battle with subhuman ruffian Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and IS trying for the hand of the attractive Hallie (Vera Miles). Stewart, however, mixes up the broth. A skinny eastern dude lawyer, Ransom Stoddard, is nearly beaten to death by a masked Valance during a stage robbery at the beginning of the story. Outraged that everyone \u0096 including Tom \u0096 concedes that the gun is mightier than the law in this wild territory, Rance stands his ground.This is the first screen meeting of Wayne and Stewart and the chemistry is wonderful. (It seems quite appropriate that they paired up a final time in Wayne's last film, `The Shootist.') Surprisingly, the bookish and na\u00efve, but inwardly tough Rance is a match for the tough, confident Tom. (In fact, the movie is worth renting just to see Stewart sock Wayne in the jaw!) In the strange quadrangle, Hallie is the tough, but inwardly vulnerable female love interest; Valance is the vicious threat to everything decent and above board; Rance is the real hero, in an anti-hero non-Western sort of way; and Tom is the upright and moral, but less idealistic big brother. A competitor with Rance for Hallie's affection, Tom bails Rance out more than once with fist and gun, yet cannot help developing a strong respect and liking for him. Each man turns in one of his finest performances.Ford is also at the top of his game \u0096 although it almost looks like a Frank Capra movie at times. The themes of voting, being responsible citizens, law and order, and the integration of immigrants of all genders and races into the melting pot of society are smacked over the viewers' heads like the mallet with which Rance bangs to try to get order during the election for territorial delegates. Still, the film works and Ford's points are made, thanks to strong work by proud German immigrants Peter and Nora Ericson (John Qualen and Jeanette Nolan), Pompey, Tom's dependable black sidekick (Woody Strode) and several Mexicans \u0096 all striving to learn English and become productive citizens. A cynic might call it `Mr. Smith Goes To Washington And Kills Liberty Valance.'I'm no cynic, though. This movie works because it breaks several Western clich\u00e9s, while keeping Wayne and Stewart true to their natural screen personas. The cast is fine, with bumbling Andy Devine as the useless marshal and Denver Pyle as one of Valance's obnoxious giggling sidekicks. The cinematography and pacing are outstanding, as one would expect in a Ford picture, and the viewer finishes the film with a satisfied feeling. Whether one is a big western fan or not, this is a movie to watch and to share with the whole family.",

            "content": "I could talk about this film all day long but I'm going to limiit myself to telling you that it's the finest work by John Ford, John Wayne, or James Stewart.  Ford's photography, with the deep shadows and careful camera placement, has to be seen to be believed: I swear to god that it makes his other work look like home movies by comparison.  Wayne's performance eclipses even his turn in \"The Searchers.\"  His scenes in the bar after discovering his woman with Stewart are the finest of his career and his whole angry performance has a maturity and gravitas that he never matched in any other film.  I've read that Ford was particularly brutal to him off-camera in this one, no doubt to keep him in the proper frame of mind, and it shows on the screen.  It's the most impressive portrayal of sheer strength I've ever seen, and reminds me of Lon Chaney, Sr..  The aspects of the movie that some less discriminating viewers perceive as flaws are actually subtle touches of genius: the claustrophic unreality of the obviously soundstage-shot flashback sequence, the barrenness of the interiors of the \"present day\" scenes, evoking the comparative sterility of more modern life, and the plot itself, marvelous in the context of the fact that none of the legends we take for granted can really be accepted at anything remotely resembling face value.  This film is so dense and rich that I'll simply refer the reader to the extant scholarship rather than proceed any further.  One amazing thing, though: this movie went right by Garry Wills in his superb book on Wayne; oddly enough, Wills didn't understand the movie and even had a basic misapprehension of the storyline itself.  In any case, whatever you do, don't miss this greatest of Hollywood movies, and when you watch it, give it your absolute full attention. You'll be very richly rewarded.",

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) :\nBrief Review -John Ford's Classic Western Drama which is slightly corresponded to Legendary Casablanca. Actually if have to say it in details then The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance isn't really anywhere close to Casablanca as far as the story is concerned but i found it little bit in the same way as Casablanca and also there is so much in the film i couldn't fit in one sentence so i decided to use Casablanca's reference to make it short and worthy. The story is about a Lawyer Ransom who enters in a western town and robbed by Liberty and his gang. He then meets Tom who is the only threat to Liberty to own this town and a girl named Hallie. Tom loves Hallie but never proposes her and Hallie falls in Love with Ransom. At last Liberty is killed by Ransom but it was actually Tom who killed him and he asks Ransom to leave the town with Hallie. Now if you remember Casablanca's Love triangle where Rick asks Ilsa to leave with her husband, here the situation is almost similar but set in different conditions. However, Casablanca has a pace while showing it but The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance takes a little time because there are things like politics and western town events involved in it. John Wayne in this film is just mind-blowing and his accent, attitude is kick-ass. Perhaps one of the finest character i have ever seen in Western film. James Stewart gets naive character but still finds a way to leave an impression despite the phenomena of John Wayne. Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, Edmund O'brian gets little but enough to do. John Ford has made a couple of mistakes which i would like to reveal. First, he kept the pace of the film slower than it should have been. Second, he revealed the future outcome of characters in the begining scene therefore killing the suspense of what actually happened in the past. Suppose, in Casablanca beginning scene you see Ilsa and her husband returning to see Rick after spending happily married life till they got old. It kills all the fun of climax that how Rick turned the things around and that's the problem with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Except these 2 things i couldn't really find anything to bash in this John Ford's Directorial Classic Western. Well, i called it Classic now you know everything.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "In John Ford's worst Western, artificially filmed almost entirely on sound stages, John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon. Doniphon has a ranch outside of Shinbone, a town terrorized by Liberty Valance. As befitting a character played by John Wayne, Doniphon talks tough: \"Liberty Valance's the toughest man south of the Picketwire ... next to me,\" he boasts. But on the two occasions when Doniphon has verbal confrontations with Liberty Valance, Doniphon is backed up by his \"boy\" Pompey, an imposing black man aiming his rifle right at Valance.I hate to say this about John Wayne, but Tom Doniphon is a coward. For all his tough talk, he doesn't face Liberty Valance in a fair fight. Instead, he hides in the shadows and bushwhacks him. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance more accurately Ambushed him. Then he Executed him. The one thing he didn't do was Face him. Or Outdraw him. Or Outgun him. Or Outfight him. In fact, in one embarrassing scene, the mighty Tom Doniphon couldn't even muster enough breath to blow out a match. In another scene equally embarrassing, a pacifist lawyer who Doniphon provoked punches Doniphon in his mouth and knocks him on his ass. So much for being the toughest man south of the Picketwire.Then there's John Wayne's performance. He was always more of a movie star than an actor, but in this film he was reduced to a caricature: John Wayne sounding like he's impersonating Rich Little impersonating John Wayne. Add to that the casting of the annoying Andy Devine as comic relief where none was needed, and O. Z. Whitehead, age 51, incredibly playing an elementary school boy who sucks lollipops, and in one scene, is seen skipping, and James Stewart and John Wayne both 20 years older than the characters they were playing.Honestly, if this had been John Ford's only Western, no one today would remember his name.",

Directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and James Stewart(one of my favorite actors) The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the best Westerns ever made.It endured a troubled production. Ford was such a stern director that he ridiculed Wayne and Stewart so they would deliver an efficient performance. Wayne would fight with Stroud because of this. But you cannot see this internal turmoil anywhere in the film.The film starts with a retired senator returning to his old town for a friends funeral and he begins recounting the tale of his adventures to a journalist. From there we are shown his early life and how he set out for a adventure as a idealist law graduate looking for adventure in the west.Liberty Valance is the archetypal bad guy. He kills ruthlessly and there is no remorse in any thing that he does. He isn't arrested because of the coward marshall.Unlike most westerns the film isn't about anti - heroes and lone warriors. It is about a town and its colourful characters. It is about their struggles. Their attempts to find beauty in the world and try to make sense of it as best as they can. There is no room for law & order . The film tries to talk about the need for all these things. You cannot go all guns blazing all the time. Like Batman you have to know where to draw the line between your enemies and yourself. An underlying feel throughout the film is about roots. How you cannot really leave the place where you are born. I love this quote by Abbas Kiarostami that talks about this. He says that he doesn't leave Iran because he would feel like a tree that has been shifted to a new location and suddenly the fruit wouldn't be good anymoreThere are moments of tremendous beauty and poignancy in the film. Like the cactus flowers. And the ending is one of the best I have ever seen. It was visceral. Sergio Leone calls this his favourite John Ford film because he says that Ford had finally learnt a word called pessimism. While I wouldn't call this film pessimistic. I would say this is his most true to life picture. Because it is the most chaotic, yet there is an answer in this chaos. There is beauty in it.",

But \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" always leaves you wondering about its characters and its story.The key character seems to be the Vera Miles role, who by the end of the film, has revealed a true love for both her husband Stewart and the recently departed Tom Doniphon (played by John Wayne).The movie is a complex study of intellectualism vs. brute force. Stewart as Ransom Stoddard begins the movie being appalled by the violence of Liberty Valance (played menacingly by Lee Marvin), but as the story unfolds, he comes to realize that such evil as Valance can not be eradicated by law books, but only by the necessary force of a gun.At first, I sided with Stewart all the way. I frankly have low tolerance for the great John Wayne. Too often his roles seem to be made of cardboard. But Wayne is a fine actor if given the exceptional material presented here.Stewart reveals his true weakness when, mistakenly believing he has committed murder, renounces any career in politics, since his main drawing card is that he was 'the man who shot Liberty Valance\". To build a career that champions law and order all because he has become a venerated murderer is repugnant to the Stoddard character.It takes the Wayne character to tell the true tale. Once Stoddard comes to know the truth, that he has not committed murder, he can accept his seat in politics and his role in taming the Wild West.Vera Miles is wonderful in the role of Hallie. The ending is a beauty for its sparse dialog. Even if the newspapers insist on 'printing the legend', we know that the man who shot Liberty Valance died unknown, with a cactus flower on his grave.I find that this movie, like all great films, gets more entertaining and interesting the more I see it. It is much more than it seems, and it brings together two screen giants, Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne.",

He also inspires the people to get involved with local politics.The local outlaws and bandit gang (Marvin) are against this idea. They play as the exact opposite. It turns into a classic struggle between order and chaos.There's a really powerful scene in the beginning where Marvin's gang of bandits ransack Stewarts wagon before they roll into town. Marvin discovers law books inside the luggage. Stewart informs him that he's a lawyer, to which his response is ripping pages out of the law book and shouting along the lines of \"This means nothing out here, I'll show you the law of the west\". He then takes his belt off and whips the crap out of Stewart.Sorry for all the spoiler, I just love that scene. It's a great movie that happens to be set in the west. Westerns to me are usually full of gunfights. This film is almost the complete opposite. The fighting is pretty minimalist. It focuses around the eventual duel between the protagonist and the antagonist, and that's about it.Great cinema. If you're open minded to a dialog-heavy western, check this out.",

Before reading some other reviews I didn't really notice how old the cast were, especially as the time frame varied. What fascinated was the theme that history gets faked. And the press is complicit. It strikes me that this is especially true of the history in this film. The pointer in the script was the phrase that all men are created equal, stumbled over by Woody Strode. All men are obviously not created equal, in any practical sense, and rarely treated equal. It is obvious to anyone who thinks twice that the basic aim of the Revolution was to preserve US slavery as long as possible, and to eliminate, or ethnically cleanse, the Native Americans, so as to grab their land. The demonisation of constitutionally powerless, good-natured and mentally disturbed King George III as a tyrant was, and is, ludicrous. The British Royal family have had no political power since 1714. So much for no taxation without representation. The land-hungry colonists made not the slightest attempt to seek representation in Britain, which would have scuppered their drive to get possession. So the fiction became fact, and this film seems to recognise the truth of this untruth. The story could have been better written, and the direction could have been more subtle and realistic, but the message is powerful. Print the legend. Make America great, whatever the means or method.

            "content": "John Ford, the director who took booth the western genre and the Hollywood storytelling into new dimensions in four decades, has made this classic Western. As the other John Ford-Westerns I have seen, \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is not an ordinary Western. And as the case with other Ford-Westerns, his way of storytelling is much more than just gunfights. And Ford\u00b4s gunfights is not the typical gunfights either.(Some small spoilers)It is hard to talking about Ford\u00b4s \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" without expose much of it's story, but it is for me a film that discuss truth and lie, a film about change, the contrast between \"the old ways\" and the modern civilization - with a little help from the railroad (as in \"C'era una volta il west\") and a film who wants to say that the west must be purified to leave the old ways and develop the modern world - but with dependence of the old ways and through sacrifice (instead of using the new ways - putting Valance in jail where he would belong in the modern world, the old way is used - he is shot to death instead). John Ford want to show us that the west had it's bad sides but that the new world is not always better. Some things change but some remains. He thinks that people are not always interested in facts, irrespective of what time they living in.\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is a movie that contain \"dusters\", the long coats which became standard in Westerns after Leone started to use them frequently in his later Westerns.\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" has a superb cast, such as a very cool John Wayne together with a Woody Strode in perfect shape.Rating: 10 of 10.",

            "content": "This may or may not surprise some musicologists and rock trivia nuts, but the very fine Gene Pitney song \"(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance\" is not even in this Western! The song was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. (Bacharach wrote for Famous Music which Paramount owned.) Gene Pitney stated: \"The only problem was that Paramount was in Los Angeles. By the time we finished recording the song which was tailor-made for the film, the movie was released already in Los Angeles with music taken from a 1939 film called Young Mr. Lincoln with Henry Fonda. Why in the world they used that I have no idea. It's a shame too, because I don't care if I was the one singing it or not, but the song 'Liberty Valance' would have really helped the film.\" The Bacharach-David composition was superbly performed by Gene Pitney under the production of Musicor Records founder Aaron Schroeder and recorded March 1962 in New York. The song went on to number 4 on the US charts and may be more famous than the film. Thomas J McKeon Indianapolis",

Intentionally or not this film is where this team passed their baton. The subject of the film at every turn seems to hinge on turning points of society, urban development and world views. From theromanticized violence of the past, to the calculated temperament of the future. Through the desert villages of yesterday to the bustling centers of tomorrow. Wayne is a brute dinosaur and Stewart is the studied man of reason. The film exists in a meeting ground between the simplistic west we knew from classicsand the world of the modern western. While The Magnificent Seven, made twoyears earlier set the stage for the spaghetti western, this set the stage for classics such as The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Inthese worlds the gunmen are fallible and the choices they make are sometimesirrational, with sad consequences. We sympathize with Wayne in this film in a way unlike any of his previous work.

He's the star of the movie, believe it or not, and he plays a politician who comes to the west expecting it to abide by the law. He quickly learns that out there the law is the gun. John Wayne is his educator and Liberty Valance is the name of the villain who terrorizes the town and has it in for Stewart in particular. I watch a lot of old movies and they're generally routine. Like Dirty Harry. Sure it was fun and exciting, but was it anything new? Ofcoarse not. Every once in a while there's an old movie like Network that is truly original and creative.

Jimmy Stewart is at his idealistic best. That's what makes this movie so profound: The juxtaposition of the images of these two acting giants.

The black and white photography is in several shots of a classical beauty, for example the train rolling in and out, to start and end the film. Naturally the cast is top-class. John Wayne looks totally desperate and heartbroken when he says to Jimmy Stewart: \"Allie is YOUR girl now.\" Lee Marvin's sardonic outburst in laughter when he makes Stewart fall while he is carrying a plate of steak makes him one of the most cynical villains ever seen in cinema. And the speechless expression on Stewart's face at the end, when the journalist tears his notes to pieces and decides not to publish what he has heard is more than an open book on his feelings, his disappointment too. However, to me photography and acting are only supporting the real message I see in this film: the crowd appreciates and values spectacular heroes, and has no or insufficient eye for moral and intellectual qualities. Ransom Stoddard had ideals as a young lawyer, and indeed he brought literacy, law and order to the little town of Shinbone. But his drama is that he realizes that these are not seen as his primary merits. He is pushed into a role of hero by an ignorant crowd, as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. And still, there is a message of hope, because for Tom Doniphon, the man who only knew to defend himself with violence and gunfire, there is nothing left but a lonely grave and a single flower.",

I find The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence an improvement though still light years short of George Stevens' Shane for example (perhaps significantly Stevens, unlike Ford, was not known for making westerns). The opening reel especially is suffused with melancholy and might be a flavor-of-the-month director transposing Uncle Vanya to the Old West. Then Ford falls victim to the old 'failed flashback' syndrome in which one person - in this case James Steward - begins by recalling a scene in which he himself was present but gradually that same flashback shifts perspective so that the original person has become a reporter rather than a participant. Duke Wayne gives one of his less mannered performances here and often just his presence in a scene is sufficient to lend gravitas. I've always admired Edmond O'Brien and I resent the way Ford makes him a buffoon, Lee Marvin phones it in as the eponymous villain of the piece but overall it had a pleasant feel to it.",

He is met by a newspaper journalist wondering why he is their. He explains as the movie then flashes back to Ransom's young days when he first arrived in town. He was immediately robbed by a man named Liberty Valance who also beat him. Ransom meets a beautiful young women (who you can see at the beginning ends up marrying him) as well as her boyfriend Tom Doniphon. As Liberty brings the town to his knees Ransom tries to help using law. First he tries to achieve statehood for his state rather than being a defenseless territory. He puts together a meeting for the town. Tom stands up for Ransom against Liberty at the meeting and he also nominated Ransom for representative. Liberty has one of his men nominate himself. Tom also teaches Ransom to use a gun. Later Liberty intimidates the townsfolk including the local journalist. This causes Ransom to meet liberty valance with a gun. Liberty shots Ransom in the hand and as he is about to finish off ransom, a shot quickly takes him out. Ransom at first believes he should drop out of the race believing it to be murder. However, many view it as self defense. When Ransom learns the truth however, that it was in-fact Tom who shot Liberty from a distance in cold blood. It was Tom who murdered Liberty Valance not the hero Ransom who killed him legally in self defense. The journalist he was telling this whole story to however, does not report this saying \"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\". Liberty and his wife board the rain back to DC as Ransom contemplates retirement.

Nearly every problem faced by educators is well-dramatized in a few short minutes. Lee Marvin would be thrilled to know that I utterly hated the character he portrayed.

While this movie cannot be the best Western (I believe the best Western is The Searchers) it certainly is a spectacular one. I love how the story gently unravels itself. THe movie begins with the story set in the future around 20 years. In that time, much has changed in the town. First, the funeral of Tom Doniphon, whose story is told through Ransom Stoddard. It is unknown how he died (SPOILER he just dies from natural causes). In the beginning too are all the characters that are left, Pompey, Link Appleyard, Hallie. ALl are in their elderly status. Yet it takes around one hour for the movie to reveal how they got into that state. The movie plays out as the story of a man's struggle through Western front. A story of a man as he tries to survive- and shoot Liberty Valance. It is the spectacular story of a man as he struggles with his love for a woman and his hatred towards a man, and a man that comes in between. As a western this movie certainly depicts the the spirit and the struggle of the new frontier. Here is the epitome of the harsh western life, where the struggle is not only how to live, but how to survive with people literally holding their guns up to your face. In the beginning the harsh western is even depicted as a place where bandits rob protagonist Ransom Stoddard. Here is the struggle even to eat, where Hally struggles to feed even her curstomers in the harsh western front. And all the performances are magnificent. James Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, and Woody Strode; these veterans of other westerns, notably John Wayne, allows for viewers to truly enjoy the film.",

In all of the tension, coming from the strong dialogues, and in all the romance, coming from the beautiful Vera Miles, he seems to have succeeded in defeating Liberty.

It follows a young lawyer moving to the small town of Shinbone to open a law practice and encountering an outlaw who initially beats him and later bullies him into a gunfight.Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) is an older Senator returning to Shinbone for the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). The local newspaper asks for an interview about his time in Shinbone, and he tells the story in a lengthy flashback.Ransom comes by stagecoach as a young lawyer to set up a law office in Shinbone. Before getting to town, a well-known local outlaw, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), robs and beats him. With no money, he's forced to wash dishes in the kitchen of a Swedish restaurant run by Peter (John Qualen) and Nora Ericson (Jeanette Nolan). They have a beautiful but illiterate daughter, Hallie (Vera Miles). Tom Doniphon, a local horse trader, plans to marry Hallie after he gets an addition built to his small home with the help of his African American helper, Pompey (Woody Strode).Ransom sets up his law office with the local newspaper publisher, Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), who is an alcoholic but brave reporter on the issue of the territory pursuing statehood against the opposition of the large ranchers north of the river. The ranchers utilize Valance to intimidate the townspeople and settlers south of the river, as well as the cowardly Marshall Link Appleyard (Andy Devine).Despite the conflict with Liberty Valance, Ransom refuses to carry a gun, despite the warning of Tom, who has become a friend. Then Ransom starts to practice with an old revolver. After additional insults and challenges by Valance, they end up in a climactic confrontation. We then learn how Ransom Stoddard survived, why he ended up with Hallie, and what happened after the fight.\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is a caricature bordering on satire because all the characters are exaggerations of believable people. James Stewart, in his 50s, tries to play a young lawyer with a love interest more than 20 years younger than he is. The town newspaperman and doctor are both drunks. The Marshall is afraid of his shadow. John Wayne, also in his 50s, is the tough guy made in his image. The townspeople play cards with Liberty Valance even though they're deathly afraid of him. Lee Marvin is an over-the-top outlaw. Twenty-five years after he began making classic westerns, John Ford should have done better. There's no nuance in the movie.",

            "content": "The Man who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) John Ford was one of the few directors who could deftly balance entertainment with more ambitious elements in the undercurrent. Because of that, his appeal to mainstream audiences was as wide as deep his reverence among aficionados. His films are among the favorites of many great directors, from Scorsese to Kurosawa.Ford made great films throughout his long and illustrious career. One of those was The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. That film, like many of his others, is skewered with problems and elements of period melodrama acted sometimes by not so great actors. But nevertheless, those films, and this one, survive and thrive in spite of them.James Stewart plays Rance Stoddard, a big wig senator, once a small time lawyer. His fame came as a result of his killing of a notorious outlaw, Liberty Valance. Rance tells his story to a group of reporters when he returns with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to the small town where he found fame for the funeral of a man - Tom Doniphon. Lee Marvin plays Valance, who's gang holds up Rance's coach, then mercilessly beats him. He's found by Tom, a rugged wild man played with ferocity by John Wayne. He has a side kick, Pompey, a towering African American. The two men get along, but there is conflict under the surface. At this stage in the game, Hallie appears to be in line for Tom, not Rance. Rance preaches the word of the law, while Tom insists the only way to survive in this essentially lawless land is through the word of the gun. He frequently stands up for Rance when Liberty rides into town, and though never outwardly stated, seems to emasculate Rance with his protection of him. In the mean time, Rance is persuaded to start teaching the townsfolk to read and write, and starts working for the local paper. He is a jack of all trades but the gun.When the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarrassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end.The first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen.Ford's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch.As noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals.Nevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.",

            "content": "The man who shot liberty valence is an unusual western, one more complex than almost all other westerns out there. The film is entertaining and absorbing, but at the same time also intimate. The film eschews over emphasising tough guy cowboys with their tough talk and tough guns, instead choosing to divert its focus on important questions to do with civilisation and modernisation. We go and explore the lives of ordinary characters like the Swedish couple who owns the only restaurant in town, or the editor of the small newspaper. The two leads are exquisitely played, and the black and white cinematography is superb. But ultimately this is a sad film because of its ending. The last 20 minutes of the film might seem, on first glance, unnecessary and superfluous, and we would much rather the film be ended right after Ransom kills Liberty and our hero rides of into the sunset. This ending would be more satisfying, but John ford denies us this satisfaction. He fully fleshes out the themes in his ending. Modernisation and civilisation have triumphed over brute force. Tom becomes a self sacrificing hero- he recognises that his ways are slowly becoming an anachronism, and liberty's death would herald the age of civilisation and the rule of law. He chooses to help Ransom, but does so silently as a self sacrificial act. He loses the girl, and it is presumed he dies a lonesome, depressed character. His act has to be silent because the character who (appears) to kill liberty would be immortalised and be thrust into the responsibility to lead the new civilisation. Tom recognises he is a poor fit as such a leader, but ransom is perfect for such a job, so he does what he does. But all in all, I think the film ends on a sanguine note. Having helped achieve great progress for the territory, now senator Ransom wants to retire there. I think Ford is implying that Ransom, having achieved so much for his state, does not need the political support as \"the man who killed liberty valence\". I think he will now retire to Shinbone, and tell the truth about a great, self sacrificing hero- the real man who killed liberty valence.",

            "content": "James Stewart plays a senator named Stoddard who returns to the town of Shinbone with his wife (Vera Miles) to attend the funeral of an old friend named Tom Donovan (John Wayne). The local newspaper picks up on the senator's visit and wants an interview and the scoop on who Tom Donovan was.Stoddard is reluctant to do so, but the editors insist so he proceeds to tell them a tale about himself that they don't want to hear.About how 30 years before, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) robbed the stagecoach that Stoddard was riding on in his trip out west, beat and robbed him and left him for dead. Until Tom Donovan came along and saved his life by bringing him back to town in order to receive medical attention. Donovan's also taken to calling Stoddard; \"Pilgrim\". (laughs) Valance is the all around bully in Shinbone that people go out of their way to avoid, and that includes Stoddard who agrees to work for Vera Miles' families restaurant while he decides to later open a law practice there. And it also turns out that Donovan is the only one in town that Valance is afraid of. Only after Valance and his henchmen (played by Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin) viciously beat the drunken newspaper editor (overacted by Edmond O'Brien) that Stoddard agrees to meet Valance on the street for a duel.Valance shoots first, wounding Stoddard, but then Stoddard fired back, killing Valance. Or does he...? We all know Stoddard the tenderfoot can't hit the side door of a barn, right? One of the lesser known John Ford oaters that's out there, this has the disadvantage of being filmed on Paramount's back lot in b/w, instead of the wide-vista on location filming that we've come to expect from him. It also goes on a little bit too long at the end after Valance is shot. He could have wrapped it up a lot sooner, imo.But even so, a lesser John Ford western rises above most of the other oaters out there.7 out of 10",

            "review_title": "Once It Was a Wilderness, Now It's a Garden",
            "content": "A train arrives in the plains, the ominous dark smoke polluting the grand nature. It arrives to a nicely civilized small town in the west. Comes out a famous politician. He says he came for the funeral of a friend, Tom Doniphon, that most people have forgotten. The politician sees the body, insists \"where are his boots? where is his gun belt.\" The boots, which was awfully nice, was taken by the undertaker, the funeral paid by the county. \"I am not going to make any money out of this,\" the undertaker says, who was going to sell these boots for gaining some extras. A fat and sad old man, a former marshal, mentions very quietly about the gun belt, \"he didn't carry a handgun for years.\"With a masterful economy of narrative, the beginning already crystallizes the thematic cores of this film, one of the last westerns by the master of the genre John Ford. Once it was a wilderness, the wild west. Now it's a garden, with churches, high schools, shops... civilized. But already the progress doesn't seem to be that positive--the symbol of civilization that opens the film, the train, is invading the innocence of the nature with black smoke. It's menacing. The town is clean but void of any charms. Many conversation about money, rather petty amounts. When the politician meets the black guy who worked for the dead friend, he palms some bills pretending to shake hand--a very acted out gesture of subtly caring--Jimmy Stewart is superb. The politician is obviously bluffing, acting out his charm. But at the funeral parlor, his attitude, even his manner, changes totally. Suddenly he is sincere, asking that his friend should be buried with boots and gun belt, symbol of a heroic westerner--that everybody has forgotten, now perished in poverty and oblivion.With James Stewart the iconic star of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and the hero of the heroes of the western genre John Wayne, both playing more their own star personas, the ideals they had represented for the American cinema, than just their roles in one film, John Ford weaves out a complex analytical elegy on the myth of the west, crystallizing its inherit contradictions. This melancholic elegy is in no way sentimental nor positive, even surprisingly bitter and cold for the filmmaker that Orson Welles once called \"the poet and the comedian.\"The politician confesses the past between his and the friend who has died, the surprising truth about how he became the champion of \"law and order,\" arriving to the west with the hope of bringing civilization and democracy to the people of the west.But that tale is in no way an idyllic one. The young lawyer that he was being totally powerless against the law of the guns and violence of the west. The local community of small everyday people was menaced by an outlaw hired by the big ranchers. Only the heroic western gun man, that friend now going to be buried, could confront the outlaw. He told the young lawyer he should carry a gun if he wanted to survive. the young lawyer initially refused, as that would contradict his ideals of civilizations.The young lawyer opened a school. When he was talking about the democratic principles of the United States in the class room decorated by portraits of Washington and Lincoln and the Stars and Stripes, the gunman-friend came in to warn that the outlaw was approaching the small town. All the students had to leave, for safety. The lawyer, depressed, erased what he had written on the blackboard; \"education is the basis of law and order.\"The plot develops around how the lawyer Jimmy Stewart and the gunman John Wayne, totally disagreeing with each other, yet somewhat joined hand to beat the outlaw and the big ranchers. But the struggle can only be a twisted one. It reveals the most terrible sacrifice democracy and civilization needed to pay to be realized--by making compromises, ending up betraying the very core of its ideology. The honest and non-violent lawyer becomes a politician by taking violence in his hands and then corrupting his morals; nevertheless that was a necessity for the people. The old-fashioned heroic gunman has to disappear in oblivion, even willingly so, so that democracy and civilization can take over the outlaw wilderness.Disguising a western mixed with a mystery whodunit story, what 'The Man Liberty Valance' really tells is the dark side of the American history. Democracy and the American ideals could be realized only by violence, compromises, and even lies. The civilization started with moral corruption already from the very beginning.Ford doesn't only decomposes the myth he was chiefly responsible to create; the western myth, the myth of the frontier hero. At the same time he mourns what was lost in \"the progress,\" the innocence that there was once in the wilderness, even though it was a rough time for the people to survive. That melancholic minimalist poetry is crystallized in the delicate beauty of a cactus rose, the only genuine presence in this bitter tale of historical self-deception.\"Once It was a wilderness, now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?\" asks the politician's wife. He can only remain silent, then asks \"Who put the cactus rose on Tom's Coffin?\" She replies, \"I did.\" The train leaves in what was once a wilderness--what it used to be a beautiful innocent landscape.",

John Wayne looks and acts like the consummate professional he was; Jimmy Stewart displays his talent for adapting to the role of an intelligent but sensitive man thrust into events and situations he has no experience in assessing nor reacting to with certainty.  The supporting players are finely cast.  Lee Marvin's rendition of the immoral, violent and unpredictable Liberty Valence is nearly pitch perfect. Despite the play-like settings the film is superior to almost any non-location Westerns, and to an extent views like \"Stagecoach\" shot many years earlier.  In particular some of the elements of great film are here, including a surprise, great acting and a few real moments.  Watch Wayne stumble in an angry drunken jog as he determines to destroy a dream; it is just about perfect.",

            "content": "Yet another John Ford/John Wayne western (Their last best work combined). Add to that James Stewart and Vera Miles (Post Psycho) and a very determined Lee Marvin. The result is a very impressive adventure western with a touch of politics and American Legislation. As the title suggests, there is a guy by the name Liberty Valance who has been shot and since none of lead heroes respond to that name, Valance must be the villain and he truly is. Apart from that James Stewart plays a honest lawyer who thinks that all criminals should be treated as per the American Laws and violence is not the way to deal with them. John Wayne plays what he plays best - A tough guy from the west who is a genius with the gun and has a golden heart too. Lee Marvin is Liberty Valance - The Bad Guy, who is the most feared and dreadful mobster and who loots and kills innocent civilians, mocks the law and has a gang of just two people. Both Stewart and Wayne have their different takes on Liberty and how he should be punished for his deeds. But the movie just does not end at punishing Liberty, it moves a bit forward and ventures into politics going as far as the American Congress at Washington.What separates an ordinary western from a special one is the handling of the genre itself. John Ford is the master of the genre and he has excelled with this particular movie as well. As far as the acting is concerned, it is a cakewalk for John Wayne to play the tough guy from the west, he does a fine job. James Stewart also plays the frail, non-violent yet determined law abider who becomes a Senator convincingly. Vera Miles plays the love interest of both the leads and has done a good job at that. Lee Marvin is exceptional in the few scenes he has got in the movie. He was truly one of the plus points of the movie. The hallmark of a great director is how he deals with the supporting cast along with the leads of the movie. John Ford is known to extract the best from his supporting cast and this movie shows that. Overall, 'Watch it Pilgrim'.Rating : 8/10",

Frankly I've never been able to figure that out. You've got Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne and Lee Marvin all giving powerhouse performances in a movie filled with great characterizations by everyone involved. A mature western that tells a simple and basic story of events surrounding the bid for Colorado Statehood (at least I figure its Colorado-the Purgatory River or the \"Picketwire River\" is located in southeastern Colorado) and about life in the old American west of the second half of the 19th century. It was a lawless and reckless time and always a hard life for even the most rough and tough individuals of their day.Bottom line. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with it's black and white cinematography gives us what we want most from a movie, to be entertained. This movie does that from the first scene to the last frame. Ford's direction is outstanding in what would be his last great film production.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance belongs right up there with the greatest westerns ever made. The best of the best, like Red River, My Darling Clementine, Shane, High Noon, The Searchers, The Westerner, Rio Bravo, Once Upon a Time in the West, Unforgiven, Stagecoach and Winchester '73. Let's not forget the John Ford-John Wayne cavalry trilogy of Fort Apache, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande.Over the years few directors have been as successful storytellers as John Ford had been. Ford could hold the audiences attention with his highly crafted style approach to filmmaking. No director has won more Oscars then Ford who had four to his credit, plus two additional for his WW2 documentary, Midway. Surprisingly none were given to him for a western. It doesn't matter. John Ford perfected the western in a career that spanned almost 60 years as a director, beginning with silent films.

He is a hero who pretends not to be a hero . A man who gives all the credit for a deed he has done to Ransom Stoddard, played by James Stewart. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne's character) hates Stoddard yet he does what he does because he knows it is best for his girl and the West, even if it tears him up inside and leaves him a forgotten man. James Stewart is excellent as the traditional hero. He is Ransom Stoddard, a lawyer from the East who is determined to bring justice to the West without gunfire. The irony is that he only succeeds after gun play is attributed to him. He becomes a success for being good with a gun at a very important time even though he did not do what he was credited for. His victory is hollow and his success is without satisfaction. Lee Marvin was super in this film as the baddest bad guy in the West. The rest of the supporting cast was top-notch. Go see this film.

            "content": "Despite a trusted recommendation and a high reputation, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have reservations as I sat to watch. I'm no fan of John Wayne in any capacity, and with few exceptions, westerns as a genre don't capture my imagination in the way that other pictures do. Fine as it is, this picture isn't entirely free of these concerns. Not least of all compared to his co-stars, the impression stone-faced Wayne makes with his wooden acting is less of a world-class talent exhibiting skills to carry the film, and more of one unremarkable piece of a large puzzle falling into place to fill the space that has been made for it, and getting praised for the fact of it. There are instances of scenes that struggle with pacing, taking too long to do what they must and/or lingering after they should be over. I see these as unfortunate imperfections, especially as they are so prominent throughout the length.Set these aside, though, and even given a presentation in black and white, 'The man who shot Liberty Valance' bursts with vibrant color and life that cannot be dulled. Every other person in the ensemble illustrates tremendous acting skills, even with a single glance or expression, that elevates the feature to extraordinary heights. James Stewart rather seemed to have specialized in portraying honest, optimistic men out of their depths, and his lead role of Ranse fits neatly into that mold. The sheer viciousness Lee Marvin embodies as Liberty is sickening, from a standpoint of empathy, and joyous as a viewer. Andy Devine's blustery marshal, Edmond O'Brien's drunken newspaperman, Woody Strode's faithfully loyal handyman, and all other parts are realized with welcome, terrific emotive range and personality that's like a shower of sparks brightening the feature. Vera Miles gives love-struck Hallie a sweet but sorrowful warmth and innocence that's greatly satisfying. How lucky Wayne was to share the screen with these players, that his flat, grey acting could be elevated by the company it kept.The narrative these characters inhabit, summoned forth by the cast, is rich and classic. It's a Western, yes, set in an as-yet unincorporated territory where the law was defined more by strength and will than word. More than that, though, this is a story of change, progress, and hope, contrasted against a backdrop of senseless violence, tradition, and quiet, languishing forlornness. We're treated to glimpses of that harried transition before, during, and after, spotlighted partly through the appearance of the town of Shinbone, but especially exemplified by the people who are swept up in it. And with that, 'The man who shot Liberty Valance' transcends the bounds of genre and becomes timeless, and almost mythical - a word that seems particularly appropriate in light of the plot. There's brusque violence as jarring as the most severe of Western epics, and heartfelt sincerity as palpable as the most family-friendly pictures Stewart made with Frank Capra, and the melding of these elements into one film is impactful and rewarding in ways I hadn't anticipated, besting my expectations.The production design is outstanding, as is the costume design. The cinematography is impeccable, and just as John Ford's reputation as director speaks volumes, he proves his worth here. In almost every way, 'The man who shot Liberty Valance' is roundly stupendous, engaging and compelling. As someone who doesn't spend much time with the genre at large, I may have missed out on this altogether if not for one important recommendation, but I'm so very glad I was steered toward it. There are some titles whose quality is so very high that notable flaws or indelicacies can't truly hold them back, and they demand viewership even from those who may not always think of them in the first place. I would say this is one of those titles. Bearing in mind the violence and some racist dialogue, as content warnings, 'The man who shot Liberty Valance' is a strong, deserving work of cinema that continues to stand tall 60 years later. Don't pass up an opportunity to watch this.",

His talent was modest and he pre-dates Method acting but some of his performances are just fine.His reward for his lifetime of effort was that in the nineties George Bush's son Neil and other vermin of his ilk, utilizing the new deregulations, caused the savings and loan crisis, losing billions of investors money. All was lucky for Neil as dad had just become president and he quickly put the nation into a war (at great profit to himself) to distract people from the debacle that rich brats like Neil had helped bring about. Neil should have gone to jail, but jail is for poor people. The Bush family is just the gift that keeps on giving.Jimmy Stewart lost his fortune and ended his life in comparatively dire straits.",

            "content": "This movie can't withstand close examination to \"The Searchers,\" which raised the Western genre to an art form and inspired \"Taxi Driver\" and other screen classics. Yet, John Ford further demythologizes the John Wayne character he helped create (compare, for instance, Wayne's first entrance in \"Stagecoach,\" a tight closeup that should leave no doubt to The Ringo Kid's ability to make everything work out for the best, with his final scene in \"Valance,\" where he leaves the convention hall after persuading Ransom Stoddard to do the right thing. Although not as emotionaly stirring as the classic final shot of \"The Searchers,\" the ending to \"Valance\" works similar ground. \"Valance\" shows us people electing the right person for the wrong reason and, in the case of Wayne vs. Valance, someone doing the wrong thing (i.e., killing Valance) for the greater good. One reads that Ford just wanted to get \"Valance\" over with and, yes, the screenplay is riddled with cliches (Edmond O'Brien's role is played for laughs, for one thing, and anyone who knows anything about the West can guess that Valance is holding aces and eights, the so-called \"dead man's hand,\" before his shootout with Ranse). But the movie is great entertainment, never more so than when Wayne and Lee Marvin are on screen together (\"He's been hiding behind your gun long enough, Tom. You've got a choice, dish washer. You can leave town or be out in the street tonight. And don't make us come get you!\"). Vera Miles, John Qualen (a staple of many Ford films) Jeannette Nolan, Denver Pyle and Woody Strode are ideally cast.Two Westerns make my career top 10, one each by Howard Hawks and John Ford: \"Red River,\" a triumph despite a trite ending, and \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,\" which is much more than the flawed masterpiece many have made it out to be. Critically, both provide entertainment upon repeated viewings, which any great movie should.",

The acting was pretty good from most of the cast; although boy am I tired of seeing John Wayne play the exact same character in every single move. The cinematography and music didn't stand out as either good or bad. Some of the emotional moments - especially for the main character - did a great job of making you feel for the character experiencing the emotions. The weakest part of this movie was the pacing; the organization of slow scenes and action scenes felt too-slow in some places, and too-fast in others.

James Stewart plays Ransom Stoddard, a senator who slips into town unannounced to pay respects to a man forgotten in time. When the editor of the town paper asks the reason for the visit, Ransom tells the film's story in flashback.The story is about a young lawyer who is robbed before he ever reaches his destination. He is determined to get revenge, somehow, through legal means. But western justice rules Shinbone. The fastest gun makes the laws. Ransom is educated in the facts of life by Tom Doniphon (John Wayne).The entire film, while ostensibly a story about a territory on the verge of statehood, and the war between cattlemen and sodbusters, is a story of ideas. Is the pen mightier than the sword? Does good always win over evil? Can true lawfulness exist if force is required to maintain it?Lee Marvin plays the villain, Liberty Valance, with a broad brush. And he is accompanied by two sidekicks portrayed, improbably, by Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin. Marvin will parody his character years later in \"Cat Ballou\".The town is populated with interesting characters that make the film even more fun to watch. This is a drama punctuated with moments of comedy and side stories. No wonder it is one of the most admired westerns of all time. No surprise, since it was directed by John Ford.",

This is how legends are born.\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" (1962) is a superbly solid movie, but not a traditional western.

This movie sort of reminded me \"Unforgiven\" (1992), another superb movie set in west, but not a western in usual sense. Both movies deals with a legend status, and a true grit and reality beyond the legend. Although they are very different in style and mood, both share similar feeling of change of times in the old west, when old gunslingers were replaced by law and modern times. Overall, not going into plot details, \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is an very entertaining motion picture from start till the end. It is not a traditional western, but it a very entertaining drama set in the old west. James Stewart is great in here, while John Wayne is more or less like usual John Wayne except for the ending, nevertheless he is a joy to watch.

            "content": "It's very difficult to discuss this terrible movie without giving away more of the story than a reviewer properly should.  Maltin says it was panned when it first came out.  That's readily understandable.  He adds that it's since become a classic.  That isn't.  `Valance' is seriously flawed in almost every aspect, although the huge cast is filled with fine, familiar faces, John Ford regulars.  Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles are peerless.  Lee Marvin is a marvelous sneering heavy.  His villainy is never explained; he's just pure evil.  He plays Liberty, by the way, and the originality of the name is one of the movie's few interesting points.  The entire film is cast as a flashback, a clumsy device that accomplishes absolutely nothing.  We're given a climactic \u0096 but amateurishly devised \u0096 flashback within the flashback.  The story is a mishmash of several stillborn plot lines.  An eastern tenderfoot (Stewart) in the Old West is befriended by a swaggering John Wayne, who of course has a heart of gold.  There's an inevitable love triangle, assumed by the audience but never actually dramatized.  There's an underdeveloped conflict between homesteaders and open-range cattlemen in a quest for statehood.  The territory isn't named.  Presumably it's Arizona, since a few fake saguaros are stuck here and there in the infrequent location shots.  At one point, some lines are quoted from the Declaration of Independence, and Jefferson is named as the (principal) writer.  But the quote is said to be from the Constitution.  Superb research there.  Even the splendid John Ford slips seriously in leading us to believe an important character has died when he hasn't.  It's a flat-out error in direction, or perhaps \u0096 to be kind \u0096 an uncorrectable result of a last-minute rewrite. The inept cut that ends the `deathbed' scene only makes the mistake more obvious.  Long before the welcome end of the film, so many artistic failures had accumulated that I found it hard to pay attention to the screen, despite the eminently talented people involved.  The writers are not included in this group.  It's generous not even to name them.",

Although typical of the films of the time (especially those with 'dark themes' that needed the tone to be lightened) they do jar modern sensibilities.The problem is the excess of such characters and their rather broadly drawn characterisations in the midst of much subtler and realistic people. The cowardly sheriff would be acceptable as comic relief on his own, as would the town stammerer. But the newspaper owner being portrayed as a comedy drunk is a gross miscalculation; he is an important character and his courage is undermined by this portrayal. The savage beating he receives from Liberty Valance and his gang is less effective and frightening than it could and should be.However such are the timeless themes that this still remains an impressive piece of work.",

A number of scenes have the players in makeup so they look elderly (like that was needed). But, somehow it just makes the production look like a crappy high school play.I saw this film years ago and remember that I hated it. I saw that it was on the other day and figured I'd give it another try; I love a good western, and was probably too critical the first time around.No, I was right, this movie is appalling.It centers on a young idealist, fresh out of law school, who heads west to practice. That would be someone around 25 years old given the circumstances.The atrocious casting assigns the role to a 54 year-old James Stewart. His nemesis and rival for the hand of the lovely maiden in the story is a local no-nonsense tough-guy rancher. In real life this would probably be a 25 to 30 year-old experienced western man.The god-awful casting gives this role to a rapidly aging 55 year-old John Wayne.So, now we have two men supposedly infatuated with a young woman who would be the age of their grandchildren in real life.Another part is assigned to a ranch hand, also a supposed youth, who in one scene is kicked out of the room because he is \"too young to vote.\"That part is played by 51 year-old O. Z. Whitehead.Again, we have the young and illiterate waitress who is ready to marry - a 16 to 18 year-old in those days.That part is given to 33 year-old Vera Miles. At least she is only one generation older than the part she is playing.So, in the end, this movie had everything going for it: An exciting western adventure full of interesting characters and some good plot twists.Unfortunately it is a great story completely ruined by a cast of geriatric actors.",

As this is one of the first films in this subgenre, we still have good and bad guys here, but they are shown much more realistically than in the classic western. Good guys have their bad sides and hidden intentions, while the bad ones have a well-developed motivation for their deeds, which, although it does not justify them, at least makes us understand them and allows us to look at things from their perspective.The movie shows the modernization of the Wild West, which is slowly ceasing to be a wilderness ruled by the law of the stronger. Instead of cowboys vs. Indians, here we have a conflict of morals and laws against gunslinger lifestyle. While most of the characters still stick to the tested recipe of the classic western, John Wayne's character has tried a more realistic approach to characterization, and the hero we are used to is starting to show the characteristics of an anti-hero.The story is interesting and tries its hand at non-linearity, but for my taste too simple and naive. A limited budget forced Ford to shoot in the studio, so the film, limited to four walls, lost the visual impressiveness typical of westerns. And James Stewart is too old for his role so much that at times it's ridiculous. With due respect to the idea behind this film and the influence it left on the genre, I think it is quite overrated, but it is definitely worth a look.7,5/10",

When the legend becomes fact, print the legend\". - Maxwell Scott, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance In John Ford's most mournful tale, the legendary director asks the question \"How did this present come to be? Just how did an inferior race of men whose only weapon was that of law and books defeat the old gunslingers of the great West? Just what exactly happened to the Western heroes portrayed by John Wayne when law and order came to town? How did the wilderness turn into a garden? In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Ford depicts a world where everyone has got everything they wanted, but nobody seems happy with it sound familiar to anyone? Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to Shinbone on a train with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to visit the funeral of an old friend named Tom Doniphon (John Wayne, remarkably the film opens where this iconic star is dead). The newspaper men have never heard of him, so why would such a powerful political figure visit the town to attend this funeral of a \"nobody\"? Through the use of a flashback, Stoddard tells us the tale of how he came to the town as a young lawyer but was immediately attacked by the psychotic villain Liberty Valance (terrifyingly played by Lee Marvin) who teaches him \"Western law\". The rest of the film tells the tale of how the man of books eventually defeated the race of the gunslinger and what sacrifices had to be made for that to happen.In truth, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is more of a melodrama than a Western. Gone are the vibrant landscapes of Ford's landmark movie The Searchers six years earlier, which was so proudly promoted as being in VISTAVISION WIDESCREEN COLOR and instead the film has given way to a bleak, claustrophobic black and white tale, with so many enclosed sets and not one shot of Monument Valley.There's a lack of a real bar scene, lack of shots of the landscape, lack of horses, lack of gunfights. It's a psychological Western, probably unlike anything ever filmed until maybe Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Why is this movie so good then? In basic terms, it's about the sadness of progression and without giving way too much away the film tells a remarkable tale which truly does examine what Ford's view of the West as promoted in his earlier work truly meant. It's a tragic and pessimistic movie but it's a rewarding one, with huge replay value and one that leaves you with so many more questions than it does answers.Do we prefer the legendary tale of our heroes or the truth? Are tales of people such as 'The Man With No Name' just more interesting than Wyatt Earp? Is living a lie as a successful guy better or worse than quietly dying as a hero? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the most complex Westerns that has ever been put on film and is a remarkable film when you consider it was directed by a guy who made his living telling grandeur tales of the American West. Well acted, very well written and is one of the most rewarding Westerns for replay value in the history of the genre.",

Curiously, the limited budget Ford was given for this picture forced him to use more indoor sets, less elaborate locations (no monument valley) and even a few sound stage exteriors. This gives the film a curious and unique \"look\" of an early 1960's T.V. western, but with a decidedly \"A\" movie cast and script. The film explores the themes of authority versus anarchy, encroaching civilization upon the fading \"old west.\" James Stewart represents law and order and progress as (in flashback) a youngish eastern lawyer who comes to the western town of Shinbone to introduce literacy and lawfulness to the people. He runs afoul of the symbol of lawlessness and anarchy in the person of Liberty Valance, a thoroughly amoral, heartless terrorist, here masterfully portrayed by Lee Marvin. John Wayne plays the intermediary character of Tom Doniphon, a rough, tough, straight talking, take no bull@#t type who recognizes the value of law and order, but knows that a gun is the most expedient and reliable persuader and peace keeper, if wielded skillfully. Doniphon befriends Stewart's character, Rance, and eventually helps Rance bring order to Shinbone. I won't give the method away except to say that Rance becomes successful due to the way in which he dispatches Valance, thus making his political ascendancy possible. He is the legendary \"man who shot Liberty Valance\". He must live with the truth behind the hyped up legend. The performances in this picture are a joy. Everyone is at the top of his game here. Lee Marvin should have won an Oscar. Hell, they all should have. Edmund O'Brien and Ford staple John Carradine were a bit over the top, however. Both seemed under the impression that they were performing gaslight melodrama. Vera Miles Plays the love interest in a rivalry triangle between Rance and tom, and she's appropriately saucy, irascible, and enjoyable here. Her Hallie is a virtual continuation of Laurie from \"The Searchers\". Great Western, well made.",

            "content": "It was directed by John Ford, and it features a screenplay by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck that was based on the story by Dorothy M. Johnson. The titled story is told in flashback by James Stewart's character, Ransom Stoddard, who's now a United States Senator that has returned home to Shinbone to attend the funeral of his old friend Tom Doniphon, played (in flashback) by John Wayne. Woody Strode plays Tom's dependable ranch hand Pompey.While answering questions from reporters, the Senator recalls the day he met his future wife Hallie (Vera Miles), in attendance, and how he became known as \"the man who shot Liberty Valance\", a notorious outlaw played (in flashback) by Lee Marvin.However, once the truth is revealed - that Ransom had been an educated nonviolent man (\"a fish out of water\") in the untamed West, capable of standing up to the bully when it finally had to be done but incapable of stopping Valance, even after the outlaw had been drinking (it was Tom that had done the deed from a side alley, initially unbeknownst to Ransom, to protect his friend, and he had lost his girl Hallie, sympathetic to the future Senator, in the process), which was contrary to the \"facts\" as they were known - Carleton Young's character speaks the famous quote: \"This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"The cast includes so many (Western) movie veterans that it's a virtual \"who's who\" of character actors: Edmond O'Brien as a newspaper editor, Andy Devine and his insufferable creaky voice, John Carradine, John Qualen, Willis Bouchey, Young, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin, and Lee Van Cleef (among others).It is incomprehensible to me that such a masterpiece as this only received one Academy Award nomination (Edith Head's B&W Costume Design was Oscar nominated)!Added to the National Film Registry in 2007.",

            "content": "I've been catching up on a lot of great westerns lately and for me the teaming of Wayne and Stewart is enough to have made this a great film. The only actor who could ever get away with playing a part he was much too old for was James Stewart. He also did it brilliantly in \"Spirit of St. Louis\". He put a lot of passion and volatility into the young Stoddard and a lot of bluff and stuffiness into the older version. I always loved the irony of the ending. Edmond O'Brien is wonderful as the drunken newspaper editor but I wonder if his miraculous recovery had something to do with Ford keeping his options open as to cutting the film down in the editing process. It does seem a bit too long.O'Brien played a similar over- the -top character in \"The Girl Can't Help It\" which any fan of fifties pop culture should see if they haven't already. He's also great in the \"Wild Bunch\" which should be seen in the longest version available.I bought the DVD of \"Valance\" and was surprised that the theme song sung by Gene Pitney was not in the film! This seems pretty crazy to me. Does anybody know why? I assume it was sung over the opening and /or closing credits of the film in it's theatrical release but I don't know. I got burned in a similar way recently when I bought a \"Petticoat Junction\" DVD which didn't have the familiar theme song at the beginning of each episode. What gives? They should at least have a disclaimer on the cover if they tamper with history like that.Lee Marvin was one of the baddest bad guys in screen history! Check out\" TheComancheros\" where the Duke takes him out way too early in the film and \"Cat Ballou\" where he plays two roles one ,the gunfighter Strawn, is pretty much a send-up of Liberty.

Call Stoddard the idealist and Doniphon the realist, but don't call him the better man. In 1946, John Ford directed My Darling Clementine, perfectly blending Wayne and Henry Fonda with his usual cast of characters to create a masterwork. Sixteen years later, he put Wayne together with Stewart (plus all the ol' gang) and made another peerless film. There was a time I didn't really \"get\" John Ford and John Wayne.

This movie deals in messy reality, stepping up from a different angle, yet in a way that involves a necessary sacrifice for good to triumph.Two excellent performances: Lee Marvin genuinely reminded me of someone I know, an example of the type of man whose violence and contempt are always worn in his face. If the election scene had been written with more intensity, I would rank his performance alongside Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. John Wayne combines his relaxed power with patient judgement, and yet it's ironic that the director taunted him on set for failing to make his character's sort of sacrifice in real life.Apart from that, it's regular western fare.

            "content": "Who shot Liberty Valance ? The one everyone saw was Ransom Stoddard but the bullet that killed him was actually discreetly shot by Tom Doniphon. Ransom was an East coast lawyer who \"couldn't shoot the hat off of his head\" while Doniphon was aptly self described as the toughest man south of the Picket Line. When Ransom walked out to face Valance he knew he didn't stand a chance in gunfight but still did it because nobody else would. Tom Doniphon on the other hand was every bit as good or an even better gunslinger than Valance and there was a strong possibility he could have killed the bushwacker. But he didn't. He only killed Liberty,unseen from the darkness,to save Ransom's life for Hallie's sake.However, Doniphon was the silent hero who was willing to sacrifice himself for the betterment of the west. He knew that Ransom Stoddard was the hero the west deserved but not the one they needed now. If it sounds familiar it's because it is;there's certainly a noticeable similarity between The Dark Knight and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.Both John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart at ages fifty three and fifty two were much older than the characters they were playing were supposed to be. With the help of the right lighting and makeup it's hardly noticeable. Especially with actors of their caliber. The personalities of the unassertive,cordial Stewart and gruff,flinty Wayne provide a stark contrast to one another yet they compliment each other perfectly as well. The characters feel as if they were written for and only for these two actors and could have been played by no other actor-certainly not as well. And then of course playing Liberty Valance there's Lee Marvin. Most actors especially those known for 'tough guy' roles are at there best playing villains and there's no better example than this one. Marvin is ruthless and menacing as Valance and without a formidable heavy, so much of the film's value would be lost. There are some quality performances from other members of the supporting cast as well such as: Vera Miles(the last surviving major cast member) in her rather contained role,Woody Strode who never got the oppurtunity of a leading part in a quality picture as well as Lee Van Cleef,Strother Martins and Andy Devine.\nOne performance that was utterly asinine,however,is the 'general' who's debating against sending Ransom as a delegate. Unfortunately, characters such as this one are far too common in John Ford pictures.Throughout his filmography small details usually a character or sometimes a scene appear that are absolutley terrible. Either hokey or melodramatic or downright childish these things,a sort of Ford touch,detract from the overall quality with their ineptitude. Now that's not to be taken as calling John Ford an inept director, there's so much he does right especially in this film. As in his use of shadows particularly during the final showdown or the quiet shots that speak volumes like the one of the rose cactus on Doniphon's coffin. Ford knows how to generate the perfect emotion for any scenario in the most nuanced,proffesional manner.\nOrson Welles once replied to a question about his favorite director with \"...the old masters,by which I mean: John Ford,John Ford and John Ford.\" Ford won the Best Director Oscar four times(including once beating out Welles for Citizen Kane) more than any other director. Although he was not even nominated for this film.The picture also has some clever and witty dialouge,a powerful score and an Academy Award nominated costume design from Edith Head. The picture is executed brilliantly and is filled with pathos,irony and one ever looming question.Who was the man that shot Liberty Valance ?",

            "content": "In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), Ford spun the archetypal western into an exploration of America's history by suggesting that the new frontier of an educated, politically active America could not have existed if not for the innate strength of the old west. Similarly, through the exploration of a feudal system fractured by the hope provoked by an eastern intellectual, Ford observed that the old west could not have existed without the possibility of eventual change. Thus, old and new are as symbiotic as the forces of human nature upon which the film's thematic corps lies. The twin poles (good old and reliable tactics) of the classical western are people and the land. Taken together, they represent the forces of civilization and of nature, each existing uneasily with the other. The structure of most westerns is a series of elaborations on this theme of opposition: sheriff versus outlaw, saloon girl versus schoolteacher, settlers versus wilderness, individual versus community. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was not only one of his last but also his farewell - to the western hero, to the myth of the West - which Ford more than any other filmmaker helped create. We observe from the opening frame that things are slightly off-kilter for the year in which the film was produced: the picture is shot in black and white (a novelty at a time when almost every filmmaker tried to shoot in color). The opening credits appear on a series of wooden signs, except they are not actual signs but obvious, almost crude, drawings. And while we see the landscape - consistent with Ford's aesthetic - in the opening shot, this time it is not Monument Valley but a much less heroic vista, and through it travels not a lone cowboy or a stagecoach, but a train. We soon observe by way of the film's use of flashback (eventually flashback within flashback) that The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is about the passage of time \u2013 history - and how we deal with it, factually and mythically. Hence, the film is about how new aspects come to replace old. The film is also about the death of the \"legend\" (the closing of a chapter), and as it is suggested not just in Tom's death but also in the artificiality of the sets and the references to stagecoaches (the \"old\" vanishing). However, the death of that legend is a grudging one. We know through the motif of the cactus rose that Hallie loved Tom (a symbol of burgeoning life and resilience; the cactus rose is a biological anomaly). And, more importantly, we know that the events of the film occur because of Tom: it is Tom who kills Valance, tells Ranse the truth about it, gives up Hallie, and thereby creates Ranse's career. It is Tom who refuses nomination and destroys his (and what was to be Hallie's) home. Thus, Tom anticipates his own obsolescence and gives up power, home, love, and finally his way of life so that Ranse may create community through words and law and politics; Tom's every act is one of denial, sacrifice, almost of suicide. As a matter of plot, the new is predicated upon the old.",

This is raw, well-presented entertainment and what many Westerns relied on to capture not only your interest but to tell the tale as well. Add some shoot em ups, a love interest, horses of course, and plenty drinking at the bar in the local saloon. One thing that always captures my interest in any movie is food scenes as I like to see what people eat, how they eat and what the food looks like. In this movie, I was thrilled. Why?

            "content": "Is there a more emblematic way of signalling the death of the old west than the death of John Wayne himself? Of course, we don't see his actual body, but we are made aware of what sort of person he was through the reminiscing and the dialogue - Jimmy Stewart's indignation that such a great man could ever be buried without his boots or his gun belt. There are no wide, sweeping shots of the town or of the iconic Monument Valley. Anyone who is at least a little familiar with the Western will recognise that it has become a relic here. Sometimes the steam engine brought the hero's last hurrah - here it brings not a gunslinger, but a politician and his wife. The sheriff is a plump, gone to seed kind of fellow...ah, but he was always like that. Sometimes the law must stand aside for a while for these conflicts to boil. So we have two opposing perspectives; Ranse, the young hotshot lawyer who has grand visions of his practice and schooling being able to restore this lowly frontier town, and the pragmatist, Tom, who prefers brute force and seems to be the only one who can stand up to Liberty Valance. And in between, as always, the woman. Westerns have always been imbued with a sense of their own logic, their own rules. There are clear power balances that are established; three guns, for examples, outnumbers two. We can almost certainly tell who has the upper hand just by looking the eyes. They tell us so much...and of course the fingers, inching towards the holster. Leone was very good at this, but of course he learned from the master. Ford subverts these structures in this film because it was the last of his westerns with Wayne and even he knew that the west was dying. Tom and Valance exchange death-stares in the restaurant, with Pompey ever present with his shotgun, and conventionally, we expect a slow, agonisingly tense retreat, but we would also be relishing the battle later on. Here, Ranse rudely interrupts them with some common sense. Who would die over a measly steak?, he exclaims incredulously. But as he goes into the kitchen the bravado cracks and we can see his is visibly shaken, and on the verge of tears. Stewart was not often asked to be one of the weaker of the cast, but here he does very well. Is it enough for Vera Miles' Hallie, who is the aforementioned woman the two leads are fighting over? She flirts harmlessly with Tom every time he comes around for his dinner, but the younger and newer lawyer seems to have caught her eye. Ranse offers something that no one else in this town can offer, not even the hardy Tom, and that is the hope that comes with his knowledge of the law and his passion to educate the townsfolk. She is clearly taken by this little glimmer of inspiration; how long has it been since someone didn't treat Liberty Valance's brutish invasions as normal affair? Notice that Ford doesn't ever lean on those sappy, inevitable moments to signify the romance. He suggests through their actions and reactions. The most telling scene of the film is when Hallie confronts Ranse after his 'showdown' with Vance. This is what she wanted for him, is it not? For him to stick close to his principles and to stand up for what he has been proclaiming to the townsfolk all this time. No more being bullied by the bigger men. And yet, one look at the 'hero' and Hallie immediately knows that she cannot admire what has clearly scarred him. Without a single word we know that her priorities have shifted - that she now values his wellbeing and safety more than any high-minded lawyer talk. But it is Tom that we are admiring at beginning at end. He is a character that has a distinct awareness of his own use-by date, but nevertheless chugs on, perhaps because without him Shinbone would be left free for Liberty Vance to terrorise as he pleased. We sense that he has been waiting for someone younger and more idealistic like Ranse to arrive and relieve him of his duty. John Wayne has been required in many of his roles to have that masculine aura of invincibility, the rugged wanderer, to always have the answers (often a physical one). It is why instead of weeping or talking he instead beats Vance's thugs, and then in an act of silent rage, destroys his house and possessions. But here in this film he is also required to know that this persona is not enough, and that his time has come. He realised this in The Searchers too, and gave us one of the great all time film endings. Much more admirable is the hero who knows when to back down and admit they are out of their element. He adds a parting gift - a coward shot, from the darkness, for a man who must be protected in order for Shinbone to flourish (Steward spends much of his time wearing an apron and in the kitchen - the symbolism is clear enough). With this, he has fired his last bullet, his own personal code of honour marred, but he has ensured the building blocks for the future. Tom Doniphon is the hero of this story. He was the man who shot Liberty Valance.",

It is overlooked on these pages that the Wayne character indulges in exactly what he uncompromisingly disdained in other movies: a 'bushwhacking'. Valance has little chance (although he doesn't know it). Stewart is mistakenly iconicized. Rightly, Wayne's character is implied to sink into oblivion.This central duplicity in the story, which plays inversely to the title, actually ruined the movie for me. I could accept the long-in-the-tooth characters, cheap jack sets, B & W photography. But the fact that there are no true heroes, only varying degrees of villains, precludes me from granting more than seven stars. It's a good but flawed movie. But, I do not understand it being designated a great movie.",

            "content": "This was a good year for this story to come out. You have two seasoned superstars (James Stewart and John Wayne), who are guys, who are in, some ways, on opposite sides of the culturally and political lines of the time. You have the college educated lawyer, from the big city, who fights with his law books, Ransom Stoddard (Stewart), and the life-long cowboy, with the horse ranch, who fights his battles with a fist and a gun, Tom Doniphon (Wayne). Stewart did a handful of films, around this time, when the film would open up in the present day (1910 in the case of this story) and have him tell a story about his past (in flashbacks). The F. B. I. Story (1959), is one that comes to mind. It was one of the things people remembered about him, later in his life, that he was so good at narration and telling a story. It was something that he would mention on Johnny Carson or something. Anyway, you are taken back to this story, that tells us about the lives of Ransom, Tom and Ransom's future wife, Hallie Stoddard (Vera Miles). It also features the other, major part of the plot, about who shot Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).Guess who is directing this John Wayne film? John Ford. Yep, these two guys get together again, for an engaging story, with plenty of action, with fantastic performances by the cast. It is a western, that is centered in a more centralized location, being a small town. It doesn't really feature the wide-open spaces, seen in the open range, which is a Ford staple in most of his films. However, that doesn't deter Ford from not giving us great composited, wide-screen shots, utilizing the straight lines of buildings, doorways or windows, with the characters centered in the right place, to show dominance, strength, weakness or the pain from them. The film has the strength required to make the film the piece of art that it is. It doesn't need to use the open range. The performances and the determination of the characters, makes you want to see what happens at the end of the film. It also was a time when the black and white film was beginning its twilight years. The use of black and white film in the 1960s was usually used for low budget films or films made by the masters, who had the experience to still get the magic to shine in black and white. This one is no exception.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "review_title": "Yet another Ford masterpiece.",
            "content": "Unfortunately most people have no idea who John Ford is in our modern day, as well as his impact on modern cinema. George Lucas cited The Searchers as a major influence on the making of the original Star Wars, and other modern Hollywood heavyweights like Spielberg and Scorsese have also cited Ford as an influence. He's fallen in with directors like Elia Kazan who are regarded as game changers and mavericks in the Hollywood system, yet are almost forgotten or unrecognized in everyday discussion on film.While I prefer his more cynical and nuanced The Searchers, I still find The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance to be another daring subversion of the western, in a time where the world wasn't exactly ready for the western of be subverted or commented on. As I mentioned in my Searchers review, the western was being deconstructed and commented upon even before Leone showed up on the scene. Unlike The Searchers, Valance's subversion and commentary in Valance is far lighter, with a hint of satire being put in for good measure. Valance's exploration of the myth vs the reality of the Wild West is also apparent in its influence on Unforgiven, which also explores similar topics. Though much like Leone's work, Unforgiven takes a rather obvious approach. Valance is much more subdued, much subtler in its commentary.While the filmmaking isn't as on a high scale as The Searchers, Ford makes his techniques more intimate for the themes of the film. It is really the performances of the film that steal the show, as it shows Ford's true subversion of the western, combining unpredictable casting choices (Jimmy Stewart) along with the predictable ones (John Wayne, Lee Marvin). Ransom is almost a cliche, a prissy city boy walking into a world that he barely understands and is determined to see law and order prevail over a land that hasn't a clue of the concept. Wayne and Marvin's characters are also cliche as well, old relics of a wild, unpredictable wasteland. It is through the performances where the satire and commentary of Valance truly shines, as it is through these almost cartoon characters we can see Ford's true message about the West, and quite simply how reality can become warped into mythology.No film is perfect, and I noticed a flaw in Ford's films in how he'll meander in spots without giving much clarification or adding anything substantial to the story, he also has a habit for putting in light spots of humor in misplaced parts, it is one of the few bits where Leone had him beat, in that he could carry his films to the end without getting lost in translation in terms of tone. Luckily, like with The Searchers, Ford never gets too lost in those moments and gets the story back. I was also disappointed to find that Wayne was giving yet another John Wayne performance, and lacking the nuance and depth of Ethan Edwards. Not to say that it's bad, but that I was disappointed to see Wayne once again embracing the western hero image he cultivated, rather than subverting it as he had done in The Searchers.Indeed, I am quite disappointed to see that most people have forgotten Ford, as the genius of Scorsese, Lucas, and Spielberg probably would never have existed if Ford hadn't done it first.",

The writing of these studio-westerns had to be difficult---there was no real reliance on the natural beauty and space that filled \"The Searchers\" and \"How The West Was Won\". A studio western was a stage play in spurs and gun belts. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" was one of the very best of this genre.And why not?---director John Ford was the Spielberg-Cameron-Scott of his day, and knew a thing or 2 about directing actors. And WHAT actors...Duke, Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles and Lee Marvin.....that is still a working A-Team, tho they have passed into history. Woody Strode and Thomas Mitchell were the icing on the cake for me--Woody being one of the finest and most spectacular character actors in film history.This studio western had the unique and undeniable effect of an epic---the passage of time and tide so well written and played. John Wayne looked like a man destroyed by love at the end of that movie, and he will, like other great male actors such as Brad Pitt, Kevin Kostner and Kurt Ressell, always be under-appreciated and underrecognized mainly because acting is so seemingly effortless to them, and the mostly gay entertainment press ignore them because they ignore the mostly gay entertainment press.Vera Miles was perfect as a beauty who could make one man's life, and with complete innocence, ruin another's. John Ford had a great eye for the truly beautiful women in Hollywood, Miles and Maureen O'Hara setting the bar very high for that all-important camera-eats-them-up factor.I'm still kind of struck by the casting of decorated WWII B-24 bomber pilot Jimmy Stewart being cast as the egghead who didn't know which end of a gun to hold, and the Duke, who was never in the military, as the crusty old gun-fighter...the only man capable of terminating Libery Valence--the only man Liberty was afraid of.....but...that's the movies.

In actuality, this is the story of two men, told from the perspective of one, Ransom Stoddard. Stoddard is a \"right\" filled lawyer fresh from the east.  Tom Doniphon, played by John Wayne also believes in \"right.\"  However, Doniphon is unsophisticated in \"book learning\" and operates on a rougher moral code.The location dictates that Doniphon's justice is more apropos.  Likewise, Stoddard is seen as a weak man on the trail of righteousness.The catalyst for action is bad man Liberty Valance's character.  Generally, he is a bully, not shy about using terror as a tool of his trade.  Valance has a peculiar fear and respect for Doniphon.  Stoddard, astutely reasons that both Valance and Doniphon operate on the same moral code, albeit on opposite spectrums.The result is a \"thinking man's\" western.  The general gist of the film is riveting.  However, many sequences which pervade the film are slow and rife with humorless banter.Upon Valance's exit, Doniphon's character turns inward and dark.  He immediately realizes he is no good for his sweetheart and engages in a downward spiral.  Succinctly, he abandons his code of honor for the sake of progress.On whole, this picture acts as commentary on modern social issues.

Both men share a common interest in the same woman, but also share a common dislike to the town's local thug, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Lee Marvin plays Liberty Valance, a local thug who bullies the town with violence and intimidation, which is more than enough for Ransom to pair.But what was thought to be a miraculous moment for Ransom was actually a surprising twist near the end. Tom let Ransom take credit for killing Valance because he was a good man, and people had looked up to him for standing up to a bully, whereas Tom himself would've just be remembered as a gun-slinger who was always at odds with Valance, and it would've been a matter of time if one of them killed the other. Tom also knew that the same woman the two men vied for loves Ransom, so he accepted that the best man won her heart (and that's why he wanted Ransom to live, for her).Stewart and Wayne were both brilliant in the film. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was one of the greatest western films of all.

Neither changed my mind in what I think is, also, a highly overrated film - even for the Western genre which, admittedly, storytelling often takes a pedestrian turn to make way for landscape and action.There is little of the transfixing panoramic shots that made John Ford famous, which is just as well because the bellicose yammering of the film's two stars would have chewed up the scenery. Stewart represents the ideal utopia that democracy is suppose to bring, while Wayne represents the primal instincts of living on an untamed land. The two are at odds, as the cattle ranchers and the settlers are in the back story. Their mutual love interest, Hallie (America manifested, duh) is yanked between the two of them, eventually settling on the man on the side of the law.The film is so caught up in metaphor and idealism, it forgets its characters. There is no back story on anybody to illustrate a reason for their behavior, or why any of them stay in that godforsaken desert town. The settlers are suppose to love their land so much they risk their lives at the hands of a violent henchmen, Liberty Valence (Lee Marvin looking and acting remarkably like Tom Waits)but why? Too much is expected to be taken for granted.All that said, the camera work - typically Ford - is beautiful. The high contrast sculpts shadow and danger into the actors' faces, and the restored sheen is almost chrome-like.

My Late Father-In- Law who was born in Europe had a fascination for the old west. Whenever I came over to visit him he had a western on the television. Western giants the likes of Cooper, Eastwood and Scott filled his last years of life as the Western Channel had an endless supply of movies for him to enjoy. One afternoon My Father-In-Law sitting in his regular perch overlooking 47th street in Queens,New York, in his familiar raspy voice said, \"Hey Rob their a John Wayne movie and it's a classic lets go watch it. I\"ll even order the Chinese food.\" That sold me. Not the film . The Chinese food. Paramount Pictures proudly presents The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The movie starts out with an elderly well dressed Senator, Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles)as they arrive via the locomotive to the town of Shinbone? Somewhere in the American Southwest. The Stoddards came all the Way from Washington D.C. to pay their last respects to an old friend and rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne).The well dressed couple is recognized the moment they stepped off the train by a young reporter. The young journalist wants to know why the Senator returned to Shinbone? Then the Reporters's boss and the Mayor show up and take over the interview but the Senator says, \"A man is more willing to give an interview in the comfort of the Shinbone Star office.\", as he tells the others that he once worked there. The five convene at the Newspaper office as the Senator goes on about things in Washington (Not Shown). A familiar face of a generation before shows up. The paunchy cowardly Marshall Appleyard played by the colorful Andy Devine takes Mrs. Stoddard over to Tom Donophin's ranch via horse and buggy or what's left of the place out in the desert. Meanwhile the Editor wants to know why the special trip out west? Stoddard breaks down and confesses it's for a dear friend Tom Doniphin. The reporters asked why the long trip for a dead rancher? Stoddard gives in and tells the story and recounts the events that happened twenty five years earlier on that faithful night traveling westward involved in a stagecoach robbery and his first encounter with the beady eyed, mean and dastardly Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Valance and his henchmen rob everyone of their belongings which is too much for the young idealistic Attorney Ransom Stoddard to bear. With his life savings and huge supply of law books heads out west to serve justice in a gun crazy west? Valance holds up the stage and takes everything from our defenseless passengers. Stoddard tries to fight back but Valance whips the poor Lawyer to no end and leaves him for dead. Found and carried to the nearby Shinbone restaurant where he is tended to by Hallie (Vera Miles) and two Swedish immigrants the Ericson's Nora (Jeanette Nolan) and Peter (John Qualon). The Town seems in disarray with a Doc Willoughby (Ken Murray) who is a lush, The Newspaper editor Mr. Peabody (Edmund O'Brien)who quotes everything from Shakespeare to Greely for a nip at the bar.The chickenhearted Marshall Appleyard who I mentioned earlier has every excuse not to deal with the evil Valance. The only men with spines in that helpless hamlet are Tom Doniphin and his muscular sidekick Pompey (Willie Strode). Just love the \"Pilgrum\" characterization of the typical western tough guy as Wayne is a natural and handles the dialogue methodically. It appears that Wayne didn't sleep much during production as you see noticeable bags under his eyes. Probably spending the late hours after filming with Director John Ford doing excessive drinking and playing poker as fellow actors say,\"What did you expect.Your in John Wayne's world.\" Stoddard is grateful to the Ericson's and Hallie for getting him back on his feet.. Stoddard wants to pay the town back by setting up a law practice and school as Stoddard is stunned to learn the most of the townspeople are illiterate. Doniphin has plans to marry Hallie as he and Pompey are fixing an extension on his Ranch a few miles out of Shinbone. Stoddard tells the stoic Doniphin that the law books will put Valance behind bars but Doniphin chuckles and says that guns put the man in check out here. Doniphin also notices that Hallie has her attentions to Stoddard teaching her how to read. In all truthfulness Doniphin could have blown away Valance from the start and there would be no story. This movie shot in black and white had such colorful characters that you didn't even notice the distinction. This makes for a great showdown as Marvin, Stewart and Wayne meet up for the showdown at sundown as the result of a dropped steak. Jimmy Stewart performance reminds me of the self righteous man he played earlier in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington film. Vera miles fresh off her role in Psycho gives a softer side yet she a sturdy woman who stands up well against the confident Wayne. Andy Devine's comedic timing adds for some reassurance during some rough scenes. Lee Marvin sustains his range of cold blooded hostility. Lastly our stand out performance goes to our alcoholic baritone Edmund O'Brien. As for the Duke is there anyone who could out take him? Maybe a lucky sock to the jaw by James Stewart.

            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance If you think you are getting a thoughtless western when you turn on The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, then you are dead wrong, pilgrim. This John Ford classic starring James Stewart and John Wayne brings about a very thought provoking piece to the western genre. The audience will really be challenged to evaluate what they think of right and wrong, and just how absolute the two should be. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance begs the question, will justice always prevail? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance opens by introducing us to an aged United States Senator as he visits his hometown to attend the funeral of a dear friend. Accompanied by his wife, the audience soon learns that there is quite a history between the deceased person and the Senator. Upon the newspaper reporters' ceaseless questioning of his arrival, the senator goes on to fill them, and the audience, in on the story involving him and the deceased man. Early on in the film a powerful scene takes place in which we meet the main character, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) as he is riding in a carriage. Unfortunately for Ransom, he is ambushed by a vicious gang lead by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). After protecting the woman accompanying him, the gang turns their violent focus on Ransom savagely beating him and leaving him for dead. Fortunately for Ransom, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) peels him up from the path and takes him into town to have a local family tend to his wounds. When he finally comes to, Ransom is stunned, both to see the family tending to him so attentively, and to the realization that there is no accepted idea of justice in this Wild West. Ransom is committed to his belief that justice exists everywhere and as a lawyer, refuses to take arms to protect himself against Liberty Valance and his gang of outlaws. As our story progresses, Ransom stays firm in his notion of justice ruling the land. Ransom remains with the family that took him in, he even teaches the adult daughter of the family how to read and write, eventually marrying Hallie (Vera Miles) Ransom takes his teachings a step further and seeks to educate the entire town on basic principles of law and citizenship. Liberty Valance, however, remains just as committed to keeping the law out of his land and cuts Ransom off at every pass of collective improvement. Tensions rise as the boiling point is finally reached between these two culminating in a surprising shoot-out that has the audience on the edge of their seats. First of all, it needs noted that I am a sucker for a good movie told backwards. No flashbacks took place throughout the film, we are just made aware of the ending, after which the film is told in proper succession. To me, this takes a great deal of precision by a filmmaker, which John Ford is more than capable of. When this type of storytelling is properly achieved, even though the audience knows a great deal of how the story turns out, they are no less interested in how it turns. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a wonderful display of backwards story telling. Another aspect that adds to the story telling of this film is the score. Each change in pitch is punctuated perfectly against the action being told on screen, bringing about a masterpiece of sensory symmetry. The sound effects were also a standout part of this film's experience. For instance, each time Liberty Valance used his weapon of choice, a whip, against his adversary, the sound was realistic enough to give the viewer a sharp sting on their back. Another mark of a great film, for me, is when action is fragmented well between what is seen and unseen. Much of this film reminded me of Burt Lancaster's first film The Killers (1946) in which the most pivotal scene climaxed out of frame proving that when a director can acknowledge the intelligence of the audience, they don't need to put every detail in front of their eyes. This scene, and many others like it, notably from Alfred Hitchcock, has stuck with me years after their initial viewing because there is great power in performing a scene off-camera. This story-telling device requires immense detail and thorough framing; once both of those criterion are met, the audience's mind is free to wonder imaging exactly what the action that took place on screen looked like. This imagination may provide even more depth to a scene than the director would have been able to film. To depict a scene this way also requires a great deal of trust in the actor. In this set-up, a director must be confident that the actor will display enough nonverbal emotion to cue the audience into what is taking place. One illustration of this device occurs when Ransom looks into the casket of his deceased friend and becomes angered that his boots have been removed. If Jimmy Stewart was less of an actor, or if John Ford was less a director, the audience would not have enjoyed such a scene, made all the more powerful by the pinnacle occurring off-camera. Another excellent device used by John Ford was the way he introduced us to John Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon. Tom acted as a savior to Ransom, and a savior is exactly how he was depicted the first time we see him, high upon his horse. One could also notice that Wayne's character first appearing on a horse correlates him to that of a knight, riding up to save the day, which he ultimately did for Ransom. Such direction by John Ford illustrates his legacy and allows the viewer to recognize, first-hand, why he remains a legend more than 40 years after his death.",

            "content": "Part of my western movie journey. This was all in all simply a really enjoyable movie from Ford. Wayne, Stewart and Miles give such great performances. The story is solid and well though out. There's some open ends here and there but overall it's just great.Directing is strong, love going back to black and white and having it in widescreen. It does give it that different vibe versus color and definitely makes it feel older. As I read the trivia it was due to keeping the costs down, in this case I think it only helped, especially with the apparent age of the actors. Editing could have used a better indicator or two when we skip some time abruptly, it was missing a simple shot of a landscape or town that would give you some breathing room between time jumps. But it was minor.The story presents some great conflicts both morally and ethically. The times are changing and Wayne's character is the direct opposite of Stewart. But the story shows that not everything can be so black and white in the end. Regarding the open end towards Doniphon I'm not sure how to feel about it, my guess is that it was heartbreak. Closure wasn't essential on it because ultimately it wasn't about him, but still. The time jump and age difference was just okay, they tried what they could, but it wasn't very convincing. I got used to it though very quickly.Compared to The Searchers, this movie plays it a bit more serious. There's less explosive behavior aside from a few small moments and the music is toned down immensely. Characters also feel a lot more real. The Marshal might be the of the bunch but that's all really. There's still your memorable and identifiable Ford characters here. And again the diversity and life they give to the movie is characteristic to Ford from what I've seen so far.Wayne and Stewart are the most standout actors here. Whilst Stewart gives a more muted and contemplative performance correct to his character, Wayne gives a great one and really goes beyond towards the end.The main villain was played really well by Marvin but as a character I found him to be one of the weaker bad guys with a lack of dimensionality. Also his outfit wasn't very intimidating or anything and his pals neither. It felt a bit like a oddball posse.Once again at 2 hours it does at one point start feeling like 2 hours and especially the political scene takes it's time.

Even the last shot of the movie, a long shot of the running train, is filmed with a hand-held camera. What a pity!As for the story, there's also a big, big problem: A famous senator and his wife come to a small town to attend a funeral of an unknown person. This causes the curiosity of the newspaper reporter and give the senator an interview, thus starts the flashback of the movie. After he finishes the story, his wife put a cactus flower on the coffin, then they leave the town. Now, what about the purpose of their trip? Aren't they forgetting John Wayne's funeral?",

            "content": "One of the things I love about the Western genre is that it is the only genre to which America can really hold claim. There were of course, non-American efforts in this genre; I myself after all have long championed the films of Sergio Leone and several other Spaghetti Western filmmakers. But at its very core, the genre is American and therefore speaks to America and the American experience in a way no other genre really can. Such is the case with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, a film that may rank in my estimation to be the very best American Western ever made and a film that speaks profoundly on many subjects, most notably the tendency to mythicize the American Old West, both in history, but particularly on film and also on the very nature on the rise of the liberal American order. The film is also astonishingly well-made and stands as a monument to John Ford and the Western genre he helped create, but at the same time is able to look back honestly at both and see a good deal of mythmaking. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance tells the story of Ranson Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart), a United States Senator who returns to the town of Shinbone in a unnamed Western state to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), a local rancher.The local media is intrigued as to why such a prominent man is traveling so far to attend the funeral of what they see as an unimportant rancher. In flashback however, Ranson tells the story of back when he was a young lawyer from back east and Shinbone was a small dot of a town in a United States territory, rather than in a state. He comes to the town to discover that it is under the grip of a ruthless outlaw named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Ranson wants Liberty Valance to be arrested, but Tom reminds him that unlike in the East, in small towns in the territories, the law is useless and thus a man must learn to defend himself, and advises Ranson to bring a gun. It is an idea that Ranson balks at, seeing that law, order, and education must prevail against frontier violence, though he does eventually comply. And living up to these values, Ranson opens up a school to increase the education standards of the town and even begins to work to get statehood for the territory. While working to gain statehood, Liberty Valance and his gang begin to become even more ruthless, an event that cumulates in one night when Liberty Valance begins to threaten Ranson and Ranson shoots him in self-defense. But as it turns out, it was not Ranson, but Tom to shot Liberty. Tom though opts to tell no one, save for Ranson himself, and advises him to do the same. Ranson thus can be known as \"The man who shot Liberty Valance\" and using his newfound fame, is the overwhelming favorite to be shoes for the delegation for statehood, which he is eventually able to use as a jumping off point for a long career in the United States Senate. The movie then flashes forward in time, where, upon learning the truth, the local media rips up the story and refuses to publish it, because, as the newspaper man says, \"This is the West sir, when legend become fact, print the legend.\"As just purely an exercise in filmmaking, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is remarkable. The acting is great, from both the leads and the supporting cast. John Ford's signature directorial style is very pronounced in this, and the film just simply looks great. The film also boasts a highly intelligent script from James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck. It has all the elements therefore, of a film that is at least good on a technical level. But there is more going on here than this, and because if this, the film is able to become something more, transcending into the best Western ever made by an American and what might be not only the best statement on the nature of the Western both as a genre and the place of the Old West in American history, but it also serves as a critique of liberal naivety and of Great Man Theory.What stands out immediately about The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is how it is shot. You see, the film is shot in black and white, something that was very rare for a major director such as Ford working with major actors to do in 1962. By shooting the film in black and white, Ford harkens back to an earlier film he made with Wayne, Stagecoach from 1939. Now in addition to being one of the great Westerns, Stagecoach is historically important as it was not only the film to put Wayne on the map as a major star, it was also the film that transformed the Western into an art, as before the genre was considered a cheap and disreputable genre made for the entertainment of the masses. With Stagecoach and his other films, Ford was able to more than any other single man, even the great Howard Hawks, to codify how Americans viewed the Old West. With The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance however, Ford takes a look at the myth he helped create and conclude that yes, it is a myth as the actual history of the Old West is far more complicated. It is also interesting to note that this film was made in 1962, just as the Western genre was going through some significant changes. After being an easy way to print money for years, the genre was beginning to decline in popularity, at least in the Unites States. And while the genre would enjoy a resurgence in popularity in the coming years, the genre would look far different. Two years later, a young Italian director named Sergio Leone would make A Fistful of Dollars, a film that would reimagine the Western hero in far more cynical amoral terms. The other Spaghetti Westerns would largely follow suit, and these films along with the homegrown Revisionist Westerns of the same period would completely uproot the genre from its John Ford/ John Wayne foundation and establish a far bleaker view of the American West. The film also, though perhaps unintentionally represents the end of the old era and beginning of the new era through its casting. On one side, the film stars Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne, two of the biggest stars of the old Hollywood, and on the other side is Lee Marvin, a major star to be in the 1960's and 1970's and would represent a new kind of Action star by eschewing the more traditional morality of Stewart and Wayne. Much like a lot of other aspects of the culture, the American film industry was at a crossroads in 1962 and this film perfectly captures that moment.Connecting to this, the film also examines how the Old West works in the context of American culture and American history. As mentioned before, the Western is the only genre Americans can really claim as their own and as such the Old West as well plays an important role in American identity. But that version of the Old West that Americans have latched onto, a view that was even more pronounced in 1962 than in 2016 where the atrocities that were committed in the Old West are now more widely known. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance though understands this to be a myth, but it does not stop here. For many movies, the idea of the American Old West as seen in films such as Stagecoach would be conflated with the idea that the myth is false and has no value. But perhaps because it was directed by a man who helped to establish that myth, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance does not do this, instead it understands that while the myth of the American Old West is not literally true, it is profoundly true in that it gave the young American nation an identity and gave generations of people morals to which they could inspire. Just as Ranson Stoddard did not really kill Liberty Valance, so to was most of what made up the myth of the American West did not really happen, but Stoddard's supposed act inspired his neighbors to move forward towards statehood and the myth of the American Old West served to give America a firm foundation in the world. This is not to say that the atrocities against the native, American Indian population among other things should be whitewashed, far from it and recognizing this is also an important part of maturity, but it does mean that this myth, like all great myths has a value that cannot be tossed out just because it is not literally true of the heroes of this myth did not live up to the morals we would have liked them too, the myth is far too important to do that.And connecting to this, the film also serves as a critique of liberal nativity and recognizes that as much as it does not want to admit it, the liberal order has been made by illiberal events. For Ranson Stoddard, men like Liberty Valance can be beat by law and order and education is an important tool that by itself can enact positive social change. For Tom however, the reality of life in a town such as Shinbone men like Liberty Valance must be challenged with frontier violence and education is limited in its ability to enact positive social change. In a very real way then, Ranson represents the emerging liberal order in the West with its focus on progress, law, and education while Tom represents the older value system of Spartan living and a resistance, or at very least apprehension to change. And indeed at the end of the film, Ranson's view wins out as the town becomes better educated, becomes part of a state, and also enjoys all the material and social progress associated with the emerging Western United States. But while all of these things are good, this is ultimately based on an illiberal event, the extrajudicial killing of Liberty Valance. Thus as much as liberals may not want to admit it, the world view that they have championed, has been made possible by a series of illiberal events and thus the pure focus on education will not do. But here is the rub, in many respects, it is good for people to believe in these things, it is good for the vast majority of the population to see education as a positive good and to put the punishment of criminals in the hands of the legal system rather than dish out punishment on their own.",

            "review_title": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence",
            "content": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence (1962)During the 1960's, the Western genre proved to be more than just another subtext for violence and rugged masculinity. Thematically speaking, the genre gave a new edge to the film industry as it adopted contextual issues into the \"bigger, moral picture.\" A few of the main premises in Liberty Valence were \"civilization versus the wilderness, violence versus idealism, and the male bond (which idolizes and fraternity) versus the male ideal of isolation\" (Bordwell, 247). While some instances of isolationism surface throughout the film, we as an audience ultimately sympathize for Wayne's character as he protects Senator Ransom Stoddard (the isolationist lead) from the feared gun-slinging outlaw Liberty Valence. Director John Ford was much of an auteur, whom casted John Wayne into several of his Western outlaw roles. In his film Liberty Valence, Wayne's character Tom Doniphon, is portrayed from the moment we meet him as someone who understands the relationship between the \"individual and society.\" When we first meet him in the Ericson's Restaurant, Stoddard tells Doniphon about his confrontation with Liberty Valence bruised and beaten. Doniphon tells Stoddard that out on the Western Frontier, there is no order or law, and that things are settled and handled in a quick-draw duel. Contextually, while the film's genre turns to antimodern situations, \"the iconoclastic hero struggles and fails to conform to modern society\" (Bordwell, 248), at least initially. In the case of Liberty Valence, Senator Stoddard tries to press his political ideologies in the community of Shinbone, which at first raises a few eyebrows. Stoddard uses his legal knowledge and culture to fight for Statehood in the community. While it takes all the townsfolk awhile to adjust to this lifestyle, eventually they adapt to Stoddard's \"idealistic perspective\" by taking his legal advice. However, this articulates his failure to conform to what is shown as a \"modern civilization.\" Since Stoddard attempts to establish conformity in the community throughout most of the film, his character in due course, betrays his primary ideals by choosing \"violence\" over education and order. This character contradiction is also illustrated in another example where Doniphon admits that he was the one that actually killed Liberty Valence, not Stoddard. While Stoddard is grateful for Doniphon's actions, Doniphon is disgruntled and envious that Stoddard has something that he doesn't. Stoddard teaches Hallie (a girl that admires the both of them) how to read and write, giving Stoddard an upper hand in the love triangle. Doniphon tells him to \"accept his nomination as the state's first governor so that it would give Hallie something to read and write about.\" It's after we're given this piece of information though where we realize that Doniphon's intervention in the duel resides in personal issues. Doniphon realizes that his feelings for Hallie are outmatched by the idealistic attraction of education and democracy. The underlying concept in this instance depicts \"civilization versus the wilderness,\" where a civilized and educated man is showcased over the opinion of an illiterate individual living on the western frontier. A final contradictory example that conveys \"civilization versus the wilderness\" is in the final scene where Stoddard asks Hallie if she would like to go back and live with him in her hometown of Shinbone. Excitedly, she simply tells him, \"My roots are here\u0085 Look at it \u2013 it was once a wilderness, now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?\" It's in this contextual facet, where we see Stoddard give up his \"civilized roots\" to live a life in the wilderness, which leaves another contradictory mark on his character. While contextually, we take note that \"many of the men returning home from the war at the time found that their country was profoundly changed\" (Bordwell, 248), we notice the contrast between these two realities where Stoddard unexpectedly invites this cultural change even though he fights against the ideals of the wilderness setting throughout the entire film.",

However, I much prefer Fort Apache, as it focused on a sustained dialectic between a man obsessed by his own self-immortalizing and a majority of self-actualized, honorable men: Ford's ultimate conclusion, that the majority of great men are forgotten to make room for flatulent fools, is greatly aided in the former by Wayne, who tempers the polemic in a chilling soliloquy delivered to a reflection of cavalrymen superimposed over his weathered mien.In \"Liberty,\" Ford delivers a balanced critique of westward expansion and the ubiquitous railroad, and skillfully evokes the rapidly shrinking open range in cramped settings. The action takes place almost entirely within the town of Shinbone, the camera rarely roving to romanticize the natural land. But the narrative, aside from some spirited interrogations of legislation, how it complicates and corrupts the existing order of self-governance, is positively jejune.The usual troop of slapstick side-characters march out (Edmond O'Brien, good; Andy Devine, not so much) and do their thing, as we wait for the inevitable showdown between Stewart's idealistic lawyer and Lee Marvin's eponymous villain. The problem is Stewart's character isn't very compelling. He's diffident, naive, pedantic, and brazen to an irritating degree. Wayne steals the movie quite easily from him; his and Marvin's terse standoffs have an electricity the rest of the movie lacks. I think part of this is by strategy: Wayne represents the world Ford himself immortalized in movies, so it's fitting that we sympathize with him. Kudos to Ford for staying the philosophical course in what could have been some very mucky footing\u2014the uncharacteristically sober and clear-headed tone is the film's most resolute virtue and, unfortunately, that which restrains it from taking flight.",

Now, 48 years later, 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is both critically-acclaimed and loved by viewers. This is a compelling Western, one with a depth of character and story that is often missing from the genre. This film is well written, beautifully filmed and powerfully acted. It deserves its place in the pantheon of Westerns.Jimmy Stewart portrays Ransom Stoddard. Stoddard has just graduated from law school and moved to the American West. He hopes to make a name for himself among the outlaws, ranchers, settlers and dreamers that populate the West. Upon arriving he takes a job as kitchen help in the town's busiest restaurant. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon. Doniphon is the \"baddest\" dude in town. He is liked by many and respected/feared by all. Both Doniphon and Stoddard have their eye on the lovely woman who also works in the restaurant. She is played by the terrific Vera Miles.The antagonist to our two heroes is the title character Liberty Valance. He is perfectly portrayed by Lee Marvin. Valance is obnoxious, foul-mouthed and very tough. Everyone, with the exception of Doniphon (Wayne), fears Liberty Valance. Valance singles out Stoddard (Stewart) for his abuse. Stoddard, being from the East, has no skill for dealing with such a person. He can neither fight nor shoot. He believes that laws and sheriffs will protect him from the wilder elements of the frontier. But the Wild, Wild West is not fully tamed. How can a city-slicker like Ransom Stoddard stand up to an outlaw like Liberty Valance? One story about this movie that I love. Both Stewart and Wayne were huge stars before this film was released. Who would get top-billing? Having your name appear first in the credits (top-billing) was a sign of status in Hollywood. Both actors agreed that Stewart would get top-billing in all the advertising. Things like the posters, lobby cards, etc. would all feature Jimmy Stewart above John Wayne. Wayne would get top-billing in the opening credits. This would create some balance between the two stars. At the time, most people thought that Stewart got the better of John Wayne. Many more people see the advertising for a film than see the actual film. But John Wayne got the last laugh. His name still appears above Stewart's in the opening credits on each and every DVD, video and TV screening of the film. We still see Wayne getting top-billing long after the advertising materials have all but disappeared. Never try to best John Wayne! 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is the last big western from director John Ford. His films featuring Monument Valley in Arizona had amazed viewers who had never seen such magnificent scenery before. But 'Liberty Valance' is different from most Ford Westerns. Instead of amazing scenery and epic vistas, this film was shot primarily on sound stages. It is a personal story that focuses upon the characters. The traditional Ford cinematography is nowhere to be found. This movie tells the story of the changing West and Director John Ford changed his style to help tell that story. He returned to using black and white film. This too helps force our attention to the detail of the characters. These subtle changes in film making for Ford help to put 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' on the list of wonderful films.",

Instead, the movie depicts the civilization of the West, as the spirit of James Stewart's character, Ransom Stoddard (Stewart's a little old for the flashback scenes, but what the heck), and his law books eventually win out over the spirit of John Wayne and his guns. Wayne's character knows in some inarticulate way that he's being marginalized and there's little he can do it about it -- except perhaps hasten the process, both of statehood and of the love story. Some viewers also say Stoddard doesn't deserve the success that comes his way (this is no give-away, as he starts the film as a senator); but Stoddard deserves credit for showing the bravery (however naive) that Wayne's character is too savvy to display. Stewart is very good; Wayne is excellent, portraying his swaggering cowboy with an atypical sadness to him; Vera Miles is good as the center of the love triangle. The rest of the supporting cast is also good, including Lee Marvin as Valance. I rate it a 10.",

            "content": "\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" is my favorite John Wayne movie. I have watched it over and over and as I watch the movie, it occurs to me that it is really a \"murder mystery\".Someone shot Liberty Valance, and if you follow the script, you would assume that Tom Doniphon did it. It would make sense since John Wayne's character rescues Ransom Stoddard. Then, after he sees that Hallie loves Ransom, he tries to show Ransom he isn't cut out for the rough & tumble west and as a final gesture, Tom sends Pompey with the wagon to help Ransom get out of town.Later, when Ransom is having second thoughts about accepting the nomination for political office, Tom explains what happened that night\u0085or does he? After watching the movie over and over again, I believe that Tom Doniphon LIES to Ransom Stoddard. In reality, it WAS Ransom Stoddard who shot Liberty Valance.First, we know that throughout the movie, Tom Doniphon is there to rescue Ransom Stoddard. Second, Tom is in love with Hallie, so if Valance kills Ransom, Tom gets Hallie back. It would be in Tom's best interest to let Ransom and Liberty shoot it out. Third, bullets don't scare Ransom (as evidenced by the fact that he is willing to face Liberty on the street in a gun fight). Ransom is a man of principle. What DOES scare him is violating his principles and capitalizing on the killing of a man to gain political office.I believe this is where Tom Doniphon steps in once more to rescue Ransom Stoddard\u2014this time, not from bullets, but from his own conscience. Tom realizes that Ransom is the right, true and just man for the political office he seeks. Tom realizes that Ransom's conscience is keeping him from it, so he makes up a story about what happened that night.I believe it is a lie because Tom never actually says, \"I shot Liberty Valance.\" In that scene, what Tom actually says is, \"Beside, YOU didn't kill Liberty Valance.\" He stops short of saying it was he who shot him as a clue for the viewer. He is making up the flashback scene to relieve Ransom of something scarier than bullets. He is relieving Ransom of a guilty conscience.This is affirmed in the last scene when the conductor says to Ransom, \"Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.\" It is like the movie is now solving the mystery and proclaiming that Ransom was in fact the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.This is just my take on the movie. Does anyone else think this could be true?",

You can't stop the images, nor set up a distance between yourself and the events; an image comes out straight at you, at the speed of light, effecting you emotionally, intellectually and viscerally on the spot. To decently analyze what's going on the screen, you may only watch the film over and over, and even then, you are immersed again back into it. John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a stunning tragic feature. It's visuals and graphics stimulated and influenced me throughout my childhood. \u2013 Who's dead Sir? The locals (the newspaper editors) don't even know! Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) says to them he's in town for \u2013 a funeral... a man by the name of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Here's - right at the beginning - all the magic of a good film! Watching it once again it reveals new experiences, you'll have new thoughts and feelings on the same visual content: when senator Ransom gets in town you'll find him almost arrogant and haughty; only because he's asked to speak, he'll tell about his friend Tom. Then we take a ride out to the desert with Hallie and Link (Vera Miles and Andy Devine) to rediscover Tom's burned house \u2013 he never did finish that room he started to build on, did he? says Hallie. How is that that these same words and images make you now feel so uncomfortable, so hurt and sad? At the second view the wooden coffin inside the room is not empty anymore... the sight of it makes you almost see the body lying inside... and so with the missing boots; how dare they have taken them from such a man! and the dedicated friend Pompey, the cactus roses, and so on... Then the final shot, the train pulling away from Shinbone, taking Stoddard and his wife (and the audience) back to Washington, and the question of whether Stoddard and his wife were happy with their lives stays with us... John Ford knows of what images are made of! I can watch The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance over and over.",

            "content": "Who killed Liberty Valance?  Why, Keyser Soze killed Liberty Valance!But seriously, the film is worth seeing. Yes, it's black-and-white, claustrophobic and old-fashioned, the production values are low,  and the sets are cheesy.   Everyone here is a stereotype, or an archetype. The Good Guys wear white hats and the Bad Guys wear black hats. Mexicans in sombreros twitter in the corner and dance in the streets when Valance is shot, but never say a single line.   Swedes speak like muppets. But that's  probably not because of the age of the film - it came out in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia! - but more likely to be deliberate - this is a homage to, a farewell to, almost an affectionate parody of, of an obsolete kind of film.  The political scenes are certainly parody. This is *not* a realistic film. Three side-bar points:The good: the supporting cast, as others have said, are excellent. Everybody overacts shamelessly except for the supposed leads.  Stewart and Wayne play default Stewart and Wayne characters. Miles sinks blandly into the background.  This allows the others to stand out against their neutrality and  ham it up to their hearts content. The best are Carradine and O'Brien who don't so much steal their scenes as pick them up, elbow the opposition aside, and run over the line with them. Marvin & Strode are wonderful as well as being total stereotypes. The Bad: Maybe Wayne can act, but he isn't doing it here. Perhaps he wasn't asked to. In only one scene does the seem to come alive emotionally,  and that's when he sits on the stairs at the back of the convention hall hand watches what's going on while saying nothing. For the rest he's more a cipher than a character. Maybe there is an alternate universe in which Clint Eastwood played Tom. That would have been a different film, and probably a better one.The Ugly: one of many American movies in which someone is placed in an absurd, unlikely, or extreme situation in which it becomes morally correct to use a gun to shoot someone. This is propaganda, Pilgrim.But who was the Man who Killed Liberty Valance?  The \"Keyser Soze\" crack is not entirely off the point.  All we know is that Rance said that Tom said that he killed him. It is all a double-flashback. Either man could have reasons to be economical with the truth.Rance might have made a lucky shot - we do see him firing first, before either Liberty or Tom.    If Rance had killed Valance Tom might have lied about it to persuade him to stand for Congress. Rance might even have wanted to believe that Tom had done it to ease his own conscience. Or smooth his career. It might suit him to be known in the Territory as \"The Man Who\" - but to have a defence against any accusations made in Washington.\nOr Pompey may have killed him. At the first account of the fight we don't know that Tom is even present. We do know that Pompey was in town and knew about the fight, and Pompey had a rifle and is a good shot. If Pompey had killed Valance, both Tom and Rance would have wanted it kept secret - at that time and place there'd have been a lynching. We don't know what happened, only what was said. It is Tom's story within Rance's story within John Ford's story.  Print the Legend.",

Also, I didn't understand why no one did anything about Liberty Valence and then when he is shot in a duel people accuse the shooter of murder. Was there no justice or law out in the west?

Black and white filming probably helps. Stewarts acting helps. But mainly I think, we don't really mind. The dynamic is that Doniphan, as the old hand, is the dominant character and Stewarts inadequacy, in terms of coping with the old west, makes him a junior, in a way. There is great poignancy in the way that doniphans time is passing. What really gets me is the sentimentality. I choke up on the opening scenes. I've seen this film so many times that I can't tell whether that's because I know the story that's about to unfold. I think it is. The most poignant aspect is that the man who actually shot Liberty Vallance is a forgotten man in the small town by the time he dies. He was somebody to reckon with as was Vallance in a different way, but his star faded. It seems the reasons for this seem to be that society has changed and his time has passed, and also the loss of the love of his life. The Incident which, by misinterpretation, launched Stewarts career, pretty much spelled the end of Wayne's. He could have had the girl but he saved the life of his rival.

Bet Clint Eastwood & Morgan Freeman owe a tip of their Unforgiven hat to Ford/Wayne.Ultimately the film is a play on Tale of Two Cities with the Duke as a heavier Sidney Carton. He's prepared to give up the best cook in town (wasn't she Jeff Chandler's gal in The Searchers?)and the woman he loves, so that Rance can aspire to his higher callin of achieving statehood and running water for the territory.

Andy Devine was there as the scared marshal, Vera Miles, who played Stewart's wife, was temperamental yet sweet, Edmond O'Brian as the town drunk, and Lee Marvin was meaner than mean could be.In the story, a lawyer from the East, Ranson Stoddard (Stewart) returns to where he had lived about forty years before with his now-wife Hallie (Miles). Though he comes to the town to attend the funeral of his friend Tom Donathan (Wayne) the local newspaper editor wants a scoop on Stoddard and his friend. Definitely, one fact that is in the lawyer's favor in many ways and for many reasons is having the name as the man who shot Liberty Valance. Yes, that strongly led to his success.Again, there is both humor and dramatic action blended well together. Again, you have to laugh at the marshal Link Appleyard (Devine). And, you can't prevent yourself from laughing at Edmond O'Brien who always remains inebriated. At the same time you can't keep from hating Liberty Valance (Marvin) for killing and beating people with a sharp silver whip.It is a classic in its own right, and well it should be, with the very familiar and, again, outstanding cast.",

            "content": "I've seen this movie referred to by various commentors as a \"great western\". It's really a very good anti-western, in the tradition of High Noon.  More should not be said about the non-traditional protagonist played by Jimmy Stewart.  For my two cents, Stewart is the one fly in the ointment; I just can't buy the 54-year-old actor as a young, eager-beaver attorney trying to make his way in the wild west.Like all great movies, the success of TMWSLV is largely attributable to its cast.  I'm not just talking about Stewart (a great actor if not perfect for this role), Wayne, and Marvin, all superb and clearly having fun making this movie.  Valance's henchman are portrayed superbly by Strother Martin (best known as the warden in Cool Hand Luke) and Lee Van Cleef (famous for lighting a match on Klaus Kinski's face in For a Few Dollars More).  Edmund O'Brien and Woody Strode have lots of screen time as the publisher of the newspaper and Wayne's ranch hand; John Carradine has a short appearance in a great ham job as a lawyer at the convention in Capitol City.  It goes on and on ... Denver Pyle, Andy Devine, and Ken Murray as the townfolks.If you can pretend that Jimmy Stewart is twenty years younger, you will really enjoy TMWSLV.  My favorite scene is when Lee Marvin trips Stewart while he's carrying out John Wayne's steak.(PS: Tonight, I saw this right after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  It's interesting to see the difference in Stewart in 1939 and 1962.)",

In the last few years, I think I've seen it maybe 3 times and every time I see it I fall in love with this movie a little more.John Ford had such a perfect way of filling his stories with well-defined characters, rich sentiment, tense drama, varieties of humor and realistic action.  TMWSLV is a great swan song for the team of John Ford and John Wayne as this was the last western they filmed together.Filmed in Black and White, the scenes are full of texture and ambiance that Ford had mastered earlier in his career in movies like My Darling Clementine and Stagecoach.  In this classic we have Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) as a noble lawyer looking to bring law to the west in the form of books and ideals.  John Wayne is perfectly cast as a good-hearted, tough rancher who has seen law dealt out by the gun and lives his life appropriately.  Lee Marvin is menacing as Liberty Valance the polar opposite of Ransom Stoddard.This movie has it all - a great story of good vs. evil.  The struggle of man against man and man against himself as Stoddard struggles not to live life by the law of the gun.  There's a complicated love triangle with Vera Miles as the center piece and Wayne and Stewart as her courters.Edmund O'Brian is Dutton Peabody the Editor of the newspaper and a comical drunk.  And Andy Devine as the town Marshall who is scared of his own shadow. If you are at all familiar with Ford's movies like the Quiet Man, The Searchers, Stagecoach, The Three Godfathers, you have to see this movie. A movie that Ford obviously crafted with love and great attention to detail late in his career.",

To say that there are clashes in this film is to say that Western cinema is like an ass (of the quadruped variety) that expired long ago but the rider still feels compelled to flog it. The love triangle: Wayne's Tom, Stewart's Ransom and Marvin's Liberty is a shotgun wedding and perpetual squabble until the last man is standing. Of course Tom and Liberty are enemies by default according to Western cinema standards but when you throw Ransom into the mix then you've got gin with your oil and water (a most unholy cocktail).

It does show in a clear way how the question is laid out. Also, the director is a Democrat! The film was shot in black-and-white on Paramount sound stages, a marked contrast with Ford's other films of the period, such as The Searchers, which featured vast western landscapes and colour photography. Paramount executive A. C. Lyles maintained that Ford wanted to make the picture, but Paramount could not budget the necessary cost. Ford then offered to make it for whatever budget was available, although he had James Stewart and John Wayne, two of the industry's biggest attractions, both at the heights of their careers, lined up to work together for the first time. However, Lee Marvin claimed in a filmed interview that Ford realised that the film would not be as effective shot in colour, because the atmosphere and use of shadows would be adversely affected, and insisted on filming in black-and-white",

Whitehead, who was actually 51, and whose \"dad\" (Denver Pyle) was in reality 7 years younger. (And look at Pyle's makeup; you can see the obvious powdered, white hair and stage makeup lines on his forehead). Not only does Ford stretch credulity by casting aged actors in young roles, but the mix of comic touches by supporting actors blows gargantuan holes in the dramatic story arc (but in a strangely good way). The actors all apparently have only one suit of clothes apiece, and everybody constantly eats steak or drinks alcohol (in a very un-P.C. kind of way by today's standards). This movie just gets weirder and weirder every time I view it. And the punchline? \"Print the legend.\" Well, Ford may have gotten that right, as today's politics would support.

It isn't even the best John Wayne western I've seen but it is undoubtedly worth watching.I love Jimmy Stewart but he never changes whatever part he plays. But he is dependable. John Wayne is his typical macho self. Vera Miles plays an honest and decent woman, Lee Marvin is okay as the villain and Lee Van Cleef has little chance to do much wrong.The storyline is pretty good too.However the sets are poor (many older westerns look more realistic) and some of the bit part actors are mere caricatures and don't get me started on the parts played by extras hamming it up awfully in the background. Some scenes are played for laughs and that's fine and acceptable in parts.However the tension is wafer thin in comparison to better westerns and the climax weakly put together.

While TMWSLV is a Goody versus Baddy western, with all the usual suspects thrown in for good measure, the rancher, the sheriff, the doc, the newspaper man,the girl, etc, I consider TMWSLV to be a comedy western. Perhaps not a comedy in the same category as Blazing Saddles, or Support Your Local Sheriff, but a comedy none the less.Next time you watch the film, remark how many comical situations there are and how many more comical remarks there are.I consider it a comedy, in, for instances, look at some of the comical situations, which, in a \"serious\" western, like High Noon, simply would not or could not exist.Halle kicking John Wayne's hat, as he is about to reach for it. The whole eating episode with Andy Devine (Link Appleyard)and his sudden loss of appetite with the arrival of Lee Marvin.Duttin Peabody (What a name!)(Edmond O'Brien) is over the top in his hamming of the newspaper editor.John Wayne knocking hell out of Duttin Peabody's hat on the table at the election.At the dropped steak scene, when Strother Martin (As Floyd) declares that he will pick it up, John Wayne doesn't even look round, doesn't take his eyes of Liberty Valance and doesn't take his hands out of his pocket's, but manages to kick Strother Martin the nicest kick on the jaw ever seen and then says to Liberty Valance, \"You pick it up\"At the convention, the way-over-the-top speech by John Carradine and his casting aside of his 'speech', (which never existed on the paper)As regards funny remarks, who could forget Kaintuck with his s-ss-sss stutter and \"d-d-dee-dee-deep dish app-app-apple pie.\"  Andy Devine (Sheriff Appleyard) almost choking as he ask's in disbelief \"arrest Liberty Valance ?\"John Wayne's famous remark that \"Liberty Vallance is the toughest man south of the Picketwire\", whereupon he pauses and adds, nearly as an afterthought, \"next to me\" and finally, to me, one of the best one liners ever seen or heard on screen.Liberty Valance is lying on the street after being shot, a crowd gathers round, his sidekick, Floyd (Strother Martin) calls, \"get the doc, get the doc\", whereupon Doc Willoughby (Ken Murray) in his top hat and drunk as usual, appears out of nowhere, gazes intently at Liberty Valance, calls out \"Whisky, quick\" takes hold of a proffered bottle, unscrews it, takes a generous slug, wipes his lips, reaches out with his boot, turns Valance (Lee Marvin )over on his back, glances a little to the crowd, nods his head and states \"Dead!\"Yes, a comedy western indeed, but with the added ingredients of the greatness of John Ford to produce a film which can be viewed as a comedy, but also as a love story and a good versus evil film all wrapped up in his favourite set, the Western set.",

I had seen a movie which had functioned perfectly at both intellectual and emotional levels; serving both to entertain and to offer a profoundly deep philosophical perspective on the dividing line between civilization and savagery; diplomacy and the law of the gun. The film is perfectly cast and immaculately executed; it is bittersweet, poignant, intelligent, and profound. It has the strengths of the emotionally distilled qualities of the Western format while also leaving us pondering its intellectual implications in a fashion reminiscent of the most profound moral philosophies. It draws a line in the sand which challenges us to examine the tenuous nature of civilization while simultaneously engaging us at the more direct level of fulfilling entertainment that most film-viewers crave. It is more than a Western, it is an awe-inspiring testament. It ranks among my all-time favorite Westerns, and is surely an masterpiece to be cherished.",

            "content": "Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they pay their respects, local newspaper editor Maxwell Scott asks Stoddard why a United States senator would make the long journey from Washington to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years. Upon entering the territory as a young attorney, Ranse is beaten and robbed by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Tom Doniphon finds Ranse and takes him to Shinbone. Ranse's wounds are treated by Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, and others, who explain to him that Valance terrorizes the residents, and the town's Marshal Appleyard is powerless to stop him. Tom is the only man who stands up to Valance, stating that force is all Valance understands. Ranse is determined that law and justice can prevail over Valance; however, Ranse begins practicing with a gun. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom advises Ranse of Valance's trickery. Tom also makes sure Ranse understands Hallie is Tom's girl by showing renovations to his ranch house are intended for his marriage to her. Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the statehood convention at the territorial capital. Ranse and Dutton Peabody, the local newspaper editor, are elected, despite Valance and his gang's attempt to bully the residents into nominating him in order to represent the cattle barons. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines...\n\nLiberty Valance was released in April 1962, and achieved both financial and critical success. Produced for $3.2 million, it grossed $8 million, making it the 15th-highest grossing film of 1962. Edith Head's costumes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design (black-and-white), one of the few Westerns ever nominated in that category. Contemporary reviews were generally positive, although a number of critics thought the final act was a letdown. Variety called the film \"entertaining and emotionally involving,\" but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, \"it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,\" instead of concluding with \"condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes. What should have been left to enthrall the imagination is spelled out until there is nothing left to savor or discuss.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin agreed, lamenting that the \"final anticlimactic 20 minutes ... all but destroy the value of the disarming simplicity and natural warmth which are Ford's everlasting stock-in-trade.\" Despite this, the review maintained that the film \"has more than enough gusto to see it through,\" and that Ford had \"lost none of his talent for catching the real heart, humor and violent flavor of the Old West in spite of the notable rustiness of his technique.\" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that \"Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here,\" but opined that the film \"bogs down\" once Stoddard becomes famous, en route to \"an obvious, overlong, and garrulous anticlimax.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"a leisurely yarn boasting fine performances,\" but was bothered by \"the incredulous fact that the lively townsfolk of Shinbone didn't polish off Valence [sic] for themselves. On TV he would have been dispatched by the second commercial and the villainy would have passed to some shadowy employer, some ruthless rancher who didn't want statehood.\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Director Ford is guilty of a few lengthy, slow periods in his story-telling, but for the most part the old, reliable Ford touches are there.\" Harrison's Reports gave the film a grade of \"Very Good\", but Brendan Gill of The New Yorker was negative and called it \"a parody of Mr. Ford's best work.\" More recent assessments have been more uniformly positive. The film is considered one of Ford's best, and in one poll, ranked with The Searchers and The Shootist as one of Wayne's best Westerns.\n\nThis John Ford classic is somewhat a bit too talkative if you ask me and yet again I think James Stewart is paired with a much stronger actor, in this case John Wayne, within the western genre. \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" becomes more of a James Stewart drama than a John Wayne western. It\u00b4s nicely shot, it contains of many great scenes and Lee Marvin is as evil as only he could be. Rest in peace Lee. But, it\u00b4s not enough in my book. There\u00b4s something that doesn\u00b4t make ends meet for me at least. And I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s John Ford\u00b4s best movie as some claim.",

            "content": "A pensive Western on what progress requires of men.\n\nJohn Ford directs what is arguably his finest Western drama The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). It's gripping with serious gunshots and men standing up to vicious bullies and robbers. I was also surprised at how funny and lighthearted much of Liberty Valance is with plenty of comedy relief. This is also Ford's most explicitly political film as he demonstrates through the use of an ethical lawyer the moral imperative of voting in the democratic process.\n\nJames Stewart is fascinating as the lead Ransom Stoddard with his guffawing at Western violence and stalwart upholding of democratic ideals. He has nice chemistry with the lovely Vera Miles' country girl desiring real love Hallie Stoddard. Her earnest fondness for quiet country life is matched by her joyful spirit over learning to read. John Wayne doesn't waste a second of screen time as the quickdraw master and rancher Tom Doniphon. His tough guy persona feels more heroic and realistic than ever before in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. There's some hilarious back and forth between Stewart and Wayne.\n\nLee Marvin is phenomenal as the brutal villain Liberty Valance. Marvin's deep booming voice rages against the law and decency with his visceral silver whipping, rapid fire shooting, and fearsome snarls and insults. You've never seen Lee Marvin this scary before for sure. Alongside Marvin's terrifying Liberty Valance is Lee Van Cleef's surly henchman Reese appearing out of the dark to scare Edmond O'Brien in one of John Ford's best shots ever. Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine are hilarious in supporting roles I will not spoil. John Carradine cameos at the end with a flurry of flowery Southern gentleman speeches full of lies and political spin. The entire cast is just amazing in hindsight.\n\nDorothy M. Johnson's story lets you see how a strictly moral man may be led down the path of violence to convince the violent of the way to progress. She also tells her tale about unsung heroes and how we perceive the past. The Man Who Liberty Valance remains a brilliant example of the power of Westerns.\n\nJohn Ford's direction is all about misdirecting the audience about the meaning of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. His heavy use of black and white camera tricks, silhouettes, and shadowplay still looks striking today. His compelling and visceral, creative direction lead Ford's narrative on conveying the range of toughness required for both gunslinging as well as legal upheaval to bright heights.\n\nWilliam H. Clothier and Carl Manoogian's cinematography uses bursts of white light to guide all the shrouded darkness of the old West. Their black and white cinematography features heavy use of shocked gritty faces in stellar close-up shots and perfectly framed wide shots to see all the action. Liberty Valance has this slick stark look that appears like its a film noir with Ford's iconic Western style.\n\nOtho Lovering's editing is super sharp with hard cuts all over Liberty Valance. He keeps Ford reigned into a swiftly paced 123 minutes. Farciot Edouart's visual effects are dazzling from gunfire to shattering glass and much more. Cyril J. Mockridge and Irvin Talbot compose a killer Western score with exciting swells of symphonic danger, helping the feeling that anyone can get hurt or killed in the wild West without the law being enforced. Edith Head's costumes are very cool from Jimmy Stewart's proper suits, John Wayne's cowboy classic look, and especially Lee Marvin's wicked rogue aesthetic.\n\nIn conclusion, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance must be seen by all fans of Westerns as it features some of James Stewart, Lee Marvin, John Wayne, and Vera Miles' best acting alongside John Ford's best direction.",

Many of the supporting characters are there for comic relief and are extremely exaggerated, something that fit better in a \u201830s adventure like Stagecoach than it does in a \u201860s drama like this, and the political and societal aspects of the plot often make it feel like Mr. Smith Goes To the West and Then To Washington. Unfortunately, Jimmy Stewart isn't as young as he was in 1939 and struggles to be entirely believable as a young up and comer, but he still delivers a compelling performance alongside John Wayne at his most heroic and cynical, although not young enough for his part either. However, it wouldn't have worked with any other actors as the characters of Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon seem made for Stewart and Wayne respectively. The story is powerful as well, telling of a man who gives up his girlfriend, the spotlight, and credit for his action to a man he believes is more capable and deserving. The film combines the pensiveness of The Searchers and the tenderness of My Darling Clementine, a feature that suggests John Ford did need to wait until 1962 to make this film in order to allow these ideas time to fully evolve. Even so, and unlike the two previously mentioned films which very much fit their decades, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance feels out of place, like a newer movie (for the time) dressed up to look old or an older one made to feel new, not unlike Jimmy Stewart playing younger and older versions of his character.",

I like that he was playing the straight-laced lawyer who wasn\u0092t the type to fit in amongst all the rough frontier folks. And it made sense that over time his charm and honest nature won over the townspeople. John Wayne offers a great contrast to Stewart, and I was surprised how well they played off one another. I wasn\u0092t the biggest fan of John Wayne going into this movie, but I thought he perfectly fit this role. And they are just the two leads but there were also good performances from the supporting people including Vera Miles, Andy Devine, and especially Lee Marvin. \n\nI\u0092m not exactly an expert in the Western genre, but I could basically predict what was going to happen from one scene to the next in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. It latches onto a number of familiar plot devices, although I\u0092m willing to bet this movie did it first, I just know it from derivative stories. And that\u0092s not to suggest anything that this movie does is bad or uninteresting. I get quite involved in stories like this, because we have such a clear-cut villain against admirable protagonists. I like the way the story is laid out, and even the framing device works for me, because it somehow adds emotional weight to the end of the story after we know all that happened before. \n\nThere was a romance subplot as well in the film, that could have been a pointless distraction, but I didn\u0092t mind because of how well it was handled. Most of it was understated as they trusted the viewer to know what was actually going on. I thought it was intelligent storytelling and that\u0092s not something you get all the time, especially not nowadays. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that one could easily pigeonhole into the genre of Western, which has never been my favorite, but it has elements of a character drama and even feels a little like a biopic (that\u0092s how realistic they made it all seem.) There were some small elements that didn\u0092t click for me in this film, but in general I loved it.",

That always seems to be the case in these old Western movies. Everyone just seems to get along with there co stars. This marshall is such a useless fat bodied yellow belly. That diner scene with Liberty Valance really shows how malicious of a person he is and how much I'd like to see him get his ass beat. \n\nIt's interesting seeing the difference between how Ransom the attorney lives and carries himself as oppose to how Tom and the town carry themselves. Liberty Valance is so extra! He's like that one jock bully in school who's dad never loved him lmao! Sometimes you just got to settle things on your own terms and say fuck what the law says. I'm glad Ransom did what he did. \n\nThat Langhorne, what a gimmick having the horse come on stage and the lasso. Ugh. That was a good unexpected turn. Wow, Ransom basically owes it all to Tom for all his success. It's crazy how the guy who gets credit for doing the amazing act is the one who gets the success and everything when in fact it wasn't him the whole time, while the man who in fact did the amazing act ended up doing nothing. Ransom had to live with this lie which ended up in him finding success within the government. But now that Tom is dead, feels uncomfortable and guilty with taking credit for Liberty's death. This is some very good social commentary on how politicians might find there way up the ladder and into power. Sometimes, the best of them have to lie or do things they might regret later on. \n\nAnother fantastic Western from John Ford with a great message that goes deeper than one expects.",

Released just before the rise of the Spaghetti Western. characterized by gritty gang warfare and bounty hunting, the film is a quieter story dealing largely with the changing politics of the era, largely constrained to interiors rather than the expanses of the West. While these elements feel kind of refreshing in the genre, and there's lots of other nice elements to back the movie up, the film itself feels a little flat in delivery. The first act, setting up the characters and relationships, and third act, in which the title really comes into play, are solid and show signs of a really engaging Western, but the middle drags and hinders these elements at times. It's a slow paced story that takes its time in getting to its conclusion, which is admirable but sometimes leaves you wishing for a bit of a quicker pace. In terms of acting, James Stewart and John Wayne, two legends working together in the same film for the first time, are both expectedly great, helped by playing characters with opposing worldviews that allows for a unique dynamic. Vera Miles is a pleasant supporting presence and Lee Marvin is a mostly imposing figure as Valance, although the character sometimes feels like little more than a Westernized school bully. As a whole, it's legendary for a reason, but doesn't come without its fair share of problems.",

One might not understand that he is doing this, which is why this film is perfect. Some will enjoy it for what it appears to be, and others will enjoy it for what it means.

            "content": "\"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that is highly revered today by critics and audiences alike, although when it was released in 1962 it wasn't met with the same enthusiasm. Ironically today it is one of John Ford's most popular films along with The Searchers and Stagecoach. Many even consider this to be Ford's masterpiece and the purest example of the Western genre and the transition it was heading for. The film's greatest appeal was that it starred James Stewart and John Wayne for the first time together. Wayne always did his best work under Ford's direction, but Stewart was the real star and had been at the height of his career for a while. I'm assuming watching the two together must have intrigued audiences at the time because I was definitely interested in catching up with this classic for that very reason. The film was shot in black and white, which I believe had a lot to do with the fact that both Wayne and Stewart were playing characters 30 years younger than their actual age, although it also gave the film a nostalgic quality to it. A nostalgia that works for this film in particular because through this character study we see a shift of power and dynamics from the traditional macho cowboy character living by the way of the gun to the literate and educated character who believes in justice and law. It also has a strong political undercurrent but it is basically a western where the power balance is shifting from one ideal to another. The black and white composition also allowed Ford to focus more on the characters and their relationship, delivering a carefully constructed character study as well. \n\nThe film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at the train station of a small local town with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). This is the town where Hallie grew up in and where she met Ransom some 25 years earlier. When a local reporter asks the Senator what thy are doing in town he mentions they are in town for the funeral of a dear old friend named Tom. No one seems to recall who Tom was, except of course his personal ranch assistant Pompey (Woody Strode) who is mourning his friend's death next to the casket. Wanting to know why this mysterious man's death is so important to them, the reporter asks for an explanation. And so the flashback begins as Ransom narrates the story of how they met. He was a recently graduated lawyer at the time who was arriving from the East in search of better opportunities. Upon his arrival, his stagecoach was robbed by a bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and he was brutally beat. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) came across his unconscious body and brought him to a local family restaurant where Hallie worked at. Once he recovers, Ransom wants to press charges against Liberty but he soon discovers that isn't the way things are handled in the West. Not being able to make much use of his profession in this town, he offers his help at the restaurant and also begins educating Hallie and some local ranchers in the area. Meanwhile, Valance is still in town causing havoc everywhere he goes, and Ransom sees no other way to stop him but to face him despite his lack of expertise with guns.\n\nI'm a huge fan of the Western genre and had high expectations for this classic, but I was underwhelmed by it. I found the pacing a bit slow and the fact that the film was shot on sound stages at the studio took away what I appreciate the most about the genre: the beautiful and vast location. The film is shot mostly in enclosed spaces focusing more on the characters, and although John Wayne and James Stewart were both great, I never felt their characters were developed naturally. The transitions they go through were merely there to serve the purpose of the story which was to expose the shift of our ideals of the western world. The facts are much more boring than the legends and that is exactly how I felt about this film. The villain in this film wasn't menacing at all and he simply behaved like a grown-up bully so the tension there was missing as well. The twists in the story were rather predictable as well so the final revelation never did anything for me either. The fact that Wayne and Stewart are supposed to be playing such young characters was also a distraction. Overall I understand why this film is regarded as a classic, but I just wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I had anticipated.           \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I also dont get why people like John Wayne which is why I was reluctant to watch this movie. Im a big Jimmy Stewart fan though so I thought Id give this a go. I knew straight away itd be a struggle when I heard Jimmy Stewarts accent but I still hoped for the best. However it descended into a farce. The movie starts with a old Jimmy Stewart attending a funeral and then it goes to a flashback of 25yrs previous when a young lawyer (Jimmy Stewart) fresh out of college enters town... However Jimmy Stewart still looks about 50 in the flashback (probably because he was actually 54 in real life at the time).. Its so unbelievable. Its actually ridiculous. it lost me. He is clearly a 50 some thing year old man, not a young man so why cast him as one.. He just doesnt suit the role at al.. In fact all the \"young\" people in this flashback look about 40/50 probably coz they are... John Wayne is 55. Vera Miles is 30+.  Actually I dont think there are any young people at all in it.  Also most of the towns folk are caricature idiot type characters. Just cant take them seriously. Liberty Valance looks about 40. His two middle aged side kicks are terrible in it. I love Lee Von Cleef but somehow theyve turned him into a idiot and the other sidekick has some kind of sex pervert expression on the whole time.  Also at the end of the movie theres a scene where John wooden Wayne goes into a bar and after one sip of his drink he is blind drunk and falling out the place... Its just so stupid as was the shooting scene... How many times are you gonna let Liberty Valance shoot before you shoot back???? ffs... . arrghhhh... How did this movie get so many stars???? and how do people like \"Pilgram\" John cant act Wayne.... Every time he said Pilgrim I cringed.... He is terrible at acting. So so wooden.. Also the end of the movie is so predictable and why is Jimmy Stewart asking his wife \"who put the cactus rose on the coffin\".... Why is he jealous of that.. Of course she was gonna do that...Oh thank fuck its just ended... I endured this movie. Silly movie and Im glad its over. The kind of stupid slap stick western I hate.  \"When the Legend becomes fact print the Legend\"... yeah like the legend that this is a good movie and that John Wayne can act.",

            "content": "As I was impressed with The Searchers, another collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne sounded like it was a good choice to watch, so The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was a must see.\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of John Ford's westerns which are a lot less focused on the frontier and getting filmed on a large scale, and instead keeps its focus on a smaller level. A lot of the film is more political and focused on the dramatics behind the fight against Liberty Valance from a non-violent perspective. This makes The Man Who Shot Liberty one of John Ford's most anti-violence westerns as it values dealing with its character from a peaceful perspective a lot more than shooting them until realising that it is futile to do so. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film which is certainly anti-violence and doesn't glamourize its battle between good and evil. It finds the appropriate themes and rests on then, giving them a meaningful exploration throughout. \nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a far from perfect film because it isn't as great as John Ford's western masterpiece The Searchers. It stays on a small scale and focuses on the political side of the west a lot which it does through having its characters talk a lot. While the dialogue is effective, some viewers may find that it makes the pace if the feature a lot slower than it already is as a western. Western films are generally slow, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is slower than the average, so it is not a film for the impatient. But it is still a good piece of western cinema.\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is interesting because of its two main characters. One of them is the political Ransom Stoddard who refuses to carry a gun around as he is a non-violent person and feels that the law will protect the innocent and persecute the guilty, while on the other hand there is Tom Doniphon who knows that the only thing criminal cowboys understand is violence and should be treated as such. The contrast between both characters emphasises both the negative and positive elements of violence in the west, even though the main focus is largely on trying not to resort to violence. So John Ford's style of storytelling in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a truthful and honest look at the west which is packed with a lot of talking which may prove too much for certain viewers, but others that can appreciate its innovative approach to the western genre as a means of preventing it from falling into the territory of being a generic western allows it to maintain its strength as a memorable feature which proves just what kind of writing talent James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck maintain when they put their minds to it.\nJohn Ford also gives a great stylish direction to the film. He ensures that the scenery maintains a strong western feel and that the look of the buildings and sets all fit into the appropriate timeframe, as well as the fact that all the costumes enhance the actors in successfully portraying characters from the time of the film's setting. And the cinematography is great because it constantly has a feeling of stability and captures everything from a good distance without excessive editing.\nThere is a lot of strong elements in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, but when you get right down to it none are more key to its success than the skill of its cast.\nAs Cary Grant dominates the screen most of the time in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, his performance is arguably the most important to the story. Playing the man who thinks that the law can handle itself without having to resort to violence, Cary Grant has to experience a lot of character development in the role of Ransom Stoddard. As he comes to terms with the true violent nature of the west, he must develop as a person to face the kind of harsh reality that truly is the West. And without fail, Cary Grant succeeds every time. He faces the material head on and puts his natural sophisticated charisma into the role so that in contrast to tough guy John Wayne who he acts opposite, the two are very different figures. This allows a complicated chemistry to ensue between them which shows both characters approaching situations in different ways and revealing more about how the other characters react as a result. Cary Grant is firm with developing his character at a strong pace over the course of the running time in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and his line delivery projects his emotions as well as his facial gestures do, so his performance is thoroughly convincing.\nAnd John Wayne is the other leading man in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Capitalising on his natural cowboy charisma and ability to give a performance with true grit to it, John Ford brings out some of the best talents in John Wayne once again. Projecting his natural cowboy persona, John Wayne takes on the role of Tom Doniphon, the man very different to Ransom Stoddard and he rides it to another successful performance. Refusing to back down, John Wayne stands tall with his heroic charisma in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and establishes a sense of support that comes with his fearless leading strength. John Wayne is a great presence in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and his leading skills are as fine as ever.\nAnd Lee Marvin's natural skill for portraying an antagonist makes him an awesome and rough edged enemy as the titular Liberty Valance. His character represents the dark nature of the west and Lee Marvin plays it out with natural gritty charisma, so it presents another strong performance from the Academy Award winner.\n\nSo while The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an imperfect film with a very slow pace and a lot of talking, it still emphasises John Ford's skill for directing strong western films and reveals the talents of its cast once again.",

The set pieces and costume design are also both very good, as is the cinematography.

That quote is a great one, especially when it comes to taking a closer look at history, but especially historical memory, and its impact. And it's the key to this film too, which is one of many standouts from its legendary director John Ford.\n\nJimmy Stewart is Ransom Stoddard- a greenhorn eastern lawyer whose efforts to dispense his brand of justice out in the small western town of Shinbone are hampered by the local menace Liberty Valance, played wonderfully by Lee Marvin. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphan- the toughest and meanest man in Shinbone (next to Valance), who does his best to help Stoddard, despite some complications, namely their methods of how to proceed, as well as the fact that they're both pining after the same lady- the lovely Hallie, who is played by Vera Miles. \n\nThis is one of many elegiac westerns that was ahead of its time for trying to demythologize the west before it became popular. It's also maybe the only time in his career where Ford is presenting things with a decent amount of pessimism, something that would also later get popularized a few years later along with revisionism, and demythologizing.\n\nThe acting is great, and Ford had a tremendous cast to work with, There's also lots of smaller appearances from way too many genre luminaries to count, and that certainly scores the film some extra points, too.\n\nI love how, even though this was made in 1962, they chose to shoot in black and white, and almost exclusively in interiors. There's a few moments outside, but there's none of the grand landscape shots you might expect. I think it really adds to the mood, tone, and point the film is trying to make about expectations versus reality.The music is also pretty fine as well.\n\nAll in all, this is a superb film. Definitely give it a watch.",

Here, Stewart plays a lawyer and Wayne plays the gunman in what feels like one of the most genuinely striking American works representing the beginning of the end of the western law of the gun. Ford is able to connect with the audience by building an emotional bridge between the audience and every single character in the film. Furthermore, the usual stunning photography and the striking sentimentality of the dialogue portrays a passionate ambivalence for American society and its roots.",

It charts the transition of the west from law of the gun to law and order, as an idealistic young lawyer comes to town in the shape of a typically fantastic James Stewart and finds his courage and knowledge are useless in the face of the violence he encounters. Up steps John Wayne as a pragmatic gunman and as was the case with many of John Ford's films, there was a perfect John Wayne shaped hole in the script that enabled him to shine. Add enjoyable turns from Lee Marvin as the total shit-heel of the title and Edmond O'Brien as a sozzled newspaper man and you have one the the great tales of the old west.

It's a dramatic tale about bullying, strength, honor, creating myth and legends about alleged heroes, and what it really takes to adapt to the truth. John Ford did a great job with telling the story in a retrospective, by placing all the missing links together, and therefore, showing the world, who really shot the infamous Liberty Valance. James Stewart is very believable as the fearful, neglected and a bit foolish, newcomer, who steps on the wrong territory and tries to fight with a notorious gunslinger, known for his perfect proficiency in gun-related manners. In all of the tension, coming from the strong dialogues, and in all the romance, coming from the beautiful Vera Miles, he seems to have succeeded in defeating Liberty. But as the memorable story is being revealed, the true nature of events can be as shocking as it may be actually expected. Another remarkable collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne, and one of the darkest western tales in history.",

However, it is absolutely magnificent for more than just the themes. The acting is superb, to say the least, and the staging and lighting is something to behold.

I can't distinguish specific actor, because they r all superb. Since this is dir. Ford's film, I must say this is the best John Wayne character I've seen n experienced. He's such great actor, I can't see anyone pulling of Tom Doniphon except him. Liked him from the beginning, because he is strong, royal, and sweet inside. By the end, I felt so sentimental towards Tom Doniphon, left me with very heavy feeling. Btw one of the surprising ending, and ties up everything so perfectly.

Director John Ford's masterpiece is a complete epic of both cinema and the western genre, an action packed coming of age film that's utterly gripping and completely hard hitting throughout.  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is loaded with beautifully choreographed shootouts, incredible cinematography, top notch action sequences and elite acting, it's a fully loaded balls to the wall adventure that's relentless as it completely absorbs the viewer.

The western legend John Wayne lives up to his epic name, he is wonderful to watch throughout.

U.S. State Senator Rance Stoddard (James Stewart) recalls the time he came to the border town of Shinbone, where he was attacked by outlaw bandit Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). He was left for dead, but he was found by local rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), who has him taken in with restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his Swedish wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan) and illiterate daughter, Hallie (Vera Miles). But, Rance settles in, and works for Ericson and his family. But, it's not long before Liberty Valance comes back to town, and threatens Rance and the Ericson family, but Tom wards him off. Meanwhile, Rance falls for Hallie, and he even goes as far as setting up a school in the town of Shinbone. But, when newspaper man turned political delegate Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) is beaten nearly to death by Liberty and his men. Enough is enough. This is a very good western, it's very engaging and it has a good sense of humanity too, Wayne plays his tough guy well, Stewart is the everyman we've come to expect, but Lee Marvin nearly steals it with relish as the evil Liberty, it's one of Ford's better films.",

            "content": "\"I had taken Horace Greeley's advice literally. 'Go west, young man. Go west, and seek fame and fortune, adventure.' \" So starts U.S. Senator Ransom Stoddard's (James Stewart) story of his first arrival to the small western town of Shinbone in John Ford's highly thought-provoking 1962 Western, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. His arrival to Shinbone is not welcoming at all as he is brutally whipped and left for dead by a town bully by the name of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), who basically tells him that the laws created by the U.S. government will not suffice in the West. Ransom is eventually rescued by local rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) and nursed back to health by a restaurant owner, his wife, and their daughter Hallie (Vera Miles). \n\nEven with all of his belongings (law books and documents) scattered and lost, a now healthy Ransom is determined to bestow justice upon this local daily menace and his henchmen once and for all. There's only one problem with his plan to put Liberty Valance behind bars. Apparently, Tom states that in Shinbone, the law books and documents that Ransom uses won't apply to this politically unstable town. \"Out here, a man settles his own problems,\" Tom states to Ransom. Furthermore, many of the townsfolk, including Hallie, can't read or write. However, Ransom does volunteer to teach some of Shinbone's citizens how to read and write. While his voluntary teaching works well so far, the next big encounter with Liberty comes ever so closer to the point where Tom has to teach Ransom how to shoot a gun against his will. \n\nAnd no matter what the end result of Ransom and Liberty's next encounter will be, it will profoundly change the town of Shinbone permanently. Either way, it makes the whole plot all the more fascinating especially when it comes to dissecting what the main moral behind this film is. Does this story argue for the importance of educating others how to read and write as well as reinforcing law? Does it argue for the importance to defend yourself regardless if you're incapable and unwilling to kill a man? What makes this particular tale all the more interesting is that it answers these certain questions by giving us indirect answers and raising more questions both at the same time. In short, we're given an answer that makes us draw our own conclusions as to why it had to end up this way. Without revealing too much about this climax, it's unforgettable to say the least. \n\nAlong with the climax's brilliant and complex payoff, the way director John Ford brings the town of Shinbone to life is also worth examining. By the end of this film, one can obtain a better appreciation of what this town was like between when Ransom first arrived and when Ransom returns at an older age. When Ransom first arrives to Shinbone, we can clearly see how poorly run this town is. The town marshal (Andy Devine) does absolutely nothing about his town's troubles except get drunk at the saloon. The only person aside from Ransom who's willing to stand up against what's going on in Shinbone is the editor of Shinbone's newspaper (Edmond O'Brien). Everyone else is either too afraid to confront Liberty over his actions or too afraid to even admit or say that Liberty's actions are unjustified. When Ransom returns to this town at an older age however, that's a different story. \n\nI appreciate the way John Ford captures the change that the town experiences by simply focusing on the folks that occupy it as opposed to just showing the town physically change. After all, the main way change can be brought about is by being introduced to original thoughts and ideas regarding how we can make life better for all of us. In this case, the citizens of Shinbone agree to put an end to the Western law being determined by gunslingers and let it now be determined by politicians. By analyzing the dilemmas our main characters experience, we can obtain a better understanding of how change is created through this technique as opposed to just being shown shots of a town physically changing. This was not just a well-chosen storytelling decision on John Ford's part, but also on the part of the film's screenwriters James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck. \n\nI also respect how Ford and his writers handled the love triangle between Ransom, Hallie, and Tom. Even though Ransom and Tom are basically competing for Hallie's affection, I admire how they still end up respecting each other as opposed to becoming each other's foes. It just makes these characters feel more real as opposed to just becoming plot devices. It's all the more encouraging since these three all have very strong personalities. I respect how Ransom believes in the written law so strongly that he'll stand up to gunslingers without a gun just to stick to his morals. I found Tom's internal struggle between his beliefs in guns being the law and having Liberty Valance killed for the town's good to be fascinating. The main reason is because he realizes that he isn't going to win either way by having the best of both worlds. Although she can't read or write, I like how tough and defensive Hallie can be and how she stands up for herself. \n\nMany people agree that if there's one quote that sums up The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, it would be this: \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\" That quote basically means that regardless of the facts, this is the kind of story that people want to hear. But these words won't do justice unless viewers, Western fans or not, see this outstanding film for themselves especially if they want to have a career in politics.",

            "content": "What a great movie this is. It's a real Hollywood classic, with two of the biggest actors ever both giving excellent performances, directed by one of the most well-respected directors ever. It's got memorable characters, a strong story, and worthwhile themes about law and order versus rugged individualism. I like going back to these older American movies every now and then to remember just how great that classical storytelling could be.\n\nThe frame narrative opens with a gray-haired senator (Jimmy Stewart) returning after many years to the small Western town where his political career started. He's in town for the funeral of his friend, an old gunslinger (John Wayne). He tells the story of how his friendship with the gunslinger started after a conflict with a local desperado and bully named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).\n\nWhat does one even say about John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, honestly? They are two of the greatest, most iconic movie stars. Stewart is excellent here as the lawyer new to the rough Western town, who is determined to bring Eastern law and order to a town unaccustomed to it. Wayne is as swagger-y and tough as ever as the local gunman who is cynical and skeptical of Stewart's idealism, believing that only individual violence can provide a reliable source of justice out there. But Wayne's performance isn't simply machismo, though - his character does get to reveal some vulnerability and depth. Wayne was an actor typecast all his life, and he knew it, but he was just so good at that type. Lee Marvin makes for a thoroughly despicable villain, one of those movie bad guys you just love to hate. Vera Miles is fine as the obligatory female lead, but her character does still have some dramatic interest, given how torn she is between the Wayne and Stewart characters. Andy Devine, a wonderful character actor whose voice you may remember as Friar Tuck in the old Disney Robin Hood, is hilarious as the completely ineffectual, gluttonous local sheriff.\n\nThe story is unhurried in its development, and takes the time to really flesh out the two main characters and the clash of their philosophies. The movie doesn't judge either one, but makes a point of the necessity of both their approaches. The cinematography (very nicely preserved on the DVD I saw) is beautiful black-and-white, with very effective but not overdone usage of shadows and lighting. John Ford's direction is sure-handed and unobtrusive. Despite being a Ford film, there aren't a lot of sweeping Western vistas here; the focus is mostly within buildings and town streets. The film is a wonderful elegy for the Old West and the sort of man John Wayne always portrayed in movies. It's also the source of the line, \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend!\" This movie should well dispel the possible prejudice that John Wayne and John Ford made movies without nuance or thoughtfulness.",

            "content": "I initially wasn't too enthused about the idea of sitting down with this film. While I certainly admire John Ford, I had grown accustomed to the more coarse view of human nature on display in the spaghetti westerns of Leone, Corbucci, and Petroni. However, I was in for quite a pleasant surprise with this film. \nThe film centers on the life of Rance Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) and his return to the Western town where he came of age. In a series of flashbacks, we follow the exploits of Stoddard and his brush with the town's hero Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), and the town menace Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Yet, while this seems to have all the makings of a classic good vs. evil confrontation, Ford plays around with the idea of justice. \nAs if representing two adverse parts of the brain, Wayne and Stewart are ardent about fighting their own fights in their own ways. For Wayne, justice can be achieved with old-school heroism, a little gunpowder, and a dash of wit. For Stewart, the law of the land is sufficient and he is intent on reshaping the town's attitudes in such a way. Both men mock the avenues taken by their counterpart and blindly follow what they know to be true. They are two opposing forces, both immensely powerful in their own right. However, influence eventually leaks in on both sides and both men seem to come to at least some sort of understanding regarding the importance of their separate ways. \nThis sense of duality is strongly diffused throughout the picture and Ford highlights this visually by his expert use of shadows. In most shots, the characters shadows are projected on the wall behind them as if to showcase the dual nature that lurks in the hearts of these men. Yet, rather than casting judgement, it seems as though Ford wants to illuminate and understand these two opposing ways of life, and to lament the passing of western way. \nBeing one of Ford's last films, the viewer gets a sense that he knew the rule of the Western was coming to an end. Although Wayne is just in his own way, his character seems to know that the times are changing. No longer does having the fastest draw bring virtue and success and Wayne's character goes through a heartbreaking acceptance that Stewart's generation is taking over. In one shot in particular, Ford has Stewart's character standing in front of an old stage coach covered in dust and cobwebs. It is an homage to the old west that is both understanding and mournful.\nWhile Clint Eastwood's \"The Unforgiven\" has long be touted as the definitive eulogy of the western, I would argue that Ford's film is a much more fitting tribute to such a wonderful genre of film.",

            "content": "Man, I'd shoot Liberty Valance just to put him out of the misery of having such a girly name. Shoot, - so to speak - forget girly, because Liberty Valance sounds kind of like a stripper name or something. You know what, I'm going to make a prediction so likely that it just has to be a spoiler: Valance was shot by... Chastity Summers! Sometimes, you can't afford to have competition, and I'm glad no one said that when John Ford was alive, because he probably would have ended up killing anyone else who made a western film, and John Wayne would have been his accomplice. Man, Ford sure could make a western, and Wayne sure could star in one... just as Lee Marvin sure could play a sarcastic jerk, and Jimmy Stewart sure could get involved in some sort of a murder-mystery situation. Come to think of it, so much about this film seems to be conventional that I'm surprised that a stripper didn't turn out to be Valance's murderer, although I'm glad it wasn't (Sorry to spoil your expectations, folks), because this is a serious western right here. Mind you, it was serious for 1962, and while that isn't to say that the film isn't good, it is to say that time sort of timed this drama with certain shortcomings.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the film doesn't fall too deeply victim to Hollywood superficialities of the time, but there are still plenty of Hollywood melodramatics, and other cheesy, maybe even overly safe aspects which even have the nerve to fall into formula. There are some surprising refreshing touches here, as well as more than a few unsurprising conventional touches, which betray a certain ambition to freshen things up and might even commit the great sin of placing some predictability over a plot which is driven by certain twists and turns. Among the elements that help keeping predictability at bay is a certain undercooking to exposition, for although the developmental shortcomings are hardly all that great, certain characters seem to lack dimension, with some coming off as cheesy types which exacerbate the Hollywood fluffiness and a sense of familiarity, no matter how much the film keeps you from getting too familiar with the characters. Of course, as little time as the film dedicates towards fleshing out its characters, it takes some time to drag its feet, having a somewhat minimal story that is interpreted into a two-hour affair that drags out developmental segments over action, despite not putting all that much meat to the execution, resulting in some relatively serious slow spells, limited though they may be. Quite frankly, there is little to complain about here, but there are subtle consequential shortcomings, and quite of few of them, and each one of them sheds some shred of light onto prominent natural shortcomings. As I said, this story, no matter how compelling, is minimalist, being more about talk than momentum, which is further retarded by the Hollywood superficialities, as well as certain other superficialities to exposition and pace control. The final product could have gone a long way for a 1960s Hollywood western, but as it stands, however, it's still very rewarding, sustaining your attention pretty thoroughly with sharp storytelling, and even good looks.\r\n\r\nHaving to work with a black-and-white color palette, William H. Clothier turns in a cinematographic performance that is limited by technical shortcomings of the time, but still handsome in its subtle emphasis on lighting that takes advantage of coloration limitations in order to provide a certain sense of grit that art director Hal Pereira compliment with his capturing of the grimy environment through solid production value. It's a subtle appeal to the visuals, make no mistake, but the appeal is still very much there, with a subtle immersion value that is, of course, augmented by some tasteful direction. Though held back by dramatic limitations of the time, John Ford's subtle directorial flavor to pacing typically cut through slow spells with some solid entertainment value, and when the slower spells go accompanied with thoughtfulness by Ford, there's a certain dramatic bite that was uncommonly effective for the time, and does justice to an intriguing story. The story is at least refreshing in concept, with an intriguing narrative about a stranger being embraced by a strange land, especially upon performing actions of questionable morality, that ultimately comes down to a pretty solid twist, yet is never short on thought-provoking themes regarding morality which thrives on smart scripting. Hollywood fluff holds some bite to James Warner Bellah's and Willis Goldbeck's script back, as does developmental lapses and thin spells, but characterization is generally strong, drawing memorable characters who are made all the more compelling by twists which make the should-be villains seem merely flawed, and make the should-be heroes seem irrational and immoral, thus reinforcing the themes on the thin lines between true heroes and true villains that are further complimented by performances which are as memorable as the characterization. There is the occasional cheesy performance to accompany some cheesy characterization moments, but there are still plenty of endearing supporting performances, - particularly those by the effectively intimidating Lee Marvin as the titular outlaw, Edmond O'Brien as the drunken newsman who speaks for the people, the beautiful Vera Miles as a flawed woman who falls for a flawed protagonist, and by John Wayne as, well, himself, complete with extreme charisma - as well as a strong lead performance by James Stewart, whose classic dramatic layering sells a man's pride as an intelligent man seeking honor in a lawless land, and anxiety over being given a great deal of respect for a brutal deed. The flaws rarely abate, but the strengths never abate, and whether they be respectable for being ahead of their time, and respectable for still being strong to this day, they craft a drama which is never less than compelling.\r\n\r\nWhen the case is closed, some dated and conventional aspects slow down momentum almost as much as thin spells to exposition, dragging, and, of course, natural shortcomings, which go defied enough by handsome cinematography and art direction, well-paced direction, intriguing themes and scripting, and many an endearing performance - especially by James Stewart - to make \"The Man Who Shout Liberty Valance\" a plenty entertaining, compelling and all around rewarding portrait on challenging morals for justice.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

I didn't like Stewart as much as I have in other movies, and I'm not typically a Wayne fan other than the voice and delivery of lines.

Vera Miles brings a certain hostile charm to the screen that completely works. Lee Marvin and Edmond O'Brien were robbed of Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominations; they were incredible! Way better than John Ford's other Best Supporting Actor winners in Stagecoach and How Green Was My Valley.

I like John Wayne in very few films, but this is Wayne in a role with nuance playing to the actor's strengths and away from stereotype.  Ford was Wayne's best director and he elicits a depth of emotion from the actor that is rarely seen. Lee Marvin does a remarkable job balancing the story as the malevolent Valance. He's scary enough that when he's killed you feel the relief. Watch the movie more than once and then try telling a friend that the story is a simple \"Western\".

I only watched the film because Escapefromalcatraz and I made a deal: I would watch 'LIBERTY VALANCE,' and he'd watch THE MAN WITHOUT A PAST. Win-win situation, because both are fantastic movies, this ultimately eclipsing the other (although that's comparing apples and oranges). \r\n\r\nAs many have pointed out, the acting in this film is superb. Jimmy Stewart (who I was pleasantly surprised was in it) is pitch- perfect as a city slicker in over his heels. Vera Miles is damn sexy as his wife, Lee Marvin is downright terrifying as a sadistic menace, and John Wayne has one of his best performances (again, in my opinion, his all-time best) as Tom Donovan. It's a tour-de-force, career making performance. Clint Eastwood, hang up your saddle; John Wayne shames you in 'LIBERTY VALANCE'. Illest had a great point, that Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne are fantastic together. In the scene where Tom calls Rance to his house to shame the city-boy at shoot the can, the pair burn holes in the screen. \r\n\r\nAnd those are not easily-spoken words. Eastwood is a monster in THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES (previously my favorite western) and THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (which goes without saying).

It's a movie about the sacrifice of one man, and of honor without traditional definitions, but its really about the end of an era...or several....and the tragic fact that the dawning of a new age always means the passing and forgetting of the old.

It's not the most interesting film in the world plotwise  - you aren't exactly on the edge of your seat in regard to what shall happen to these characters.  But, like most good revisionist Westerns, much of the film's success comes from the use of anacrhonistic characters (in this case, Wayne, in what may be his best role) set against changes in the West (and American culture) during the dawning of the Railroad Era.  While telling a nice story, the film bemoans the introduction of big business in this country and the dying of a certain species of man.  In this respect, Wayne has the feel of a ghost in this film, and Ford's cinematography makes love to Wayne's allegorical representation.  The title character, played by Lee Marvin, is also excellent; though sadly, his representation has a slightly different feel than does Wayne, more of a shifting omnipresence than a death.",

Wayne's broodiness in the last half of this one is close to his tormented character in The Searchers. The screenplay is adapted from a short story written by Dorothy M. Johnson. It doesn't quite make it to five stars, another story were it was \"bigger\" than could be done in two hours with full justice. Woody Strode, Lee Marvin, Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, and Strother Martin are great in supporting roles here. John Ford did a very good job with the supporting cast performances.

It's a film with a multi-layered story of a timeless kind that speaks as solidly to viewers today as it did when it was released 45 years ago, just as it will speak to viewers 45 years in the future. This is one of those very rare films that truly deserves to labled as a \"classic\".\r\n\r\nAmong the many excellent performances in this film, particular notice needs to be given to John Wayne. To the inattentive viewer, the character of Tom Donaphin is little more than a stereotypical \"white hat\" cowboy of the kind that Wayne played dozens of times during the 1940s and 1950s. However, Tom is a deceptively complex man whose macho bearing and sincerely held patrician beliefs and attitudes are both his greatest strength and fatal weakness. It's a complex character that Wayne does justice with what may well be the subtlest performance of his career. I suspect anyone out there who likes John Wayne has already seen this movie, but if you haven't, you need to seek it out. It will give you a whole new appreciation for the man's talent as an actor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\r\nStarring: James Stewart, John Wayne, Vera Miles, Edmond O'Brien, Lee Marvin and Andy Devine\r\nDirector: John Ford",

He's a drunk, a braggart, a bully, a thief and a cold-blooded murderer who strikes fear into the hearts of \"decent\" people everywhere.  He is the embodiment of lawlessness.\n\nJames Stewart's Ransom is goodness personified.  He's educated. He has courage.  He's stubborn in his belief in justice and law and democracy.  He thinks he's bringing \"civilization\" to the lawless west.  He is brave but not fearless.\n\nJohn Wayne's Tom is a brave man when facing other men but he drinks too much and is nostalgic for the way things were, not for what they are becoming.  He's a man of direct action but has a long fuse.  He is the only man in town who Liberty Valance is afraid of but Tom doesn't care.  He ignores Liberty, letting him be the town miscreant when he could easily put a stop to it.  He is a loner and he claims to like it that way.\n\nIt is the interaction between these three principles that makes the story.  Things happen.  Civilization comes to the west.  Ransom goes on to fame and fortune.  Tom dies a bitter man.  The truth is finally told and it matters to no one.  What happened happened and what matters is the official version, not the truth.  So is history written......\n\nThis movie is not as popular as Ford's other classic westerns and has always met with more hostility because of its messages.  For me, only Ford's \"Stagecoach\" and \"The Searchers\" are as good.  Those movies are opposite sides of the same coin.  Ford's early westerns helped create the \"western myth.\"  \"The Searchers\" showed the dark side of that myth.  \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" explained it.",

            "content": "John Ford was one of the few directors who could deftly balance entertainment with more ambitious elements in the undercurrent. Because of that, his appeal to mainstream audiences was as wide as deep his reverence among aficionados. His films are among the favorites of many great directors, from Scorsese to Kurosawa. \n\nFord made great films throughout his long and illustrious career. One of those was The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. That film, like many of his others, is skewered with problems and elements of period melodrama acted sometimes by not so great actors. But nevertheless, those films, and this one, survive and thrive in spite of them. \n\nJames Stewart plays Rance Stoddard, a big wig senator, once a small time lawyer. His fame came as a result of his killing of a notorious outlaw, Liberty Valance. Rance tells his story to a group of reporters when he returns with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to the small town where he found fame for the funeral of a man - Tom Doniphon. Lee Marvin plays Valance, who's gang holds up Rance's coach, then mercilessly beats him. He's found by Tom, a rugged wild man played with ferocity by John Wayne. He has a side kick, Pompey, a towering African American. \nThe two men get along, but there is conflict under the surface. At this stage in the game, Hallie appears to be in line for Tom, not Rance. Rance preaches the word of the law, while Tom insists the only way to survive in this essentially lawless land is through the word of the gun. He frequently stands up for Rance when Liberty rides into town, and though never outwardly stated, seems to emasculate Rance with his protection of him. In the mean time, Rance is persuaded to start teaching the townsfolk to read and write, and starts working for the local paper. He is a jack of all trades but the gun. \n\nWhen the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end. \n\nThe first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen. \n\nFord's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch. \n\nAs noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals. \n\nNevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.",

While visiting the body, Stewart tells the story of how they all knew each other and why this seemingly unimportant individual is the reason he became senator. The flashback takes up the majority of the film. In it, Stewart is driving through town in a flashback when a man named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) robs his stagecoach. Stewart is a lawyer and wants to prosecute him but John Wayne explains to him that's not how things work in the film. The plot is pretty good, although I'm not sure the flashback was all that necessary. It didn't add all that much and the audience never does know how John Wayne died.\n\nAs mentioned a moment ago, this film stars James Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, and Vera Miles. Of them, James Stewart is the only one whose character has much depth and he's the only one who really stands out in terms of acting. The other main characters are good, but nothing great. There were a lot of townspeople and I didn't really care for the way they acted. Many of them were supposed to be drunk half the time which was fine, but they weren't all that convincing and more irritating than anything.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good film but it's not up there with something like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It's the first John Wayne film I've seen, but it's usually regarded as one of his better ones so I'm sure this is a must-see for John Wayne fans. This is generally regarded as one of Stewart's better westerns, but again it's the first one I've seen. Fans of westerns will probably enjoy this, but I don't think it's good enough to where people who despise westerns will find much to enjoy in this film.\n\n80/100\nB-\n\nUP NEXT: To Catch a Thief.",

            "content": "Emotionally, this is probably the saddest western ever filmed.  Ford mutes the action and the grand cinematic scenery found in his earlier films, opting for a more personal experience with his leads in a closed proximity.  The scenes are simple and long, which builds the character depth to amazing heights.  Ford uses this film to showcase the Old West turning into the New West, with Stewart symbolizing change and Wayne as the epitome of the frontier. Stewart's character doesn't demand much, but an actor of his high-caliber can make staring at a wall look interesting. Wayne gives one of the best performances of his career, as a man conflicted on what do when he realizes his way of life is changing.  The supporting cast is a long list of film favorites including Andy Devine, John Carradine, Edmund O'Brian (stealing every scene), Strother Martin, Lee Van Cleef, Woody Strode, and of course, Lee Marvin as Liberty, making audiences well aware of his potential as a leading man. In the end, this is a masterful movie told by a master story, and providing a eulogy to the American West and the Western genre itself.",

            "content": "Another masterpiece from John Ford starring Jimmy Stewart playing his usual common man transplanted into the rough and tumble world of the west. John Wayne plays his polar opposite, a gunslinging cowboy who knows how to use a gun. There are two people between them. One is the damsel in the tiny western town played by Vera Miles. The other is Liberty Valance, a sadistic gun for hire played by the great Lee Marvin.\nThis film is more about the taming of the west. When Stewart's character arrives it's a madhouse like all wild west towns are, but by the end of the film everything has become more civilized, even though the Easterner had to use means that he is against at the start of the picture.\nStewart and Wayne play their trademark roles in this film. This film is almost like looking at both icons in the stereotypes they have become in the mind of the general public. Vera Miles returns from Hitchcock land (ironically she was supposed to have starred with Stewart in Hitchcock's Vertigo) and gives a nice performance as the love interest of both men. It's Lee Marvin that brings pure evil to the screen as Liberty Valance. His performance ranks up there with some of the other classic western villains as he destroys everything in his path. He probably has the greatest gang backing him up as well, with Strother Martin playing a looney stooge while Lee Van Cleef shows us a glimpse of the quiet and dangerous force he would unleash when he went to Italy.\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a classic western that ranks as one of John Ford's best. The use of black and white is almost a way for Ford to bring the film back to simpler times. Unlike other Ford epics, the backgrounds do not overshadow the actors in the foregrounds. A great western.",

Not to mention director John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers). Probably the most interesting thing about this movie, though, was the whole Stewart vs. Wayne thing.

As the territory's safety hung in the balance, Doniphon and Stoddard, two of the only people standing up to him, proved to be very important, but different, foes to Valance."
