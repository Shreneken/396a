            "review_title": "Spectacular recounting about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944, based on Cornelius Ryan novel",
            "content": "This an important, interesting movie depicting the Overlord operation with monumental logistic and means of effecting the Normandy landing , the most difficult campaign of war . The picture brings to life the famous images of WWII and splendidly the most sensational military operation of the history in an Allied hard-fought effort . The film develops the previous days to the D-Day invasion , such as the landings and the advance over France . The film is magnificently produced in big budget by the great 20th Century Fox producer Darryl F. Zanuck . Evocative cinematography by Jean Bourgoun and catching song by Paul Anka with musical score by Maurice Jarre . Excellent casting by a great plethora of stars . Special mention for John Wayne as Lt. Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort , he's top-notch as a tough , valiant officer in this believable war film and terrific acting by Richard Todd as Major commanding Us paratroopers dropped to protect the flanks of the invasion and taking strategic bridge . Furthermore , known Generals and officers played by prestigious players , as Germans : General Gunther (Curt Jurgens) , Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Hinz) , Field Marshal Von Rundstedt (Paul Hartmann), and Allied : Brig. General Theodore Roosevelt Jr (Henry Fonda) , Brig. General Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum) , General Haines (Mel Ferrer) , Brig. General James Gavin (Robert Ryan) , General Raymond Barton (Edmond O'Brien), Lt General OMar N Bradley (Stuart) , General Bernard L Montgomery (T. Reid) and General Dwight D. Eisenhower played by Henry Grace . Grace was a famed set designer , while he worked extensively for many films , his only appearance was an uncredited performance as Eisenhower ; despite not being an actor , he was cast for his uncanny resemblance to the General . This famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous , risky landing maneuvers was professionally directed by a magnificent trio of directors , Ken Annakin , Bernhard Wicki and Andrew Marton.Adding more details along with the well developed on the movie , the events that happened on June 6, 1944 were the following ones : Shortly after midnight on June 6, about 23.500 US and British paratroopers landed along the edges of the landing beaches . Their mission was to seize vital bridges and communications centers. They also had to hold off any Germans counterattacks until they were relieved by the amphibious forces. The Airbone landings were largely successful. Some US troops missed their target and end up scattered over the countryside. The main amphibious landings took place after an artillery bombardment from some 200 Allied warships at German positions also came under attack from Allied medium and heavy bombers. They were part of the 11,500 aircraft committed to D-Day. They bombed the Germans on and behind the five landing beaches. US troops landed on Utah beach. Strong currents and inaccurate navigation meant that they were a little away from their precise target. They landed about 1 mile (1,6 km) south. The beach there was relatively undefended. The troops soon knocked out the only concrete gun position guarding the beach.Demolitions teams cleared paths through the obstacles the beach and the first tanks crossed the Atlantic Wall. They fanned out into the countryside to link up with the paratroopers. By nightfall of D-Day some 23,000 men and 1,700 vehicles had gone ashore. The beach had been highly congested for much of the day. Utah was a triumph ,however Omaha beach was nearly a disaster, the fight was the most difficult. The Us troops were unable to get off the beach to make room for later waves of invaders. There were better defenses there than on the other beaches, and the German defenders were positioned on high ground, from where they could pour fire down on the attackers.The allies also made mistakes. The naval bombardment ended too soon, and the bombers missed their targets and launched landing crafts and amphibious tanks too far out from the beach, may were sunk. When the first assault wave landed ,it faced a bar-rage of fire , some men were thinking of evacuation. However small groups began to make it off the beach to the high ground beyond. By dusk, some men were ashore, most were still crowed on the beach. The high ground beyond was only thinly held by exhausted survivors waves. Some 2300 US troops had been killed in the landings. The operation had come close to disaster. The three Anglo-Canadian beaches-Gold, Sword and Juno stretched fore some 25 miles. They were wide and open and ideal for amphibious landings. The British on Gold and Sword quickly crashed though the Atlantic wall. Their success was due partly to a range of specially developed armored vehicles known as Funnies. The Canadians at Juno had a tougher time. They faced rough seas and alert defenders .By late morning ,they were also pushing inland. Despite the horror of beaches , overall Allied losses were far lower than expected. Some 6000 US personnel were killed, wounded, or missing, along with 4300 British and Canadian troops. German losses totaled between 4000 and 8000. By the day's end ,some 128000 Allied soldiers were ashore and many more were on their way.",

            "content": "Simply put if things had gone differently on June 6, 1944 we would be living in a very different and very much uglier world than we have now. The Longest Day is Darryl F. Zanuck's tribute to all who were involved in Allied invasion at Normandy.Even viewing it now as opposed to the theaters back then back then I am staggered at Zanuck's incredible eye and grasp for the detail of the Normandy invasion. He did the smart thing and not only bought Cornelius Ryan's standard account of D-Day, but got Ryan to write a very coherent screenplay. Even one who has absolutely no grasp of military history will be able to follow exactly what was going on.Several of the people who are portrayed in the film also served as technical advisers of it. When you Peter Lawford as Lord Lovat or Robert Ryan as General James Gavin and many others these people aided in recreating the project.Zanuck may have had the largest movie set in history to work with, at least up to that time. You are seeing the film photographed in the places it actually happened. The beaches, the towns of St. Mere Eglise and Ouisterham, even the embarkation areas in the UK. I doubt you could do The Longest Day today because of the changes in all these places now. Lots of cooperation from the British and French governments was necessary.You also couldn't do it because the budget would be the size of the U.S. national debt today. This was the last days of the all powerful studio system and even with a lot of the stars free-lancing at that point, Darryl F. Zanuck was still a most powerful man in Hollywood with a lot of favors owed. One example was Richard Burton who was shooting Cleopatra at the time The Longest Day was also shooting. For his two brief, but memorable scenes as an RAF pilot, they shot around him on Cleopatra also a 20th Century Fox production while he filmed his part for Zanuck.Even the Germans came in for a portrait of them as human beings. Curt Jurgens as General Blumentritt, who was also a technical adviser, put it philosophically best about how after he can't convince Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl to wake up Hitler to move the Panzer Divisions, breaks open a bottle of cognac and decides to drink it before the Allies arrive.I have several favorites in The Longest Day. Richard Todd who actually was at D-Day and was a decorated hero himself, plays commando leader, Major John Howard who is asked to paratroop into France and capture and hold a key bridge intact. Todd is channeling his own as well as Howard's war experience into the film and gives a performance of unusual depth.Norman Rossington and a pre-James Bond Sean Connery who was just making his debut as Bond in Dr. No, give some good comic relief as a cockney and Irish soldier landing on Sword Beach. So does Kenneth More as a British beachmaster with his bulldog Winston.The French are well represented by Arletty, Bourvil, Christian Marquand and by Irina Demich. Being that three of these play civilian roles they get the only two women's parts of any substance in The Longest Day. I do like the scene where some Germans checking Irina out in a low cut dress, fail to properly search her. Irina also demonstrates how much the women were equal partners in the Resistance. Marquand as a captain of a Free French company is involved in a particularly bloody battle for a coastal town.Of course the American cinema is well represented. Charlton Heston was to originally play the part that John Wayne does, but he couldn't get free of some commitments of his own and when Wayne became available, Zanuck grabbed him. Heston was later quoted as saying Wayne did a better job than he would have in any event. Wayne's best scene was when he saw some American bodies dangling from roofs in St. Mere Eglise. As I've said many times, John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. One look at the horror expressed in his face tells you all you need to know.Henry Fonda plays General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. who would within a month after the invasion die on Normandy Beach. Had he lived, Roosevelt might have picked up the pieces of a stalled political career. But that was not to be the case. Roosevelt was found dead of a heart attack in his tent after the invasion when the Allies were trying to break out of the beach.The heaviest casualties on D-Day were on Omaha Beach where Robert Mitchum plays General Norman Cota a division commander. Mitchum is involved at the climax of the film where American GIS after being hung up for hours, break through and insure the invasion's success.The Longest Day is not only great drama and a great war film, but it is as accurate a film as you will ever get depicting the Normandy invasion, good history as well.",

            "content": "'The Longest Day' is June 6, 1944, the day the Allied assault on Hitler's Fortress Europe... And when it came everything went much according to plan... But fighting through the tough country of Normandy took much longer than had been expected...Dwight D. Eisenhower, the four-star Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, made up the force of some two million men massed in England for the strike at Europe...Combined American, British, Irish and Canadian forces assault the beaches of Normandy in an effort to gain a foothold on the continent... From the viewpoint of the Americans and Germans involved, the story unfolds through numerous episodes highlighting the 'Longest Day.' We see the commands posts occupied by the Germans; Caen, the starting point; the French underground network; Omaha Beach; Utah Beach; Ste-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise; as well as sites and camps in England...The film is a clear examination of D-Day looked at from almost every viewpoint, particularly from that of the Germans who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them... It is in fact Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (profiled against the French beach thoroughly planted with mined obstacles) who looks out to where the invasion fleet will appear later-or sooner, and gives the film its title: \"The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive... For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day.\"In the first half, much attention is focused on the weather, as the troops... American, British, Irish, Canadian and French are poised on board their boats and ships, waiting for the rain to stop... In the key scene when Gen. Eisenhower (David Grace), makes the decision to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, more than 5,000 ships moved to assigned positions... The importance of time is emphasized by increasing the ticking of a clock... On the other side of the channel, the German generals, who know the invasion is imminent, see the same nasty weather and decide to take some time off for war games...French Resistance fighters receive their coded instructions from BBC radio and increase their sabotage activities... Much of the early going is also devoted to some of the Allies' more unorthodox ideas, the kinds of things that make more sense cinematic ally than militarily: the use of metal clickers by paratroopers for identification, and parachuting mechanical dummies loaded with firecrackers behind German lines to create confusion...The film reaches its peak when the two sides in the battle are finally engaged...The first assault wave hit the Normandy beaches at 6:30 A.M. on June 6... The soil of France looked sordid and uninviting... Planning has been as complete as possible, but in the vast confusion of invasion under enemy fire, so many men fell uselessly when they left their landing craft, and stepped into water... Others fell into underwater shell craters and drowned...The Allied air bombing that was to have knocked out German beach defense guns had not been accurate, especially on Omaha Beach where the bombs had been laid down too far inland to do much good... As a result, the gunfire that met American troops there was more murderous than anything they had been prepared for..Today it is difficult to watch the invasion scenes and not compare them to the opening of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan,' but that really is unfair... Zanuck manages to display the image of thousands of young soldiers who were killed fighting to liberate France... A long aerial shot from the point of view of a German pilot Josef 'Pips' Priller (Heinz Reincke) strafing Normandy Beach reveals a shore-line of successive waves of men running for their lives trying to secure Omaha Beach... This awful waste and destruction of war: scores of trucks and boats hit by shells, or sunk by mines with their crew lost... Trucks overturned and swamped, partly sunken barges, and many jeeps half submerged... Field Marshal Rommel set to work to do everything possible to make the beaches if not impregnable, very uninviting indeed... 'The war will be won or lost on the beaches,' he states... The German command was slow to react to the invasion... They had been misled by the weather and the Allied deception plan that Normandy was a diversion and the main landing would be at Pas-de-Calais...Shot in CinemaScope and in black-and-white, 'The Longest Day' captures the history of the moment... The film tracks the book very closely, shifting the viewpoints from German to French to American to British throughout... In three hours Zanuck and his staff expand on the scope of one day, to tell mostly everything, with an exceptionally strong cast playing cameo roles... The cast could not be better, in spite of the brevity of their roles: Bourvil is the French Mayor of Colleville who welcomes the British soldiers with a bottle of champagne...Irina Demick is Janine Boitard, the sexy good-looking Resistance member...Henry Fonda is Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General who limps ashore with the first of the assault boats landing on Utah Beach...Christian Marquand is Philippe Kieffer, the French Commander in desperate situation in Ouistreham...Robert Mitchum is Norman Cota, the Brigadier general who chops on his cold cigar, and walks along the beach and rallies his men... Mitchum gets some great lines and delivers them with the right amount of idealism and cynicism...Richard Todd is John Howard, the major who lands by glider at B\u00e9nouville to capture the canal bridge over the Orne River...All the characters speak in their own languages... The motion picture is Winner of two Academy Awards for Cinematography and Special Effects, Zanuck's 'The Longest Day' is one without doubt an absolutely remarkable film, one of the most impressive and most authentic documentation of war ever put on film...",

            "content": "This was an another one of these all-star casts that you don't see in more modern times, in which about everyone who was actor made an appearance....or it just seems that way. For those unfamiliar with this film, take a look back on the main page here and check out the famous names in this movie. Click the \"more\" under the cast overview and you'll see all the names. It's unbelievable. Some of them, to be fair, had very short roles in here, such as Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger and Roddy McDowell, but this is a real \"Who's Who\" of the acting profession in 1962. There are also a lot of German actors in here speaking German (with subtitles provided), perhaps numbering even more than the English-speaking stars. That's because the famous day of June 6, 1944, is seen from both sides of the conflict.At three hours, it gives you plenty of D-Day World War II action. Almost two-thirds of the movie involves action from that famous invasion. In some spots, it just gets to be too much. Frankly, the whole film is too much and almost bogs down in too many areas....and it shouldn't, but it is a very technical film. And, for a film 45 years old, the action is pretty realistic. I thought the best shots were the overheads during one particular scenes when the Alies were going through a town.I am anything but a WWII expert so how much detail of the infamous 'D-Day\" here is correct, Since they went into such detail, I'll assume they were fairly accurate. I can't say but this movie educated me on the size of the task. I had no idea \"D-Day\" was this huge in scope: three million men and 5,000 ships??!!! Amazing.",

            "content": "The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting, the cinematography, the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora, Tora,  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns but,they were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes, SPR has gritty realism that stuns you, but  like another reviewer said, this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent. You should own it as part of your video collection.  This movie may appear to be pro-war and patriotic, but Zanuck himself  said he wanted to make an anti-war film. I think he did so  magnificantly. He captured the essence of the book where Cornelius Ryan  said he wrote about the men,not the battles. That is why Zanucks film  is so successful. He captured the men and their feelings, whether they  were American, British,German's or French and what they were feeling  going into one WW2's most decisive battle. This is a Four Star  Classic!!!!",

            "review_title": "An Unforgettable Overview of an Epic Battle!",
            "content": "'The Longest Day' is perhaps the greatest dramatic record of one of the defining moments in world history. After the intimacy of 'Saving Private Ryan', many critics have accused it of being a 'sanitized' version of the Normandy Invasion, but it is a different kind of film, entirely! While Steven Speilberg's aim was to personalize the horror facing the first wave of troops to hit the beach, Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, a D-Day vet, himself, wanted to create a mosaic of the myriad of personalities, events, and experiences that shaped the day. It is a film that looks objectively at all the forces who fought this epic battle, wisely casting major stars of each country to portray actual and fictitious characters. This was a bold move at the time, as subtitles are used extensively, giving the film has a uniquely international flavor. This is not your usual war film with 'American actors doing funny accents'!\nThere are many standout performances; a few that deserve particular recognition are Richard Burton's war-weary RAF pilot, the last survivor of his original squadron; Dietmar Sch\u00f6nherr as one of the few remaining Luftwaffe pilots, faced with the impossible order of stopping the invasion with two airplanes; Jeffrey Hunter, a young sergeant who is 'Dear John'ed and faces the horrendous Omaha landing; a pre-James Bond Sean Connery as a cocky Irish infantryman; Red Buttons, as a paratrooper whose chute snags on a church tower, and is forced to view the carnage as Germans annihilate jumpers dropping into a French town square; and John Wayne (himself a war film icon), as Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, the Airborne commander, who impatiently waits for the 'Go' order, then breaks his ankle jumping into Normandy.\nFilled with drama, humor, and pathos, 'The Longest Day' works on many levels, and is never dull! Over forty years after its initial release, it's semi-documentary style still seems as fresh and engrossing as ever, and works equally well viewed by itself, or paired with 'Saving Private Ryan'.\nIt should be an essential part of your film library!",

            "content": "Despite being a classic war movie THE LONGEST DAY is very flawed as a production . Did someone say there's just too many stars in this movie ? If so I agree . Look at the way they're introduced , Mister big name movie star has back to camera , he turns round and wow we're looking at a big name movie star . All this is somewhat distracting . It should also be pointed out that many of the cast are let down by Corneilus Ryan's script . Ryan wrote the definitive account of the last year of the war via his trilogy THE LONGEST DAY , A BRIDGE TOO FAR and THE LAST BATTLE , he was a truly great historian but it's obvious he couldn't master the technicalities of screen writing , his characters are more like caricatures with the Americans all being butch and macho while the Europeans are somewhat eccentric save for a few Englishmen who have stiff upper lips . Like HG Wells with THINGS TO COME Ryan writes dialogue that sounds suspiciously like thought processes , an example being where the rangers fight their way into a bunker only to find it's a decoy and someone says \" You mean we came all the way up here for nothing ? \" . You can almost imagine the passage in the book saying \" it was obvious to the men who had survived the battle , so obvious that no one dare say it but they'd fought their way to the bunker for nothing \" Despite that I will congratulate Ryan and everyone else involved in the production for pointing out that the 6th of June was a multi national effort to free Western Europe from the Nazi jackboot , Brits , Yanks and the Free French are represented ( Not sure about the Canadians but ? ) unlike the rather overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that seems to indicate that D Day was an American solo effort THE LONGEST DAY is far more accurate and subjective as to what happened on the day . The script also has the temerity to suggest that the allies didn't win the battle but the Nazis lost due to the military incompetence of Hitler . It should be remembered that despite the overwhelming fire power of the allies they could have easily have been massacred on the beaches and that the Normandy landings was probably the most complicated military endeavor in all of military historyA word of warning - If you ever watch this movie only see the widescreen version because the technical aspects are awesome . The outstanding scene is where a few Americans sit on a bunk playing cards and one of them stands up pleading \" Hey guys , anyone got five bucks , ten bucks , anyone got twenty bucks \" . At this point the camera quickly pans out and the sound crashes in making the audience realize that the scene is set in a billets with hundreds of soldiers . Needless to say this scene is totally ruined when it's watched on a scanned copy THE LONGEST DAY is a flawed film but a great tribute to the men who fought in that campaign . As the veterans who fought there gather tomorrow for the 60th anniversary along with politicians who didn't have the guts to join the military but are very happy to use it for political gain I'd just like to say a big thank you to all the men who fought there . Thank you to one and all . If it weren't for you I wouldn't be here now",

            "content": "This is perhaps one of the most ambitious, epic WW2 films to have been made; certainly it is the last of the classic B&W films made about the subject. Featuring an all-star cast (John Wayne, Richard Burton, Kurt Jurgens... even a cameo by Sean Connery!), it comprehensively details the build-up and execution of the Normandy landings in 1944, taking care to show how the event was perceived by Allied and Axis soldiers and commanders, as well as the Free French resistance.  This is a film that takes great care in documenting the events of the day, without lapsing into sickly sentimentalism or getting distracted with fictional characters' personal lives (a failing of many WW2 movies since about 1970), or over-emphasising any one nation's importance in the operation (although, admittedly, Canadians may feel a little short-changed).Classic moments abound, notably the landing at St.Mere-Eglise and the soldier who gets caught in the church steeple, the frustrations of the front-line German commanders and fighters, and the numerous cameos for film nerds to keep track of.If you want a wartime romance, or an appearance by Matt Damon or Ben Affleck, or long, loving shots of the Stars & Stripes in slo-mo, or a gritty blood'n'guts fest, you'll be disappointed.  This film has broader concerns, and was made with much more thoroughness.  There is no agenda at work here, pro-war or anti-.  It is solely concerned with documenting Operation \"Overlord\" for the film-going public, and succeeds brilliantly; a shame then, that it has not made the top 50 war films list.A must-see for any fan of war films.",

One of the five Normandy beaches was Canadian (Juno), but there is almost no mention of this in The Longest Day, and I'm sure that one would be hard pressed to find many Americans (and not a whole lot more Canadians) who know this. Unfortunately, it is movies such as this and other popular media that shape the historic knowledge of people on both sides of the border. In the near absence of Canadian content, I find it ironic that a young Canadian (Paul Anka) not only played a part in the movie as an American soldier, but also wrote the theme music. I find it also ironic that the legendary rifle used by US soldiers during WW2 and shown in this movie was designed by a Canadian as well (Garand is a French Canadian name). The cruelest irony, of course, is the fact that thousands of Canadian soldiers were maimed or lost there lives on 6 June 1944 and the days thereafter, with virtually no acknowledgement in this movie. I have always enjoyed watching this movie, but it is unfortunate that I must use my imagination to see in it the heroic and selfless wartime effort of my father's generation, in similar fashion to viewers in the US and UK.",

Obviously a war is no laughing matter but, for better or worse, movies tend to simplify logistics while highlighting emotional chords, such as bravery and homemade apple pie. Zanuck, however, wanted the audience to understand the scope and grandeur of an enterprise like D-Day.Utilizing a cast of thousands, half of which seemed to be cameo appearances by major stars of the day, Zanuck presents on wide screen all the action and turmoil that surrounded this turning point of WW II. The ever-fighting Republican John Wayne is there, along with Democrat Henry Fonda, tough guy Bob Mitchum, brooding Richard Burton, sexy Sean Connery and pit bullish Rod Steiger.  Still for my money, one of the best landing on the beach scenes ever filmed.  Sorry Mr.Spielberg. (B&W)",

Almost broke because of the cost of making then in-progress Cleopatra, they were in a similar fix with filming \"The Longest Day\". They had been churning out a series of small films with small stars that were losers at the box office. Turn on Fox Movie Channel Retro if you want an object lesson in their sorry output during the late 50s/early 60s. Enter stage left Darryl F. Zanuck, former head of Fox studio, who had left the states in 1956 to make a series of loser films in Europe with his girlfriends who were loser actresses. He argued how he could rescue The Longest Day to the board of directors, and the job became his.The result is a great film in the tradition of old Hollywood - Zanuck's kind of Hollywood - that entertains on a grand scale, telling the story of the Allied invasion of France with a star studded cast. The big stars of the day were all there, with special billing for John Wayne. The cast includes Eddie Albert, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, Red Buttons, Steve Forrest and Leo Genn. Unbelievably Sal Mineo and Roddy McDowell get into the act too. And there are many others.There are many stories being told in many places from the viewpoints of the Allied soldiers, the Germans, and the French resistance prior to the actual invasion. We don't get to follow the stories of all of these people to the end, but each story gives us a slice of life and produces a great and compelling story of the overall invasion. You don't know who is going to get cut down suddenly, who is going to make it, and who is just going to be the victim of just plain bad luck. It is all part of the horror of war. Highly recommended. It is a long film, but it is also an engrossing one.",

The events leading up to the D Day invasion in France are meticiously viewed from the French, British, German and American sides. The dialogue is spoken in the national languages of the countries taking part in the invasion and this aspect alone elevates it high above most other films. The superb black and white photography adds yet another layer or realism . Cast features many international stars, but never stoops to a \"spot the stars\" formula like too many of these films tend to do.Clich\u00e9s are avoided and the people portrayed are realistically drawn. Even the Germans are presented as actual military leaders and not the stereotypical Nazi villains . There are massive invasion scenes, quieter scenes at the villages before the raid, and a commando raid on a German howitzer emplacement in the basement of a casino, a scene that follows the attacking Allied group from an ariel perspective while they move through town past the docked fishing boats and destroyed buildings. The overhead shots of the beaches with hundreds of troops, tanks and landing craft gives the viewer a very accurate picture of the massive scale of the invasion, something that Spielberg just could not pull off in \"Pvt Ryan\".A three hour film that is up for repeat viewings. You will discover something new each time you view it. The screenplay was by the author Cornelius Ryan from his own book.No silly romantic subplots, just the facts. I remember seeing this film after it opened with my father and uncle. It was impressive then, and it holds up beautifully today. In my humble opinion, this is the best WW11 film ever made.

It's also, if I'm permitted to say it, a lot of fun to watch. Strangely enough the all star cast is not distracting at all. It was much more in \"Saving Private Ryan\" with a cast of up and comings headed by Tom Hanks himself. In \"The Longest Day\" there are real moments, film, cinematic moments that are intimately connected with the profoundest sense of drama: The clicking of the rifle. Richard Burton, Richard Beymer and the boots of the dead German. Red Buttons hanging from the Cathedral. Paul Anka, Fabian, Robert Wagner, the landing in Normandy.

            "content": "The Longest Day (1962)This is an ambitious movie, extremely well photographed, filled with stars and secondary actors of fame and talent. And it covers roughly at 24 hour period leading up to and into the epic and dramatic June 6, 1944 invasion of German-held France known as D-Day.On all these levels, the movie almost has to succeed. And it does. It's a popularizing account of an important event. It's history made simple, for sure, but it compresses the complexity with good intentions, and with some fair handling of both the German and non-German sides of the battles, inside and war rooms and on the beach.The movie is filled, however, with so many characters (maybe fifty who are given enough camera time to take on some small meaning, though the poster advertises \"42 International Stars\") and shot in so many locations (Germany, France, London, on boats, on beaches, in villas, by the bridge, in the bunker, in the strategic commands, along the roads, flying overhead, on and on) it is truly impossible to engage in any one part of it fully. Many scenes are superb, even short ones, sometimes with great actors like Robert Ryan playing with a light on his face (in a comic scary way) and sometimes with unknowns who for a moment shine in their terror. But it's necessarily fragmented and dispersed.There are, furthermore, attempts at humor that are a welcome break to the seriousness but are sometimes too silly and improbable to really make sense. It's like the humor that perks up little moments in a Chris Nolan Batman movie--except this is real life, this is the real D-Day and not an entertainment. You don't expect a documentary, exactly, but the levity--even if as cute as a young Sean Connery goofing on the beach as bullets fly around--is a bit off target.The fact that this kind of movie works this well is probably amazing. It even got divided between different directors, and so the unifying qualities show a kind of logistical planning that paid off. (There are only two cinematographers and, crucially, one editor.) And of course there is history holding it together.And this is a history that is getting lost. Fans of WWII movies (or of WWII history) will have no trouble feeling the grand, world-changing nature of D-Day. I grew up on American movies and around my parents and grandparents who had strong feelings about the war and about D-Day in particular. But young people, like the students in my classes at college, often born fifty years after the fact, have sometimes not even heard of D-Day. Many don't know a Nazi from RAF officer, even in concept. (I'm not kidding. I ask, routinely.) This is just life. Blame education if you want, but it's a natural movement forward to more recent and still living world events. We had D-Day, they have 9-11.I watched the movie with my girlfriend who is not from the States, and who knew only the outline of the war. (Her country wasn't involved in it enough to make a dent on its own history.) And so she watched with a kind of dulled boredom. The cameos by famous people were fun for both of us, and filming was to be appreciated, but the drama I felt even with the opening credits I saw was dependent on knowing the larger scope. And so this movie will have a shrinking audience and shrinking appreciation over time. It's a long watch--three hours--and it has a steady stream of great moments. But it's not a great movie in movie-making terms. Exciting and important and with a wikipedia page to make this all clear, but it's unlikely to fully integrate and take total form as a whole.",

            "content": "Darryl F. Zanuck's THE LONGEST DAY is indeed long, has over 48 international stars, 3 directors, and took about 2 years to make.  1962 was the year of the epic as far as the 1960's were concerned and this exceptional film is no exception.  No cost was spared.  Some good war sequences mixed with stock footage of WWII effectively present a version of D-Day, June of 1944.  We see it from the German perspective (in sub-titles), the American plight, and the rest of the Allied forces.  One problem:  If you are seeing the film for the first time AFTER watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you may come out disappointed.  The war scenes are well-crafted, however, the piercing reality is missing.  I tried to watch it as objectively as I could, but it is hard, considering the impression Spielberg's version of D-Day left on me.The soldiers are led by a variety of huge name actors.  John Wayne is a no-holds-barred Captain who will fight, broken foot or not.  Henry Fonda plays Teddy Roosevelt, Jr. looking not to be treated as the son of an ex-president.   Bob Mitchum is great as a cigar-smoking officer of the U.S. raid on Omaha Beach.  The only problem is authenticity.  The actors look good and realisticly war-like, however, they are kept in frame to showcase their talents and they never seem to be near death.  This is by no means an anti-war film like RYAN.  It can be harrowing at times, but watching Richard Burton, Sean Connery, and Rod Steiger deliver cameo-like performances (meaning they know they are only on-screen for a short time) was a bit contrived and distracting.Overall, I did like the movie.  It is greatly detailed and it lets you know exactly who each actor is playing.  This is pure American propaganda, but it is still exciting.  Too many fearful war experiences are handled with kid gloves.  The grand spectacle of the top-notch production values as well as non-stop action  make the picture watchable, if only once.RATING: 7 of 10",

To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience.Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.)

            "content": "Watching and analyzing the film today is surely a study in contrasts given the half century since the film was made. A ten million dollar budget back in the early Sixties was certainly a considerable sum, but even accounting for inflation, doesn't hold a candle to seventy million for \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) or the hundred twenty five million dollars spent to produce \"Band of Brothers\" (2001). Then there's the decision to film the picture in black and white, kind of surprising to me as I'd never seen it before until today. Not knowing the history of the picture, I don't know what went into that decision, but I thought about it throughout.With an all star cast led by John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Henry Fonds (all on the CD cover), it's surprising to note that each of them had relatively little screen time given the scope of the movie. And it is a rather large scope when you come down to it, alternating it's scenes with Allied planning for the invasion, German preoccupation with downplaying the Allied resolve, and the parts played by American, British and French forces on that fateful day. One is regularly struck by the incredible confluence of planning, timing, good fortune and sheer luck that played a part in the events of Operation Overlord. Interestingly, that term was never used in the story unless it got by me somehow.Another treat for videophiles is the inclusion of so many cameo appearances by celebrity headliners of the day, and not all of them actors as it were. I managed to pick out Paul Anka easily enough, but reading the names of others in the cast like Tommy Sands, Fabian, Sal Mineo and George Segal caught me completely by surprise. I suppose I could go back and hunt them down but the three hour run time prohibits that, though my initial viewing didn't really seem that it took that long.For sheer size and epic sweep of the film, \"The Longest Day\" is certainly a must for anyone interested in World War II and the events of D-Day. As best as can be compressed into a feature film, the picture does an admirable job of relating the horrors of war and the stake Allied forces had in executing a successful operation with America's entry into the War effort. Technically there are better made war films like the ones mentioned earlier, though not many offer the sheer scope of the numbers involved in planning this greatest military maneuver in history. For those directly involved with D-Day at the time, it surely must have felt as a German General remarked in the picture - \"We are living an historical moment\".",

            "content": "**Possible spoilers ahead, though we all know how the story eventually ends (having read the book)\u0085WWII, that is.**Those who dismiss this film in the wake of \"Saving Private Ryan\" are missing the point.  Yes, \"Ryan\" was a powerful piece of film- making, but \"The Longest Day\" has a far more epic scope and concerns itself with providing a more complete picture by telling the stories surrounding D-Day from the perspective of British and American troops, French troops, German troops, and French resistance fighters and civilians.  Continual involvement of the higher command officers, particularly among the Germans, helps give the viewer a sense of the 'big picture' that was probably unknown to most on the ground involved in fighting.This blending of the strategic picture and vignettes from individual soldiers -- many of them underscoring alternately the horror, the futility, and the absurdness of war -- was a prominent feature of Cornelius Ryan's book upon which his screenplay is based.  The same is true of the 1977 classic, \"A Bridge Too Far.\"  And, yes, those more quirky scenes depicted in the film did apparently happen in real life, truth being far stranger than fiction could ever hope to be and war being sprinkled with absurdities of all flavors.Attesting to the veracity of this film is not only the fact that Ryan was responsible for its screenplay but that among the military advisors were a host of generals and other officers from German and Allied forces, most of them depicted in the film.  And some of those depictions were spot-on, in that the actors chosen naturally looked like or made themselves look like the historical figures (for example, the fellow who played Eisenhower looked more like the Allied commander than Ike himself did!).  The core story of \"Private Ryan\" is fiction; the totality of \"The Longest Day\" is fact.Another difference between the two films is that many of the battle scenes in the 1962 movie were dominated by long-shots whereas the newer movie kept things tight and far more up close and personal.  This difference reflects the difference in the films' scopes:  big-picture versus small; divisional action and objectives versus platoon-based action and objectives.  On the subject of long shots, some of the sweeping tracking shots (especially of the French commando raid, but also of the assault on Omaha Beach and in a few other scenes) in this film were pretty incredible.\"The Longest Day\" shares another essential similarity with the later \"A Bridge Too Far\" in that both feature the proverbial 'all-star cast.'  I'm not sure that similar assemblages of talent and 'big names' have been cast for the same project since \"A Bridge Too Far.\"  Although it can be a tad disconcerting to see a famous actor occupy a tiny chunk of screen time, apparently underutilized, the approach does get across the idea of the sum being greater than any of the parts.As for charges that \"The Longest Day\" was a pro-war film\u0085I don't know where that comes from.  And that's even WITH John Wayne being among the cast!  The fact is that camaraderie and certain positive aspects of human character become magnified during war just as the more negative aspects do, and elation over triumphing over adversity is not something that should surprise viewers who might wonder why some of the soldiers appear happy at times.  Also, bear in mind that many of the troops were relatively inexperienced in battle and that they were embarked upon the 'greatest adventure of them all,' finally delivering the enslaved nations of Europe from the grasp of tyranny (etc, etc).Heroism is real, too, no matter what motivates it.  Moreover, the inherent waste and tragedy of war was -- despite relying less on overt gore than is now the custom -- a current that ran through the entire film, perhaps being most obvious in such scenes as those concerned with the accidental dropping of members of the 82nd Airborne Division in Sainte Mere-Eglise and the US Rangers' incredible (and ultimately pointless) scaling of the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc.  I was surprised, when I saw \"Private Ryan,\" that Steven Spielberg had included a scene that showed American soldiers killing prisoners.  I'd forgotten that a similar incident was included in \"The Longest Day\" (the GI responsible mused about what \"bitte, bitte\" meant, but surely he knew what arms raised in surrender meant).  It's to the film-makers' credit that the German cast are (in addition to being allowed to speak German) portrayed as real human beings, with emotions, concerns, and real problems with those who command them.In summary, this film is far from supplanted by \"Saving Private Ryan.\"  The Spielberg film is an incredible one, and worthy of the accolades accorded it, but its existence does not relegate \"The Longest Day\" to the scrap heap.  The two films complement one another and together provide a remarkably full picture of what happened in Normandy almost 60 years ago.",

            "content": "During the couple of decades after World War II, Hollywood made movies about the war that were really fantasies disguised as histories. Many aspects about World War II are incorrectly portrayed in \"The Longest Day\". First, not all of the German high command were complete idiots. Second, not all the French were in favor of the allied invasion. And last but not least, it was not as easy for soldiers coming from the naval war carriers to hit the beach at Normandie. When it was released, \"The Longest Day\" was probably appropriate for its audiences who were only a stones throw away from the war and probably wanted to see escapist fair. However, 45 years later, the film does not uphold as well against far more realistic depictions of war such as \"Platoon\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", even \"Patton\". Except for a sequence in the latter part of the movie in which the allied forces move inland, much of the movie suffers from too many clich\u00e9s, too many unrealistic situations, and dialog that has become almost laughable.If someone who had never been taught anything about World War II were to see this movie, he or she might well believe that all the Americans were heroes, the English were constantly ingenious, the French loved Americans (and maybe the English too), and the Germans were a bunch of nincompoops. The problem may go deeper as this is the portrait that is often painted in US High School text books. The picture on this Hollywood canvas is over the top idealism in both directions. It's hard to believe, based on this movie, that the Germans were smart enough to get their uniforms on correctly, let alone almost capture Europe. When the Germans learn of the shrewd moves made by the allies, their reactions remind me of the bad guys in the old Batman TV show. Or maybe Colonel Clink in Hogan's Heros. The Germans either blow their tops (I almost expected smoke to start coming out of their ears) or they dismiss what they're hearing. The movie shows a German lookout at the beach becoming frantic, dropping his binoculars at the sight of all the war ships. When he phones the high command, they at first insist that the allies don't even have that many ships before realizing the invasion is on and they go crazy. And the few references to Hitler make him seem more like a spoiled grammar school boy than one of the most feared men in the world. One officer says that the F\u00fchrer is having another one of his tantrums. The problem is the movie rarely breaks away from its own clich\u00e9 rhetoric. The characters constantly talk about \"making history\" and heroism as if ground soldiers would say such things in the heat of battle. It just gets a little much. While the German high command are insulting each other, the American and British high command are portrayed as much more organized and deliberate in their actions. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne who play the high ranking officers at the ground level seemed like they were plucked out of a novel rather than portraying real people. Every line, every command, and every decision is prophetic. And the men obey their commands as if they came from Moses! And every time the allied forces were about to attack, a high ranking officer always prefaces it with a patriotic speech! Maybe that was a motivation to go and fight so you didn't have to hear another one!The actual invasion at the beach is probably the weakest and least realistic aspect of the entire film. In reality scores of men were mowed down by gunfire long before they ever got to the beach. Here, about 1 in 50 seems to get hit by gunfire. I guess the Germans just weren't very good shots. Another rather insulting piece of Hollywood melodrama shows a Frenchman becoming overly ecstatic at the appearance of the allied forces at the Normandy beaches. (I guess he couldn't wait to get an autograph from a movie star, considering just about every major Hollywood talent was drafted into this movie, including Richard Burton and Roddy McDowell.) In reality, the attitude toward the invasion was more ambivalent. There were many French who were not thrilled with the allied invasion, but these diversities are never touched upon.There are some good visuals in the film, and some great shots from above. Overall, a rather mixed movie that has a few moments of interest and a lot of clich\u00e9 silly lines, and parts that are simply bad history. But as the old adage says, the heroes write the history. Or re-write it.",

The action scenes (in 1962) of the Normandy Landing are diminished by \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), but are still great. \"The Longest Day\" was the winner Best Cinematography, Black-and-White in the Oscar and Golden Globe and winner of the Best Effects, Special Effects in the Oscar and nominated in several categories of several awards, including the Oscar and Golden Globe.

The contrast between the featured actors works well.D-Day, the battle on the beaches of Normandy, has become the stuff of legend, the type of derring-do which makes as good a rattling adventure yarn as it does a warning sign against the mindlessness of warfare. In 'The Longest Day' we see small stories, and big ones. We see Americans, Brits, Germans, and view the conflict and the issues from all sides. There is pathos and humour.Directed with a sure hand by Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton, this film represents one of the best of its kind. Well written by Romain Gary and James Jones, it makes you think about what really happened during those momentous days of World War II. And for those of us who had family members who were involved in D-Day, this film does its bit towards making us proud of their contribution.",

I have walked around the square in St. M\u00e8re Eglise. In other words, I know something about D-Day.That allowed me to be impressed by Zanuck's effort to recreate a moment in history. But, with all due respect, this movie comes off, to me, as something of a dramatized documentary, a history lesson with cameos. It is great for learning about how we finally made it across Omaha Beach, for example, and up that cliff. But it pales next to the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* when it comes to making you feel as if you are there, one of those poor soldiers in the first waves trying to cross that beach.The acting is all fine, the \"staging\" of the scenes, especially Omaha Beach, very impressive. I could have done without the brief cameos designed to make the French civilians look foolish, as in Bourvil's portrayal of the mayor of Courville.You will learn a lot about D-Day from this movie - though not as much as if you read any good book on the subject. The movie, being a movie, leaves us with all sorts of questions. Like: why didn't the Allied air force destroy those pillboxes at the top of the Omaha Beach cliff before we landed on the beaches down below. Why didn't we have better info about German positions in the area? Etc.",

            "content": "Detailing the strategies of the British and American troops in Nazi-Occupied France in 1944, during the fifth year of World War II. One of those war epics taking place in the 1940s which is written and directed just as squarely as similar movies from that era, with purple prose taking the place of real dialogue and famous faces popping up just long enough for the audience to recognize them (\"Look, there's Sal Mineo!\"). Despite an epic scale, the film is full of pedagogic vignettes and subplots involving the French Resistance and the decoy paratroopers lumped together without much style. Critics usually trip over themselves with heightened accolades for well-meaning event-movies such as this (\"A masterpiece!\" or \"The greatest WWII film ever made!\"), but the portentous drum beat at the very beginning (and the star-sightings within the first 10 minutes) signal what lies ahead: a commercial Hollywood package with a 'serious' side, designed as a war document but really meant for mass consumption. The milieu seems right, and the Oscar-nominated cinematography from Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz is fine, but the dialogue is ripe with overeager passion and the casting is certainly odd (John Wayne drawls his lines as if he were still out West, while Richard Burton appears intermittently to deliver bizarre, studio-set soliloquies on the atrocities of battle). The mechanics of the film are not very engrossing or surprising; there are brief flashes of weary war-time humor and also some beautiful images, but there are no memorable characters or exciting sequences beyond the derailing of a train. Curiously, the movie is timid in dealing with the Nazis (is the word ever uttered?) and in showing the swastika symbol (it gets a close-up near the beginning, but is otherwise tough to spot). The bulk of the screenplay by Cornelius Ryan, based upon his own book, is given over to theatrical vitriol or melancholy, and all human interaction is woefully stilted. Five Oscar nominations with two wins, including Best Special Effects. ** from ****",

            "review_title": "A great film within its context",
            "content": "The Longest Day works on several levels - the most obvious being the \"don't blink or you might miss several\" nature of the Star-Studded cast. Much of the cast works very well (Sean Connery's little comedy double act with Norman Rossington is an unexpected highlight). Some less so, and some is just downright tokenism - Rod Steiger getting all of 43 seconds on-screen for example. But overall, it's always a watchable movie - beautifully shot.Some previous comment have surprised me, particularly the assertion that The Longest Day is, in any way, a \"pro-war\" film. I'm not sure if there *is* such a thing, but if there is then The LOngest Day certainly doesn't fall into this category - the scene of bewilderment between Richard Burton and Richard Beymer at the end about the confusion and directionlessness of war is the perfect example, ending with the memorable line \"I wonder who won\".\nI'm also surprised that a European reviewer should have accused this film, of all world war II movies, of being American propoganda. I wonder how many other WWII films include both German and (almost unqiuely) French perspectives of the war to such an extent that almost half of the dialogue in them is in a language other than English. I find the German sequences in The Longest Day to be amongst the most interesting historically and dramatically.The film is certainly as accurate as it's possible for a fictional movie to be - the list of advisors that it had working on it should prove that - including many people who are portrayed by actors in the movie itself. These include the characters played by Peter Lawford, Richard Todd and Kenneth More, along with several of the German field officers. Little touches that seem utterly out of place (like the nuns procession through the French village bringing a temporary ceasefire) are actually historically spot-on.The final problem for the modern reviewer, of course, is the inevitable comparison between this film and Saving Private Ryan. But, as several other contributors have noted, SPR is not only the product of a different age with a different view of these events - historical as opposed to something which happened so recently that half of the audience are likely to have lived through them. But, ultimately, something usually forgotten about Operation Overlord is that Omaha Beach was merely one battle of a very long day indeed. Americans tend to focus on it because of the death toll, but the taking of Utah, Sword and Gold were just as important to the overall outcome. The Longest Day is a film about five beaches, many battles, and many men - some, as Richard Burton says, dead, some crippled and some lost. It is an anti-war film which proves that you can be anti-war and still celebrate and acknowledge heorism. The heroism of the young American and British troops, falling face-first into the salt water of the Normandy killing grounds. The incredible bravery of the Rangers who scaled the cliffs at Pointe du Luc on and, ultimately, meaningless mission. The heroism of the two Luftwaffe pilots commanded to face the invading armies alone, and who did so (another historically accurate point).The Longest Day is a historic film about a historical event and it should be viewed as such.9/10",

            "content": "1962's The Longest Day is one ambitious, comprehensive war movie. The care that was put into the film making it as realistic as possible is very commendable. With that realism in place, I think the movie suffered just a tad bit. The movie is three hours long, and there are long stretches of build-up leading up to the famous Allied D-Day landing in Normandy. That said, the rest of the movie works well and I really liked the ambition put forth into the film. The film had the largest budget for any black-and-white film, a whopping ten million dollars (a lot for its time). It would hold that title until 1993 when Schindler's List came along. The film made use of many famous actors from all around the globe-48 actors to be exact!One of the things the movie does differently when compared to other films is that it is divided into different sections. Each section represented a different country and was directed by a person from that country. The main sections were the United States-directed by Andrew Marton, England-directed by Ken Annakin, and Germany-directed by Bernhard Wicki. Every section had their own actors. For example, the American scenes featured John Wayne. There are also some scenes regarding the free French resistance. Unheard of for its time, each of the foreign countries (Germany, France) spoke in their own countries and English subtitles were used. I think this format enhanced the movie as we see what both sides are doing and thinking regarding the war. It's June 1944 and Europe has been battered with an unusual amount of storms. The Allies made plans to invade France with Normandy as their chosen location. On the other side of the coin, Nazi Germany believes the Allies won't make any move because of the weather and if they do, they would land in the French town of Calais. The Germans think wrong, and General Dwight Eisenhower decides to make the move. I was impressed with the acting. Usually if 48 renowned international stars would appear in a movie together, things would get rushed. Give credit to the movie-the actors were used well. No one stood out-and that is the point! If I had to single out any actor for their performance, it would be John Wayne. Who can forget John Wayne going into battle on crutches. But listen to some of the actors in the cast: Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Kurd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, and the list goes on and on. On the technical side of things, The Longest Day works. Even though there are some long stretches of nothing, there are some great battle scenes. The Normandy landing is quite impressive and so is the parachute drop. This was a film that had assistance from people who actually fought in the war, so they filmed the movie to be real as possible. The sound and the visual effects are rather impressive. The movie was filmed in docudrama style and it would make a great education tool. Despite the impressive look of the Normandy landing, it will not hold well when compared to the D-day landing depiction in 1998's Saving Private Ryan. Overall, The Longest Day is a solid war movie. It could have been a great movie if it was not hindered by its length. Some tighter editing would have done the movie favors. The movie is based off the acclaimed bestseller by Cornelius Ryan and he also wrote the script which was a good one. I liked the tone of the movie and how ambitious it tries to be. If you like war movies, definitely give this film a shot. My Grade: B",

Both films have tremendous production values and are very well made BUT both suffered from a massive overdose of \"celebrity walk-on fever\"--this insane notion that the film should be spiced up with celebrity cameos. And, unfortunately, the opposite usually occurred--the whole tempo of the film was disrupted and too much money and time was spent following these stars in their brief roles. Apparently, THE LONGEST DAY originated this idea--which came into its own on the many Irwin Allen movies (particularly THE TOWERING INFERNO)--one #@^#&#!&^$!! celebrity after another parading across the screen at the expense of the plot.And this is really a shame, as at heart, THE LONGEST DAY is a very, very good film. Its production values illustrate how this was a real labor of love for producer and studio head Darryl F. Zanuck. I really think that without all the \"guest shots\" and a little more focus on the action instead of bouncing about so much, the film would have gotten a score of 9.",

            "content": "June 6th,1944. The Allied invasion of northern Europe begins along the Normandy coastline. In the early hours of the morning thousands of British and American paratroopers are dropped inland to secure strategic objectives, to be followed at dawn by the main assault force consisting of Americans (Utah and Omaha beaches), British (Gold and Sword beaches), Canadians (Juno beach) and French (attached to the British at Sword). By nightfall it is hoped that the troops will be moving off the beaches and linking up with the Airborne forces inland.   This multi-faceted account of the D-Day landings was a mammoth undertaking in its day. Adapted for the screen by Cornelius Ryan from his book of the same name, it is a very detailed look at the events of that momentous day in history. Every angle is covered, from the commanders, planners and soldiers to the French underground, civilians and the German defenders. The cast list reads like a who's who of international cinema at the time, to the point where this can detract from the drama of the events at times. Nevertheless, the sheer scale of the production is staggering in its scope, most of it filmed on the actual battle sites where possible. In terms of cost, this would surely be impossible to film these days.   There are a couple of drawbacks, however. Some of the dialogue leans toward the corny at times, especially by todays standards. Also, since the release of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band Of Brothers' the landings on Omaha beach and the parachute drop sequences look tame and rather antiseptic. This isn't a criticism of the production, so much as a comment on how the film is starting to show its age.  On the plus side there are some very well executed sequences. The scaling of the cliffs at Point du Hoc by the US Rangers is one, and the storming of the town of Ouistreham by French commandos is another. This is probably the most breathtaking scene in the entire film, as an airborne camera tracks the commandos through the streets and ends up circling a German machine gun nest on top of the casino building.   The film needs to be viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio to fully appreciate its epic scale. The DVD print is a beautifully clean transfer in the original black & white. I, and I suspect many others, got quite a shock a couple of years back when I tuned in to watch it on TV, to find it has been digitally colourised. In truth this version looks quite good, but it's not available on DVD.   Despite showing its age a little, 'The Longest Day' remains one of the great World War Two films, and is still the definitive cinematic account of D-Day.",

These are interspersed with rather cheap, cheesy studio scenes.My feeling is that the humour was forced in to make up for the stilted dramatic dialog. The result is rather uneven, but on par with the other big budget blockbusters of the time.Like the big budget movies of today, it is both good and bad. It is not a classic.

Here Hollywood actually succeeds in making a movie that stars ... the actual historical event. This is so uncharacteristic of Hollywood that it deserves special notice. Usually when Hollywood gets a hold of some historical event that it wants to bring to the screen, the event itself winds up becoming a mere backdrop to some insipid love story. This movie does not ... REPEAT ... DOES NOT ... do that. How the producers of this movie managed to stay so focused should itself be the subject of a movie. Nowadays if Hollywood did a remake of this movie, maybe one-quarter of the movie would be about the actual event and the remainder be about some dumb and completely impossible love story - for instance an American paratrooper who, of course, had never been away from his hometown until joining the army, and a young French women, who happens to be fluent in English (with a French accent of course), who are both hiding from the Germans while the invasion is going on ... and become guerrilla fighters and then ... lovers!!! (In reality, the French woman would have been a collaborator who would have reported the GI to the German authorities or her SS lover. After all, let's not forget Marshall Petain and Pierre Laval.) That's what Hollywood would do The Longest Day if re-made today. One other thing, it is tempting to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. This is like comparing apples with oranges. They're both war movies concerning D-Day, and that's where the comparison ends. What is for certain is that D-Day, June 6, 1944, was one of those momentous days in history that no amount of Hollywood embellishment can trump and that the brave soldiers who stormed onto Omaha Beach were the stars of the story and to portray it any differently would not only be artistically dishonest but disrespectful to the memory of those brave soldiers who participated in the event and in many cases made the supreme sacrifice.",

With an initial domestic rentals gross of $17.6 million, \"The Longest Day\" was second only to Fox's own \"Cleopatra\" at the U.S./Canadian box-office for 1963. Although it was not generally released in the U.K. until late October 1963, \"The Longest Day\" took more money at U.K. ticket- windows than any other movies in 1963 except \"Cleopatra\", \"How the West Was Won\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\". Oddly, though the movie was well-liked, it did absolutely nothing like this sort of business in Australia. In fact, receipts barely covered the cost of a massive advertising blitz.Won two prestigious Hollywood awards: Best Black-and white Cinematography. (Through some indefensible miscarriage of justice, the award was given only to Bourgoin and Wottitz). And Best Special Effects, defeating \"Mutiny on the Bounty\".

In actual practice, however, the lines of demarcation are somewhat blurred. Many Hollywood studios including M-G-M made a practice of nominating all the heads of their special effects departments, including miniatures. Other studios like Fox, RKO and Paramount included only camera personnel. So whether you received one of those prestigious Hollywood awards for your miniatures and painted backgrounds depended to some extent at which studio you worked at).Also nominated for prestigious Hollywood awards for Best Picture (won by \"Lawrence of Arabia\"); Black-and-white Art Direction (won by \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"); Film Editing (won by \"Lawrence of Arabia\").Best English-language Movie Release of 1962 \u2014 National Board of Review. 4th Best Motion Picture of 1962 \u2014 Film Daily poll of American film critics. Best Screenplay \u2014 The Film Daily. Best Direction \u2014 The Film Daily. Best Photography \u2014 The Film Daily. Tied with Lawrence of Arabia for Best Film of 1962 \u2014 The New York Daily Mirror. Number 2 on the N.Y. Daily News list and also on the Filmfacts composite list.COMMENT: Although not listed at all in the official credits, Gerd Oswald directed some of the most effective episodes, including the searingly unforgettable sequence with Red Buttons. Zanuck himself directed the interior ship-board, plane-board and barracks-board scenes, while Elmo Williams handled most of the battle footage, and Wicki did a lot of memorable German work including of course that stunning D-Day bombardment scene with Hans Christian Blech. Though the story structure is necessarily episodic, the film retains our firm interest, partly because of the inventiveness of the writing, particularly its sharply realistic dialogue and colorful characterization; partly because of the movie's spectacular scope and breadth, plus all the stunningly-staged action; and partly because of the constant star-spotting. So far as actual acting goes, I thought the German players creamed the rest. Wayne and Mitchum are wholly their usual selves, but it's good to see Richard Todd in uniform again. Burton, however, is moodily dull, even with Donald Houston along to stooge him his cues.OTHER VIEWS: The producer's actual battlefield experience is amply reflected in all phases of The Longest Day, for never before had Zanuck been so intimately involved in the making of any of his pictures. He worked with the writers, Ryan, James Jones and Romain Gary; spent long night hours planning camera angles and positions; talked \"strategy\" with the army and the navy; conferred with directors, sound men, special effects technicians, prop men and accountants. Even so, he was present, day after day, in good weather and foul. - Fox publicity.",

If you were going for authenticity, don't let an actress appear with such an obvious joke of a hairdo. The rest of the movie is submerged in corny dialogue and wholesome soldiers who have the personalities of 8-year old cub scouts (Richard Beymer, Red Buttons) or of cranky lint bags (John Wayne, Peter Lawford, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum). The combat action depicted here is very weak - the horrors of Omaha Beach are not conveyed to any degree that would do justice to what had actually occurred there. None of the chaos and stark terror that is war is shown in this film - only down scaled, obviously choreographed, watered down nonsense. The beginning of he film showed promise, with the drum roll beating as the action shifts from the German fortifications - the marching soldiers, the German officer playing fetch with a German shepherd on the beach.....then we see Irina with her bubble-flip hairdo....and it's all downhill from there.",

I look forward to revisiting it each chance I get.What do I like about The Longest Day? Almost everything. I know the film has its share of detractors who complain about the film's length, the historical inaccuracies, the number of cameos, the \"flag waving\", or the lack of realistic bloodshed amongst other things. I don't have a problem with any of this. The film's length - not a problem. If anything, I always want more. The historical inaccuracies - not a problem. There's a whole page of goofs listed on IMDb. I'm not a historian and I'm not about to let the fact that someone was carrying the wrong sidearm get in the way of my enjoyment. The number of cameos - not a problem. The only cameo that I feel is unnecessary is the one of Rod Steiger. I enjoy all of the others. The \"flag waving\" - not a problem. The Allies, of which the U.S.A. was a part, should be proud of their victory in WWII. The lack of realistic bloodshed - not a problem. The carnage depicted in Saving Private Ryan may be missing, but the atmosphere and \"feeling\" are still there.In short, it's damn near a perfect film as far as I'm concerned.",

Granted, it has some incredible performances (and some sort of dull ones), but, again, there were just too many stories to keep track of; hence, most of them are just a bit undernourished.

            "content": "Darryl F. Zanuck's epic story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 boggles the mind with its scope and ambition. It's properly called \"Darryl F. Zanuck's\" movie because the cigar-chomping Goy from Wahoo, Nebraska, is the prime mover. Without him, and without the four-million-dollar infusion of his own financial blood, it would never have been made. Zanuck was just coming off a series of flops at the time (\"Satan Never Sleeps\"?) and this was his last big shot. He controlled everything. He inserted an important part for his then-girlfriend, Irene Demick, during the demise of his marriage. Not that this was anything but traditional in Hollywood then and now. Darryl's son, Richard, gave HIS paramour an important, if silent, part as Charlton Heston's girlfriend in \"Planet of the Apes.\" It's GOOD to be the producer. Anyway, it has to be Zanuck's movie because it's a vast ensemble piece with none of the forty-two stars being given more than a few minutes of screen time.There are no back stories at all. None of the characters, most of them based on real people drawn from Cornelius Ryan's blockbuster book, have wives or children. There are no flashbacks to anyone's happy boyhood, fishing barefoot from a pier. Nobody grew up in a dysfunctional family in the slums either. Nobody carries a picture of the girl back home.The Americans and Brits speak English, the French speak French, and the Germans speak German. This means subtitles, which in turn means that if it were produced today nobody under the age of thirty would enjoy seeing it, since MTV and \"Die Hard Forever\" and \"I Dismember Mamma\" have no subtitles. One can almost hear the complaints of the kids sitting around chugging energy drinks and squirming with the effort to look and read at the same time. Well, maybe that's a little harsh. I'll make an exception. There would be no squirming among the kids in any household that has a copy of \"The Origin of Species\" on one of its bookshelves.Aside from the expense and the massive logistical effort on display, it's not a bad movie. There are a few awkward moments in the script, true, such as when a solemn actor tells someone else, and the audience as well, that this is an important day and we should all try to remember it.And, thank God, no speeches about patriotism. These guys on both sides are dying. The nationalism is on display and doesn't need to be spelled out. There's a good deal of irony too. It tempers the obvious heroism. Some German soldiers come out of a bunker with their hands up, crying \"Bitte, bitte!\" and a GI shoots them all down, tips his helmet back, and muses, \"I wonder what 'Bitte, bitte' means.\" In \"Saving Private Ryan\", any Germans trying to surrender are automatically exterminated without qualms. But \"The Longest Day\" is a kind of transitional film. Those produced during and immediately after the war pretty much demonized the enemy. Those coming later in the 1960s and afterward were usually more \"realistic\" in that they had more blood, and the enemy, although a nuisance, was sometimes humanized. But if the enemy weren't demonized, they weren't sympathized with in any way. They were offed matter-of-factly, the way Dirty Harry shot his adversaries. Just bodies.The British here are the kind who are jolly and brave and who hide their emotions carefully, as Richard Burton does. The Americans are good-natured complainers who practice seductive speeches in rudimentary French before jumping out of airplanes. The Germans are of two types -- the commanders who sit around sipping tea in palaces, and the men and junior officers at the front who frantically try to communicate with them while holding off an inexorable Allied force.There are concessions to commercialism, as there almost inevitably will be. Some incidents are depicted that never took place. Some mistakes are skipped over (the frenetic and pointless gyrations of the airplanes carrying the parachutists). And Irene Demick has a hair style straight out of 1962. Of course, our side wins. Our side always wins. That's why you will never see a movie called \"The Battle of the Java Sea\" or \"A Yank at Kasserine Pass.\" But it's a good movie, almost a documentary, and should be seen for its educational value alone because it isn't fictionalized like \"Saving Private Ryan.\" It may not be as bloody as some people would prefer but it's instructive -- and it's so gol darned BIG that the grand sweep of this ineluctable, elephantine monster carries you along willy nilly.",

Some of the sets look staged and are so over lit and glossy they resemble something from the Theatre or Television. These seem irredeemably self-conscious and corny, as does much of the acting and dialog.The Military details and the Historical accuracy, or lack thereof, have been discussed by experts and let's leave it for them and concentrate on the Film as a Film, the Movie as a Movie. In short, its entertainment value and not its value as a Documentary account.As mentioned the long shots are stunning and it shows what you can do with time and money. But this is all undercut by some really shoddy back projections and lackluster troop invasion scenes. Yes, there are lots of soldiers (again, time and money) but they are completely unrealistic and uninspired. The unending list of name Actors fare even worse with little screen time. What motivation and character development we have are dated platitudes, fake humility and bravado, along with some intrusive unfunny comedy relief. There is not one memorable or engaging performance.Overall, it is a sprawling epic and cuts a wide swath that only money and time will allow, but it is all done with a heavy hand, a pandering patriotic pathos, and not much verisimilitude. It is a dressed up delivery of imitative imagination in a noble, but elated production.",

            "content": "This is, without doubt, one of the greatest American war movies made in the '60s, along with ''Battle of the Bulge'' and ''Where Eagles Dare''. It's well told from the different sides (Americans, British, French and Germans) and everyone talks in his own language (the French speak in French and the Germans speak in German).The title refers to the D-DAY (6 June 1944), the day the Allied assault the Nazi-dominated France.The movie can be divided in two parts. The first, with Americans and British that complain about the bad weather and about the ships and planes, and the decision of General Eisenhower to go ahead with the invasion on June 6, with the background sound of a clock: meanwhile also the Germans want to take some time because of the bad weather. The French Resistance receive their coded messages by radio and then they start their sabotage plans.The second part starts when the two sides, Allies and Germans, are engaged in battle. My favorite part was the Pointe Du Hoc, because is full of action and thrilling scenes and with few actors that I like; Robert Wagner, George Segal, Fabian, Tommy Sands and even singer Paul Anka, that also wrote the theme song.The scenery is great, from the beginning to the end; the beaches, that today are one of the most famous of France's camping sites, the farms with some animals (cows, doves and rabbits) that are indifferent of the soldiers, and Pointe Du Hoc itself.The music score is also great, especially in the ending credits.Shot in black-and-white and CinemaScope, The Longest Day is the excellent chronicle of the D-DAY, from the preparation till the ending of the beach invasion, with a remarkable line said here by Robert Mitchum ''Take me up the hill, son''.In three hours Zanuck and the three directors (Annakin, Marton and Wicki) managed to tell all the scope of one day in every minimum detail, and with the greatest all-star cast ever seen in a war-movie. There are some, like Rod Steiger, Henry Fonda or a pre-007 Sean Connery that vanish after few scenes, but they are also convincing. While the biggest parts, like Robert Mitchum or John Wayne's, are also good, and surrounded by some famous supporting actors of those years. Wayne's co-stars are Steve Forrest, Tom Tryon and Stuart Whitman, while Mitchum's co-stars are Eddie Albert, Ray Danton and Jeffrey Hunter.I want to talk about the roles and the actors that, for me, were the best in the movie: Irina Demick as Janine Boitard, the SEXY French Resistance leader, that succeed to distract two German sentries.Robert Mitchum as Brigadier General Norman Cota, that never stops to give orders and rallying his men. His lines were the best, and were said with a right dose of cynicism.Tommy Sands as an US Army Ranger.He is the most bold of the Rangers and eventually kills some Germans in pacific state while he keeps company to a wounded Robert Wagner.Eddie Albert as Col. Thompson. He reassures Mitchum saying that the rain will stop. Eventually he is convinced by Mitchum about the fact that the men have to battle despite the heavy casualties.Stuart Whitman as Lt. Sheen. He is useful for John Wayne's men because he gives indications about the locations of the German outposts.Sal Mineo as Pvt. Martini. A brief role because he is killed in action.Sean Connery as Private Flanagan. A loudmouth soldier and always besides him Norman Rossington. Trivia: After this movie Connery became the first actor to play James Bond in ''Dr. No''.Henry Fonda as Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Brigadier General that arrives with the first landing craft at Omaha Beach.John Wayne as Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, who would participate in war actions and wouldn't stop to give orders to his men broken foot or not. He is the best actor in the movie.I always watch this movie every 6 of June, the anniversary of the D-DAY. It's one of the best American war movies ever made, second only to ''Saving Private Ryan''. It also won two Oscars, for Best Cinematography and Best Special Effects. And watching this movie, even multiple times is a great experience. Must-see for all war movie fans!",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's got nothing on The Longest Day. Once you watch this movie, you'll wonder why he felt the need to reenact the landing at Normandy, after Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, and Darryl F. Zanuck did such a wonderful job capturing the moment thirty-five years earlier. The beginning of this movie is extremely slow, and the first half hour could have easily been cut. The start of the film could have been when Eddie Albert announces, \"Next stop: Normandy.\" But after that announcement, it's very good, and the beach scene in so incredibly filmed, it feels like watching a remake would be sacrilegious. There's a long tracking shot where everyone rushes in, machine guns knocking people off, bombs crashing down, chaos in every inch of the frame, helicopter shots that show planes picking off soldiers on the sand-what else do you need? Blood and guts aren't really necessary to capture the horror and seriousness of war, not if it's filmed correctly. And those four certainly filmed it right.It seems like everyone who wasn't in 1962's star-studded epic How the West was Won joined the star-studded cast of 1962's The Longest Day. Except Henry Fonda. He can do whatever he wants, so he was in both movies. This three-hour war drama chronicles D-Day, and as the title forewarns you, it's long. But if you want to see John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Curd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Mel Ferrer, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Paul Anka, Christian Marquand, Kenneth More, Gert Frobe, Richard Beymer, Steve Forrest, Ray Danton, Paul Hartmann, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowall, Edmond O'Brien, Tommy Sands, Peter van Eyck, Richard Todd, and George Segal all together in one movie with parts ranging from five seconds to thirty minutes, you can rent it. Just to warn you, everyone in this movie speaks their native language, so a good two-thirds of the movie aren't in English. The first section of the movie involves the French, German, American, and English bigwigs planning and strategizing. There's lots of subtitles, and if that's not your cup of tea, you'll get bored. Once you get past the first thirty minutes, it doesn't feel so long, because then the battle scenes start.Believe it or not, there's actually a lighter side to this movie. In the middle of the landing at Normandy, a Frenchman rushes up to the soldiers waving a bottle of champagne, welcoming them and thanking them for coming. Peter Lawford says, \"That's most kind of you. Very nice to meet you! Perhaps next time, you see, we have a previous engagement-the war!\" Very dry and very British, but at a time like that, it's nice to see good old fashioned manners towards someone who is so happy to see the soldiers. In the same scene, Sean Connery is joking with another soldier, and his commanding officer, Kenneth More, keeps encouraging the soldiers to get off the beach, since all the gunfire is upsetting his dog. He shouts at them, \"Don't stand there yapping! The war's over there!\"If you like watching classic war movies, this is one of the most famous out there. Yes, it's filmed in black and white, but it's just supposed to transport you back in time and add to the realism. And no, there's no blood or guts, but with all the drama and tension in the battle scenes-once you get past the first thirty minutes-there's no need for all those extras. The second half of the movie in Normandy is riveting and incredible to watch. No wonder it took four people to direct this movie!",

            "content": "\"The Longest Day\" may be the best historical film ever made about World War II in Europe. It has plenty of action. It gives a wonderful picture, from both sides, of the invasion of Normandy on D-Day. The Allies are anxious and restless as they wait in England for the word to go on June 6, 1944. The Germans are reticent and uncertain, knowing that an invasion was imminent. But when? Where? Finally, all the parts of Operation Overlord play out.The largest armada in the history of the world set sail \u2013 more than 5,000 vessels headed across the English Channel for the coast of France. Shortly after midnight, more than 13,000 American paratroops take off for a night jump in the largest airborne assault in history to that time.Few of the Allies met their objectives the first day. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their target sites. Americans met Germans entrenched with artillery and machine guns on cliffs high above Omaha and Utah beaches. At Gold, Juno and Sword beaches, the British, Canadian and French troops fought house to house in towns along the coast. Most of the airborne drops behind enemy lines were way off target and paratroopers were scattered across a large area. Yet, the Allies gained a foothold, confused and disrupted the enemy, and soon were able to move inland for the drive to defeat Germany.There is nothing about the plot to give away \u2013 the story is well known. But the production of this movie\u2013 about such a major event in world history, begs a close look for its achievement.The film is based on a book by Irish-American author Cornelius Ryan, who also wrote the screenplay. Ryan had been a war correspondent who was driven to write a book about the world-changing event. After a 1949 visit to Normandy, he began his research and interviewed more than 1,000 D-Day veterans. He finished his novel in 1959, and \"The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day\" was a huge best-seller.Daryl Zanuck bought the movie rights for 20th Century Fox. More than a dozen of the senior veterans \u2013 American, British, French and German, were consultants on the film. More D-Day veterans were military advisers. The result was a movie that closely followed the real event. The film won two Oscars and had three more nominations for its technical excellence. It had a huge cast that included more than two dozen notable actors of the day \u2013 all who gave top performances.\"The Longest Day\" had a $10 million budget \u2013 the record for black and white films until \"Schindler's List\" 30 years later. The film was one of the first to record characters of different nations in their own languages. English subtitles appear in the German and French scenes. The movie was filmed at locations in France, including parachute scenes in Ste. Marie-Eglise. The beach landing scenes were shot on the Ile de Re in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of La Rochelle, France.As with any war film, all of the aircraft and ships couldn't be the originals, or even of the same time period. But Zanuck found Messerschmitts and Spitfires in the air forces of Spain and Belgium, and he rented them for the beach strafing scenes. Only military purists will note the different equipment elsewhere that's not accurate.The scenes of the invasion fleet were filmed in June 1961 during maneuvers of the U.S. Sixth fleet. It was then stationed in the Mediterranean. The film crews shot around the fleet's aircraft carrier because there were no carriers in the Normandy invasion. But 22 ships of the Sixth Fleet were photographed for the movie.The movie opened in France on Sept. 25, in America on Oct. 4, and in Great Britain on Oct. 23. When it came out, I was serving in the 1/504 airborne of the 1st Brigade, 8th Infantry Division at Mainz, Germany. The 2/505 airborne was part of our brigade. I met some of its troopers who had been in the jump scenes for the movie. Ste. Marie-Eglise, France, has an Airborne Museum dedicated to the American paratroopers who helped liberate Normandy. The movie shows a company of the 505 that was slaughtered by the Germans when it was dropped right on the town.Quite a bit is made about John Wayne's age in playing the part of Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, and I agree. By way of comparison to airborne commanders, the ages of most senior military officers are 15 to 20 years older. Those in this film \u2013 Allied and German, were mostly in their 50s. And, the actors who played them were very close in age. But, both actors who played the American paratroop leaders were way over age \u2013 and looked it. Wayne was 54 when he played his role \u2013 twice the actual age of Vandervoort who was 27 at the time. And Robert Ryan, at 52, was 15 years older than the real Brig Gen. James Gavin who was 37 at the time. This is a point worth noting.In the 1945 movie, \"Objective Burma,\" Errol Flynn's character tells an older reporter that the paratroopers, including their officers, have to be young men to stand up to the rigors of airborne missions. \"Do you know how old the colonel is in there? Thirty-four. You know how old our commanding general is? Thirty-seven.\" I appreciate and enjoy John Wayne and Robert Ryan as actors, but this is one time when the roles they played would better have been cast with someone else. Charlton Heston was supposed to have wanted the role that Wayne got. At age 39, he would have been good for either role. But, Paul Newman at 37 would have been just right as Gen. Gavin, and Steve McQueen at 32 would have been ideal as Vandervoort.",

The characters sound very sincere and involved, with a good mix of comedy and tragedy.This was Hollywood honcho Darryl Zanuck's pet project for an anti-war drama, and it works very well. And the title music by talented music artist Paul Anka is very catchy. Sure, this hasn't got the high gross-out impact for a post-Vietnam audience that certain later efforts do (How could it?); but at dramatizing the situation, this is a lot easier to follow.I would strongly recommend that you try and see the colorized version as it's a lot easier to watch; especially in noticing scenic details and when reading the subtitles.

He hired every name actor in the book (and several who were not in the book), with John Wayne as an 82nd Airborne officer, among others. Sean Connery has a main role in the film; about 8-10 seconds on screen. Zanuck even hired Tommy Sands, Fabian, Paul Anka, and other non-actor singers and entertainers, just to add more attractions for younger audiences. He didn't miss a beat. There were a few anecdotes that didn't work, but most did. The Army engineer scene with Robert Mitchum was too long, as were a few other scenes. But generally speaking, the film captures the intensity of the event. My father was on Omaha Beach, and he mentioned the only thing he cared about was dry socks after the landing. It is tough on the feet to march with wet socks.Peter Lawford is fine in the film, as are most of the other cameos. Robert Ryan and Richard Burton, however, are quite forgettable. Red Buttons does a good job in a memorable scene early in the film. It is interesting to note, that the lower you go on the rank of the soldiers involved, the more interesting the stories are; with the highest ranking officers having the most hackneyed phrases and situations.

It is very long, as it is ambitious enough to tell the story both from Allied and German viewpoints, and do so at least in a plausible way, if not wholly truthfully. That means a huge cast list, and it is a little difficult to keep track of everyone and their own little subplots. However, it also manages to deliver an overlook with each little subplot augmenting each other. As a story it is magnificent. Despite the known outcome it kept me on the edge. Helping is the for its time good effects and huge scenes with great masses of extras. It is very clear that few expenses were cut making this film. The huge cast also allows for a lot of famous actors appearing, most notably John Wayne, Richard Burton and Sean Connery, among many others.Even though it is a little too long for my taste it was never boring or dull. It kept the tension and the interest by combining calm scenes with action filled ones. In that way there were never too much of either one.The Longest Day is getting a little old nowadays but still keeps it place as one impressive war movie. Only a few movies are made in this scale anymore. I can see how it has influenced the entire genre since. It is simply put a classic.8/10",

At one point Hans Blech says, \"A whole night wasted again!\" Well, yes, Hans, but only if you watch the whole thing.Lots of guys who've done excellent work in films far, far from this one mark their time here imprisoned by an atmosphere of tremendous density, moving through cement in unhurried interiors that suck the life from even Rod Steiger - now that's a rare day - and in exteriors that seem designed to minimize whatever benefit may have been offered by fresh air. There's more lead in this movie's feet than in its guns. You think that's labored prose? Try listening to Richard Burton's Officer's Club scene.At minute 6 this film is an unwatchably boring series of sea- and landscapes, photographed as if by remote control. By the time somebody speaks, it's in poorly translated French, then intermittently translated German. The first English we hear is bad wisecracks from a b-movie graveyard. Then Liz Taylor's best girlfriend Roddy McDowell recites a tender memory of camping with his Dad. Now you know you're in trouble, but wait: next a bunch of grumpy stars deliver bald exposition like men just awakened from dreams of not being in this movie. At minute 53 somebody finally shoots a German, but I'm already counting sheep named Tom Tryon, Fabian, Paul Anka... all-star has never meant so little. 120 minutes to go. Watching this movie may be the only experience painful enough to compare with actual combat.American draft-dodger and armchair warhawk John Wayne is a dependably uninspired performer at the best of times, only coming to life when he plays an overbearing prick with a gun in his hand. This movie nefariously circumvents his only cinematic value by sticking him with the kind of up-to-speed dialogue normally delegated to Jeffrey Hunter (\"...there's 3 million men in camps just like this one scattered all over this island...\"), then breaking his leg so he can't move. Kind of like his real-life inertia while his fellow American Fascist Jimmy Stewart and co-star American Liberal Henry Fonda went off to win DFCs and Bronze Stars fighting three-dimensional Germans and Japanese.There's one decent battle sequence, including an impressively executed 90-second aerial shot, when the French attack Ouistreham with the help of some nuns, but it's too little too late. Too bad. Overall it's the German interior scenes that come off best, with Blech, Wolfgang Preiss, and the unstoppable Curt Jurgens maintaining some sort of pace under the Prussian lash of Bernhard Wicki. This while Andrew Marton allows Robert Mitchum to stagger up Omaha Beach in a distracted daze, trying to remember where he stashed that third reefer. The scene reminds me of the Paul Verlaine line that signals the start of the whole operation. \"Monotonous langour\" should be this movie's epitaph.",

            "content": "The Longest Day (1962) -I watched this film thinking that it was on one of the many top film lists that I have been checking off. I am actually flabbergasted to find that it doesn't feature on ANY of them at all. Films like this are the reason I AM ticking off the lists. I want to find things that impress me, that I would never expect to do so and this was exactly what I've been waiting for. A film that showed things from more than one perspective, with the right people in the right roles, speaking the right languages for their character and subtitled appropriately. This is what films like 'Independence Day' (1996) and 'Dunkirk' (2017) should have been. A chance to unite studios and actors across the world to deliver something important, in the way that is correct for each nation and shows a real representation of that country.Obviously this film is a little biased towards the Germans coming just 17 years after the end of WWII, as it would be, but imagine remaking this today, with a fairer view of how events occurred from all sides, including the Germans who may have been just following orders and might have believed that they were doing right. We know a lot more about all factions these days.The only downfall with the real languages of the different nations being spoken was that it was difficult to judge the performances of those speaking them. But that ability to subtitle has been around for a long time, so why don't we use that option instead of getting everyone to speak the same language? I want more reality from my films and that would be a great start.After 5 minutes this film was already better than 'Dunkirk' and it built the tension really well, whilst also showcasing a veritable feast of hotties in uniform.It was a shame that so many of the actors, that are well known to us now, only had small roles. I can only imagine that they ended up on the cutting room floor due to the running time.It is a long film, so don't go in to it if you haven't got the time to see it through, because you'd lose the fantastic momentum that it maintains, but I'd like to have seen more from Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Richard Wattis and many more.And it may be my new found appreciation for him, but somehow John Wayne still seemed to shine out brightly as THE star of the film, despite its ensemble design. Robert Mitchum was a strong character too and I could appreciate the efforts of Richard Munch as General Marcks as well. In fact there wasn't really anybody to grumble about, even Kenneth More, in his relatively small role, seemed perfectly cast and I usually can't stand him. I didn't go much on his beard though.I did feel let down by my history teachers however. Who knew that D-Day was so much more than just a beach landing? It was interesting to watch, even if it was just to see everything else that went in to the success of June 6th 1944. Although classing it as a victory, when you see all the deaths on all fronts still doesn't really feel right to me. Films like this always upset me with the stupid waste of life that war brings. I hope in 2022 that we are beyond such things and yet the news shows differently every day. I wonder when the world will grow up?Some moments of the film actually gave me goosebumps and I felt that I was landing alongside some of them, going along for the journey like my grandad used to do whenever he watched the TV and he would get right up close to the screen. He was actually there on the actual D-Day and I was ever so lucky that he returned home to be in my life.If I had to criticise it at all, I would say that it had a similar problem to 'Dunkirk' in that it was hard to tell who was who? So many of them looked alike and because the cast was so big it wasn't always easy to see which group was winning or losing what.I can't believe just how much I enjoyed this one, it's probably the highest rated war film on my list and only second to 'It's A Wonderful Life' (1946) as the top Black & White film. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in film watching, making or reviewing.It should appear on more top 100 lists. It's far better than some of the ones that I have seen.843.86/1000.",

Strangely enough, most of the comic relief comes from Sean Connery in his last pre-James Bond role.I like the fact that we got to view the German viewpoint of D-Day and the movie looked so good in black-and-white.

            "content": "This was a big movie in 1962. It was a time of big movies. Hollywood was trying to outdo television and we were the winners.I was still at school, but I remember when \"The Longest Day\" landed, we had an overload of spectacular movies: \"Ben Hur\", \"Spartacus\", \"The Alamo\", \"The Guns of Navarone\", \"Exodus\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and of course, \"Cleopatra\", which wasn't quite cooked yet, but was talked about endlessly.For those that have only ever seen them on DVD or cable, believe me, they were glorious on the 70mm screen with their overtures and a break in the middle to relieve extended bladders.However, \"The Longest Day\" was the most ambitious of them all.Look at the scale of the thing. Darryl Zanuck was a pushy little guy, but he had a vision for this movie and he made it happen, he was the Hollywood equivalent of a 5-star general. He also saved a spot in the movie for his current girlfriend, dazzling Irina Demick, representing another good reason to liberate France.It all seemed so authentic with the various nationalities speaking their own language complete with subtitles. Before that, English-speaking audiences were used to WW2 movies with everybody speaking English, often with dodgy accents \u00e0 la \"Hogan's Heroes\".Thanks to Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\", modern audiences familiar with a fair amount of arterial spray can see that \"The Longest Day\" was still adhering to the gore-free Hollywood production code.With that said though, \"The Longest Day\" still has amazing sequences, and they just kept on coming: a spectacular glider attack, a train wreck, scaling cliffs under fire, massed landings on beaches (including wider shots than Spielberg attempted) and an incredible, single-take helicopter shot of French commandos in action.The film faced the biggest challenge when the focus shifted from the spectacular to the intimate, how to avoid movie stereotypes of the GIs, Tommies and French civilians? The answer is it doesn't, but to be fair, many of the stories were straight from Cornelius Ryan's book.Composer Maurice Jarre didn't go for the tragedy and pathos of war in his score; it's a celebration of victory. One of his themes was actually based on the Morse code \"V for victory\", Da-da-da DAH!Much has happened since 1962, but this film gives a pretty good idea about what happened on the big day; you can still feel its power.",

In addition, each of the segments was shot by five different directors, including the parachuting episodes.The all-star cast includes luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Steve Forrest and Roddy McDowall. Furthermore, the opening military percussion-oriented score is superlative. The movie saves the compelling invasion of the Normandy beaches for the last act (unlike the mawkish \"Saving Private Ryan,\" which starts with it).Unfortunately, the movie loses points for the B&W photography, which is inexplicable for such an all-star early 60's blockbuster. There are also some hackneyed or awkward parts, like the scene where a ravishing French woman & her bicycle suddenly appear at the railroad tracks by two skeptical German soldiers. Why Sure! Another arguable problem is that the ambitious scope of the film prevents the story from focusing on any one group of notable characters, which make the proceedings seem like a thrilling docudrama rather than a gripping action/drama.Nonetheless, \"The Longest Day\" is a must to catch a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day on several fronts, not to mention you get to see the proverbial big picture.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours; and was shot in France.

You are able to see dialogue between soldiers that would usually be left out in Hollywood renditions of important battles.

The scenery and acting are so vivid and authentic that you'll swear that you can smell the soldiers as they run through puddles of mud. The shots and bombs are so loud and destructive that you'll jump from your seat.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war movies or historical dramas. Although this film did not have much in the way of special effects due to the fact that it was released in the early 60s, the director still manages to create an intense and action- packed movie that will give viewers the perspectives of opposing soldiers at war.",

Thanks to this you get a true sense of all the planning, men and materiel involved in the invasion, and how they all fit together. By showing the German side you also see how the enemy feels, and how wrong-footed they were.Not as realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan - such realism would never gave gotten past the 1960s censors - but such micro-detailed realism is not necessary here. The picture is more a strategic one, though you often get to see it from the eyes of average soldiers.Mostly quite accurate, but there are some mildly-annoying inaccuracies. The portrayal of 27-year old Lt Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort by the 55- year old John Wayne is probably the pick of the bunch. Once the action starts, however, the mild inaccuracies are quickly forgotten, as you immerse yourself in reliving an event of massive historical significance.In fitting with the epic nature of the movie, just about every actor in it with dialogue is a major star. About the only male superstars of the time missing are Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Orson Welles! Some of them, eg George Segal, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, have very minor parts and only have a handful of lines, but it shows just how deep the talent pool was in the cast of the movie.Stirring, incredible, epic war drama.",

The merit of this film is to tell the story of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's not to create art, or even to elicit sentiment. So to be as factual as possible, (or at least market it as such) they filmed on actual locations which are still recognizable today. A puzzling disconnect occurs in the production: John Wayne is there to 'John Wayne' things up (he plays another hard-on), trying to make it a personal story but if ever there was as story about group sacrifice, D-Day is it. This narrative problem is never successfully addressed. As with all war films the goals are so poorly explained that you don't care if the allies derail a train, or save a bridge; because although characters have talked (and talked and talked) for an hour before things get going, you still don't understand what specific goal has been achieved. It's all poorly explained.My french guide through Normandy took us through his hometown 'Ouisterham' in the film, whose distinct cliff-walled harbor is featured in the movie. This sequence begins with a long aerial tracking shot that comes down the harbor. It's one of the best sequences. It occurs nowhere near the beach. When we revert back to the beach, some time later to resume the Mitchum/Albert storyline, it actually feels out of order.The on-location filming in undermined by some of the worst rear-screen insertions I've ever seen. The actors actually cast shadows on the rearscreen. At one point about nine actors are squeezed onto a barely passable set of an aircraft carier bridge, with the sea faked in behind them. Red Buttons is here playing the same annoying sappy twerp he always does. Richard Beymer is trying to give an electrifying modern performance but he has nothing to do.The English army is constantly depicted as dorks with silly priorities. English culture used to interest me. Now I can't imagine why; it doesn't stimulate an ounce of interest.The movie never wavers from the battle narrative. This is most unfortunate as we watch maybe twenty early scenes establish, re-establish and belabor the same points. We don't get a scene of the army greeted as liberators, so as far as prestige pix go it's pretty chilly.Sean Connery shows up and spews some indecipherable lines. Three single-named stars (Arletty, Fabian, somebody else) are in the movie along with anyone who passed through Hollywood in 1956 in possession of a penis (Paul Anka, Ricard Beymer, Jeff Hunter, Sal Mineo, Robert Mitchum, Eddie Albert, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Peter Lawford, Henry Fonda, Edmund O'Brien, George Segal, rod Steiger, Tom Tryon, Robert Wagner) & Roddy MacDowell (whom I would argue could not possibly have had a penis).Graphic deisgn. I really can't understand why graphic design has achieved the reputation it has. Here \"The Longest Day\" is spelled out with long letters, literalizing the stupidest aspect a weak-minded designer could muster.The end theme doesn't help the tone. It's a peppy whistling march that gives way to an asinine chorus, as if to say don't think about the gravitas of this heavy topic, just go out and think pretty thoughts.",

Supervised by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by multiple directors, the movie unfolds like a docudrama and is a 3- hour epic that remains compelling for the majority of its runtime.By allowing the British, American & German directors to handle segments of their own nationality, Zanuch is able to provide the film a much-needed impartiality, and even manages to evoke some sympathy from all the three parties. One can tell the extensive amount of research that went into its production, for some scenes that seemed too far-fetched to be true are surprisingly factual.A major portion of the movie is devoted to the wait, analysis & preparation of the Allied invasion, and Germans' response to prevent it from succeeding instead of the gruesome battle that unfolded on the Normandy beaches. Some moments are disturbing & upsetting, others brim with suspenseful vibes, and few even manage to squeeze in little laughter. All in all, it's a superbly executed effort.Its grand scope is reflected by the massive extras & huge ensemble that show up on the screen, and everyone play their part rather well, except John Wayne who's a tad too full of himself here. Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Sean Connery & many more notable actors show up here n there but their presence never becomes bigger than the story itself, plus the roles they are assigned are cameos anyway.On an overall scale, The Longest Day is a comprehensively researched, brilliantly directed, deftly written, crisply photographed, patiently edited, thumpingly scored & finely performed account of one of the most memorable events that occurred during the Second World War, and is brought to cinematic life in a concise, controlled & calculated manner. One of the best examples of its genre that still carries elements of surprise, The Longest Day lives up to its legacy in splendid fashion.",

            "content": "The epic war movie to end all epic war movies, The Longest Day is producer Darryl F. Zanuck's salute to those involved in the Invasion of Normandy. It's a riveting film that recreates the events leading up to D-Day for the Americans, the British, the French, and the Germans. It's told in great detail with more historical accuracy than is usual for a movie based on real people and events (then or now). It helps that it was filmed on location in many of the real places and used military consultants, both Allied and Axis, who had actually been involved in D-Day. The cast features many big names such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, and so many others it'd take the whole review just to list them. I can honestly say that, despite the huge cast, every actor involved does solid work. No one was phoning it in or hamming it up in this one. The special effects and beautiful black & white cinematography both deservedly won Oscars. It's a remarkable film that holds up very well after all these years and stands as the premier war movie of its kind. One of the last great WWII movies made by people who lived through it, the greatest generation.",

            "content": "What is there to say about 20th Century Fox and its legendary and cantankerous studio chief Darryl Zanuck's monstrous 1962 World War II epic THE LONGEST DAY that hasn't already been said? Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich. And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people, including plenty of their own, to their deaths. At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present. On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused: John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Fabian, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others. All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large; as such, the gravity of the situation was enough to unite everybody. Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come.",

This ensemble movie is a classic and inspiring story of D-Day.  It successfully conveys the fog of war.  It also shows that the most carefully planned battle still must rely on rapid improvisation. The production values are outstanding and as I write this comment, I feel myself on the Orne River Bridge with the British Glider forces and hear the bagpipes in the distance which means Lord Lovat and the commandos are near by to relive the company of glider-troops who must \"Hold the Bridge, until Relieved.\" Private Ryan was the war on the level of the patrol, The longest day included the Invasion of Normandy from the individual service man to the memebers of the High Command on both sides.",

            "content": "The allied landing in Normandy is almost certainly the moment, in the whole World War II, that was most often taken to the cinema. There are, therefore, a lot of films about it. Some are better, others worse. This is one of the most epic, one of the most expensive and one of the best.I'm not going to waste time explaining what the D Day was because 95% of the people who are going to read this review know what happened there, and the few who still don't know, I advise, should do some reading about it before taking this film. This is because the film does not waste time on explanations either. The script, written by Cornelius Ryan, has serious problems: it is quite clear that the whole effort was focused on reporting, very meticulously and rigorously (as far as I was able to see) the landing and its previous arrangements. One thing I really liked was to see several nationalities and military forces that, alongside the British and Americans, also take part of D-Day: the Scots, the Irish, the free French (I miss the Canadians)... but everything that goes beyond the landing report, and which is also part of a good movie script, has been undervalued: the construction of the characters was limited to a series of sketches, when they are not caricatures, the dialogues are clich\u00e9 or sound absurd and, moreover, the film has no story to tell that goes beyond the war story. It is the epic \"documentary film\" of war, at its best.Another problem with the film is that its a nest of highly regarded movie stars who practically limit themselves to appearing and saying something. It is eye-catching for the audience, and the camera work tried to echo that with frontal shots from that stars, but it sucks for the plot because we are seeing the actor So-and-so, not the character he plays. Among the actors that appear in the film we can mention Eddie Albert, Paul Hartmann, Robert Ryan, Curd J\u00fcrgens, George Segal, Richard Burton, Hans Christian Blech. I especially liked the work of Henry Fonda, as the Teddy Roosevelt's son, eager to honor his father's name and memory, and to see Sean Connery, still quite unknown (the first 007 film premiered in the same year as this one) playing the role of a simple Scottish soldier, with touches of British humor. John Wayne is good, but he always seemed to me like a very theatrical actor and his characters sound artificial.Despite all this, this film had the full commitment of its directors, who through it wanted to honor the men who fought that day, winners and losers. That is meritorious. The film has excellent cinematography and an exceptional film and camera work, worthy of the Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography, which won that year. The special, visual and sound effects that were used are also really well done and look great (Best Special Effects it was another Oscar that this film collected). The film has great sets and costumes and an excellent post-production work, where the commitment of all involved is perfectly felt. There is no scene or sequence that seems to be over, or out of place. The film is long, in fact, it is three hours in length, but if the audience gets carried away it will not be a problem.Technically extraordinary, this film makes a remarkable account of the military events it portrays. But the flaws in the script, the poor construction of characters and dialogues, the constant parade of famous actors with nothing to do hurt the final product.",

            "content": "\"The Longest Day\" is a small miracle of a movie. Despite being directed by a handful of different men, it manages to be more coherent and more consistent in tone across its considerable running time than many films directed by a single person. This is not an episodic film in the sense that each director gets his own moment to shine before handing another section of the movie over to someone else; no, all of the variously directed segments are interwoven into a seamless narrative about the events leading up to and taking place on the day of the American invasion of Normandy during WWII.Released in 1962 and produced by an artist of the old school, Darryl F. Zanuck, \"The Longest Day\" sits somewhere between the patriotic WWII films of the 1940s and 50s, to a greater or lesser degree all propaganda films, and those of the 1970s and 80s, which would downplay the heroism of war and instead focus on its barbarity and its toll, physical and mental, on those who fight them. This film leans much more toward the former, but it does dip its toes in the water of the latter by including a couple of moments that ask us to reflect on the sheer horror of what it must have been like to see combat during the World War. Of course, compared to a film like \"Saving Private Ryan,\" its version of the Normandy beach landing looks quaint, but taken as a whole this film is better than Spielberg's, because it rejects the maudlin and sentimental story around which Spielberg anchored his film and replaces it with a much more objective, journalistic style. The film looks jaw-droppingly amazing, a marvel of sheer physical scale. If this were made today, CGI effects would do at least a half of what real actors and physical locations do in this film.The film stars everybody and his mother. OK, so actually it doesn't feature anyone's mother, since only one role in the movie out of hundreds, that of a French resistance fighter, is played by a female. But it's a who's who of male talent, some of them -- John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Richard Burton -- already superstars when the film was released, and others -- Sean Connery, George Segal, Rod Steiger -- about to become so.But the real star of \"The Longest Day\" is Samuel E. Beetley, the film's editor. This is a movie entirely made in the editing room, and it's one of the best examples of the art form ever committed to screen. Beetley was rightfully nominated for an Oscar nomination, but had the misfortune of seeing his work go up against that other little movie from 1962, \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" which won just about every technical award it could. That would have been a tough choice, but I'm not so sure that, much as I love \"Lawrence\" and think it's overall by far the better film, I wouldn't have given Beetley his due.The film did win Oscars for its black and white cinematography (thankfully \"Lawrence\" was in color) and its special effects. In addition to editing, it received nominations for Best Picture and Best Art Direction (B&W), which is also phenomenal.Oscar trivia: \"The Longest Day\" was one of three films in 1962 (the other two being \"The Music Man\" and \"Mutiny on the Bounty\") that managed to be nominated for Best Picture without receiving nominations for directing, acting, or writing, the only time that's ever happened in a year with only five Best Picture nominees.Grade: A",

Hitler slept soundly, unaware of the brutal weight now bearing down on Germany.This film is one to watch, as it opens up a great swathe of WWII history, and inspires one to learn more about those days. The film watches almost like a novel, in chapters, and skipping around different POVs German, American, French. Yes it is a \"victory march\", but it was 1961 when it was filmed. The US had emerged as a great new power in the world and they wanted to celebrate. There ARE German viewpoints written and filmed about these events that one can track down that DO tell a different story, but that doesn't mean this one is not as accurate as they could make it at the time. Popular history, as they say, is indeed written by the victors.A great book to read, that in a strange way complements this film, is Stephen E Ambrose's \"Pegasus Bridge\". It's a remarkably exciting and well written account of the British glider assault depicted, from memory, about 40 minutes into the film, that began just after midnight on June 6.This film is an entertaining and enthralling 2 and a half hours well spent. On this day I think I'll put on the Longest Day, and raise a glass to all those, but especially those young British guys who, at ages younger than myself, volunteered to be the first to touch ground in Fortress Europe. I can only begin to imagine their bravery.",

The film in comparison to say Saving Private Ryan is not a single layered narrative, unnecessarily emotional or utterly ignorant that other countries other than America actually participated, it even notes that Britain were in the war before America!!!! Perhaps this film does not have the special effects that Private Ryan does have (to its credit)but this aside it certainly makes up for it in every other area. The sheer fact that this was the most expensive black and white movie until Schindler's list is testament to that. The advisers on this film were actually there and helped draw the plans themselves, yes it is a drama, but when considering history please don't disregard fact for the want of a better plot (Spielberg) If you like war movies then this is the king of the genre, if you have never seen a war movies or dislike them, this may just about change your mind.

The movie goes into interesting detail on the planning, strategy and decisions that went into the battle not only from the American's side but Germany and occasionally other countries. It was fascinating to hear the behind the scenes thinking from various high ranking officials for how and why certain decisions were made. As the film enters the battles, it reminds me of A Thin Red Line as you get a peek into a complete assortment of scenarios from big to small and the emotional perspectives of those involved; from a paratrooper stuck high up on a bell tower to residents of a cottage in the battle zone to German officials afraid to awaken a sleeping Hitler. The pacing was stellar as this is a 3 hour war epic shot in rich black & white, thus their approach of including an assortment of scenes shot with stunning cinematography (won Oscar for cinematography) helped this epic feel lightweight. Sean Connery even makes an appearance as a jovial soldier with his James Bond smirk. Getting warmed up for Dr. No as he starred in that immediately after.

It had the feel of a civil war re-enactment rather than an intense battle.  I'm not saying we need gratuitous gore, but to really show the battle, we need to see guys wrenching in agony and more bodies on the beach.  We are given the impression that the invasion was not a messy affair.  I think this does a disservice to the people who were there.  Now the good things.  The movie pays quite a bit of attention to historical detail, from the German commanders who were at odds with the furher to the French resistance and even the 'crickets' the airborne troops carried.

The British and Americans devised plans of great complexity, involving vast amounts of men and materiel. It was a guessing game where they would land and when. An element of surprise was achieved when the first allied forces appeared off Normandy--where they were not expected--on the tail of relentless rain, through fog banks over choppy waters.But the initial stages of the attack occurred during the previous night, when allied paratroopers descended over the French countryside. \"The Longest Day\" does a good job of showing the confusion and mishaps that resulted from the night invasion. And it provides a glimpse into the unintended and accidental nature of war. The effectiveness of the invasion was affected by red tape, egos, poor communications, bad planning and mistakes--just like all wars.Though the film contains some factual errors, it does a good job (for its time) of conveying the true nature of armed conflict, where lives are often lost or saved simply due to chance.A large all-star cast and thousands of extras make this film noteworthy. Four directors under the direction of Darryl F. Zanuck were used to achieve balance in the film by serving the American, British and French interests in the story.For a more graphic representation of that beach invasion, see Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\". But \"The Longest Day\" is a fine film, especially for its time. The ending includes minimal moralizing and some good summarizing, but it feels like a sequel was envisioned. A television miniseries would certainly be welcomed if it could follow the stories of various participants on all sides of the conflict as this film does.",

It charts \u2013 predominantly \u2013 the 8th June (or 'D-Day' to most of us) when the Allies finally stormed their forces into France to liberate it from German rule, but the first part (of the film's near three-hour runtime) tells the story of the events leading up to the fateful day itself.The film is generally an 'ensemble' with multiple actors appearing for \u2013 in some cases \u2013 quite brief periods of time. However, due to the general talent of the actors, that never really feels like a problem. Yes, I'm sure that any of them could have had an entire film made just about them, telling their individual story, but we have to make do with their minor performances. It's hard to pick a 'stand-out' performance as they're all so good.Apparently, according to some who have lived through the day itself, the film isn't always factually accurate (and even a former President of America apparently left a showing due to technical inaccuracies). However, even if some creative liberties have been taken, it still gives a no-nonsense feel of what the troops had to go through when entering the French beaches and countryside for the first time.Due to the film's length, there's even time to fit in some scenes with the Germans themselves. It's important to see what was happening on the 'other side' as it relates specifically to how the Allies managed to pull of the (overall) victory.Of course it is black and white, so for those who find it unable to watch anything that isn't designed for 3D and/or IMAX will find it hard to take! The Longest Day may seem a little dated by today's standard, but, if you're a fan of war films, or are even just interested in what went on during World War II, then you should definitely check this one out.",

I found that to be rather interesting because I wasn't aware of that.  It also said that he consented to do the part but the reason he didn't get it is that the make-up artists couldn't make him up to look like his same young self in 1944.  I find this rather hard to understand because, to me anyway, he didn't look that much different in the early 60s when the movie was made than he did in the mid 40s!  Oh well, at least the guy they had portray him, Henry Grace, was a dead ringer for the former supreme commander!",

This movie was well done but again places the Canadian accomplishment of the day not only on the back burner but still in the fridge. My father was in the Canadian Air Force and served in England during the war. As typical Hollywood so often portrays Canada in WW2, the movie devoted about 1 minute to the Canadian participation on D-Day. Canada landed over 15,000 men on Juno Beach and achieved most of their 1st day objectives, they actually pushed the furthest inland of any of the 5 beaches.

I find the subject fascinating.I saw this movie a very long time ago, I must have been a kid. I have just seen it with my wife, hoping to help her put some order in all the things she has seen in Normandy.I was sadly shocked to see such poor acting and above all, extremely terrible directing for the English and American scenes and \"just\" bad directing for the German ones.Other films from the same period and older portray battle scenes and the soldier soul with far superior credibility.I can imagine the directors telling the poor actors \"look towards the horizon with dignified face\" and other rubbish of that sort. No attention to logic, coherent acting or historical research. This resulted in empty, soulless characters.It was really hard not to turn the film off. The stupid comical acting in the middle of a battle made my whole body cringe. Why did they need to invent things like paratrooper John Steele hanging for 10 hours and being deafened by the church bells? That is not true and looked stupid! He was shot in the foot BEFORE landing, he was hanging there for ONLY 2 hours until taken prisoner by the Germans to be liberated by the 82nd and 101st Airborne. And he was not deaf for hours or days, he even said that the tension and the pain in his foot did not allow him to hear the bells. In the town of Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise you can read all about this. Do not rely on the internet because sadly it mostly considers the scenes on the film as historical facts.And why did the actor play him as if he was a silly clown? I guess the directors thought that they needed some comedy in the movie in order to keep people entertained.If they paid 1/4 million $ in 1962! to John Wayne to appear and ruin the movie, they could have used a small fraction of that sum on historical research or a proper director.A positive note is that the Germans spoke German amongst themselves, and not English with German accent, which sounds imbecilic. The same applies to the other languages, although they are all very stereotyped.Quoting freely from \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942) what this movie has done to Cornelius Ryan's book is what the Germans did to Poland.",

            "content": "A great film but as an historical record, majorly flawed. It perpetuates the myth that the British and Canadian involvement in D-Day was minimal. Nothing could be further from the truth.Strategic plans for the Normandy landings were conceived and developed by the British under the auspices of Lieut. General Frederick Morgan. His ingenious plans included the building of the floating Mulberry harbours and the construction of underwater oil pipelines between Britain and France.The Supreme Allied Commander was indeed an American, General Eisenhower; but he had never fired a shot in anger, and all the allied forces on the ground (including the Americans) were under the overall command of the British General Montgomery who expanded General Morgan's initial plans. The Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Arthur Tedder, was British. The Allied Air Commander in chief, Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, was also British; as was the Allied Naval Commander in Chief, Bertram Ramsay.On D-Day, British Empire forces (largely British and Canadian) put 75,215 troops ashore over three separate landings; the Americans, 57,500 over two. To these figures should be added 8.500 British and Canadian paratroopers (who achieved all their objectives); and 13,100 American.Overall, there were nearly 7,000 vessels involved, and of the 1,213 warships taking an active part in the assault, 892 were British. The Royal and Merchant navies provided 137,824 personnel; the Americans, 52,889. Of the 4,126 landing craft involved 3,261 were British; 805 were American.In addition to providing its own supplies, the British provided the Americans with nearly one-third of theirs.\n.\nOn D-Day 11,590 allied aircraft took part in operations; almost half of these (5,656) were flown by the RAF. In addition, 1,800 RAF personnel were landed on D-Day (swelling to 3,500 by 9th June). They and over 800 vehicles were used for airfield construction and the servicing of allied aircraft.Bletchley Park's input was also hugely significant; they had broken the latest German Enigma codes some six weeks before the invasion. MI 5 had not been idle either: all German agents working in the U.K. had been captured before D-Day and many of them turned, so the Germans were receiving false information about allied intentions. The entirely fictitious \"First United States Army Group\" was (apart from its name) the concept of British colonel David Strangeways, the head of Montgomery's R Force deception unit. This \"Army\" under the supposed command of General Patton was designed to mislead the Germans into believing the allies assault would take place around Calais.The American contribution to D-Day was indisputably substantial; but it was certainly no greater than the British and Canadian. It's a pity the film does not accurately reflect this.",

Viewed in 2008 for the first time, courtesy of TV, it's equally reasonable to assume that the majority of the above are no longer with us and/or around 90 years old which means that the film or rather TV)is now targeting a younger audience, one on whom it can't hope to have the same impact. It is, of course, virtually impossible to chronicle accurately everything that occurred on that momentous day but on the whole Cornelius Ryan, who adapted his own book for the screen, has probably done as well as anyone. Because I'm somewhat familiar with the subject via novels like Nevil Shute's Requiem For A Wren I missed the 'feel' of the build-up to the day which Shute captures so well in a novel in which D-Day itself is only peripheral, inasmuch as we enter the action more or less on June 5th but I realise that other viewers will not necessarily share this opinion. Rather bizarrely the necessarily large canvas negates the feeling of a collective effort and there's a danger that some viewers will empathise with one or a group of characters who never appear again. As a great admirer of French films/actors I was delighted to glimpse such luminaries as Arletty, Madeleine Renaud, Bourvil etc even in blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos and I'm sure that Hollywood/UK buffs will feel the same about the likes of Eddie O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Harry Fowler, etc. On the whole I doubt if it could have been done better as an overall picture of a vital moment in wartime.",

            "review_title": "Zanuck invades Europe",
            "content": "\"No matter what political reasons are given for war, the underlying reason is always economic.\" - A. Taylor Before Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" collected all WW2 clich\u00e9s and dressed them up in money, shaky-cam and faux black and white cinematography, producer and movie mogul Darryl F. Zanuck did the same with \"The Longest Day\", an expensive mega-production which hoped to capture the \"spectacle, horror and sacrifice of Allied soldiers\" during WW2 and D-Day.Younger audiences raised on kill-a-second video games and indoctrinated in \"Private Ryan's\" sexy shaky-cam carnage will no doubt find Zanuck's production tame (\"Where's the blood, man? I want more squibs!\"), but virtually every sequence in \"Private Ryan\" is done here equally well, and at times better, though Zanuck's agenda is ultimately the same as Spielberg's: a celebration of movie technology, spectacle, action and glamour in the guise of deceitful notions of \"humanism\", \"brotherhood\", \"humanity\", \"heroism\", \"honour\", \"sacrifice\", \"pride\" and \"country\". And as Zanuck's films runs for almost 3 hours, scenes you've seen in other old B or A list WW2 movies pop up as well.Though \"The Longest Day\" was directed by over five directors, its real auteur is Zanuck and so it manages to maintain a consistent tone and voice throughout. Most of it is aestheticized slaughter, though, war lovingly recreated, documentary style, for no reason other than to recreate, faithfully, war, documentary style. The idea here is that the images speak for themselves, but of course this is never the end result. It's less salacious and exploitative than \"Ryan\", but the ultimate effect is the same. And so we smile as a haggard John Wayne (draft dodger and armchair war-hawk) kills Germans and squirm as a brave Robert Mitchum guns his way up a beach. Sean Connery and Richard Burton's square jaws makes us proud, Henry Fonda's gentleness touches our hearts and we marvel at scene after scene of exciting, righteous murder, in which wrong-footed Germans (the film even makes a point about their shoes being on their wrong feet) are lovingly perforated. People die? Yeah, but we're dodging bullets by proxy, baby. Meanwhile, the truths of world wars 1 and 2 are brushed aside, thinking is admonished, myths and cosy iconography are reheated, and all history, nuances, complexity, ambiguities, politics and context are ignored.Still, some of the film's moments are haunting. Zanuck's smoke shrouded cliffs and beaches are ghostly, haunting even, shots of corpses hanging from parachutes stuck in trees achieve a kind of macabre surrealism, and one long helicopter take into Ouistreham, in which a disembodied camera tracks a platoon as it guns its way across a river, over a bridge, into a town and then up a building, is special, echoing the floating cameras of Jancso's \"The Red and the White\" and Rosselini's \"Garibaldi\". There are other good moments, like one in which a group of nuns glide serenely through a gun fight, the nightmarish burning of St Mere Eglise, the film's overall look of grey, concrete and cement, and Zanuck's protracted beach landing (contrary to \"Private Ryan\", the landings weren't frenetic blood baths; the beaches were too big, forces separate and progress slow). The film's final shot, a helmet on a beach, would be re-textured with the final shot of Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\", a germinating coconut on a beach, death sprouting life. The sheer scope and scale of Zanuck's film is also overwhelming (his battlefield sets are spectacularly expansive, but not as turgidly so as other epics), and the film's production design is impressive. Again though, it's all technique.Ironically, \"The Longest Day\" was part of a group of war films released between 1965 and 1977 (\"A Bridge Too Far\", \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\", \"The Battle of Britain\", \"Battle of the Bulge\", \"Cross of Iron\", \"Patton\", \"633 Squadron\" etc) which promised to broaden the scope of previous war films by focusing on as wide a cross section of the military as possible. In these films, generals, soldiers, sergeants, medics, lieutenants, Army personnel, Navy personnel, Airforce personnel, nurses, doctors, civilians etc, all came together in a kind of narrative cocktail, the entire military body working together to achieve some goal.Unlike the platoon genre, these \"heirarchal films\" thus aimed to portray war on a far larger canvas. They promised to offer audiences the \"spectacle of history\", viewers being granted a nuts and bolts recreation of some historical event in which the entire hierarchy of the military machine took part.Significantly, the event being recreated often revolved around some grand disaster: Pearl Harbour being attacked, Britain being blitzed, D-day going awry, the German advance in the Battle of the Bulge etc. These are all films in which noble Allies bravely fight against all odds (against an overwhelming, savage, superior foe), only to eventually emerge with a kind of bittersweet victory. These films thus display contempt and reverence in equal measure.The last film in this cycle was \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), by which time audiences were tired of WW2. At this point a series of cathartic Vietnam films were realised, culminating in the angry sermons of \"Rambo\" and \"Platoon\". But covertly, all these films succumb to the Cult of the Military. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must be periodically sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the state, to whom we should therefore be devoted, obedient, unquestioning and grateful. Of course Zanuck's films were often propagandistic, from his Bible movies, to his Lincolm movie to his \"The House of Rothschild's\". He'd turn his hands to Pearl Harbour later.7.9/10 - Simple war porn with impressive choreography, vast sets and careful set design. Worth one viewing.",

To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience. Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.) Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time. If you can't find a favorite, then you are just not looking hard enough. A superb war film.",

John Wayne is excellent as a tough 82nd Airborne officer, Kenneth More puts on a brilliant turn as a stiff upper lip British officer on the Normandy beach with his bulldog for company, and Richard Burton is on top form as an injured RAF officer( \" the few are getting fewer\"). Also Sean Connery appears as a private and Gert Frobe, later to play opposite Connery in Goldfinger, plays a German soldier who is one of the first to spot the Allied invasion.What I do like about The Longest Day is the authenticity. The Germans are played by real Germans speaking in their own language, not Americans affecting bad German accents, and some are shown as quite human, realising that they are losing the war, and not blind Nazis Also amid all the fighting, the civilians sometimes appear, in one scene a group of nuns who refuse to go indoors, and others coming out to cheer on the Allies, again true to life.Another thing I like is while Hollywood had mostly gone over to colour by 1962, The Longest Day was filmed in black and white. This was to reflect the newsreel films of D Day, which were in black and white, and to add to the documentary style.Only criticism I have of The Longest Day is a few of the guest stars are below par, the singer Paul Anka is weak, but otherwise this is an excellent war film and a great way to pass an afternoon.",

This 3-hour, widescreen retelling of D-Day stars a huge roster of then-stars like Robert Ryan, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum plus a quite-young and unknown Sean Connery. Not a drop of blood is spilled, and soldiers who are shot fall theatrically. We spend as much time in the company of the Germans as we do the Allies, which wears thin after awhile, and there are probably 2,000 extras in this early '60s epic. The special effects look pretty bad today, but I assume they were pretty impressive in their time. Minimal documentary footage is included, which is a blessing. The film is in pristine B&W, which gives it a greater sense of reality but will cost it many potential viewers. There are moments where the viewer will feel drawn into the action, particularly in the French commando siege of a hotel held by the Nazis. Some passing nuns give this incredibly tense scene a touch of whimsy. In its own, creaky and ham-handed way, THE LONGEST DAY is superior to RYAN, in that it holds one's attention the whole way through. RYAN falls apart once it leaves the beach.

At that time nobody in Germany would have raised a voice to put up a brave front. I read a lot about D-day and I visited the historic sites and find that the film shows the major lines about the day, but not really more, because even the details are not for real. The average soldier is anonymous besides the \u0084big shots\" (double meaning) . Well, you have to stay with the victors to have an idea about the purpose of it all. The movie was expensive and filled up with many stars of the time, but is it good? The answer is no as for a historical accuracy. The representation of the German side is simple and incorrect, as if it would not mater at all what was going on on this side. It is shown the invasion from the viewpoint of the Allies. Therefore it is one sided. In retroperspective of a winner there is a lot that is stereotyped. The Longest Day suffers from the \"Hollywood\" treatment of historical events. Some characters are obviously composites; Richard Burton's Flight Officer David Campbell and Eddie Albert's Col. Newton are nowhere to be seen in Ryan's original book, while others (Jeff Hunter's doomed Sgt. Fuller) are clearly fictitious.There are also some unexplainable errors, such as having American paratroopers jumping from British Lancaster bombers, showing how close they worked together as only brethren can do. Again nobody cares. In most parts the film is just a spectacle of no significance, a rowing of episodes, patriotic, heroic \u0096 the reality was different. No heroism at all, but the accomplishment of desperation on both sides. I heard original reports of participiants from both sides. They know what happened. This movie shows not much of it.

            "content": "This movie does a great job of bringing such a massive logistical operation down to the individual level in several of the major components - paratroopers, infantry storming ashore, naval personnel on the ships, the generals trying to plan it all, etc etc.Some have criticized it for not being explicit enough in the violence and others who say that it tried to do too much at once. I'd like to point out that this movie was released in 1962. That was only 18 years after the actual invasion. Hence, the audience knew the horrors of war - they'd lived thru it. If they didn't actually serve in combat, they sure knew men who did, maybe even knew one or two who died in combat. Hence, they didn't need to be shown all the gore that was shown in \"Saving Private Ryan\" cause they knew it far too well.As far as the scope of the movie, one must realize the depth of the operation the movie tried to overview. To do that, the movie had to be long. To give each component of that massive scope a human element, yet provide insight into what it was like for the individuals involved, the movie had to be long and it had to involve numerous subplots to even come close to being representative.And, here we are 73 years on from the actual event the movie portrays and this great flick STILL draws a great following. I'd say all of that makes it a 10/10.",

Imagine what something like that would cost today. What a great scene with Red Buttons stuck on the church tower while his whole squad mistakenly parachutes into a heavily fortified town. The comparisons to \"Saving Private Ryan\" don't hold up for two reasons. One is the technical and societal ability to present gore for entertainment. Also, \"SPR\" is a leftist anti-war film, so emphasizing the gore and mayhem suited Spielberg's purpose, while in this film, while the death is not minimized, (see the scene mentioned above) the purpose is to celebrate heroism, as well as provide some history in an entertaining fashion.",

            "review_title": "A thrilling and engrossing epic war film",
            "content": "A largely historically accurate account of D-Day, one of the most important single days of the 20th Century, this is a thrilling and engrossing epic war film of a kind which is sadly not made anymore. Based on the 1959 book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan, it is a stirring tribute to the resourcefulness and bravery of the Allied strategists and combatants who ensured that Operation Overlord was a success. While it only covers the events leading up to the invasion and those of June 6, 1944 itself as to opposed to the rest of the campaign, there is a sense of \"a lot done, more to do\" as the film draws to a close. The film may be over but the war certainly isn't.The film benefits from a very strong script and is extremely well directed by all concerned in both the quieter character scenes and the wonderfully shot battle scenes. In spite of its multiple directors, the tone of the film is very consistent and, had I not known already from my previous viewing, I would assumed that there had only been one director. The fact that all of the German and French characters speak their own languages rather than English also gives the film a great sense of authenticity. The film is extremely well paced and there was not a minute where I was bored. On the Allied side, D-Day was chiefly depicted from the British and American perspectives but I did like that there was an acknowledgement of some of the other forces involved such as the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish. Still, they could have done more with it.There is a terrific sense of tension in the early scenes in which the Allied Forces are waiting to receive the word from General Eisenhower to launch the invasion in spite of the worst weather in the English Channel in 20 years. Eventually, it is decided to give the order as the conditions were unlikely to improve any time soon. There was talk of Eisenhower playing himself in the film but it was decided that he looked too old. The same was true of David Niven. I can't say that I'd really have cared in either case! The prelude to the invasion is also examined from the German perspective with Field Marshals Erwin Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt, played very well by Werner Hinz and Paul Hartmann respectively, being dismissive of the prospects of invasion due to the poor weather conditions and are consequently caught unawares when it does come. On the German side, the strongest response to the invasion comes from Generals Max Pemsel and G\u00fcnther Blumentritt, both of whom served as consultants on the film as did Frau Rommel, among others. They were also lucky enough to be played by the two best German actors in the film: Wolfgang Preiss and Curd J\u00fcrgens. Preiss later played von Rundstedt himself in \"A Bridge Too Far\", incidentally.The film has a very big cast which reads like a \"Who's Who\" of 1960s male film stars and almost all of them get a chance to shine. Richard Burton has a great cameo as the RAF pilot David Campbell, distraught at the death of the only other remaining member of his squadron from the Battle of Britain. He later turns up towards the end of the film after being shot down the previous night. Richard Beymer plays a cocky young private named Dutch Schultz who wins $2,500 gambling as he is waiting to be deployed. However, he has the reality of the situation brought home when he receives rosary beads from his mother. Cast against type, Red Buttons is excellent as Private John Steele, who was trapped on the church tower of Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise after his parachute became caught. Robert Mitchum has one of the more substantial roles in terms of screen time as General Norman Cota and gives a great performance as a general who cares about all of the men under his command. Henry Fonda, my favourite actor in the film, has a smaller role as General Teddy Roosevelt, Jr., who lead his troops onto Utah Beach in spite of his severe arthritis and died of a heart attack the following month. Jeffrey Hunter is very good as Sgt. (later Lt.) John H. Fuller, who does not survive the day sadly.At 55, John Wayne, who probably had the biggest role overall, was twice as old as his character Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort was on D-Day but he is nevertheless more suited to the role than he was to that of Genghis Khan in \"The Conqueror\", the last film that I saw him in. He was certainly not a very good actor but he had a likable screen presence in most of his films and this one was no different. That said, the anguish on his face when he sees the bodies of parachutists who were shot down while attempting to land in Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise was the best acting that I have ever seen from him. In a case of art imitating life, D-Day veteran Richard Todd plays his erstwhile superior officer Major John Howard and took part in the assault on Pegasus Bridge as he did in reality. Other than those actors that I have already mentioned, I was impressed by Richard M\u00fcnch as General Ernst Marcks (who turned 53 on D-Day but did not have a great birthday), Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Hans Christian Blech, Peter van Eyck, Roddy McDowall, Mel Ferrer, Rod Steiger, Edmond O'Brien, Kenneth More, Peter Lawford, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, Georges Wilson, Andr\u00e9 Bourvil and Irina Demick, who has the best role of any woman in the film as the French Resistance member Janine Boitard.Overall, this is an excellent war film which was deservedly nominated for Best Picture. It may not be on quite the same level as its companion piece \"A Bridge Too Far\" but it's not far behind either.",

            "content": "THE LONGEST DAY is an expensive World War II epic that leaves you with the feeling that you know what D-day, the 6th of June was really like for American soldiers. On the other hand, it leaves you with the feeling that somewhere around the bend another great movie star or film personality is about to make another appearance.It's this disparity between truth and Hollywoodized fiction that struggles constantly to win your attention as you watch what is actually a very realistic depiction of what it must have been like during that fateful day when America lost so many of its splendid soldiers on the field of battle.It's a film that opts for realism, whether it's telling the story from the American point of view or the German--never sugarcoating any of the sequences but presenting the fateful day in an almost documentary fashion with the kind of realism and attention to detail that is awe inspiring.Suffice it to say that all of the names fit perfectly into the scheme of things, never giving the impression that the director chose them at random for star value. Whether English, German or French, all of the roles are beautifully played.With the Fuhrer having taken a \"sleeping pill\", the German commanders realize they are losing the war. Unfortunately, it's such an epic film that it doesn't give you a chance to identify with any of the characters to the extent that you can care what becomes of them. That, indeed, is the film's major flaw.Truthfully, while all of the invasion sequences are extremely well staged for maximum effect, what's distracting is when the viewer's attention strays from the story upon seeing name players pop up unexpectedly in the midst of explosive action. Just a few of the names come readily to mind: JOHN WAYNE, PETER LAWFORD, RODDY McDOWELL, SEAN CONNERY, ROBERT MITCHUM, RED BUTTONS, HENRY FONDA, ROBERT RYAN, ROD STEIGER, RICHARD BEYMER and others. Fox seemed intent on using just about every male star in the business to fill the huge number of speaking roles.Summing up: If World War II war films about D-Day, the 6th of June, are of interest to you, THE LONGEST DAY, from a novel by Cornelius Ryan, is an essential, not to be missed, in all of its B&W glory.",

In addition to it, the intelligent department, weather forecast department and underground fighting force were described well enough in this movie.

It's not hard to see why it was such a box office winner, sure it's a touch too long given that a lot of characters don't really have much to do, but performances are strong and the slices of humour off set some of the national stereotypes on show.One has to marvel at the ambition of the production, Fox Studios boss Darryl F.

Narrative is split into three parts, the preparation, the operations on land and sea in readiness for the Normandy assault, and then the landings in all their powerful glory.

Five directors helmed the sprawling action scenes, with Andrew Marton directing the American scenes, Ken Annakin handling the British scenes, and Bernhard Wicki lensing the German scenes. Most of what happens occurs in vignettes that feature a major star. The paratrooper scenes are incredible, especially when Red Button is trapped atop of a bell tower while his fellow jumpers landed in a square and were picked off by the Germans like fish in a barrel. The black & white cinematography adds an element of authenticity, and the whistling theme is classic. Interestingly enough, the Twentieth Century Fox logo with the searchlights is never shown in this film. Just as interestingly, despite all the participants of the actual battle who served as advisors, former top commanding general Dwight Eisenhower walked out of the film because so many technical errors were committed. \"The Longest Day\" opens with the Allies mobilizing for the cross Channel invasion and keeping an eye on the weather. Reluctantly, Ike (Henry Grace) decides to commit the Allies to a landing during stormy weather. Essentially, the Allies caught the Germans sleeping and battered their way through enemy lines. The Allies dropped in dummies that activated and created noise designed to detract from the appearance of real soldiers. The dialogue is memorable, too.",

Strange, isn'it?\nAnd I think it would need a remake, because the book written by Cornelius Ryan is one thousand times more interesting than the however excellent film, the feature that re invent the war movie, brought it to a higher scale. In the book, you have millions of details, awesome details and elements which could not be put in the movie.

The soldiers there had the sense to merely whistle \"Colonel Bogie's March,\" NOT prattle insipid lyrics glossing over unspeakable war-time agonies. Most of the spoken dialogue in THE LONGEST DAY sounds so contrived, pompous, and written 15 years after-the-fact that it seems probable that some of the dimmer bulbs in the cast--such as self-admitted potheads John Wayne and Robert Mitchum--were allowed to ad lib their own lines. With at least 60 speaking parts, most characters (including Henry Fonda's doomed American President's son) get lost in the shuffle, and virtually none merit a movie watcher's attention (no matter how Heroic their Real Life counterparts). If Hitler had had an opportunity to watch this three-hour snooze-fest, he would not have needed to take a sleeping pill in order to nod off! Producer Darryl F. Zanuck apparently was too dense to realize that having FIVE directors on your flick is nothing to crow about. If he wanted to be honest about something, he might have advertised that THE LONGEST DAY was mostly his effort to make his latest mistress--Irina Demich--a movie star, so that he could reap the perks that might come with her gratitude.

I see it as the ultimate dumb blonde ww2 film, which I have suffered again in the build-up to Christmas 2008. Now, I have lived in the USA and have a very small idea of how they think (at least in the Midwest). I quite accept that they may love this film anywhere in the United States, especially with their armies in Afganistan and Iraq. Hollywood is the US film industry and playing at home to the US public. Europeans have no such loyalty to any film industry outside each of their own countries.My real problem with this film is with the screenplay. You cannot argue that the money and stars were not thrown at it - and that is a major problem. Every name had to get it's 5 minutes on air and the money was there to allow it. Monosyllabic German is subtitled (bar Curd J\u00fcrgens). I reserve my harshest complaint for those do believe that this film has a grain of truth about it. Cornelius Ryan seems to have given the dumbest situations possible to stage the action scenes. There are literally dozens of examples of layered stupidity. Nuns roaming through the beaches unharmed. Bagpipers marching from inland to the beaches (and being cursed for being Irish!) undisturbed by the shells falling within their ranks. Then you have the time for American GIs to respond to the slow witted Germans. This brings up the problem of the cast.No stars were included from outside Hollywood. Only the Dutch actors were previously unknown to American audiences. This allows lazy acceptance of the stereotype norms - em, for who? Well, in this case, the American audience. So the Yanks were all John Wayne wannabees, the Brits all Trevor Howard wannabees (even Sean Connery and Richard Burton). The Germans were irrelevant as this is an American victory film. I have no problem admitting that the Allies could not have won the war without the US. It is something Europe will always owe the USA....but that is a separate topic. This film is a celebration of those 'Palinesque' Americans who believe all the dumb stereotypical images of Europe and their peoples. The stars had to take part, or be noted for not being. No depth of character was asked for nor given. No actors or situations were challenging. No questions were asked or answered. Steven Spielberg and others have done wonderful ww2 films, from all the countries involved. This is a very poorly made, expensive, film which did nothing for the career of any actor taking part. I hope I am allowed to hold these views without negating my liking for my time working in the United States, England and Germany.",

Most of these individual stories are compelling as are the performances, but the sum of the parts ends up a bit too disjointed.

Every time this film comes on, I find myself flipping through my battered paperback copy of the book, especially at the point where Private Schultz decides he needs to lose the $2,500 he won at craps. That actually happened, though there is no mention of him having suffered any serious injuries during training.Probably the most glaring deviation from the book is that the final breakout from Omaha Beach wasn't as dramatic as was portrayed in the film. Those who survived fought their way off that beach inch by bloody inch. It is true that General Cota was very inspirational to his men in the 29th Infantry Division as he tried to move his men off the beach. I was pleased that some of the more minor 'idiosycracies', like Lord Lovat having his personal piper with him, were accurately portrayed, as well as the incident when Lovat's commandos relieved Major Howard's Paratroopers at 'Pegasus Bridge.' That incident was retold fairly accurately, although I'm not so sure about the exchange of words between Pvt. Flanagan and the other Irish soldier, regarding the way Bill Millin played the bagpipes. It did strike me as classic British humor in a time of stress.By the way, one error on this page that might be cleared up. Pips Priller's Luftwaffe 'buddy' and wingman, the one who complained about 'not being able to get any sleep', was no major. He's Flight Sergeant Heinz Wodarcyck, Priller's regular wingman on the staff flight of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wing) twenty-six. Also, Priller's final official score was 101, not the 130-some-odd mentioned in the movie. He survived the war, so it's entirely possible that some of those kills occurred after D-Day. Wodarcyck was killed in Operation Bodeplatte, a major strike coordinated with the Battle of the Bulge, intended to wipe out the U.S. 9th Air Force, and maybe the British 2nd Air Force, on the ground in Belgium.

And yet what struck me for a film written and directed by the winners is how dispassionate it is.As if it embodied the spirit of that fine generation of young men who didn't even feel they were doing something noble, the directors just tried to get the job done. That it's a team of relatively unknown names is a fitting coincidence for \"The Longest Day\" is certainly the triumph of a collective effort that didn't need the additional value of a household name. Patriotic undertones in the form of triumphant fanfares are reduced to the minimum, and deaths aren't treated like emotional momentums, except for some memorable bits such as the wiping on the paratroopers who landed near Sainte-Mere-Eglise church, a scene shot through the shocked and teary POV of Red Buttons whose life hung with his canopy on a providential gargoyle.I was even surprised by the absence of a monologue about the necessity to triumph over evil, which would have been perfectly suitable for any audience. In fact, the Overlord operation is treated a decisive set of tactical moves, and a logistic nightmare for both sides. What is more remarkable is that these aspects are treated from each of the Allies and German side. The film actually opens with all the preparations set by the Germans under the commandment of Erwin Rommel and before the first notes of the \"Fifth Symphony\" ominously resonate, the Desert Fox guarantees that the Allies will land somewhere in the North coast of France, that's for the mathematical certainty. And whether they pierce the Atlantic wall or not will be the move that will make or break the war.Whatever happens that day is unknown but that day for sure will be the longest. Eisenhower certainly thought the same, he who had a special speech ready in case of failure.The first major obstacle is the weather: would the Ally land on June during one of the worst springs in decades after having stalled for a more merciful May? The Germans didn't believe it precisely because he held Eisenhower in high regards, but there are times where common sense and emergency don't pair up very well. The weather prospects were low but just as the American troops moral after so many weeks of stalling under the British climate... occasional glimpses on the French and British perspective allow us to remember that Europeans have been 'there' for two extra years. The landing was itching everyone and was the talk in every platoon and maybe the Allies should be grateful that the absence of sun kept soldiers on guard.Regarding the portrayal of the Germans, it's interesting that the film doesn't treat them through the prism of their evil ideology but like an army with its own ordeals and that is so remote from the tumultuous headquarters it tries to act rationally. And by being so miraculously detached, if not neutral, as far as warfare is concerned, \"The Longest Day\" actually highlights the military prowesses and turns out to be one of the few war movies that has something to say about war, on a pure educational level. The D-Day wasn't just about crossing a beach but holding positions the night before and like in a game of chess, luring the enemy into the wrong anticipations. If the Germans in the blockha\u00fcses didn't open their eyes wide at the sight of the Allies' fleet, then the mission would fail.And apart from that unmistakable little tune from Maurice Jarre, music is scarcely used, never to enhance the spectacularity of the action. The film in its monochromatic format is a meticulous recollection of every single operation as so many tiny pieces of a puzzle that form the 'big picture' of the D-Day. And so we learn about the little \"click\" signal, the Ruperts, the codes for the Resistance, from obscure mentions of one's mustache to a Verlaine's poem... and in a sort of self-referential prose, we have a Nazi officer who promptly states that they will lose the war because the Fu\u00ebrher is not to be awakened. Which made me realize that this Day didn't wait for the passing of years' hindsight to raise awareness on its historical magnitude. Eisenhower's name could have lived in infamy...And it is indeed a long day that starts in the middle of night and concludes with a cigar-chomping Mitchum,. But no star ever outshines the other, they're all like little lead soldiers disposed in the right place and right moment, sometimes at the wrong ones, for more tragic effects... but still far from the carnage a certain movie from a certain director about a certain private to save... released 36 years.At that time, fewer directors were even born during the war and as a mark of gratitude, the new generation felt the need to remind us the deadly price of victory. More emotions, more heart-pounding tension, more patriotism, more spectacle... but somehow I prefer the straight-to-the-point approach of \"The Longest Day\".",

This ensemble movie is a classic and inspiring story of D-Day.  It successfully conveys the fog of war.  It also shows that the most carefully planned battle still must rely on rapid improvisation. The production values are outstanding and as I write this comment, I feel myself on the Orne River Bridge with the British Glider forces and hear the bagpipes in the distance which means Lord Lovat and the commandos are near by to relive the company of glider-troops who must \"Hold the Bridge, until Relieved.\" Private Ryan was the war on the level of the patrol, The longest day included the Invasion of Normandy from the individual service man to the members of the High Command on both sides.",

Coming at about 3 hours this film is very long and with a gigantic number of characters. I really liked this film, it's portrait of the many forces that played an important role in the D day and the all together epic proportions of this film. I also really liked the cinematography, the beach landings have some amazing and beautiful shots. The acting is good but maybe due to the giant amount of characters it feels like no one (not even the big names) gives any amazing performance. I personaly think the film is a little too long but it wasn't painful to sit trough it. Finaly I absolutely loved how the film showed so many perspesctives, the american and british forces, the french forces returning to fight for their country, the german point of view and I espeacily loved the scenes with the french resistance. There were parts of the movie that really put me off though, like in the beginning the shot of a german talking with the sea behind him but then he sudently disapears and reapears back in the same place a few moments later.\nOverall this film isn't perfect or anything but it is still very worth watching and it's still probably one of the best D day movie ever made\n8.6/10",

            "content": "A film at the height ?Longest Day is an black and white film which tells the events of D-Day during the Second World War. This film realized in 1962, is an adaptation of the homonymous book of Cornelius Ryan.This War film is co-directed by few directors: the English producer Ken Annakin who was charged to film the Britissh and French Exteriors, Andrews Marton(famous for Ben Hur) for the American side and Bernhard Wicki for the German episodes.This film was also famous for his amazing casting of actors; we can recognize the well-known John Wayne, Robert Ryan, Richard Burton, the unforgettable Clint Eastwood, the French actor Bourvil. So the film is very attractive for fans (and it's a pleasure to look our favorites icons!) and a colossal amount of cash was used since the budget of the film overtakes the 10 millions of Dollars! The Longest Day is even on of first blockbuster in the story of movies.This giant production tells during nearly three hours the episode of the Normandy Landing, the 6 June 1944. He was cut in different point of views, with mains and secondary characters. Unfortunately, the spectators can be lost although these richest perspectives, and the different camps and place of the film. But we can notice a positive point: each actor played in his own language. For example, the French actor Bourvil spoke in French, his native language. So, it gives a certain authenticity in the dialogue especially. The amazing performs of the casting bring the efficiency when the actors play faithfully their historical role. For example, we can salute Red Buttons in the role of John Steel(The parachutist who was hanging in the bell tower); he took inspiration thanks to the testimony of the real John Steel.But, outside this good point we can notice in many reviews the clich\u00e9 side of the French Underground or the Germans authority voluntarily ( or involuntarily!)parodied like the scene with the Geman who was wearing his boots upside down. Maybe to give a little irony in the war... I don't know. However this moment of comedy which lighten the dramatic tension of the film.We can although congratulated the place of film which were faithful to the historical reality ( Remember-us the famous village of Sainte-M\u00e8re-l'Eglise in France), but we can also notice a gap: the scene of the Landing was turned in the beaches of Corse because the landscape stayed natural contrarily to the beaches of Normandy. Fortunately, the amazing aerial shot, (we have the impression to fly over the beach!), and the short scene of dialogue are lively with the face to face of the character. For example, when the soldier who is lost met an injured soldier who contemplate the corpse of the upside-down-boots German are speaking about the real sense of the life. I find this scene sums up the film: philosophers are speaking as for the uselessness of this war.During the film, we can hear the fabulous music of Beethoven which the movement follows perfectly the script of the film. We can congratulate this choice mixed with drums which accentuate the tension and the imminence of the fight. The film begins of the image of a helmet on the beach and it closes on the same, like this war was useless...with the same music.A negative point: the special effects. They are not bad for the time but the smoke, the explosions and just near a soldier in life...( always in a single piece!)This film received two Oscars and it tells the war with excellent techniques , excellent actors and an excellent screenplay, but for the used budget we expected for it not less...",

Battles make ear blasting use of machine guns, cannons, planes, battleships, rifles, grenades, cannons, tanks and gattling guns. The many battle scenes which show soldiers pouring out of small boats and onto different beaches while being shot and bombed at are truly breathtaking.The theme music is brilliant and the film is beautifully produced by Darryl F Zanuck and perfectly written for the cinema by James Jones, Romain Gary, Cornelius Ryan, David Pursall and Jack Seddon. The direction should be an example to all film makers today and the film was stunningly directed by no more than six directors, Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald, Darryl F Zanuck and John Wayne.

            "content": "I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was a boy which was the only time I have seen it on the big screen. It of course is the story of Decision Day better known as D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the allied invasion of Normany setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the end of the war in Europe 10 months later. 2,700 ships carrying 176,000 soldiers land on the heavily fortified German controlled beaches of Normandy. Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered. In recent years Steven Spielberg chronicled the event in his film Saving Private Ryan. In that film you are put directly into the battle and it's graphic depiction. That film couldn't have been made in 1962 before Vietnam. This film, The Longest Day is more of the overall telling of the day. German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century. From that quote author Cornelius Ryan titled his best selling 1959 book from which this film is adapted from. Told in three parts, The Waiting as they prepare the invasion, The Night as the allies prepare it's launch and the Germans prepare their defense and The Day of the invasion. Ryan drafted the screenplay along with Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddan. It took an equal amount of cinematographers to film it led by Jean Bourgin and Walter Wattiz the all-French photographic team included Pierre Levant, Henri Persin and Guy Tabary which won them the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in the last black and white epic filmed. The film won a second Academy Award for special effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. This film was producer Darryl F. Zannuck's pet project and he claimed to have directed much of it although uncredited in that role he obviously oversaw it's production and it's use of multiple directors to have so many directors turn out a seamless production. Principal directors Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton are supplemented with director Bernard Wicki and second unit directors Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams in addition to six assistant directors. Shot in 31 locations in France and Corsica including studio locations everything about this movie is on a grand scale. So much so it required four production managers. Among it voluminous international cast of A and B-list stars are John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Edmund O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Mel Ferrer, Sean Connery, Stuart Whitman, Eddie Albert, Robert Walker, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, Peter Lawford, George Segal, Sal Mineo, Christian Marquand, Richard Dawson, Curd Jurgens, Jean Louis-Barrault, Werner Hinz, Wolfgang Preiss, Lee Strassberg, Jeffery Hunter, Steve Forrest, Richard Todd, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Tommy Sands and Fabian. More isn't necessarily better but in this case it's pretty good. It runs long at three hours and has it's flaws but well worth the time and some memorable screen moments.",

With four directors, five writers, and forty-two billed international stars, this is an unforgettable movie, and one that used its many stars to their full advantage.The 1960's were loaded with epics where directors took every big name star on the market and thrust them into a role. It may seem like that's what was done here, but in fact, the casting was excellent, and no one looked out of place, especially the lead actors John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Henry Fonda.There is also an amazing supporting cast, with actors from America, Britain, France, and Germany, which represented the four countries involved in the D-Day Invasion of Normandy. It takes a whole paragraph just listing their names: Eddie Albert, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Peter Lawford, Roddy McDowell, Sal Mineo, Kenneth More, Robert Ryan, George Segal, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, and Stuart Whitman. Singers Paul Anka and Fabian also made appearances as American soldiers. The cast of Germans and French include Hans Christian Blech, Richard Munch, Bourvil, Werner Heinz, and Wolfgang Preiss.Ken Annakin shot the British scenes, Andrew Marton shot the American scenes, and Bernhard Wicki shot the German ones. Darryl F. Zanuck produced the film and is often credited as a fourth director.What was really special about this film was the fact that the characters from their respective countries spoke their native language, and subtitles were used on-screen. This was very rarely done by Hollywood back then, and films involving foreign characters were still shot in English, with the vernacular to be assumed by the audience.\nThe famous opening shot from \"The Longest Day\".The special effects are also top notch, and the battles scenes and cinematography were worth the Oscars they won. There are may distance shots of the battles scenes, with so much going on and this added to the realism of the movie.Even with so many stars, this film really does not belong to anyone in particular. Wayne and Mitchum's scenes were brief and spread out evenly throughout the course of the movie. Meanwhile, Henry Fonda recieved less time on screen than any of the top-billed stars.It's truly amazing to finish this movie and see the end credits role and see so many names whose faces you did not recognize. There are so many small scenes and cameos all around, that it could almost be made into a game with whoever you are watching this film with, to try and name who is on screen.This film would work really well as a compliment to Saving Private Ryan, which is considered the definitive D-Day movie, despite it being only one scene at the beginning. Watching The Longest Day before watching that will help you to understand what went behind the largest invasion in modern warfare history. That's why this movie is so great, because it is not just one big battle, but lots of dialogue explaining every mission involved, no matter how menial.I will make my final rating a 9 out of 10, because I am still impressed at the special effects and star power every time I sit down to watch it.",

            "content": "Unlike subsequent films that depicted war as hell, Darryl Zanuck's spectacular epic \"The Longest Day\" emphasizes the courage, heroism, and raw guts required to wage battle. Admittedly made about the last non-controversial war in which the United States was involved, Zanuck's film downplays the brutal realism of more recent war movies and focuses on the broad vistas of thousands of soldiers storming the Normandy Beaches on June 6, 1944. Employing dozens of well-known actors in small parts, \"The Longest Day\" effectively utilizes the cameo approach to help viewers keep track of characters in the complex cutting between scenes that depict American, British, and German military personnel both on and off the battlefield. While a cast of unknowns would have enhanced the otherwise documentary-style approach, the audience would have been lost as to who was who. Among the large cast, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, no strangers to war film heroics, register strongest, although Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Edmund O'Brien, Jeffrey Hunter, and Richard Beymer are also memorable. The bevy of rock and roll stars that includes Fabian and Paul Anka will be unrecognizable to younger viewers and illustrates the dangers of casting those with fleeting fame in a movie intended to be seen over the decades. Only one actress, Irina Demick, appears among the otherwise entirely male cast. Her credibility, however, as a French resistance fighter is severely undercut by her carefully applied makeup and perfectly coiffed hair.The stunning black and white cinematography creates bold and beautiful images of the battle, which was filmed on the beaches where it took place. One incredible uncut helicopter shot follows a platoon down the streets of a French town, around the harbor, and into an encounter with another platoon on the other side of the town. The logistics of setting up the shot must have been awesome in the days before CGI. Although three directors were used, evidently producer Zanuck was the guiding force, and the result is a seamless film with few blunders. Unfortunately, the screenplay at times relies on expository dialog to identify characters or to set up a scene, and occasionally an obvious attempt at \"meaning\" creeps into such lines as \"I wonder who won?\" The stirring march penned by Paul Anka may be too up-tempo and enthusiastic to underscore the depiction of a day when thousands died, but the music does emphasize the producer's intent to celebrate a great victory. However, the addition of insipid lyrics over the closing credits goes too far in trivializing a weighty subject. Nevertheless, \"The Longest Day\" remains a fine tribute to the men who fought on D-Day and does a credible job of remaining faithful to the facts without embellishing them with the kind of fanciful fiction that marred another filmed depiction of the battle.",

But really, it's essentially a different movie.  \"Ryan\" wasn't really about D-Day.  It was about a small group of soldiers in battle--it was rather comparable to \"Midnight Clear\" with Ethan Hawke, or \"The Victors\" with George Hamilton.  Not that it's a bad movie, of course, Ryan was imaginitive, and intense, but it simply can't compare to this incredible production. The Longest Day gave great context, the issues and questions.  It established the reasons, the strategy and tactics, and in some cases, the utter foolishness.  Nothing here seems to go right for the AMericans and British, or the French for that matter.  And I think the criticism about lacking in reality are utterly misplaced: I could just smell the fear of Red Buttons as he's dangling on the church, or the utterly exhausted and petrified Richard Beymer. Or the frustration of George Segal after his men die pointlessly.  (Small spoiler here) When Jeff Hunter is killed, it's rather effective.  John Wayne is often thought to be a rather wooden actor, nothing could be the further from the truth; his bitter rage when coming across his dead soldiers hanging from the poles is trenchant, and one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.  I think he can communicate more feeling and emotion in one look than many actors can in a soliloqy.  There's a reason he's the center of this movie--because there aren't many actors of his stature. \nPerhaps another asset here is that the producers avoided making the Germans into cartoon villains.  They are some of the most impressive characters--actual human beings.  They're caught up in the same situation as the allies, and are doing what they feel is right and honorable.  And they don't use silly German accents to approximate speaking German, they just use subtitles--something directors who don't underestimate the intelligence of an audience do.If there is a flaw here it's that we aren't really given enough of each actor--there being so many.  They're not really given an opportunity to flesh out the people caught up in the storm.  For the destructiveness of war on a grand scale, this is a wonderful movie.  No, it's not the most deeply effecting when it comes to the human destruction--see \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" for that.",

The film plays like a chess match as we see D-Day from the perspective of the Germans, English, Americans and French (both Army and resistance) with different directors doing their own segments. The biggest surprise is that at no time does the film feel like different directors were involved.I thought the glorified cameos would be a bit much in the film, but it turns out it works a great deal in it's favor. You get an instant attachment to certain characters and care what happens with limited time devoted to them which is good, because despite it being three hours long, the film doesn't have time to waste on character development.It works though. How do we make sure the audience notices Brig. Gen. Norman Cota when he's introduced in a five minute scene and then remember him when he shows up again 2 hours later? Put Robert Mitchum in the role. How do we make sure the audience is suddenly invested in what happens to Pvt. Flanagan when we see him for the first time storming the beaches of Normandy? Cast Sean Connery in the role. Ect and so forth.The various moving parts coming together with amazing star power to back it up would be enough to make this a great movie, but it also has some jaw dropping amazing shots. Practical shots you do not see in films today without them being CGI'd to hell.Also one of the most surprising elements of the film is that despite it being this grand epic, completely worthy of that moniker, the film makers decided to go with a small understated ending... which was PERFECT. Loved it.",

            "content": "One lesson I have learned a bit late is that one has to be fair and considerate while evaluating 'old' movies. Such movies were made in a era which was probably way different than we have ever experienced, or we can ever contemplate.First of all, the makers of the film deserve an applause for their ambition and execution of a film that tries to cover an unprecedented event like the D-Day.I took an instant liking to the movie since it lacks the overly dramatic and loud depiction of wars/battles. The restlessness and other practical problems caused when millions of soldiers are assembled, the uncertainties, the challenges when several leaders from various countries are working together and so on are highlighted. They have given adequate footage to the various events in right chronological order(airborne landings, the French Resistance in action, the beach landings). I was quite happy to view the scenes that showed the funny, tragic incidents e.g: a paratrooper landing in the lawn of German high command residence and sarcastically apologizing, another falling in the well, a slaughter that ensues when a bunch of paratroopers land near a church in middle of a village. The Atlantikwall, the confusion in the OKH, the conflicting command structure, the unpardonable mistake of not unleashing the Panzer divisions, and Luftwaffe's unavailability were touched upon. Overall, I found the approach and rendering quite professional (for many, it is more of a documentary than a movie but that's an absolutely ridiculous assessment!). When I later read about the movie, I discovered that many actual participants of the D-Day were the military consultants and actors for the movie.The potential flaw in this, as well as many other B&W epic films, is casting actors who were way older than the characters. The action(if any!) of Allied air force, the paratroopers holding their positions overnight, aren't covered. Having said that, it's a 3-hour movie and one must not expect it to have everything one expects!A sheer classic of the WW-II league!",

Operation Overlord is frequently associated with Eisenhower as he was the architect of the invasion and during that time he sent fake intelligence to the Germans to trick them about the invasion. The movie also talks about the American soldiers behind the scenes such as Col. Benjamin Vandervoort (John Wayne), Brig. Gen. Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum), Brig. Gen. James m. Gavin (Robert Ryan), Col. Thompson (Eddie Albert), as well as the son of Theodore Roosevelt (Henry Fonda) who was a Brigadier General. The film also tells its story from the British and German perspective with precision and marvelous detail and perfectionism thanks to the direction by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, and Berhnard Wicki who directed one of each of the episodes of this movie on such an excellent level. The performances are also excellent and impressive with actors from different parts of the world, and an excellent supporting cast including Richard Burton as British flying officer David Campbell, and along with Mitchum, Fonda, Ryan, and Albert, there is also people like Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Jeffery Hunter, Paul Anka, and especially a young Sean Connery who doesn't have that many scenes but makes it count with the amount of screen time he has. Feature films aren't known for accuracy when they're telling real life stories but documentaries are the only ones that are which doesn't bring this movie down one bit. The writing is superb, the performances are top notch,and every person involved made it into a masterpiece that ranks among the best military movies ever made such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), \"The Great Escape\" (1963), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), as well as many others. This is an essential movie that is required viewing for history students who are studying World War II in their respective classes, and it is one of the most patriotic movies i've ever seen, as well as being one of 1962's finest films.",

I have to say that across the board it's badly done. I imagine tackling a multi-national, multi-lingual epic is a tough job but everything about it smacks of being done on the cheap. Bad direction that looks like old staged television shows. God-awful editing of picture and sound. One segment of a German officer obviously standing in front of a green-screen beach comes immediately to mind. The officer just sort of appears and disappears from the foreground as the beach stays exactly the same. The sound of the film is very thin. Almost minimal use of sound efx. Main characters have conversations in the foreground with battalions in the background preparing for battle and all you hear is the dialogue. It really looks like they ran out of money while finishing this film. The black and white photography doesn't age well with this film either. Very washed-out looking film And the acting and direction are very wooden. Viewing this film is like watching paint dry or better yet a slide show on the D-Day invasion.",

I know it did well when it first came out... it was nominated for 5 Oscars I believe.The acting was good by everyone... there is a very impressive cast list for this movie. I loved the actors in this film and am happy to have seen them all in one movie. The film stars far too many people to list, but the big names are... Richard Burton, Sean Connery, John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Phillips, George Segal, Rod Steiger & Robert Wagner. Very impressive.The actual fighting scenes were pretty good, but being a war movie, that was pretty much it. There were a few parts of the movie that I thought were great... I loved the idea of them dropping little fake soldiers out of planes just to distract the Germans so they could attack from behind. There were also other parts that I really liked.The film is on for so long too... the movie goes on for 3 hours, and it definitely felt like it.I will give this film 4 out of 10.I do understand why this is a classic, but it is not for me i'm afraid.

            "content": "\"The Longest Day\" is unquestionably a product of self-important Hollywood bloat, but it is also a noble attempt to do justice to one of then-recent history's most singular moments, the Normandy landings of June 1944. For the price of sitting through clumsy expository dialogue, misplaced comedy, and thumb-in-your-eye cameos, you get some terrific cinema and a decent war story.As an opening title tells us, its the fifth year of the German occupation of France, and on both sides of the English Channel, warriors await the inevitable clash of arms. RAF pilot David Campbell (Richard Burton) notes ruefully he is now the last member of his squadron still left from the Battle of Britain. American paratrooper \"Dutch\" Schultz (Richard Beymer) decides if the landing is on tonight, he'll gamble away his sizable winnings and \"jump clean.\" An unnamed German officer sleeps comfortably in a French farmhouse, his boots off and carelessly arranged.Much later in the movie, the three men will be found together in a scene that summarizes the film's philosophy at its most pungent: War confirms our universal brotherhood, even with those we kill.Little moments like that are sprinkled throughout \"The Longest Day\". Every now and again, you get something more sustained. There's an attack by Free French commandoes at a casino in Ouistreham that sustains a bird's-eye view of the running battle for far longer than any other film I've ever seen, overall by far the best sequence in the movie. The British glider troop assault on Pegasus Bridge comes off effectively by being played in real time, while a botched U.S. parachute drop on a German-occupied village makes for a harrowing sequence.But \"The Longest Day\" has its share of misfires; too. A lot of times in the movie, we are taken to a meeting room somewhere so the directors can tell you what is happening. The huge all-star cast is about a few stars too many, either unnecessary (Henry Fonda, Eddie Albert, Rod Steiger) or playing themselves instead of their characters (John Wayne, Red Buttons). By the time the beaches are hit, the film is two-thirds over, and a lot is skimped, especially the most effective of the D-Day landings, the Canadian assault at Juno Beach.But the overall quality of \"The Longest Day\" is high, reflecting its big budget as well as a passion for telling the story. Even more than its three sure-handed directors (Brit Ken Annakin, naturalized American Andrew Marton, and German war vet Bernhard Wicki) and numerous screenwriters (including James Jones and Cornelius Ryan, who wrote the book upon which this is based), you have a masterful editing job by Samuel E. Beetley, which sustains the film's galloping pace by keeping less important scenes to the barest minimum. Few films are as long as \"The Longest Day\", but many feel longer. Too bad for Beetley he was up against \"Lawrence Of Arabia\"'s Anne V. Coates come Oscar-time; any other year he would have won.It's not a great film otherwise, but it manages to hold up more than not, leading up to that winning wistful moment when Beymer, Burton, and the German come together. \"He's dead...I'm crippled...You're lost. I suppose it's always like that. I mean war.\"",

This and Saving Private Ryan are the genre leaders for this historical event and therefore comparisons between the two are inevitable.The Longest Day is like a diluted version of Saving Private Ryan - you get a lot more but much less strength. Where Private Ryan chooses to dissect the real effects of war on the individual, this movie shows as many aspects of D-Day as possible to provide a complete, unbiased view of the events (we see the war as viewed from the outside rather than the inside). For example, I think the scale of the D-Day invasion is realised in Longest Day, but not in Private Ryan, where I found the opening sequence harrowing but somewhat like a small commando attack rather than the largest invasion ever staged.\nA great piece of cinema but, like most war movies of the day, fails to communicate what war was REALLY like.",

            "content": "I saw this movie at the cinema when I was a kid, and on the big screen is seemed to just blow everyone away. We got to see the war from what at least looked like every angle, with a cast that included just about everybody who was anybody. It was long, sumptuous, involved and sometimes confusing. But it was also epic and definitive. Or so things seemed back then.But I got the DVD cheap last week, not having seen it for a while, and gave it a watch. Now; I have to admit that I've joined the nay-sayers. I've awarded it 7 stars because it does still provide a decent run for your money, and one should take the movie's vintage into account. However; it no longer appears to be the epic I once thought.Today, editing comes over as rather fragmented. A lot of little vignettes of ordinary servicemen don't really move the story along. I'm thinking of the guy who makes a fortune at dice and then believes his winnings might betoken bad luck. We know such things may happen, yet its detailed inclusion was irrelevant especially at the expense of true events. There's a guy telling a boring personal tale to someone he has never met, or there are the needlessly vociferous arguments with the Luftwaffe pilots, and so on. Pluskat's dog had the good sense to scram before the shooting started (in times of war follow your pet's instincts!). The big issues needed to be addressed before we spent time with all this minutiae. Yet the cut and cut again from one senior military figure to another presumed an almost encyclopedic knowledge on the part of the viewer. Often these people were seen just once or twice, and again it contributed to a fragmentary appearance.It's obvious that a lot of money, thought and effort went into this movie's making, but watching it today, some production values have an almost made-for-TV appearance. That may be a measure of how production values as a whole have risen over the years. The thunder-flash grenades and fire-cracker ordnance explosions especially on the beach just don't measure up nowadays. 'Saving Private Ryan' has raised the bar too high. We also saw no sign of the 'funnies' - ingeniously adapted tanks - that were such a boon to the British assault, but which were scorned by the American high-command with dreadful consequences. The amazing 'Mulberry Docks' also deserved at least a look-in, even though they didn't actually arrive in France on the first day. They were an essential part of the preparation. Some mention was also deserving of the elaborate effort to conceal the military build-up. All of this was part of the British effort, and shamefully omitted. I think a remake, employing far greater use of special effects with good-quality CGI, and a much more coherent (and honest) overview is called for. The first half at least should be dedicated to the tremendous preparations - rather like 'The Dam Busters'. Though whether or not such a stellar cast could ever again be assembled to play the leads seems highly unlikely. Worse still, an update will be made by a Hollywood that is even more Anglophobic than that of the 1960's and would probably be shown from an exclusively American stand-point. It could even include a scene in which Yanks present us with the 'Enigma' machine which they captured for us in 'U571'. Ahem.I still regard 'Dunkirk' as the superior movie. And not because that was an all-British (or perhaps Anglo-French) success/debacle.",

I should have known better, because I know how AMC handles their product, but it was late at night and nothing else was on the tube but infomercials.The channel showed this widescreen film pan-and-scan, which is an abomination, first and foremost. Then, secondly, they interrupt the film for a commercial break every 5 to 7 minutes! Agghh! I will grant that the commercial breaks were not that long (2-4 minutes), but, when dealing with a film that is 3 hours long, and has such an epic scope, these frequent interruptions become trying pretty quickly. These frequent interruptions are less irksome when AMC shows Hollywood fluff like action films or comedies (anything with Eddie Murphy comes to mind), which, also, are much shorter, but with an intense, long, epic film like this, they rise to the level of maddening soon enough.I have to say, I stuck with the film since I was over an hour into it and wanted to see it through to the end, but I did so through clenched teeth, and finally went to bed in the wee hours.The film itself is pretty great. Yes, in a way, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN has trumped its beach landing scenario with film-making that seems both more realistic and more modern. But this was state-of-the-art epic Hollywood craftsmanship in 1962, and the subject befits this sweeping, epic approach. Such an amazing topic that the idea of not delving into the characters' personal lives, thoughts or dreams, is an appropriate one in this case. I'm not a John Wayne fan at all, but okay, he's not seen here too much (nobody is) and he does a decent enough job. What I did object to was stunt casting of musicians Paul Anka and Fabian, even if they too had brief roles. They're not so good.Overall, I recommend this film, but get it on DVD, do not watch it on AMC.",

It is brilliantly pieced together by three plus directors covering the German, French, English and British points of view. It has an all-star cast of anyone who was anything in 1962, the year it was made. Told in brilliant documentary style, it begins in occupied Europe focusing on the French Resistance and the Germans obtaining secret D-Day plans. Then we see the Allies in England planning, organizing and preparing for the Invasion, many already on board ships awaiting for the go-ahead. The weather plays a role in itchy anticipation. Everyone awaits the 'word' from Ike (Gen. Eisenhower). Soon the action begins with unbelievably memorable scenes i.e. the German seeing the entire Allied fleet out the window of his bunker; parachutists landing in the middle of the German occupied town of St. Mere Iglise; a patrol of Germans and Americans passing each other in the dark unaware of each other; a glider landing smack in front of a German foxhole and it goes on from there and never gets boring or bogged down.

            "content": "Three directors, Ken Annakin (Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), Andrew Marton (Thin Red Line (1964) and Bernhard Wicki (Morituri (1965), combined their directing skills for this detailed depiction of the D-day invasion. The three directors' resumes are not as great as you would think, but when they combined their skills together for this epic, they made an incredible film. Based on Cornelius Ryan's book, who also wrote the screenplay, this film gathers a stellar, all-star cast, headlined by John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. The combined strengths of the filmmakers, actors and crew, created a major motion picture, that is a delight to see. The film depicts many moments of the battle, that many audience members may not know about. They headline the importance of the para-trooper attacks inland, as being just as important as the invasion itself, on the beaches of Normandy.By the time the 1960s had rolled around, black and white film was still being used as an acceptable alternative to color film. However, it was quite clear, that black and white film was entering into its twilight years. By the mid-1970s, color film was king and black and white film was considered part of the old, classic, Hollywood style of movies. Getting back to the 1960s, being as, the end of WW2 was approaching the 20 year mark, many filmmakers decided to still use black and white film for war pictures. Black and white film gave the movie, that old-style look. Film was also still being used for consumer home movies. Video was still almost 20 years away, so your consumer brand home movies were all still being shot on film too. Being as the new medium of television was broadcasting the Vietnam War in color, all across America, the choice to use black and white helped enhance the nostalgic, old-school depiction of your \"grandfather's war\", just like your old home movies did. It was an excellent choice shooting this film in black and white. Director Otto Preminger would do it three years later in the WW2 film, In Harm's Way (1965), which interestingly enough, is another John Wayne war movie.The Longest Day (1962), has some of the most incredible WW2 action scenes ever shot in a movie. They would set up these brilliantly, choreographed, panning shots of fights going on between soldiers, bombs exploding, chaos everywhere, while trucking the camera along for blocks and blocks through these old French towns (yes, it was shot in France). The film explores the wide-screen space beautifully. It is the stuff of legends when talking about this movie. When you watch this movie, one of the most enjoyable parts of it is seeing how many of the actors you can name, that pop up in the film. I am not going to go through any of that. It would ruin the fun for others who haven't seen the film yet. The attention to detail in the film is evident. They even have testimonial and creative consultations from the German's who fought on that day. It definitely is a film, that needs to be seen, plus its impact on back and white film came to the forefront in 1962 and wouldn't be in the limelight again, until Steven Spielberg used it for Schindler's List (1993), 30 years later.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

            "review_title": "It's SUPPOSED To Be In Black And White!!",
            "content": "Opening with a shot of an upturned helmet on a beach, The Longest Day drops us straight into the middle of a dizzyingly complex series of events; quick scenes involving a number of high ranking officers of many nationalities whizzing past us. This is a gathering of stories that combine to paint the big picture of what happened on the 6th June. And this in itself is the movies great strength. It allows us to see the many faces of this historic day, without focusing on one group of soldiers overly much.In doing so this movie also gives us such massive scope. We are constantly reminded of the sheer scale of what was involved as if reminding us that yes, this really happened and yes, it was very, very big. This sense of scale is continued with some amazingly shot scenes of battle. One of my favourite is when the remnants of the once great Luftwaffa make a strafe on the troops on one of the Normandy beaches. We see two actual working Messerschmitts fly over 3,000 extras, as well as vehicles and equipment. Another extraordinary scene is when the Free French commandos attack Ouistreham. It is a sweeping helicopter shot that starts tight in and then just moves out, once again showing the sheer scale of the production and, indeed, hinting at the scale of the war itself. The word breathtaking does not even begin to cover it.Yet amongst all of this grandeur the moments of intimacy are not lost. Richard Burtons jaded pilot is a particularly interesting character. The lone survivor of his original squadron and now shot down over Normandy, he finds himself finally having to deal with death face to face: his former melancholy mood becoming one of introspection. Earlier we see two American soldiers talking on a troop carrier. They're discussing how one of them has received a divorce request from his wife, how he does love her and that he wants to do the best he can for her, his friend doing his best to advise and comfort him. It's not until later, when he's gone, that we realise that the two had never even met before.Another way of helping us understand the vastness of the events happening around us is to let us view it through the eyes of the common soldier. This is best typified by the characters of Flanagan (Sean Connery) and Clough (Norman Rossington), their commentary of what is happening about them reminiscent of the best traditions of Shakespeare.Something that this movie gets across so well is just how lucky the Allied invasion was. It seems that their best weapon was the lumbering German bureaucracy and their inability to believe that the Allies are actually invading. Even 2 hours and ten minutes into the movie Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt (Paul Hartman) cannot truly believe the invasion is happening in Normandy. The failure of the German army is summed up so well by Major General Gunther Blumentritt (Curd J\u00fcrgens) 'This is history. We are living an historical moment. We are going to lose the war because our glorious F\u00fchrer has taken a sleeping pill and is not to be awakened. Sometimes I wonder which side God is on.' This is particularly interesting, as earlier an Allied general had been wondering just whose side god was on as well, thus showing us that there is really little difference between the two enemies.This is a movie that acknowledges many factors. Many British people feel slightly miffed with a lot of American-made war movies about what feels like the downplaying of our role during the second world war. This isn't a recent phenomenon. Objective, Burma! is a fantastic re-telling of history with the Americans suddenly playing the parts of the British and Australians. However in The Longest Day you have John Waynes Colonel telling off one of his subordinates for talking about wanting to have a crack at the enemy. Yes, everyone's impatient, including the British who have just been bombed for a good many years. It's almost hard to imagine anyone in an American movie saying 'I don't think I have to remind you that this war has been going on for almost 5 years. Over half of Europe has been overrun and occupied. We're comparative newcomers. England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940. I'm quite sure that they, too, are impatient and itching to go. Do I make myself clear?' Especially from a country that talks about the '1942-1945' war. Yet here is The Duke saying this, and it actually made me feel good.Why was this movie filmed in black and white? With a budget of $10,000,000 and an all-star cast, you would think that the studio could spring for some colour film? So it is clearly a stylist choice. This is a movie that is about a book that documents the D-Day assault. The word 'document' is key here. By choosing to film in black and white Zanuck was clearly trying to give this movie a more 'documentary' feel, a classic feel.This is a movie that could never be made again. The planes flying are actually of the time, the locations are where the action really happened and many of the extras and technical advisers were actually at the D-Day landings. The actors were able to talk to their real life counterparts, indeed many of them were given items to wear/use from the people they were portraying. It's a movie that was made with a huge amount of passion, everyone in front of and behind camera giving it everything they can. With a cast that is beyond belief and characters speaking in their native language this is a one off, a classic, and one of the best war movies ever made, yet it does not feature in IMDBs top 250 movies.

            "review_title": "Revisiting June 6, 1944",
            "content": "There are just some dates in history that will live forever. July 20, 1969 was one of those days, when Man set foot on the Moon for the first time. November 22, 1963 was another such day, when America lost its innocence as the result of John F. Kennedy being murdered.Another important date in world history would be June 6, 1944. On that day, with the world still writhing in pain from a horrible war, an invasion force of three million soldiers from the U.S., England, and Canada stormed the beaches of France's Normandy coastline to start the freeing of Europe from Adolf Hitler's Nazi tyranny, which by that time had killed well over fifteen million people overall (six million of those for the specific reason of them being Jewish). The operation was known as \"Operation Overlord\"; and the date itself became known as D-Day. But for those millions who stormed those beaches, and the tens of thousands of them who were to lose their lives in this great cause, it was THE LONGEST DAY. And eighteen years later, in 1962, the combined talents of 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl Zanuck, writer Cornelius Ryan, and tons of others memorialized that day on the big screen in one of the greatest Hollywood epics ever made.This nearly three-hour masterpiece doesn't just focus on the complexities of the D-Day landing itself; it also gives us a look at the men who had to fight it, and the Nazi commandants who were in charge of repelling the invasion (and who evidently slept at the switch, not thinking that such an invasion could ever be mounted). THE LONGEST DAY was the most expensive black-and-white movie ever made in Hollywood up to that point, at nearly $10 million; and in order to make this happen, Zanuck got practically every living actor in Hollywood, and some more from England, to participate. This meant that many of the actors were only on the screen for a short time; and it also meant that some were in roles that they arguably were a bit too old to be playing. Still, the presence of these actors and their star wattage made THE LONGEST DAY, among other things, The Biggest Deal. When you have a cast that includes John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, and Eddie Albert just for starters, then it definitely is a big deal.Of course, it is tempting for people to compare this film's depiction of the D-Day landing to the way it was depicted in, but was the opening salvo to, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But such comparisons, while inevitable, are not necessarily fair or accurate. What was shown in unflinchingly graphic detail by Steven Spielberg in his 1998 masterpiece could not be shown in pre-MPAA ratings Hollywood. One can't hold this against either Zanuck, or the three directors (Andrew Marton; Ken Annakin; Bernhard Wicki) who helped bring THE LONGEST DAY to the screen. In the end, THE LONGEST DAY still gives one a feel of the scope of the way the invasion took place, and some of the foibles that occurred on and prior to June 6, 1944. The fact is that D-Day, while an enormous success for the Allies in the end, wasn't perfect at its inception, which was certainly shown to be so in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and acknowledged here.Still, the invasion was given its full measure of due here in THE LONGEST DAY; and that's why it remains indisputably one of the greatest films about the absolute last \"Good War\" in history.",

            "review_title": "The Beginning Of The End Of The Thousand-Year Reich",
            "content": "No one will tune into this, one of the greatest and most epic war films ever conceived, for plot surprises, given the fact that it details an event whose outcome is of course already known.  The point of the film is to detail what actually happened on the day that began the eventual downfall of the Thousand-Year Reich, and it does so with a rare combination of painstaking historical accuracy and Hollywood star power.The historical documentary aspect of the film is best shown in the German scenes, given the general lack of familiarity of the German performers and their characters on the part of the audience.  Most will probably recognize Erwin Rommel and some may recognize Karl Gerd Von Runstedt, but it is doubtful most will know who Werner Pluskat or Josef \"Pips\" Priller or Gunther Blumentritt were (though James Bond fans will recognize Curt Jurgens, here playing Blumentritt).  Given this general lack of audience familiarity, the German scenes move along like a documentary.It is in the American and some of the British scenes that the Hollywood star power of the film comes into play.  Darryl F. Zanuck assembled the most ambitious cast in memory and all the major stars get quality screen time, from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum on down.  Roddy McDowell is best known for the mild British accent he imbued to so many of his roles, so much so that it takes a few viewings to recognize him as an American grunt. Richard Burton has only two scenes in the film, but he makes the most of them and has the strongest dialogue, notably in his conversation with an 82nd Airborne paratrooper - \"He's dead, I'm crippled, you're lost, I supposed that's what war is\" is one of the best lines in any film ever.Sean Connery would soon become famous as James Bond, and here he eats up the scenery with Norman Rossington as they land on the beaches, Connery chewing out the fact that an officer rallies the troops to remember Dunkirk even though he was not in the service at the time, and Rossington commenting on some of the absurdities involved in this battle - \"I tell you, there are some very peculiar blokes on this beach.\"The one scene I had a problem with is the assault on Pointe Du Hoc - the film notes that German guns that have been firing on the other beaches have been moved, and makes it out like the Army Rangers assaulted the hill for nothing; in actuality the Rangers tracked down the guns initially deployed at Pointe Du Hoc and destroyed them as they tried to besiege Allied Forces further inland.My favorite scenes are the travails of the 82nd Airborne batallion led by John Wayne's Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort, and the squabbles between Luftwaffe commandant Wolfgang Hager and hotheaded ace Colonel Josef \"Pips\" Priller.  Hager and Priller haggle it out on the telephone constantly, leading Hager's XO to ask why Priller was never court-martialled. Meanwhile, Vandervoort leads the drive to St. Mere-Eglise, despite breaking his foot in the swamp area the Germans have flooded five miles away - when he and the batallion discover they're going in the wrong direction because a directional sign was turned around, Vandervoort growls, \"Does anyone in this outfit read a compass besides me?\"The 82nd also figures in the film's signature horror - the slaughter of a batallion, here including comedian Red Buttons, who is brilliant as the 82nd private who is concerned with speaking French but who can only watch helplessly as his pals land in the middle of the town and are wiped out by the waiting Germans, amid the din of church bells.Without question this film ranks as among the very best war epics ever put to film.  Whether shown in its original B&W format or colorized (unlike many other colorized films this one loses nothing in the switch from B&W) it tells a chilling historical story to near-perfection.",

The comparisons with 'Saving Private Ryan' that some of the reviewers make here are not relevant. With no disrespect to Spielberg's achievement, 'SPR' in no way compares to this documentary style black and white film. The cast is superb and there is no way a contemporary movie could include such a high caliber collection of star power and talent because frankly, it just doesn't exist these days. Contemporary film makers seem to be too busy rewriting history to be able to tell it accurately and objectively. Many of the  terrific character actors that sparkle in this film would not be instantly recognized, but their performances shine nonetheless. Such actors as Richard Munch ( as General Marks)gives a bird's eye view into the German dilemma of trying to trace the allies true intentions, which were all too cunningly guarded by an invincible 'bodyguard of lies'. Hans Christian Blech also terrific as a German ace pilot in command of the beleaguered Luftwaffe's  front line fighter squadrons gives an unvarnished portrait of the divide between desk-bound commanders and the fighters who have to make do with too few planes and tanks close enough to the front to do any good. Any military man would give gruff assent to this point of view. 'SPR' is told through  undeniably brilliant cinematography and superb direction, 'TLD' is told by some of the best actors of the 20th century and superb editing. Both are valid ways of telling a story but I must say, that while I've seen 'SPR' at least 3 times, 'TLD' is a film I 'must' see at least once a year, especially at Memorial Day, as one of the only ways ( as a tribute to the sacrifices of these men and women) I can attempt to share the experiences of the many thousands who lived and died on that longest day of days.",

            "content": "There is too much good stuff in The Longest Day for it to be called totally worthless, but it's certainly less good than you'd think, given its credentials. The film was an incredibly epic production, probably right up there with Lawrence of Arabia for sheer number of extras, number of costumes, number of locations, etc. This may actually be the films problem: it's too big to hold together, and collapses under its own weight.The film touted itself as having a cast of \"48 international stars.\" I don't think its being timid to say that's too many. It obviously lets out much by way of character development, and even makes it hard to keep track of who's who. The audience is expected to keep track of dozens of subtitles telling characters' names and affiliations. This is mitigated somewhat by the star system, however that brings up another problem -- no single player is able to get enough screen time to really capture our attention. John Wayne swaggers forth for what looks like it could have been one of the best movies of his career, and then never really gets to do anything.And really, the script is just plain bad. A lot of the dialogue sounds bizarrely amateurish, and more than a few situations are so badly conceived its more like a comedy than a \"war epic.\" Big dramatic moments are written in that never come to anything, and supposedly big moments are shoehorned in when there's been nothing to remotely build up to them. Any kind of tension or coherent pacing are nowhere to be seen, and this is worsened by the fact that the film is criminally over-long. It could have ended over an hour before it does, and when it finally does end, it would be hard to imagine a more arbitrary moment for it.One can probably tell a lot from the fact that the film had three directors, nearly a dozen screenwriters, and an army of consultants. With so many voices clamouring at once, its no surprise the film takes the vague, rambling shape it does, with no single, coherent voice shining through.And the combat. Oh, the combat. Imagine if you will the fantasies of a six-year old with only the vaguest idea of what a war consists of. Now imagine that same six-year old given a Hollywood epic budget to put his fantasies on screen. That's what a lot of the film's fighting looks like. We're spoiled for realism in this age of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down, where We Were Soldiers is the worst it gets. The Longest Day is the product of another age, where it was thought necessary to romanticize war and lionize the soldiers in it. When it was an odious task to have to show a single GI get killed, and would be made up for by showing 50 Germans with machine guns get gunned down by one GI with a rifle and a few grenades (which in this movie, seem mysteriously to be nothing more than smoke grenades).The only redeeming moments in this movie come from the odd moment when one of its stars gets enough screen time to say something memorable, or the odd cleverly scripted moment. Big, grandiose aerial shots of battle mean little when they're in no coherent context, and it doesn't help that they're interspersed with gratuitously slapstick humour. This movie is not even worth wasting a coupon on.",

Those insertion in the film that look real, are from a larger (10 days) shoot of realistic mock landings and events by Landing Force Mediterranean \"LFM-1-61\", 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine Division on Corsica in 1961. We had a lot of single and group shooting on the ships and shore with Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Eddy Albert (USN-Navy Cross, Tarawa 1943), etc., but these were cut because after film development, our Sateen Green Utilities (fatigues) when wet after being dropped off short of the beaches, were too dark to double as WW II Army brown fatigues. So, Zanuck had to re-shoot a cheaper landing version with actual U.S. Army troops later that year, and they were criticized by a lot of actors (War Veterans) as not being realistic and frighten getting into and out of the landing craft. Zanuck, did keep to Cornelius Ryan's story as close as possible. My biggest mistake is having read the book in 1959, and had my copy (1st hard back edition) with me, I did not get C. Ryan, Zanuck, and the actors present to sign it. Thanks for your comments, John J. Kline, Philadelphia, PA",

Particularly heavy with pathos amongst so many strong scenes are Pvt Martini (Mineo) as a victim of imperfect D-Day planning (click confusion), paratrooper Steele (Buttons), witness to a Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise courtyard massacre, the RAF commando who, in the nick of time, riddles the German attacker of French partisan Jeanine Boitard (Demick) to obliterate in one act of Allied alignment, 1000 yrs of Anglo-Franco animosity, and then G. I. Dutch (Beymer), not just lost, but a survivor, and at day's end it's what matters most. Chiefly penned for the big screen by Corny Ryan, author whose work was its basis, it stars Richard Beymer, Robert Mitchum, Richard Todd (\"Hold until relieved\"), Curd J\u00fcrgens, all-star support, a Maurice Jarre score (LoA Zhivago Witness), an Oscar'd camera (Bourgoin Wottitz Persin) and effects (MacDonald Maumont) (4/4).",

            "content": "**This Review May Contain Spoilers**There are many great war films. They are in a class by themselves, and can never be replaced. However some are the more elite, effectively capturing a time and crucial moment in history we might not have known much about. This is one of them. Darryl F. Zanuck's The Longest Day is possibly the best of the elite war films, and one of the greatest of all time. The key comes from the realistically staged and recreated invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. He could have made it a overly American film, and it would have been forgotten. But Zanuck put his heart and soul into the film and tries to present each side with dignity and honor. And with success.For instance when Pluskat sees the invasion coming, it is darkly funny. But this is not to make Pluskat look like an idiot Nazi, it made it so he is a guy doing his job and frightened of whats coming toward him. Another when Richard Burton and Richard Beymer sit and smoke waiting for the Allies, they get into deep thoughts about the war. They are indeed patriotic soldiers, but they are tired, frustrated, and sick of the war. That is inspired writing, directing, and casting. I believe the greatest moment is delivered by Curt Jurgens at the end when he realizes he won't stop the Allies. The subtlety is unrivaledEvery cast member has his own story and moment, and all is executed flawlessly. it can be a long movie at the start, but once the invasion begins, you are on pins and needles the entire time.One of the greatest films.

It could be potentially disastrous otherwise!However, I wonder if the soldiers on the battlefield could really be moving so slowly, and actually had time to get down to talk about the boots worn by the Germans and why one wore a lifecoat. Also, the ending is rather abrupt without much reference to the reaction of the Germans or the French who played a heavier role in the beginning of the film.",

I feel I should expand it to at least 10 lines since the first one was so brief and especially since this is Veteran's Day.I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces but I naturally I never encountered anything like the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. When I was growing up in the 70's, calendars still had little icons denoting D-Day, VE-Day, and VJ-Day. Apparently, that's too politically incorrect for today's youths, since they are too busy being indoctrinated in school. But I digress...The scope and breath of this film is amazing. The fact that the film stays together after so much detail is amazing in itself. I read many of the user comments and tend to agree that a lot of the dialogue is stilted, especially in the American scenes. The best part of the film for me was the scenes involving the Germans. Their acting was years ahead of its time. I love the scenes where the German officers are afraid to wake Hitler to tell him about the invasion. The only French scene I can stomach is at the beginning when Irina Demick is on the bike trying to distract the Germans from the adjacent wagon of hay, in where her comrades were hidden. Holy crap she was hot!I thought the best American performances were from Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer and Henry Fonda, whose role was unfortunately too brief. The best British performance was from Richard Burton. His scene at the end is great.Although nothing can match the Normandy landing in \"Saving Private Ryan\", I'd take this version of D-Day anyday. While people have commented about the armchair warhawks like John Wayne, I similarly find the inclusion of Matt Damon and other Hollywood lefties in SPR just as revolting.",

The Longest Day was NOT your typical Hollywood pseudo history. It contained actors from everywhere - every male actor in Hollywood wanted to be in this film, and a very large number of them were in this film. The film succeeds as history because it faithfully follows the book of the same name by Cornelius Ryan. Of course, a movie cannot come anywhere close to a book in terms of information, and thus there are necessary editing decisions as to what should be included. The biggest failure, in my opinion, is the lack of a clear exposition before the attack of exactly where the beaches were located and which units were assigned to them. If one wants to know the full history of the landings, then the book is where to find it. Nevertheless, the movie does just about as good a job of providing the pertinent facts as is probably possible. Certainly this film makes a mockery of Private Ryan, a totally absurd piece of fiction with an absurd plot and populated by folks who never existed. That film also totally exaggerated the experience, with body parts flying all over the place. The casualty rate at Omaha Beach simply did not live up to its reputation as \"Bloody Omaha.\" Only in comparison with the experiences of the other beaches would anyone claim a high casualty rate for Omaha. We landed over 35,000 troops on Omaha on D-Day, and the total number dead was less than 400. And A Bridge Too Far was a totally manufactured event that leaves the audience with more rather than less misinformation after viewing. It was a political movie, not a valid history of Market-Garden. The Longest Day is the real McCoy and also quite pleasant to watch. You don't need to manufacture facts to tell a good story. The story practically tells itself. And truth is always far more interesting than fiction.",

And the horrible over-splicing of action scenes. Couldn't they find real boats and real people,and real water to do the landing scenes? Just picking apart two scenes, let's take the first one: Henry Fonda (T.Roosevelts son) goes to the ward room to see his division commander about being first on the beach. Now,the division commander let's fly about T.R.'s sons father being the first up San Juan Hill and leading the Rough Riders. Wouldn't T.R.'s son already know these fact. I mean come on. If he didn't hear them from his father certainly he picked it up somewhere he was a one star general.Next,John Wayne is in the chute room having a cup of coffee. In comes word about the attack. With so many tables around him, why did he have to throw his coffee cup to the floor? Couldn't he just put it down?Peppered with ham acting the best part of this film was that of the German actors. They seemed to want this movie to contain better then average acting.Look at Major Pluskat. That poor guy caught hell right from the time he was woke up with a phone call.

This is an awful film, and I have to say the best performances came from the actors portraying the Germans. Maybe it appeals to 10-year-olds, but to those of us who took part in the war, and have longer memories, it's an extremely poor attempt at covering what was a momentous time in history. The British forces too were presented as cartoon characters as is often Hollywood's manner. Compare it to Saving Private Ryan? Well at least in TLD there were British forces present at Normandy.

I disagree, because with How the West was Won, which also casts big name stars in cameo/extra-ish roles, you are not supposed to worry about the stars- you are supposed to worry about THE FAMILY, what happens to them, whether they get killed or not, who they have as friends, who they should not have as friends, who they have as enemies, who they should not have as enemies, etc., or if its The Greatest Story Ever Told, which, again, casts big name stars in cameo/extra-ish roles, you, again, are not supposed to worry about the stars, but instead, you should worry about THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, (which truly is The Greatest Story Ever Told) and how George Stevens tries to make you understand that you should worry about how the story always can, always will, and always has effected our lives. Lastly, with The Longest Day, you are not supposed to worry about the actors, you are supposed to worry about the INVASION itself, and how IT is the star of the movie, and that the actors are really the co-stars, compared to the INVASION. Another reason you should not worry about the stars in The Longest Day is because, I think, that if you were, say, Sal Mineo's character, Pvt. Martini, you would remember it if you ran into John Wayne's character, Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, for two reasons: because it is John Wayne playing the part, and it is Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort on screen. But if you were John Wayne's character, Lt. Col. Benjamin Vandervoort, and you ran into Sal Mineo's character, Pvt.

            "content": ".....and this year marks the 60th anniversary of the greatest World War II movie ever made, and it was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck who was shooting the works; his previous films as independent producer tanked at the box office. He hired Ken Annakin for the British and French scenes, Andrew Marton for the American scenes, and Bernhard Wicki for the German scenes. It would have been four directors but Gerd Oswald forgot that Darryl Zanuck was the sheriff in town and he was just one of the deputies. THE LONGEST DAY was based on the non-fiction bestselling book by Irish journalist Cornelius Ryan. It told the story of the Allied invasion that occurred on the morning of June 6, 1944 by American, British, Canadian, and Free French personnel at Normandy, located along France's western coastland. General Eisenhower (portrayed by set decorator Henry Grace in his only film appearance albeit uncredited) was on the horns of a dilemma. Should he order the Allied forces' invasion while the weather was at its worst in the last twenty years, or wait for much better conditions that would not come around until late July or early August. History says Eisenhower gave the go ahead. There are plenty of great scenes to be had. One of them is that of Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Vandervoort (played by John Wayne in a role originally intended for Charlton Heston) engaged in an intense conversation with Brigadier General James Gavin (Robert Ryan) concerning the dropping of Army paratroopers near the French town of Sainte-Mere-Eglise that happens to be surrounded by swampland and the troops are there to fight, not to swim. Well, due to a sudden gust of wind the paratroopers, including Private John Steele (Red Buttons), are shot out of the sky by the Wehrmacht as they descend in the middle of the night; Private Steele fakes his own death as he's suspended by parachute from a building, and the constant ringing of the bells render him deaf. The next morning Colonel Vandervoort and some of the other troops arrive at Sainte-Mere-Eglise, and the lieutenant colonel is extremely pissed from seeing the bodies of the paratroopers hanging all over the village, and an Army lieutenant (Stuart Whitman) can't apologize fast enough to save his life. But the Germans didn't have it any easier. Major General Gunther Blumentritt would like to have the Panzer tanks released to him so that they can be used to beat back the Allied troops, so to that end he requests Colonel General Alfred Jodl make a visit to Adolf Hitler in Berlin and make that happen, but Jodl doesn't want to bend his knee to that Austrian corporal. Well, Jodl arrives in Berlin, only to find out that Hitler went off on a tirade and took a sleeping pill with orders not to be disturbed. Blumentritt is incensed, of course. He has his orderly retrieve a bottle of cognac so that they can toast the inevitable Allied victory and the Fuhrer's stupidity, Then there's the French underground, including Janine Boitard (Irina Demich who was Zanuck's mattress mistress at the time), who derail a German train; for that scene, an actual train was derailed with eight cameras rolling. There's another great scene of a group of demolition engineers who have to blow a hole in a concrete wall after storming Normandy Beach, and one of the engineers is Sergeant John H. Fuller (Jeffrey Hunter) who gets a battlefield commission from Brigadier General Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum). You might enjoy this one scene of Army troops and German troops walking single file past each other along a concrete hedgerow! The Free French forces, under the leadership of Capitaine de Corvette Philippe Kieffer (Christian Marquand) succeed in liberating the coastal town of Ouistreham from the Germans, and both sides pause when a group of nuns show up to render medical aid. Two Luftwaffe pilots strafe the beachside before flying inland to sit out the rest of the war. THE LONGEST DAY was filmed on location in France, except for the Normandy scenes which were shot in Corsica. And it was filmed in black and white, so as to include wartime footage. This movie was colorized and re-issued in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of D-Day; if you have it, do yourself a favor and turn the colorization all the way down. Better yet, get rid of it. THE LONGEST DAY secured two Academy Awards, one for Best Cinematography (Jean Bourgoin and Walter Wottitz) and another for Best Special Effects Robert A. McDonald and Jacques Maumont). Some of the special effects were worked on by various uncredited experts, including Augie Lohmam, David Horsely, Alex Weldon, and Wally Veevers. Darryl Zanuck returned to 20th Century-Fox as chairman after having been in cinematic exile. THE LONGEST DAY was a huge box office hit, and was sometimes shown on TV during the 1960s and early 1970s with the German and French scenes filmed in English. Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, and Hans Christian Blech were also in BATTLE OF THE BULGE (1965); in addition, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Stuart Whitman, and Red Buttons co-starred with John Wayne in various films. Watching THE LONGEST DAY is a good way to remember D-Day. Thanking a World War II veteran is even better. Do it while you have a chance. Your soul will thank you. Enjoy this amazing movie.",

The Navy was also involved with the use of gunnery as was done at the Normandy landings. It is commented about in the film that Allied Command did not believe the Air Force could do much good because the guns were placed in a position that could best be attacked by the landing forces. However, I feel sure that reconnaissance must have shown much greater detail of the onshore battery emplacements and the locations of German troops. Of course it is easy to make comments with hindsight, but one has to wonder why the earlier, virtually unopposed missions flown by Air Corps pilots in softening up some of the rear areas; why this measure was not applied to the emplacements at the beachfront? Aircraft operating at that time in the European theater included many capable of close-air support as employed by Marine aircraft in the Pacific. I believe it is factual, that only two German aircraft flew one sortie over the beaches that day. Of course the Allies did not know about the placement of enemy aircraft on that given day, but the unopposed earlier missions by aircraft should have been reported and this factor given its proper consideration; seems to me that it dictates the use of the air arm in support of landing troops on the beach. Doubtless if given the amount of close-air support employed by Marine pilots, the number of men lost to hostile fire on the beaches could have been reduced as the enemy forces could have been greatly reduced by fire from aircraft. This action would also have diverted their intentions from defending against landing forces to seeking cover to avoid fire from aircraft. I am not sure when napalm was first employed by the Marines in the Pacific; it might have been later, but can you imagine the devastation that would have caused the enemy along the four beaches the Allied forces landed on? I would appreciate any comments from more knowledgeable persons on some of the historical events I commented about; also any thought any have as to the validity of my assertions. As I said, hindsight is usually 20/20, but the isolation it seems, of these saving techniques remained principally in the Pacific as I know of no action on the European continent that employed this method of prosecuting war against the enemy. I have to wonder and write this in an effort to understand why it was not employed for the D-Day landings?",

            "content": "The Longest Day has been one of my favorite WW2 movies of all time. There is so much packed in that you can see it multiple times and still pick up things you may have missed. The only weak point for me is the casting of Red Buttons as a US paratrooper. Aside from that excellent work from many people some of whom include: Henry Fonda as Teddy Roosevelt Jr demanding to be included in the invasion with his men.Jeffery Hunter - very good as a member of the demolition team on Omaha beach who has to take over when his officers are killed. The movie did a very good job of showing how regular/nameless people like Hunter's character would play such a big part in winning a battle and no one other than the people there ever knowing about it.Richard Burton as the last of the RAF pilots from the start of the war. He doesn't have a big part but gets a lot in on the few scenes he has.Sean Connery - excellent as a little comedy relief Curt Jurgens as the German general knowing re-enforcements were needed but caught between Hitler throwing a tantrum and his boss who refuses to speak to Hitler personally \"Get on my knees to that Bohemian Corporal?? Never !\" Richard Todd as the Brit told to \"hold until relieved\" and not know if the relief would ever come.A short scene where a group of nuns arrive during the middle of a battle showing as much courage as anyone there to try to help with the wounded They had people from the French Resistance, Rommel, war correspondents, the beach masters, it seemed like they tried to cover just about every aspect, most for just a few minutes but very well done. Robert Mitchum, Robert Wagner, Roddy McDowell, John Wayne, etc.If you like WW2 films and don't mind black & white with no gore you should love this movie.",

            "content": "Some people have described this film as bad because of the 'wooden' acting. Surely the spectacle, size and scope of the battle scenes make up for this supposed lack of acting skills.I personally beleive the acting in this film is great, and the multitude of stars is just one reason to watch. Sadly because of the short space of time the movie has, and the number of characters it is hard to get involved with each of the charcters as an individual, as you would in a war film about one or a select few, like Patton. This has to be about the film's only flaw.Albeit the war scenes lack a large amount of gore, in-fact they show any, with men not even screaming when they die. This has to be expected considering the film was made in a time where special effects were not as amazing as they are today.\nDespite all of this, this has to be my favourite war movie, and my third favourite film all up. I could watch it purely for the battle scenes, but I also enjoy the film because of the way the events are depicted from three positions: those of the Germans in France, the French citizens and the Allied soldiers.I beleive you cannot go wrong with this film. Some of the early parts are a little slow but that is all forgotten by the time the first glider-borne troops crash onto the Orne River Bridge and D-Day begins.A great film, patriotic, exciting and very very gripping. I give this film an 9.5 from a possible 10.",

            "review_title": "The definitive war film of cinematic and historic genius.",
            "content": "\"THE LONGEST DAY\", based on a book by Cornelius Ryan, tells us of the events of and surrounding D-Day, the World War II invasion executed on June 6, 1944. We see almost everything from the perspectives of both the Allied and Axis forces. It is a brilliantly made, extremely well-acted, and above all, a genuinely felt war epic. Just about every actor that ever worked in Hollywood during the \"golden age\" is here to lend their excellent acting abilities- John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Beymer, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Stuart Whitman, Roddy McDowall, Robert Wagner, Curt Jurgens, Sean Connery, and so many others. But even more worthy of top billing is the invasion itself. The actors and actresses, great as they are, are far outshined by the scope and grand scale of the invasion, which, in turn, gives the film immeasurable quality. The entire film is perfect. Every part of it is a complement to everything else: the acting, the black-and-white cinematography, the music (by Maurice Jarre and theme music by Paul Anka), the wonder, the awe, the irony-absolutely nothing is out of place. I believe the only reason that movies, television, documentaries, and anything else to do with the art of film should or ever needs to exist is to make us believe in the subject matter. It's not about the paycheck, the latest romantic scandal, or to show off. The purpose is to make us believe, recognize the character's attributes (or lack thereof) within ourselves, and for the cast and crew to do their best. Not every movie has succeeded, but many have, and it's a pity that many of today's films do not. Even though World War II did occur, as well as D-Day, Pearl Harbor, and all the rest, the audiences of war films could never believe for themselves that those things did happen if the movies were not believable. Fortunately, this film is very believable and realistic, and the stock footage from the actual invasion is a great asset. As a matter of fact, \"THE LONGEST DAY\" is probably one of the best films ever made (on the subject of war or otherwise). It defies the use of unnecessary gore in \"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN\", and even uses all the elements from many other films - such as the \"get-in-blow-it-up-get-out\" theme from \"THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI\" and \"THE GUNS OF NAVARONE\" (both great films). The unrest and comraderie among superiors and subordinates, the escapism, the adventure, the horror, the frustration - all have been used before, and not just in war films. Not to mention that this film also succeeds as both a \"buddy film\", and, of course, a \"guy movie\". But it is this movie that, even though it was one of the last of the greatest war movies, sets the tone for all the others. As a final note, \"THE LONGEST DAY\" also has some of the best scenes ever captured on film. A lot of the old clich\u00e9s are used, and some new ones as well. Kenneth More's entire performance, the two guys with the pigeons, John Wayne exhibiting his tough guy persona, etc. The sporadic wry humor, the great action pieces, the use of actual footage from the invasion, is all used very well. To list some of my favorite scenes from this movie would take forever and a day, but my top favorites are as follows: John Wayne's first scene when he suddenly turns around and you're thinking, \"Holy Smokes! It's the Duke!\" (let me assure you that those are my exact feelings every time), the introduction of \"Rupert\" (and when he is introduced to the German officers), the use of codes, the boats unloading the troops onto the beach, the guy on bagpipes, the \"hold until relieved\", all the character pieces, and so much more. A tried-and-true, dignified, immensely entertaining, miraculous, illustrious slice of history. Also Recommended: \"STAGECOACH\" (1939), \"JESSE JAMES\" (1939), \"D.O.A.\" (1950), \"THE NAKED SPUR\" (1954), \"JOHNNY TREMAIN\" (1957) THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF \"THE LONGEST DAY\", AND TO ANYONE WHO IS CURRENTLY OR EVER HAS FOUGHT IN A WAR.",

This black and white film,winner of 2 academy awards,directed by Darryl F.Zanuck and made in 1962 rests next to my copies of \"Patton\" and \"Tora!Tora!Tora!\". Besides John Wayne there are 47 other star actors you see with big parts or cameo size parts. This film tries to show the way men were feeling and reactingduring the Invasion of Normandy during WW2 and that words of the German Field Marshal Rommel proved true when he said it... (Invasion Day)would be \"The Longest Day\" for both the Allies and theGermans. The film tries to show what was going on before and after\"D Day\" and must leave out every event unless the film be several hours longer. Based on the book by Cornelius Ryan I  found it to be true in most details but wish it would have shown how the U.S. Navy Destroyer came in close to the shore to help silence some of the German artillery with its big guns and the fact that German Panzer tanks were waiting behind the beaches with their motors running ,waiting to get orders from Hitler to engage the Allied forces ,but it never came because Hitler was asleep in Berlin and his people were afraid to wake him because he was prone to make bad decisions and he was convinced the REAL invasion would come farther north in France and closer to England. Overall the film was a fine one and makes me proud of American military in time of war and sad that so many men died to keep us free.",

Casting actual participants adds to the realistic feel. I argued with my family about the Longest Day vs. Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan was a good movie, but it was a fictionalized account. Whereas, Longest Day had many of the actual participants in or providing technical advice. Ryan had better effects(big deal) but if you watch it, it's a clich\u00e9' ridden WWII movie just like Bataan or others. Compare the \"central casting\" characters with WWII era movies.

WWII was still a vivid memory to many of the makers (Richard Todd virtually plays himself in this film) and understandably they submit to the temptation of making their comrades a little more consciously heroic than they were. This after all is designed to be an entertainment - not a documentary. Nevertheless there is a more even handed treatment of the material than you might expect, the victory is shown as being as much due to German errors as to Allied successes and the acknowledgement of the parts played by the Free French and resistance groups seems more enlightened than modern Hollywood often manages. Three pieces of tour-de-force camera work stick out vividly - a small group of GI's playing craps is revealed, through a spectacular zoom out and tracking shot to be a vast dormitory of soldiers awaiting the word to go. Two Luftwaffe fighters strafe the beaches and we see every bit of WWII hardware the production could lay hands on as we see the attack run from the fighters POV. Finally the opening of the assault on a German garrison filmed as another single tracking shot that must have taken whole days to re-set between takes.Dated yes but still a significant piece of cinema and a fitting tribute to the Men and Women who lost their lives in June 1944.",

For younger people, please understand that when this movie was made, many of the participants in the actual event were still alive. Many contributed in some way to the movie and others would have commented strongly if they saw something wrong. That had to put tremendous pressure on the producers. The only complaint I ever had with it was technical in nature. Much of the equipment worn by the American soldiers is incorrect. It is not that it isn't WWII equipment (it is) but that it wasn't appropriate to what the soldier was doing or carrying as a weapon. I have also read that the action on the beach is spectacular but not quite correct as most of the movement off Omaha Beach early in the day was in small groups like depicted in \"Saving Private Ryan\". I forgive the movie both glitches as it was more important to put Ryan's book on the screen rather than sweat the small stuff.One bit of trivia I learned years later by reading one of Ambrose's books had to do with Richard Todd who played Major Howard taking \"Pegasus Bridge\". If Todd looks believable in the role, it turns out that there is a very good reason for that. It seems Todd was a young officer in one of the British Parachute Battalions that dropped into Normandie in support of Howard's capture of the bridge.Regarding the DVD release I just bought, I have to comment on the 'historical commentary' section. This is a feature that you can turn on and a \"historian\" comments as you watch the movie. I was highly disappointed in the comments. Instead of real history, all it contains is a lot of movie commentary and social statements. If you choose to listen to the \"Audio Commentary by Historian X X\" on this set, please read Ryan's book afterward or one of Ambrose's books to correct what you have listened to on the DVD. I normally wouldn't include such a negative section but it really angered me what they termed 'historical commentary'. If it had been labeled anything but 'historical' I would not have minded.

Filmed in a semi-documentary approach and in black and white, I always feel I am watching a documentary of the real D-Day invasion and not a motion picture. The film has more impressive action sequences than probably any other war film, before or since.  Some standouts include: The French Commando raid on the French village, Oestram, the disasterous 82nd. Airborne division drop on Ste. Mere Eglise, the 2 Luftwaffe planes strafing what seems like miles of beaches, the U.S. Ranger Division climbing Pointe Du Hoc, the British Glider attack on Pegasus bridge, etc. etc.  I'm sure that many will be confused by the scenes I have just described.  But if you've seen this film or know anything about D-Day, than you will know what I am talking about. Blessed with an impressive cast (many of whom are, unfortunately, not with us anymore,) including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, etc. etc., this film was producer Darryl F. Zanuck's towering achievement. This film just lost the 1962 Best picture Oscar to Lawrence of Arabia.  As great as that film was, this is a better and more important film.  It is unreal that these two great epics should have gone against each other. One last thought, however.  Since Saving Private Ryan was released, The Longest Day has been criticized basically for not having the same type of carnage (realism) that Ryan had in its Omaha Beach segments.  However you simply could not do that type of thing in 1962. As great as Saving Private Ryan is, The Longest Day is a film that will live forever.  See it this D-Day.",

This is a wide-view movie, and death is presented within that view, i.e., we see hoards of men running up the beach, and hundreds being shot down as they run.The hardware is terrific! No stock scenes here - the producers brought in WWII ships, tanks, guns, etc. for an exceptionally authentic look. Three thousand members of the French military were used as extras. Shot in Normandy, France, the scenes are accurate, too. The decision to film in black and white was terrific. Everything is in shades of gray.If you ever get a chance, read about the openings of the film, first in France, then in New York. And remember, this is less than 20 years after WWII.In New York, veterans of the invasion marched in dress uniforms under signs declaring \"Omaha\", \"Utah\", \"Gold\", \"Juno\", and \"Sword\".At any rate, this is one of the few definitive WWII movies, and will remain so.",

The two movies aren't comparable.  SPR is a close quarters look at how the war effected the soldiers.  TLD takes a epic point of view that explores all sides of the invasion.  Just compare the way they depicted the landings on the beach.  Zanuck's version is a wide camera view of thousands of soldiers running up the beach.  Speilberg's focus's on one small stretch of one beach.  Anyway, this is the definitive movie of the D-Day invasion, as in the ENTIRE day.  SPR is currently the definitive WWII combat movie.I can't help but warn people that you do need to go into this with the aim of learning about history. It really is a dated movie (hammy/wooden acting, sometimes unbearable low humour, total lack of gore), but this doesn't stop it from delivering a great deal of good info to the watcher.",

A true epic, this film combines spectacular battle scenes (even by today's standards) with a superb cast of over 48 international stars.To me, what sets this film apart from Ryan is the way all sides of the conflict are brought to the screen with such superb acting.  John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, and many, many others guide us gracefully through the events of the D-day invasion.  The film captures the historical element of the event, while still offering an exciting and entertaining action-adventure to boot.  For war-movie buffs, this is a film that should not be missed.

It reminds me in that way of Tombstone--each star brought his own personality to the party--thus making it fun to watch. I actually commend the producers /directors ability to bring all these guys together--and I'm sure the stars had fun doing it also.It lacked the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan but then again look at the original audience and era. Does a movie have to have gore and sex to be accepted today as good?I cant say what is a favorite part but I uniquely enjoyed the look of jubilation on the French farmers face when the fleet began bombing the shore.

            "content": "Everyone else seems to think that this is the best war movie ever made (or close to it), including several friends whose opinion I value.  However, although I agree that it is one of the best war films of its time, I feel that it has not aged well and is now dated & not as interesting as more recent efforts.My biggest problem is the depiction of the Germans vs. the Allied characters.  The Allies tend to be shown in a silly or comical way--snapping their little plastic noise makers, cracking jokes, & engaging in other low comedy (i.e. Sean Connery).  Meanwhile, the Germans are all depicted as deadly serious, realistic characters.  One gets the feeling that the tension in the film comes from whether these bumbling comedians can overcome the serious, goal-driven Germans.  While the film is faithful to Ryan's book, the choices of what to show and how to show it are not well made.  This may not have been that big a problem in 1962, but in 1999 it is a significant one.A further problem is with the idea of the \"all-star\" cast.  The stars tend to overcome the characters they're supposed to be playing.  Again, other than the German characters who are given more depth, there is a tendency to toss big names at the audience and the significance of the character they're playing is minimized.I'm not saying this is a bad movie (no movie with Robert Ryan in it can be said to be truly bad).  What I am saying is that it has lost some of its sheen over the years.  I have to admit to preferring \"A Bridge Too Far\" when it comes to \"all-star war movies\".  For all the flaws in that film, it puts its actors firmly into character and doesn't fall for simplistic sentimentality.  And the low humor is kept to a minimum.",

Especially the scenes where the paratroopers are being dropped behind enemy lines makes you wonder how one would feel in such a dangerous situation. The troopers were sometimes dropped right into enemy garrisons or killed by small arms fire before they even touched ground.One bad thing about the movie is that it contains a couple of scenes that were supposed to illustrate the madness of war in a  funny/sarcastic way. Could've been a good idea if it hadn't been done so damn corny. I really could've done without that happy French resistance guy with the silver helmet or the joking 'Tommy' at the beach( Sean Connery.)

For the first-time viewer it can be difficult to keep track of all the players because the first 20 minutes or so of the movie certainly throws a lot at you. With repeat viewings it gets easier. It's too bad that we never learn the fate of Henry Fonda's character since Teddy Roosevelt Jr. perished in the invasion but the film does not point this out. The last we see of Fonda is when he is wading onto Utah beach with his regiment. Also, the cast credits on IMDb list Lee Strasberg in a minor role but I've never been able to locate him in the film. Any help with this? All in all, \"The Longest Day\" remains one of the penultimate war films of the 1960's (along with \"Guns Of Navarone\", \"The Great Escape\", \"The Dirty Dozen\" and maybe \"Von Ryan's Express\".)

This is probably because they were directed by Ken Anakin who made many comedy films and maybe humour is a way of relieving the stress of combat. Ken Anakin went on to direct \"Those Macnificent Men In Their Flying Machines\" and \"Battle of the Bulge\" and it is interesting to notice that a lot of actors in \"The Longest Day\" went on to appear in those two films. Also Sean Connery's Irish accent was far better than the Edinburgh Irish dialect he used in \"The Untouchables\" !! The producers seemed to want to attract young cinema goers to the film by using teen idols like Paul Anka, Fabien and Tommy Sands, who would soon be swept away by the Beatles. Indeed one of the faults of war films in general is the use of middle aged actors to portray servicemen barely out of their teens. Richard Burton as an RAF flying officer is stretching things a bit. He may have been one for real in 1945, but by 1962 he was to old. But overall \"The Longest Day\" is the best D-day movie. \"Saving Private Ryan\" may have more realism, but it does not give the overall picture.",

Normandy was a hard-fought victory over some of the world's finest soldiers, not a bunch of lazy clowns.The filmmakers also inserted far too many celebrity cameos at the expense of depth or character development. On the plus side, there's plenty of action, courage, determination, reasonably realistic equipment, and a proper sense of the scale of the battle.",

Saving Private Ryan leaves quite am impression on you, and other D-Day movies, including this one, have a hard time living up to Saving Private Ryan.A main reason that this movie is so weak is because of it's unrealistic portrayal of D-Day. The film tries to show D-Day as a group of brave American and British men, at peace with God, and ready to fight and die for their country, no matter what the cost, these men were ready to go into battle. This is made obviously clear as John Wayne runs out of his invasion boat courageously at the German bunkers onto the beaches of Normandy, his men following bravely behind him, not once hesitating to find a large obstacle to hide behind. When in fact, the young men who fought at Normandy were scared beyond reality. The invasion boats were covered in puke because the men were so frightened that they were throwing up. Men lost their values, beliefs, and standards for human life in D-Day and the rest of the war. This film tries to portray it as exciting, to make everyone get up, join the Army, and go kill the Nazi's, or whatever enemy America may be fighting now.Which brings up another point that this film is purely American propaganda, trying to support the Army. The reason that this film is so weak and unreal, is most likely due to the fact of the cencorship of the 60's time period. They weren't allowed to show the true brutality of war, and the fact is, they probably couldn't have captured it then anyway.While I did enjoy the film because it is about D-Day and is a good movie, especially for it's time, it makes war look like fun, which simply isn't true.

Unfortunately, they did not. The acting is wooden (yes, John Wayne is here), and the actors are given some howler lines to deliver. The battle scenes, although using an impressive number of extras and equipment, fail to deliver on the realism side; the cliff climbing scene is just plain silly. The beach landing is very similar to that in Saving Private Ryan, however the pace is slower, with a smaller body count. Overall, although no doubt an achievement for it's time this film has aged badly. It's story is definitely more interesting and relevant than that in SPR, however the screenplay and acting are poor.

It is harder for the kids to understand that in this world of political correctness where they can't even say bad things about other people, that there used to be such evil as Hitler and the Nazis. This movie lets me tell them about the horror without them actually having to see it unlike more 'realistic' movies such as 'Saving Private Ryan'.My favorite parts of the movie are the John Wayne scenes where he is at his gritty best.

How many other movies could boast a cast of over 40 international stars. When someone asks you who's in the movie you could go on for a couple minutes listing easily recognizable names.

I also like the way that it depicted the German commanders as intelligent human beings rather than idiotic, power-mad war mongers who somehow managed to conquer Europe, as war movies are wont to do.  I wish the character of Erwin Rommel had been more significant, because it would have added depth, seeing as how Rommel really wasn't that bad of a guy.

A sheer scale of effort put in by the director towards creating a battle area is commendable. Though it shows both sides of the story from Allied and German POVs, it is biased towards the winning side. Characters are nicely developed. Cinematography is fantastic. Background music gels well with the emotions throbbing throughout the movie. I wish it was in colour. Nonetheless, a wonderful watch.",

            "content": "The events of D-Day, told on a grand scale from both the Allied and German points of view is the focus of the film. \n\nThe day after the film opened at the Warner Theatre in New York City, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times declared: \"The total effect of the picture is that of a huge documentary report, adorned and colored by personal details that are thrilling, amusing, ironic, sad ... It is hard to think of a picture, aimed and constructed as this one was, doing any more or any better or leaving one feeling any more exposed to the horror of war as this one does\". Variety described it as \"a solid and stunning war epic\" that \"emerges as a sort of grand scale semi-fictionalized documentary concerning the overall logistics needed for this incredible invasion\". Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called it \"a tingling, eye-gripping, fantastic picture\" that \"must rank as the screen's most massive battle epic\". His only criticism was \"the lack of perspective in depicting the German belief that the Normandy landings might not have succeeded had Hitler not taken a sleeping pill ... 'The Longest Day' should have taken infinitely more care to put this German belief, however strongly held, into proper proportion\". Brendan Gill of The New Yorker called the film \"a tour de force of audio-visual verisimilitude,\" but confessed that \"my emotions were hardly ever engaged, and I ended, rather to my embarrassment, by being bored\". He went on, \"Mr. Zanuck made it all the harder for me to take this mock-documentary seriously by stuffing it with innumerable celebrated actors, most of whom make such fugitive appearances that the audience finds itself engaged in a distracting game of instant identification\". The Monthly Film Bulletin stated, \"The Longest Day is a monument split down the middle by compromise. At its best, what comes across very strongly is the feeling of immense and careful organisation that went into the whole D-Day operation, the sheer crippling weight of noise, the simple fact that a lot of people died, and the sense of personal confusion and dismay of soldiers wandering alone through the countryside ... But the film is, first and foremost, a spectacle, and therefore it has stars\u2014a multitude of them, often with barely a line to speak, and usually with no real part to play\".\n\nThis American epic war film, shot in black and white is based on Cornelius Ryan's 1959 non-fiction book of the same name about the D-Day landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944. This WWII film is a masterpiece in so many ways being made in 1962. Fantastic battle sequences set in Normandie and other real places, an amazing ensemble cast including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Steve Forrest, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Jeffrey Hunter, Rod Steiger, Gert Fr\u00f6be, Curd J\u00fcrgens, George Segal, Robert Wagner, Paul Anka etc, the different languages are intact in the film which is a big plus, great cinematography (the helicopter shots in the end of the film is fantastic) and with a general epic look and feel. The film won two Academy Awards and was nominated for three others. Twentieth Century-Fox was taking a gamble making this movie. At $10 million, it was a hugely daring venture, but even more risky was Cleopatra (1963), which was being filmed concurrently. This was to set Fox back the then unprecedented sum of $40 million. Although \"Cleopatra \" did well at the box office, it was simply too expensive to recoup its costs, and nearly bankrupted the studio. Fortunately, this movie turned out to be one of Fox's biggest hits and helped offset the financial damage caused by the other epic.\n\nTrivia: When cost overruns on Cleopatra (1963) threatened to force Twentieth Century-Fox to shut down production of this movie, producer Darryl F. Zanuck flew to New York City to save his project. After an impassioned speech to Fox's board, he regained control of the company he founded, ultimately finishing this movie and getting the production of \"Cleopatra\" under control. After he had spent the budgeted amount for \"The Longest Day\", he started using his own money to pay for the production. To create a more sympathetic stance to each of the different parties, producer Darryl F. Zanuck had Englishman Ken Annakin direct the British segments, the American parts were handled by American action specialist Andrew Marton, and German Bernhard Wicki took care of the scenes with the German Army officers. The film employed several Axis and Allied military consultants who had been actual participants on D-Day, and many had their roles re-enacted in the film.",

Peter Lawford, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowell, Richard Burton all have some good scenes.   Jeffery Hunter is particularly effective as a grunt who is forced into a heroic act.  The only negative, is 40 year old Red Buttons very poorly cast as a 20ish paratrooper who is in for some hammy comedy relief. That aside the movie does an excellent job showing the scope of the invasion and the confusion that ran rampant.  Very highly recommended!",

While the story is relatively cohesive and the individual characters solid, The Longest Day is still, at its core, the victim of an incredibly outdated interpretation of the epic film: throwing 500 characters at the audience with a slight wafting of screen time each, such that you can hardly remember most of them. Throwing subtitles with names as if the audience could differentiate after a three hour run time is laughable, but the phenomenon is mitigated by the fact that most simply disappear from the narrative at some point.

            "content": "The war epic is a difficult genre to nail down as they tend to go in one of two different directions with bold anti-war art films like Apocalypse Now (1979) and mainstream films that glorify war like Patton (1970). This film falls into the second category as it is packed with stars, including John Wayne of the infamous The Green Berets (1968), and is heavy on the patriotism and light on the commentary on the damaging effects that war can have. With it's all male cast and almost three hour running time this film felt like a chore to watch and that meant that I was struggling to stay awake.\n\nThe film follows the French, Americans, British and Germans as they prepare for D-Day and attempt to set up their troops so that they can defeat enemy forces in battle. The men face off on the battlefield and the Allies prevail with their victory serving as a testament to patriotism and the intelligence of their commanders.\n\nWhat takes you out of the film while also providing some interest amid the dreary discussions of battle strategy was the neverending parade of stars who pop up to play various significant historical figures. The issue is that we get so little time with them that it is hard to dissociate them from their public personas and believe them as men going into battle. With movie stars it does take a while to relax in their presence and begin to treat them not as the tabloid fodder we know them as but as whatever character they happen to be playing. When Sean Connery arrives on the beach in Normandy and announces that he is Irish despite having a thick Scottish accent we are aware that this is the man who has become famous playing James Bond and do not empathize with the very real dangers his character will face. It does not help that some of the performances in the film are truly awful with Wayne phoning it in by relying too much on his iconic voice and stature. Only Robert Mitchum and Henry Fonda deliver sensitive, natural performances as lifelong military men wary of facing off against such a well organized army. Whatever the various directors of the film were doing they certainly weren't focused on coaxing good performances out of their cast and seemed to be happy to let them rest on their laurels.\n\nThe many different directors who had a hand in shaping this film also make it feel uneven and disjointed as much like How the West Was Won (1963) the film is episodic to the extreme. Yet it does not have the fun of that film as each section is full of clich\u00e9s of the genre and the scenes of warfare quickly become monotonous. I felt only horror when the film wanted me to feel some deep sense of pride at the sight of young boys losing their lives at the hands of other men. The film never touches on the horrific actions that the Nazis are taking and most of the characters are driven by bloodlust and a vague sense of patriotism that is never entirely validated by the film. For the time the aerial sequences were probably impressive from a technical standpoint and the film did earn nominations in a lot of technical categories at the Academy Awards. Today, however most of the film's achievements have been eclipsed by later films like Saving Private Ryan (1998) leaving an empty film with little emotional appeal.\n\nThose who like this sort of big, jingoistic spectacle may take to the film but for a person like myself who does not see how anybody could love war and cannot stand watching it held up as something to marvel at it will disappoint. Going in, I had fairly low expectations but I did not expect the film to be quite so hard to get through. There needed to be something in the film that did not target specifically male audiences who thrill at the sight of violence and good old boys triumphing through use of weaponry. The film had a very narrow target audience and that audience happened to fit the demographic of most Academy members.",

We get almost 2 hours of context and introductions before the invasion, then all the action feels endless. The excessive number of leads and extras leads to you zoning out and not focusing in one the characters, but rather the events as a whole. The Longest Day does an incredible job giving you all the details of this historic conflict, but it feels like far too much. The editing is all over the place, randomly cutting from person to person, often with no regard to the audience trying to keep track of all these men. It's actually too much of a good thing.\n\nThe Longest Day can boast its meticulous recreation of D-Day's battles on the beaches of Normandy and in the towns of France, but they go on forever with everyone just going through the motions.\n\nThe acting is hit or miss. With such a large cast of famous actors, every few moments you'll be saying, \"oh, it's that guy!\" but their actual performances leave much to be desired. The Longest Day has an all star cast of legendary figures in cinema, but wastes most of them on bit parts and supporting roles. I cannot even remember most of their lines or moments.\n\nThe action is exciting, if long winded. The mini models still look neat, but the on location stuff is still excellent. The occasional green screen looks terrible and fake now. The military outfits look period accurate. The sets are massive as the battles themselves. The Longest Day is certainly a large production.\n\nOverall, The Longest Day is worth a watch as a piece of film history wherein every major movie star of the day (1962) got a small role. It's massive battles rival any war film's efforts, but the movie is bogged down with too much exposition with no feeling, constant switching of characters, bad green screen backgrounds, mediocre acting, and aimless plot. I still think The Longest Day is an enjoyable, yet flawed movie all the same.",

            "content": "The Longest Day is a massive historical drama that tells the story of D-Day.  It starts with some build-up which is extensive and loaded with different characters.  We are bounced around so frequently, that after awhile I barely even read the names on the screen because I knew I\u0092d never remember any of them.  In many ways that first act felt like an actual history lesson where we are expected to memorize dozens of notable names, titles, and other information because we\u0092ll be quizzed on it later.  I observed the accent and the uniform to figure out whose side they were on and figured that was enough for me to get by.  Once the actual battle starts it is almost non-stop war sequences.  There are a few breaks where we are sent back to the command posts to find out what\u0092s going on with the high-ranking officials, but then it\u0092s back into the trenches.  The scope of some of these battle scenes is quite impressive.  There were a number of brilliantly executed shots, and I always felt like I knew who was on what side in any given battle sequence.  The Longest Day also includes a host of famous actors who I recognized, even if I didn\u0092t know who they were playing.  Unfortunately, with such a massive host of characters, I wasn\u0092t able to connect with any of them, unless I happened to recognize the actor as someone I like.  So Richard Burton\u0092s scene is a little more poignant, not because of the way it is told, but just because I think he\u0092s a superb actor.  A little more focus on smaller details, and a little less emphasis on the grand scope would have helped this film a lot.  As it stands, I find it to be just an average war film without much to say.",

The black and white cinematography looks great, and the battle scenes are truly stunning. The film was one of the most real-feeling WWII films I've seen (despite the total lack of blood) due to the screenplay's exacting dedication to showing what preparations were made for the battle, and all the flubs and mistakes made that changed the course of the day. We all know how things ended up, but it was interesting to see what plans were being made on all sides and how each one panned out. The performances are well done, although there is not any stand outs since you generally never focus on one character for very long. My only complaint about this film is one of its strengths, that while we do get to see all sorts of characters and sides of the battle it makes it hard to latch on to any characters. I felt that even considering all the material they had to pack in that it certainly could have been cut down by about half an hour. This is by far one of the most impressive war films you could ever see, and it will give you a new sense of appreciation and gratitude for the astonishing courage these men had on that day.",

            "content": "The Longest Day (1962), directed by Darryl Zanuck is the forerunner of the big-budget war movie, with  one of the largest, most star-studded casts ever assembled, including John Wayne, Sean Connery, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Paul Anka, and Eddie Albert, to name just a few of the forty cast members. \n\nWhat makes The Longest Day significant is how it became a model for the war movies that followed, such as Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and even 2015's critically-acclaimed Fury, but what makes this film great is its attention to history. The film details events leading up to the capture of a key German-held bridge during WWII, dubbed by the British as \"Pegasus Bridge.\" The assault is led by Richard Todd's Major John Howard, a man who actually had fought at the Battle of Pegasus Bridge. Also, the film shows French Resistance fighters being air dropped into Normandy, three days before the famous American landing on D-Day, a historically correct and significant event that is often forgotten and not widely known, as well as a depiction of the scaling of the sea cliffs at Pointe Du Hoc at Normandy by Joseph Lowe who, 17 years earlier, had scaled the same cliffs as a member of 505th Army Division. \n\nWhile this film was probably spectacular by the standards of 1962, the grandeur of the spectacle will not disappoint modern audiences. The battle scenes in this movie are fantastic for their time; the film used an actual army division as stand-ins for the Omaha Beach landing, as well as two working and historically accurate battleships: the Springfield and the Little Rock. The amount of explosions in this movie make it impressive even by today's standards, but with a movie budget of 7.4 million ($57,920,293.33 in 2015 dollars), they sure could afford it. This movie was the most expensive black and white movie made until 1993, and I'd say they budgeted very well; there was a lot put into this movie and it shows. \n\nThis movie is a must see to any history buff or war movie lover.",

Featuring John Wayne, Sean Connery, Robert Mitchum, Red Buttons, Henry Fonda, and Roddy McDowall (just to name a few), the ensemble cast that's been assembled is incredible.  However, there's a bit of jingoism going on, as the Nazi's are shown mostly as incompetent and the American/British forces are selfless and brave.  There's also very little blood and carnage; which is indicative of the time in which the film was made.  Still, the coverage of the various battle fronts on the land and sea is comprehensive, and gives a sense of scope to how massive the operation was.

            "content": "The Longest Day is nothing short of a war classic, and it stands out from so many other films of its genre and time for several reasons.\nIn terms of plot, story execution and the presence of an ensemble cast, The Longest Day is clearly very I influential of the later epic war masterpiece A Bridge Too Far, yet The Longest Day isn't nearly as confusing or repetitive. As it goes through the complex development of June 6, 1944, The Longest Day ensures that all it's dramatic plot dynamics are in order and making sense, and from a technical standpoint it honestly feels ahead of its time.\nBy that I mean the cinematography is absolutely astounding. It gets up close with the characters when the dramatic tension is building within them, and it follows them well when they move through battle. It tracks them perfectly and always manages to get the perfect quantity of elements into perspective. The cinematography in The Longest Day is some of the finest I've seen in a war film ever, and it's some of the finest use of the tracking shot technique in existence as well, definitely worthy of the Academy Award it was victorious of.\nThe Longest Day is heroic but it always feels real since it touches on the intense and damaging effect of the battle in the same manner that Saving Private Ryan did decades later while covering the more human side of the soldiers the same way that The Big Red One did. It's production design is impeccable and it feels really humane, touching on both sides of the war from each perspective and pointing to the middle man in the situation too. For a John Wayne film, it isn't right wing propaganda. It's a spectacular war epic with strong drama and entertaining action which makes it a powerful visual experience which hits the viewer pretty strongly. And with the directional efforts of Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald and Darryl F. Zanuck all collaborating, The Longest Day truly had an epic production to match its epic scale which makes it a powerful all around. It tells its story very well and it never comes up short, and with a well written script and a talented cast it proves great.\nThe standouts of its ensemble cast begins with John Wayne, because despite being more familiar for his patriotic western efforts he breaks into the cast of The Longest Day without skipping a heartbeat and delivers a commanding patriotic charisma which makes him perfectly dominant for the lead part.\nHenry Fonda also makes a great splash in his brief role on screen by putting in fine line delivery and facial gestures with a real spirit in them.\nRobert Mitchum also manages to dominate the screen when on it in a likeable manner since he conveys the role of a military hero worth following as a leader without glamourising the role. He gets it just right.\nSean Connery of course is a real genial presence because his natural Scottish Charm makes him an exceptional action hero like it did when he played James Bond.\nRichard Burton was good too and Eddie Albert really nailed the dramatic heft of his character.\nRoddy McDowall was also good early on in his career.\n\nSo The Longest Day is surely a war classic, an action classic and a cinematic classic in general.",

The Longest Day pulls no punches, and shows the viewers not just the Airborne Operations and Beach Landings, but the strategy and planning that went into Operation Overlord. Such as British troops using \"dummy\" solders to confuse the German troops and the Allied high command contacting the French resistance to cripple German communications and transportation. Everything we take for granted about war movies nowadays such, Military and Historical advisors was started by this film. Another one the films main strengths is not showing the German Officers in France as mostahce twirling stero-types but as solders following orders, much like their allied counter-parts.  Something that very few movies about World War 2 have done since. Along with an A-List cast, including John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, and Sean Connery to name just some of the star power behind this gem of the silver screen, The Longest Day cements itself as a true landmark film in an era when movies about World War 2 where being used as propaganda films to get young men to join the armed forces. However the movie is a bit long, and despite the fact the I recomend it highly. If your'e looking for a action packed war flick filled with blood, guts, and explosions you might be better off watching Saving Private Ryan because The Longest Day is a for a very niche market nowadays if you like history then is movie is for you, but if you just want action, action, and more action then you'll most likely find first half of the movie a more than a little boring. Which is sad because most modern movie goers just want to see an action packed blockbuster rather than something historically sound. But I digress The Longest Day is a film that I do recomend very highly, not just for the history behind this flick but because it makes the viewer thankful that there where and still are people ready to stand against tyranny.\n\nIf wen't for them I would probably writing this review with a different tone, and I would be writing this review in German.",

One that shows the Germans' perspective, for which they demonstrate some concern, but are also fairly positive that they can resist this takedown. Another perspective by the French, for which Normandy is obviously located, shows their worry of the overall operations. Then, there is the one of the English, who is closely associated with the United States in their operations. Finally, the United States' point of view, for which we find most of the all-star cast, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, and many, many other stars. They enter Normandy with leadership conflict, fear, and enthusiasm. Despite its length, the movie is compelling from start to finish. One of its assets is the fact that sections revolving both the Germans and French personnel are in their respective language with English subtitles, rather than just in English. As well, we also get all these perspectives as the film unfolds and the beginning of the movie does not start out with the American perspective, but the German. The battle scenes are also very good. Could have been potentially bad, as it is around 50 years old, but ended being really well done.",

            "content": "A day with this film on has got to be the longest day. Don't get me wrong, I love a good war movie, and almost all of these films' long lengths work, but seriously people, I don't know how many times we have to watch people walk around and blow each other up here and there for three hours. One can only imagine how long the war film that actually covers the highlight of an entire war would be. If it's just highlights, then it would probably be shorter, because these war films that we do actually have run about the span of an entire war. Hey, if that's the case, then hand me my rifle and send me back to the trenches, because I'm hooked on the thrills of war... movies. I don't know why I would need a rifle; maybe it would just be for my suicide plan, just in case the war movie they show is \"The Thin Red Line\", because although I liked the film, well, seriously Terrence, that's too much of a snoozefest... I said having made plans to watch the film a third time somewhere down the \"line\" (Sorry, but pun definately intended). Still, even though that film was a mess, it's still certainly better than this film, which isn't to say that this film is bad, though it is to say that it is more of a mess.\r\n\r\nRunning 178 minutes with limited material, padding with superfluous, excess material is to be expected, yet padding is least of this film's worries when it comes to tightness, even though you know that they would have pump an extra large dose of excess material in this film to even out the many rushed spots. With all of these many subplots and characters in this massive, star-studden cast, few, if any are developed, and almost all of them are rushed past points of exposition at one point or another. Actually, come to think of it, nevermind the few in \"few, if any\", because if they were to extensively develop one subplot, then they'd pretty much be setting up everyone's, seeing as these stories are all so very similiar, with only enough distinctions for you be thrown off when the stories transition into each other jarringly. Still, what might bother me the most about this film is that it's just so slow, quiet and dry in atmosphere, lacking enough of the oomph and intrigue in the substance to sustain your attention for the mammoth runtime. It's all so very messy, underwhelming and borderline boring, with ambitions going squandered in many regards, and that's enough to make a film like this mediocre, at best. However, this is an ultimately better film than that, and I'm not just saying that because I keep believing in the immortal concept of \"Three hours, I better like it\". The film leans closer to failed ambition and successful, but the film knows how to pick the right compontents to supplement that ambition to where every slip up finds its fall broken, whether it be through the writing or production.\r\n\r\nFor the time, this action was something to behold, and to this day, it remains impressive, because it's during those moments where this ensemble of directors really wake up and deliver on tension and thrills by manipulating the dynamic staging of the action, as well as the fine production designs and handsome cinematography to produce classic action composed of both style and substance that manages to hold up today. Of course, although this film is so much D-Day, the story substance remains more prominent, and if you're story is going to be overlong and messily-executed, it still better be a worthy one. Well, sure enough, this script, while plagued, is extremely original in its concept of multiple story angles in the midst of war alone. Still, that's not the only inventive concept within this story, because where most war epics tell us of the tales on the battlefield, and almost always the American side of it, this film explores the sidelines, studying on the verbal tension that determines most every battle and stage during wartime, and does it all while showing us every side of the battlefield, without bias and with intellegence, which isn't to say that you don't get plenty of intimacy with the poor suckers going out there to die for their country. I really wish that the story was used to its full potential, yet it's still very worthy and inventive, and if you see this film for no other reason, see it for its refreshing concepts, if not its using a star-studded cast of classic actors, for the most part, to good use. From John Wayne - who's playing himself again, but still doing is pretty well - to Sean Connery - who showed up... somewhere -, the film is pumped with star after star and they all charm, if not impress a little bit here and there. The cast is broad and colorful, showing you why most every person in it was then or went on the be the classic stars that they are today, and while the massive cast seems to further bloat the film out of proportions, they also serves as key components to its ultimately being generally watchable, through all of its many faults.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the indeed long day, expected padding plagues the film, though not as much a rushed moments that dilute exposition, as well as the compellingness already tainted by dry storytelling, yet what raises this film well above its potential mediocrity is its sharp production, worthy and highly unconventional storyline, as well as a massive cast of across-the-board charmers or classic stars, ultimately leaving \"The Longest Day\" a fairly watchable dramatisation of D-Day, both on and off the battlefield and American grounds.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

The film tells who is who and what location is what with facts and some fictional stuff. We see commandoes of all sides making the preparation of the attack and defense. Heck, we even go underground the French resistance is at. This entire prelude leads up to the invasion where we go from the beaches (yes, Omaha included) to the paratroopers doing the leap of faith.

With a slew of big names including Henry Fonda, Sean Connery, and the Duke himself, whose character broke his ankle landing and told the medic to put his boot back on real tight, has to be one of the best John Wayne scenes I have seen.

Quite long but more accurate than say \"Saving Private Ryan\" since it's not just the Americans that went into that particualr battle but other countries as well, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Poland, Norway, Greece, Poland and the United States!   Like Oscar winner \"The Hurt Locker\", theirs no storyline to describe but just to state one of histories longest battles!  Another one of the highlights are the appearances of several well known actors including Robert Mitchum, John Wayne, Richard Burton, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, singer Paul Anka, to name a few!   My only beef is that their is more talking than action!\r\n\r\nWon 2 Oscars out of 5 including \"Best Cinamatography Black and White\" and \"Special Effects\"\r\n\r\n3 out of 4",

The cast features John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Mitcham, Sean Connery and teen-star Fabian.  All of these individuals give memorable performances. The most significant performance comes from John Wayne, who is the commander of the 82nd Airborne. The epic story is large in scope, however, flows according to the events of the day. The viewer feels for each individual and their contributions to the D-Day Invasion as well as the frustration of the German invaders in being unable to stop the Allies because of Hitler's decisions. The film is both entertaining and educational. The filmmaking was extremely excellent for it's time. It featured several special effects and excellent aerial and crane shots, which were rare for the time. The thing that is lacking in this film is the realism found in other films. It is occasionally \"cheesy'\" and \"gung ho\" but it is a film of its time. The film is extremely long. It does encompass entire day, the \"longest\" day. The length of the film may affect the patience of the viewer.",

            "content": "Without question this is one of the greatest movies about World War II ever made. At 3 hours long, it is also possibly one of the longest however, the structure of the movie means it never gets dull to watch.\nThe story of the D-Day landings is told as a series of short tales involving set piece action or back office continuity so that as the movie unfolds, the viewer can keep a handle on the progress of the battle. Interwoven between these brief stories, are longer threads dealing with more involved plot development.\nThe cast reads like a 'Who's Who?' of the acting profession in the early 60s with appearances from Richard Todd, George Segal, Richard Burton, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Leslie Philips, Henry Fonda, Roddie McDowall, Gert Fr\u00c3\u00b6be, Rod Steiger to name but a few. Both Robert Mitchum (playing a typical cigar chewin' General) and John Wayne have longer threads throughout the movie and i suppose could be called the leading characters but this really is a true company piece and it is amazing how even with the briefest of appearances the tales of the soldiers and individuals become etched into the memory. You really do care about these people and their plight thanks to a masterful script and brilliant direction.\nI've seen this film many times and some scenes have stuck with me. In particular, Red Buttons as the hapless parachutist who becomes entangled on a church spire and can only watch as the rest of his squad are shot down as they miss their allotted landing zone due to an error. Also, the jubilant French civilian greeting the British forces with a bottle of champagne on the beach or the female resistance fighter grappling with a Nazi soldier to try to prevent him raising the alarm that a railway line is about to be blown up.\nThis film doesn't focus on any one particular aspect of the landings but tries to tell the broader picture. As such, it involves the navy, army and airforce of the Allied Forces. What was almost revolutionary at the time was it also bought in the stories of the German soldiers and their commanding officers, dealing with some of them in an atypically sensitive manner. Indeed, you feel as much empathy and sympathy for the German soldiers shot by an American soldier because he doesn't understand they are trying to surrender as you do for the Allied soldiers gunned down on the beaches.\nThis is a masterful piece of cinema that has stood the test of time very well indeed.",

Today's viewer, however, may not find its kudos entirely earned/deserved. Well recommended are the battle-recreation scenes, some vast/wide, some quite up-close and personal. This is the content that makes the film truly epic - and fast-tracked the film to Blu-Ray. \n\nAppropriately Cinemascope, but why Zanuck shot in B&W is anyone's guess. \n\nThe viewer's also rewarded through the film's ensembling of nearly 100 first-tier and second-tier actors. Even a few 1960s teen-idols were thrown in for good measure. Few films offer as many brief glimpses of mid-Century talent as this. \n\nThere's a grand illusion of content accuracy - subtitling continuously yields the names of who's-doing-what, information sourced from the heavily-researched underlying 1959 novel - shooting's on historical and/or authentic locations - and the story's told in a fair, balanced perspective from all sides of the conflict, generally using ethnically-correct actors and languages. \n\nWhen it comes to dialogue and characterization, however, there's mostly heavy fictionalization intended to facilitate American flag-waving and cheat-beating. The time's long gone by when a viewer will be awe-struck in admiration by hearing John Wayne stupidly demand mid-battle that death be risked to respectfully cut dead paratroopers down out of the trees. Or by Peter Lawford ordering his bag-piper to strike up while the Scots march along standing straight and in-the-open under fire. \n\nWith that sort of content, the film does drag along, and it comes in long at three hours. \n\nStill, it's recommended for its battle-scene visuals and look-sees over a ton of mid-Century talent.",

The war just happens to an extraordinary challenge to the outcome of our real plot, an un-natural threat to our happy couple, or a crucible of fire for our heroes to get their issues sorted out, and a gigantic classroom to teach our characters the True Meaning of (loyalty/sacrifice/humanity/equality/justice ... whatever)\r\n\r\nThe Longest Day is one of the very rare movies that actually thinks that a part of World War II (The D-Day invasion)  makes for a good story in and of itself. And it does. Almost every major character is an historical personage, and can generally be divided into two types of characters - the generals who give orders and worry about their men, and the soldiers who execute orders and hope to live through it.\r\n\r\nComparisons between this and Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan are, I suppose inevitable, and the verisimilitude of The Longest Day suffers a little from it's many deaths being bloodless. (one particular shot is when a US paratrooper comes under fire from a heavy weapon --- which causes nothing by teeny tiny firecrackers to pop on his vest).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, for all out strategy and tactics, TLD provides a much better presentation of the assault on D-Day, not just on Omaha beach, but Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword as well.

It lacks the realism of Saving Private Ryan but showed more detail of the various assaults such as the one on the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. Some curious filmmaking can be seen, such as an abrupt cut by the seaside when a character is in the scene and then the scene changes to the same background without the character. I like how the characters spoke in their native languages, and the film being black and white I think helped enhance the realism.",

The arial photography of pitched battles on beaches and in towns is alone worth the price of admission, along with the sheer scale of many of the battle scenes, but there are also several set pieces which really manage to hit an emotional mark and highlight the futility of war. Lots of fun to be had picking all of the famous faces on board too.",

This is one of the most epic, oneThe allied landing in Normandy is almost certainly the moment, in the whole World War II, that was most often taken to the cinema. There are, therefore, a lot of films about it. Some are better, others worse. This is one of the most epic, one of the most expensive and one of the best.I'm not going to waste time explaining what the D Day was because 95% of the people who are going to read this review know what happened there, and the few who still don't know, I advise, should do some reading about it before taking this film. This is because the film does not waste time on explanations either. The script, written by Cornelius Ryan, has serious problems: it is quite clear that the whole effort was focused on reporting, very meticulously and rigorously (as far as I was able to see) the landing and its previous arrangements. One thing I really liked was to see several nationalities and military forces that, alongside the British and Americans, also take part of D-Day: the Scots, the Irish, the free French (I miss the Canadians)... but everything that goes beyond the landing report, and which is also part of a good movie script, has been undervalued: the construction of the characters was limited to a series of sketches, when they are not caricatures, the dialogues are clich\u00e9 or sound absurd and, moreover, the film has no story to tell that goes beyond the war story. It is the epic \"documentary film\" of war, at its best.Another problem with the film is that its a nest of highly regarded movie stars who practically limit themselves to appearing and saying something. It is eye-catching for the audience, and the camera work tried to echo that with frontal shots from that stars, but it sucks for the plot because we are seeing the actor So-and-so, not the character he plays. Among the actors that appear in the film we can mention Eddie Albert, Paul Hartmann, Robert Ryan, Curd J\u00fcrgens, George Segal, Richard Burton, Hans Christian Blech. I especially liked the work of Henry Fonda, as the Teddy Roosevelt's son, eager to honor his father's name and memory, and to see Sean Connery, still quite unknown (the first 007 film premiered in the same year as this one) playing the role of a simple Scottish soldier, with touches of British humor. John Wayne is good, but he always seemed to me like a very theatrical actor and his characters sound artificial.Despite all this, this film had the full commitment of its directors, who through it wanted to honor the men who fought that day, winners and losers. That is meritorious. The film has excellent cinematography and an exceptional film and camera work, worthy of the Oscar for Best Black-and-White Cinematography, which won that year. The special, visual and sound effects that were used are also really well done and look great (Best Special Effects it was another Oscar that this film collected). The film has great sets and costumes and an excellent post-production work, where the commitment of all involved is perfectly felt. There is no scene or sequence that seems to be over, or out of place. The film is long, in fact, it is three hours in length, but if the audience gets carried away it will not be a problem.Technically extraordinary, this film makes a remarkable account of the military events it portrays. But the flaws in the script, the poor construction of characters and dialogues, the constant parade of famous actors with nothing to do hurt the final product.",
