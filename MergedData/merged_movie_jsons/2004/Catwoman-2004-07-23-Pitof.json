            "content": "I do much prefer Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman,a manipulative character with a crave for jewellery, not emphasised enough in this instalment, but not entirely missed. Unlike some people, I liked Halle Berry in the title role, I liked the scene where she cuts off her hair and revealed her real self. Somehow she didn't look right with all that hair over her face. When she was Catwoman, she looked very sexy in that leather outfit. Now the script was weak at times, but I really liked the overall look of the film, with the splendid sets. The special effects were a bit ropey, and others where it looked part-animated, or like the Matrix, but they're weren't the weakest part of the movie, that was the script, which seemed rather muddled and trite. The supporting players, particularly Sharon Stone weren't that bad, and while slow-moving and predictable at times, neither was the plot. All in all, a fairly watchable movie, not the best superhero movie, but not the worst(Batman and Robin). 6/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "...how movies like this get rushed into theaters.I honestly believe that when the idea of a Catwoman movie came across someone's desk several years back, it was a good idea. Unfortunately what turned up in theaters in 2004 was this mess! Having never picked up a Catwoman comic book, I cannot judge the film on that background. Knowing only of the old Batman TV show from the 60's, the 90's Cartoon and the brilliant portrayal by Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's exceptional Batman Returns in 1992. That's all I really have to go on.However, this 2004 update on the character is flawed. Halle Berry is awkwardly cast as the lead. Her screen presence was boring and lacked any real motivation.With 3 writers, it is no wonder the story goes in all directions, never sticking to one line for too long. It is disjointed and incomplete. It almost seems the script was written just to have CGI fight sequences and Berry in that silly (though hot) costume! Pitof, as director strings together a film that has no real entertainment value. Though many scenes are shot beautifully, I do not see where he treated the character of Catwoman as the focal point. It just seems like he was making a movie - nothing more nothing less.All in all the film is bland. Trite. Scripted weakly. Sloppily acted. Well, you get the idea.Long live the days when Michelle Pfeiffer wore the Catwoman costume. She truly demonstrated the characteristics of a true Feline Femme Fatale. She holds ranks with the women that have portrayed Catwoman - Berry, though I love her, does not! 2 out of 10",

            "content": "24 July 2004. I had doubts, but Halle Berry makes a perrrfect catwoman with her moves and feline behavior. Though a terrible basketball player that stunt doubles or special effects can't hide, her transformation into Catwoman is one of the best personality changes besides The Fly. The action is good, Sharon Stone's script is a little weak though it's good to see her back. The ending is suggestive of Spiderman. Halle isn't so much erotic or sexual as sensual as she herself has described. There isn't so much sex as wild, unbridled heated freedom with enhanced senses. I would think perhaps, this movie might be too threatening for men and a bit out of the box for women. Yet, as a movie - the transformation of the independence of cats into a inhibited, passive women into her own is a powerful message and experience that Catwoman manages to capture.

I was surprised to see a lot of bad reviews here and the fact this film was one of the worst superhero movies ever made.I think more likely some people didn't like the movie because the Cat woman costume was pretty revealing and that the film didn't have Batman involved in it. I suppose it would be good to see Batman. Although I was disappointed that the DC logo didn't appear at the beginning and the city wasn't Gotham. I don't know why they wanted to just keep the whole thing modern, I mean OK but really what about the Batman/Catwoman hardcore fans? Did they ever think about them too? Suppose not.I liked how the film had a lotta action and I swear, Halle Berry really was a great choice to play a flirty anti-superhero. She was stunning like omg, I would love her body haha",

            "content": "The reputation of Catwoman really goes before it. And unless you have been living in a cave, you will know that that reputation is not good. Halle Berry famously actually turned up to the Razzies to collect the worst actress award for this (hats off to her for that), although she then used it as a platform to blame her agent for getting her involved in the film \u2013 could she not have read the script herself? (Hats that were taken off for her are put back on again). Anyway, it almost doesn't need to be said that this is a pretty obviously clunky and shoddy film in many ways, with cheesy scenes around every corner. It has a bad script, poor direction and not very good acting. It's not helped much if you think back to earlier depictions of Catwoman from Lee Meriwether (Batman: The Movie (1966)) or Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns (1992)), both of whom were effortlessly cool, slinky and sexy, whereas Berry just\u0085isn't so much.However, this is still a pretty watchable bit of nonsense. I have no idea how much it deviates from the actual comic-book character, as I know nothing about this. But it moves along at a good pace and we have a string of ridiculous scenes to appreciate as we go. It's not really helped by the fact that Catwoman really does not have a proper adversary to fight against but this is, like I say, down to poor writing. Berry is still decent fun to watch and the film is overall entertaining in a really daft way. It should really have been better though, given the potential.",

If you see this movie and are over the age of 16, you will end up hating yourself for letting yourself rot for 104 minutes without getting anything back, except an increased feeling of wanting to get revenge on Hollywood. They say that it is very hard to get your script into a movie. Well, after seeing this movie, I think a one legged monkey could write a better script, without either pen or paper. The fact that Halle Berry even uses a male stunt double, makes me loose all respect for both her and this movie. Besides the stunt double thing, the movie still sucks. The dialog sucks, the acting is not even present and the action looks sloppy and poorly thought through. This movie actually made me like The Core better, which is pretty much impossible.

            "content": "I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards \"Catwoman,\" for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world. In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products. When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen. However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.The best parts of \"Catwoman\" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her. It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society. Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well. Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie. Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her \"fading\" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"). Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film. Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me. And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long. The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable \"Catwoman\" turned out to be.",

Halle Berry in the beginning of the movie seems to be so out of beauty and confidence, but after becoming the catwoman, she turns to be the hottest girl around. She is very sexy and the soundtrack surely helps it. The only problem concerns the last scenes, when Catwoman and Laurel are fighting: Lauren is beaten to death and she doesn't even bleed... the director should have noticed the lack of blood in these last scenes. But after all it's such a great movie which hero's lovers should see as soon as they can ;)",

            "review_title": "I loved it!",
            "content": "Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a visual artist who is stuck working in the advertising division of a large beauty product manufacturer, Hedare. When she acquires information that could potentially put the company out of business, they try to dispose of her. Because she had previously, unwittingly passed a \"test\", however, she is saved by a group of cats and transformed into a Catwoman.First, let me note that I loved this film. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. Since I'm well aware that most critics, professional and amateur alike, have trashed this film, I'll focus on why I thought it was so good. Maybe this will help some new viewers consider giving it a look, and possibly encourage some reevaluation by those who have already seen the film.The script immediately drew me into the film, and although I'm male, I identified with Patience. I'm also a visual artist. I have also worked for a company similar to Hedare in the past (although a much smaller and less nefarious beauty product company). I lived in an apartment that looked, on the outside, almost exactly the same as Patience's apartment complex. I also had neighbors who night after night played loud music or television until three or four a.m., while I first tried to block out the sound in any way that I could, then asked politely for them to turn the music down, and so on, until I finally called the cops on them so I could get some sleep.Not that I need to identify with a character to like a film, but that made this one have extra resonance with me in the beginning. Additionally, I was immediately drawn in by the fantastic cinematography and set design. Those kinds of things are just as important in a movie as the story is. Film is a visual and aural artform. The whole package is important. Creative, attractive visuals such as those in Catwoman are part of the package.The script, including the subtexts, worked well for me. Catwoman is a film about discovering identities, peeling away literal and metaphorical masks, and the difference between various stages of public versus private \"faces\". That the plot is centered on a beauty product manufacturer, then, is perfect. These themes permeate every aspect of the film. For example, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is continually peeling away the appearances of Patience, throughout the length of the film, and Patience is doing the same for herself--discovering her \"true self\". I can't think of a scene that doesn't touch on this theme in some way. That's very clever and thought-provoking scriptwriting, and it doesn't end there. There are also themes about femininity cleverly woven through the film, for example.I thought the cast did a fantastic job. Berry is great as a Catwoman, and subtly referenced most of the previous screen Catwomen. She also incorporated a lot of crafty cat-like behavior. I enjoyed the supporting cast, especially Alex Borstein as Patience's friend, Sally. The effects worked well for me, and at times they were also very subtle and clever, such as Catwoman's whip representing a tail in many shots (most of this was achieved via digital effects). I was also impressed with the creativity and different approach of many of the fight scenes. It was nice to see Brazilian martial arts incorporated for a change.Some of the negative criticism probably stems from a kind of purism that is disproportionately found among comic book fans when it comes to comic book films. I'm not much of a purist, but in any event, for anyone paying close attention, you'd note that Berry's character isn't supposed to be Selina Kyle. In the mythology of as presented here, \"Catwoman\" isn't a lone token, but a type. Patience is just another instantiation of a long line of catwomen. So departures from previous portrayals of Selina Kyle aren't relevant, even if we believed that filmmakers were obligated in some way to previous depictions of the \"same\" fictional characters (which I don't believe, not being a purist).Catwoman is worth a (second) chance if you can leave some of your preconceptions at the door and if you're prepared to think a bit about a comic book film.",

After watching this movie, my answer will now be Catwoman with Halle Berry in the role. Dressed in a sultry and revealing leather costume with a body as lithe as a cat and a sultry demeanor, she embodies sensuality. Unlike the earlier version that was a super villain, this iteration is fighting evil, specifically a cosmetic company that is about to release a new product. Their research has demonstrated that the product is dangerous to use, but the lure of massive profits is too great.\nThe movements of Catwoman are a triumph of special effects, she leaps and walks on narrow surfaces like a cat and sometimes eats like a starved animal. Action scenes are intense and amazing to watch without there being too much smashing and bashing. Catwoman relies more on her avoidance skills than she does on simply whacking on her opponents.\nThere is a dynamic love interest along with a best female friend that adds significant humor to the movie. The friend is not a sidekick in the usual sense, just a friend with a humorous bent that helps keep the alter ego of Catwoman thinking and acting like a human female.\nThis is a fun movie to watch, one of the few superhero movies where women will enjoy the chic-flick aspects.",

Yep,in terms of 2004's most major cinematic disaster,Catwoman was,well,not to put too fine a pun on it,the cat that got the cream.Opening to abominable reviews,from everyone from Empire to Zoo magazine,it was ushered out of cinemas during the 'summer blockbuster' period almost as quickly as it was released.It then placed it's lead star in the embarrassing position of accepting a razzie award having earned an Oscar for her devastating turn in Monster's Ball only a few years earlier.It is a pretty dreadful film,but there are arguably a lot worse.It's main problem is the story,which is so uninteresting,but the same could be said of the action on display.Also,this is a film that's managed a pretty notorious achievement.It makes Halle Berry look unsexy.The first suit we see her strutting around in is okay and fairly pleasing to the eye,but the main one (the one she's in on the poster) is really unsexy and unflattering.If you want to engage your curiosity value,go right ahead,but I hope you know what you're letting yourself in for.**",

            "content": "I scored a free ticket to this movie, and I thought, hey, I've wasted my whole life up to now, what's another hundred and forty-one minutes? After all, I have a higher tolerance for crap than most people, and, once in a while, I like to see something that completely sucks. According to the critics and to voters on IMDb, Catwoman is supposed to suck bad. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, the movie really doesn't suck. I mean, yeah, it sucks, but it hardly plumbs the depths of true suckitude. Currently it sits at #35 on the IMDb bottom 100, but I can think of way more than 34 other movies that suck far worse than Catwoman. It is much more fair to say that it is a mediocre, perhaps slightly below average, action film. It has a few pros and lots of cons. The cons first: 1) The jumpy editing is awful. 2) Way too much CGI. Same problem with the 500 pound gorilla comic book movie out right now, as well. CGI is probably the worst thing ever to happen to cinema; it's hard to believe people are worshiping a technique that looks more fake than stop-motion. 3) Benjamin Bratt is a horrible actor, and the ugliest handsome man I've ever seen. 4) How the f*ck did Alex Borstein land a movie role? She should be doomed to die on MAD TV, the longest running train wreck of a show ever. 5) Crappy, crappy script. The pros: 1) The film looks wonderful, even though that's due mostly to the CGI (I guess when it's making buildings and inanimate objects like that, it's not so bad). The costume design, even apart from the Catwoman outfit. And if they gave out Oscars to hair stylists, the ones who worked on this film would have no competition. 2) Sharon Stone \u0096 not a great performance, by any means. Her character is downright silly, perhaps even nonsensical. But she's gorgeous and has a great presence. She makes a really boring villain somewhat more interesting. 3) Duh! Halle Berry! She might not have the best ability to choose roles. Perhaps she's just obsessed with money, and now that she's got a statuette, she's going to do everything in her power to become a billionaire. Whatever you can say about her, she's a great actress. Last year, she brought Gothika up a notch, and she does a lot to make Catwoman more entertaining than it ought to be. She plays the characters' two halves, the sweet, insecure girl and the dominatrix, very well. And, come on, I'd be lying if I said I didn't go to the movie because I thought Berry would be walking around in a leather outfit for a good portion of the movie. And, damn, she's hot. This makes the movie watchable, if nothing else. There's a shot where the camera circles Berry from toe to head right after she first dons the Catwoman which was worth the price of me embarrassing myself by handing my free pass over to the cute little theater girl at the counter. 5/10.",

It's not the greatest but it was a hell of a lot more watchable than its current IMDb of 3.3 suggest so no qualms about giving it a tactical 10 to bump it up a bit.The problem as such? I'm going to come right out and say it - this is a chick's version of a superhero movie. Catwoman is not really macho, she's not really that violent. The subplot is about personal growth but not in the becoming a demigod or Bruce Wayne to batman way. ...By the end of the film catwoman character \"knows herself\". That could only count as a finale in a female oriented movie! Having said that - I'm not blind - it is a fairly weak movie. In truth probably say 5.5 on IMDb norms. I think the reason it gets marked down is the disappointment of the fanboys that all the usual male-oriented themes are missing. That's why it equally erroneously gets a 1 so often - just disappointment and a bit of how dare you mess with \"our\" DC universe.Well don't believe that nonsense. It wasn't great but it was bad either and I was mildly entertained. Just watch it.",

I'll see this movie again and I'll get the DVD or blu-ray when it will be possible. Many movies are underrated and would deserve better treatment by critic and public opinion.

            "content": "You should not sit down to watch a movie as fun as Catwoman and expect to see a masterpiece such as The Godfather or Casablanca played out on screen. It is a full-throttle and entertaining leisure view with a far from perfect, but interesting story and Halle Berry is simply amazing as Catwoman, in my honest opinion. One mistake I have actually seen a few ignorant people make though is that Patience Phillips is not the Catwoman that has been played out in the Batman phenomenon, she is a version of the essence/character that is Catwoman, and in any matter she is a damn fine one at that. She might not be the best portrayal of the character in Catwoman history, since so many think that is so, and she might be the worst, but that doesn't mean she is bad and she is unable to be found enjoyable.I don't care if this film stuck to the original characterizations of Catwoman or not anyway. It does not make the character of Catwoman out to be the villain or the superhero, just the figure that is Catwoman who strives for what she desires and in the end it's what I really enjoy about it. It seems like working hard for what she wants is what Catwoman is all about anyway, so doesn't that stay true to what people have been familiar with from Catwomen in the past in some way? The plot is the worst aspect, but not bad. What kind of plot were people really expecting from a film called \"Catwoman\" and there had been no confirmations that it had anything to do with Batman? It really doesn't matter, because when the cast played out the scenes all the problems it has fade away, in my opinion, for how delightful and exciting they manage to be.Some final thoughts are that it had excellent action, great outfits and was overall a hell of a fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. It's entertainment value and flair makes up for what it lacks in solidity and depth, but most don't believe it has any value whatsoever. In any matter, I enjoy it every time I watch it. The performances are fantastic for what it set out to do regardless of what Halle Berry said at the Razzies. Why would an actor/actress try to boast themselves when excepting a Razzie anyway? Her catsuit was sexy! I love this movie, as do other people, it is just that the hate shadows the required appreciation it receives from the minority of viewers.",

            "content": "Oh, where to start...imagine all the intellectual depth of Showgirls, plus all the excessive and ridiculous special effects of Charlie's Angels, and then throw in some dialog crafted by whomever wrote for Governor Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman movie, and only then are you even close to a movie as awful as this.I suppose one should not expect much from a director who actually refers to himself as Pitof. But let's come back to that. Let's move on to Halle Berry. Note to Halle Berry: Letting Billy Bob Thornton ream you endlessly on camera is certainly degrading, but it was also a good career move--and you won an Oscar; feverishly eating catnip and licking people's faces on camera, however, is not a good career move--and you'll probably win a Razzie this time. They make you return Oscars for movies like this. Oh yeah, as for the supernatural explanation for Patience Phillips/Catwoman's superhero status--she gets CPR from an immortal Egyptian cat--I am not kidding.And then there is Benjamin Bratt, who happens to be a pretty solid actor, but could have very likely damaged a good career. If his participation in this movie isn't enough to stigmatize him, then I'm sure he had to pass up a lot of good roles because of all the time he spent having his foot surgically removed from his former agent's rectum. There is a scene in this movie--probably the worst, and that's no small achievement--that is reminiscent of that ridiculous scene in Daredevil where Jennifer Garner/Elektra and Ben Affleck/blind superhero have a Kung Fu fight at a playground in broad daylight; in this movie it's Halle Berry and Ben Bratt playing one-on-one hoops and her doing Catwoman flips and yet no one appears to be too amazed by this, much less pants-soiling surprised, and on top of that it has a sort of VH1/Color Me Bad/early New Edition video feel to it. And I'm really not sure what city this is all supposed to take place in--Gotham, Metropolis, the land beneath the whole in the cutting room floor--but apparently this place only has one detective, the unfortunate Bratt. No matter what the crime is--burglary, murder, domestic disturbance, interrupted ballet performance--he's always there.As for the rest of the cast, that annoying woman from Mad TV--I know that's not specific enough; I mean the most annoying one who plays what I guess is supposed to be some bizarre Asian lady--well, she plays Catwoman's annoying and sort of slutty co-worker comic relief since Rosie O'Donnell was apparently unavailable.And then we come to Sharon Stone. Now I know her career is going down the crapper with all deliberate speed, but it's still hard to understand this one. The only thing I can guess is that the opportunity to break into silly, pseudo-feminist diatribes made this a role she couldn't turn down. Of course Sharon has often lamented the lack of good roles for older women in Hollywood, and she's absolutely right about that, but this is not the best way to lodge a complaint, and plus that's always been a little peculiar coming from an actress whose greatest cinematic achievement is the conspicuous exposure of her labia.Briefly back to this Pitof character--I thought that pretentious one-named idiot who did the Charlie's Angels movies--McG, I believe--was bad enough, but this guy is even more shameless and obviously lacking in talent. What's with these guys who've never made a movie and are already going by only one name? Don't you have to work up to that? I mean if is Scorsese wants to go by Marty, fine; if Tarantino wants to be just Quentin, or even just Q, whatever, but where does a hack like this get off using one name? This movie deserves every Razzie it receives, and while some reviewers may say it's not really that bad, remember, it took a lot of money to make this godawful thing, and if people don't speak out about how dreadful it really is, they just might make Catwoman 2. Can you live with that?",

Actually if you look at the film in pieces its pretty good, unfortunately you have to look at it all at once on the big screen, which means that this movie is a car wreck.The film looks good. Pitof, the director, is a former visual effects director so he knows how to make things look good. I love his first feature, Vidocq, and this film reminds me of that film with its wild moving camera, but here it doesn't always work. I have the sense that Pitof knew it wasn't going to work and got lost in his own thing.The biggest flaw in this film is the script. The writing is cartoony, but not  real. Everything that is said and happens seems off the rack as if this was put together by committee. Actually that's what I think happened, everyone putting in something but allowing no central vision to hold it all together. My guess it was the studio heads who really were calling the shots and putting things together according to a check list. Bad mistake since nothing fits together except fleetingly. The acting is okay, but the central casting of Halle Berry was wrong. She's not bad, indeed she is hyper-sexy at times, but she doesn't come across as tough as she really should. She comes off like a young girl playing dress up, who knows none of it is real. Thats great if you're in a bedroom, but not when we have to feel for our heroine.I don't blame her, someone should have seen that she wasn't working and removed her. Its not her fault that she isn't believable since she gives it her best shot. She has to learn to pick her roles or her career is over.This is a film made by a group of talented people who should have known better. They should have seen this wasn't working and corrected it before it was too late.3 out of 10.PS Sharon Stone is too good as the villain.

            "content": "Contrary to the movie's general horrible reputation, I actually enjoyed watching this movie. This film is probably \"Catwoman\" in name only, a departure from her true purpose as the sly, sometimes evil, cat burglar, as intended by DC Comics and creator Bob Kane. In this movie, we have Patience Phillips, played by Halle Berry, stumbling upon a plot to get people to buy this beauty cream; you keep on using it, your skin is smooth and strong like marble, and if you stop using it, your skin disintegrates. At the course of the events afterward (I do not want to provide any spoilers), Phillips becomes Catwoman.Catwoman's mission to foil the villain's plot portrays her as an actual hero in the movie, rather than the crafty cat burglar she originally is in the comic book. This probably upset true comic book fans, for Catwoman was not given her true form in this film, contrary to what what Michelle Pfieffer did to the role in \"Batman Returns.\" Pfeiffer delivered a solid performance as Catwoman and stayed true to form-portrayed as a burglar and a nemesis to Batman, but also has a love interest for the Cape Crusader and reluctant at times to commit crimes, making her more like an anti-hero rather than a villain. Berry portrayed the character more like a superhero, and bears almost no resemblance to the comic book character. In addition, probably the movie's sometimes cheesy dialog and campy special effects contributed to this film's poor reviews. Aside from that, I personally think the action is quite good, the movie is fast-paced, the plot is followed well, the subplot of how a woman can turn into a Catwoman is interesting and Sharon Stone gave a quite devious performance as the villain. The only problem I had was that her role was not emphasized enough; the producers should of depicted her actually showing her crafty self and committing evil deeds, like the villains did in the Batman movies.In addition, a picture of Michelle Pfieffer in her Catwoman outfit was briefly seen in Orphelia Powers' house, which meant that Patience Phillips is merely \"another\" Catwoman.Overall, a pretty exciting and action-packed movie. My favorite scene is when Berry storms into her neighbor's apartment, furious of his overbearing parties, silences everybody by squirting water in his loudspeakers and jumps on him.So, with this movie, you may like it, you may detest it. I just treat this as a movie involving another Catwoman in the Batman/DC Ccmics universe.Grade B-",

Enjoy it.Yes, I know that the critics of the day (2004) did not see it that way but time-specific gestalt is not the mission of the reviewer to decipher. A reviewer looks at a film for posterity's tastes and that is what I usually try to do.The backstory is much more troublesome than the movie. Both Bratt and Berry are/were A-listers who deserved better roles and better respect than Hollywood gave them.

Sure, you must suspend a lot of reality in order to believe that Patience could be brought back to life by the soul of an ancient cat, but I thought it was explained so it made some sense. I didn't think the idea for the evil villain being selling a cream that makes someone's skin rot if they stop using it was a great idea. They could have come up with a better plot there. But, I liked how Patience doesn't remember and must investigate her own \"death.\" Plus, it was great seeing the independence personality trait of a cat coming out of her. Like when she finally decides to break up the noisy party across the street. That was great.You could tell when it was the computer Catwoman, but it was not used excessively. I liked all the cat like fights and one liners by Hallie. I especially liked the fight between Catwoman and Tom behind the stage. She says I don't come when called, only when I want. Just like a cat.Catwoman needed to use her whip more. And I don't understand all negative talk about Hallie's costume. I thought it was hot and slick. And what was up with Sharon Stone's face. It's like they use so much pancake make-up so you can't even see one wrinkle, or maybe they are just trying to hide plastic surgery scars. She really is starting to look like an alien. Why can't she just accept her age and stop trying to dress like a 20 year old.FINAL VERDICT: I liked Catwoman and I'm also a cat lover, so maybe that has something to do with it.

            "content": "Many people came into the theatres expecting \"Catwoman\" to be a knock-off f the 1960's \"Batman\" or a rehash of Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman from Tim Burton's \"Batman Returns\". Sadly many critics were left terribly disappointed. Sure it lacked the explosiveness you would find in a summer blockbuster with the cartoon-like action and over-the-top special effects. Sure there were special effects like Catwoman bouncing and climbing over buildings. But the effects are diluted and rubbery like straight out of a video game. However, the emphasis isn't relied upon the special effects. The movie is about the empowerment of women and the incredible handling to show that summer blockbusters can still produce high octane energy regardless of what gender stars in it. Many boyfriends migh take their girlfriends to see this movie only to walk out thinking this film was idiotic. By way of contrast, the female viewers will think otherwise. This movie is dark, brooding and Gothic with a pop cultured thrill ride that has a wide open field for feminism with plenty of doors to break through. Whether intentional or by default, \"Catwoman\" captivates and manufactures enough to ponder into our ever-changing ways in which we think and to refrain from unraveling. Let's start off small and in a few decades more films like this will come onto our screens.  Halle Berry stars as the titular character. However, the film does take the time to explain how she became this mysterious vigilante. When not in costume, she's Patience, a devoted cat fanatic and graphics designer who prints advertising labels for a cosmetics company. Quiet and introverted, Patience lives in a dilapidated apartment with noisy tenants who blare their radios until four in the morning. But she is fair lady who plays it fair game and quietly lives a life hidden by a subtle streak of discontent.Patience is under opposition by a superior named Laurel (Sharon Stone), a supermodel who's many poses makes people's head spin when she enters the fray. Laurel is the co-owner of the cosmetics company that Patience works for along with her husband George (Lambert Wilson). George makes a startling announcement that after devoting her time with the company for over fifteen years, Laurel will be replaced by a much younger model. This was the perfect opportunity for Laurel to vent out that high-spirited outer self while also capturing that inner rage like we would expect after getting laid-off like that. This scene alone tells you everything about Laurel. She doesn't play by the book, she may walk with smiles only designed to fool the public's eyes. \"Catwoman\" is both slick and stylish in tones. For example, director Pitof focuses the camera on George from a long-distance only to get a shot of Laurel from a close range. It may lack in definition, but it is very tempting. Sure there are long unnecessary scenes where Patience is challenging her cop boyfriend (Benjamin Bratt) as just an excuse for a music video like montage. While at the same times adds nicely to the murky settings to support the rather unorthodox tones this film possesses.In the traditions of the other catwomen of ages past, Patience transforms into Catwoman after she is murdered and was resurrected by a group of felines. They don't just resurrect her, she lives like them. She has developed a liking for sushi, nestling on cushions and hoisting herself up and down on furniture. But the main thing that makes her stand out. She's not a part of our restricted society. She now plays by her own rules, developed a newly discovered self-esteem and now sports a cool cat costume complete with a tail and triangular ears.And this is just the tip of the iceberg. This film was handled well by the screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris along with Pulitzer nominee Theresa Rebeck, as this film celebrates female empowerment, but it also has its drawbacks as well, especially when at times it can be very conflicted in terms of good and villainy. Catwoman is personified as rebellious, independent, confident, Laurel is leaned towards being labeled as evil. But it wasn't like she was voluntarily evil. She was overthrown of her position by her husband's betrayal. She does get some of the best lines in the movie by far.There's no denying that Laurel's character has a certain level of uncertainty within her, but that shouldn't be a liability, but an asset knowing what trauma she's been through. It was bound to happen that Catwoman and Laurel would butt heads but through this good versus evil, we're looking at two strong females who play by their rules and reek of independence from anyone who tries to get in their way.\"Catwoman\" lacks natural vibrations and with a purpose being that she's like a supernatural entity and while Laurel sports a toxic face cream that make her complexion look like marble. The mask makes her lose a sense of feeling. But underneath the masks and concealers, the whole premise of \"Catwoman\" is that the movie cherishes the positive side of how independence bears no boundaries if used in the rightful perspective. It's truly a remarkable film that was badly misunderstood by the critics. Personally it's a great flick for a rainy day when you need something enlightening. The clash between Laurel's cynical ways and Catwoman's determination will keep you in intrigue. It's worth the watch.",

Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.Of course the plot may not have been overwhelming. But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.And why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this? There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.How many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women? I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).Of course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more intricate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.One thing is certain: NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fetching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!! The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder. No matter. The nature of the beast.Halle and company made a fun, entertaining movie that teaches basic life lessons in a familiar milieu. Additionally, a priceless special feature of the DVD was the \"Face of Catwoman\", a featurette chronicling Catwoman's many incarnations narrated by none other than Eartha Kitt!!!!!!!",

Bratt is good as the hero/cop as well. The soundtrack is kicking and the story line is never boring. The most unfortunate thing I can think of saying about this film is that it had the misfortune of opening up against bigger blockbuster films like the Bourne Supremacy and I, Robot, while Spiderman 2 was still going strong also. This is a good little action-type movie that should be given a chance. Ignore the critics (I ALWAYS do) and check it out for yourself. Though this film is no comparison to Star Wars in any way shape or form, I read somewhere that critics (as usual) trashed that too. See it and then decide for yourself.",

            "content": "Dear Ms. Halle Berry:After watching Gothika earlier this year I wrote you a letter detailing my bewilderment with your film choices after so historically taking home an Academy Award for your role in Monster's Ball.   My letter detailed how I felt you should have used your new bargaining power to solidify yourself amongst the great non-white actors of any era.  I can only assume that my letter did not hit its target as I have just had the displeasure of watching your new big screen dud, Catwoman.Let me first say that I was intrigued upon first hearing about the role and when I saw the production stills of you in your Catwoman outfit, I became rather weak at the knees.  After seeing your body in Monster's Ball and in Swordfish, I had the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end at the notion of you in a leather outfit with strategic rips throughout and a whip that would make you my first call of choice had I ever been in peril and needed a superhero s.t.a.t.  I wasn't keen on the Catwoman character however.  I was a religious watcher of the campy Batman television serial and the Catwoman villain as played by Julie Newmar and perfected by Ertha Kitt and I thought Catwoman was best on a show that didn't take itself seriously as, let's face it, having claws and a whip as your weapons of choice are kinda comical.  But a funny thing happened, Michelle Pfeiffer had a kick at the suit in 1992's Batman Returns and although the movie was a major disappointment and the character still seemed stale, I was at least intrigued by the woman behind the suit.To make a long letter shorter, I then held out the smallest glimpse of hope for your entry.  Then I had the unfortunate occurrence of seeing the trailer.  What led you to this role I wondered.  The script revealed nothing that would lead me to believe that this was a good career choice.  In short, a woman who is the prettiest, most polite individual this side of both oceans, happens upon a corporate conspiracy of her employer, Hedare Beauty. A result of her findings, she is left for dead, but resurrects as someone who feels comfortable wearing leather and donning nails that leave marks on lovers that would make Freddy Krueger weep in appreciation.  After settling a few gripes, she goes after the corporation heads while trying to maintain a relationship with her new boyfriend cop played rather naively by Benjamin Bratt.  Hmm, a revenge film where someone comes back from near death to use their new athletic ability acquired in their coma state into a world of hurt for all those that get in the way.  Well, that has never been done before has it?  For the first time in almost five months, the theatre patrons did not bug me during your film.  Usually, I am the unlucky sonofabitch that always seems to find the group of people either in front or behind that have no theatre manners.  Just my luck, during Catwoman, the audience was silent (except of course for the roar of laughter that I am sure was unintended at certain points in the movie).  Maybe in awe of the sheer audaciousness of the venture or maybe showing signs of embarrassment for you, barely a snore could be heard.  I have never so much wanted to listen to someone talk about his or her golf game on the weekend during a film in many many a cat's life.So, Ms. Berry before I wrote you regarding my lack of understanding as to your choices.  This time, I am writing to you asking for my money back.  The only good thing in Catwoman is your outfit and you took too long to adorn said costume.  The special effects were the jerkiest I have seen this side of the new millennium and had it not been for Sharon Stone and a few good biting comments, I probably would have used my pen to start slashing the screen.  Not being able to blame the director (someone named Pitof that had as much experience behind the camera as I have had between the sheets), I must apply the full 100% of my angst towards you.  I leave it here at peace in hopes that Catwoman does not have 9-lives.  From the reaction to the audience, I expect this made-for-Mystery-Science-Theatre waste of time will end up on video before you could lick up a bowl of milk with your hands behind you back.  Come to think of it, THAT I would have paid for.  www.gregsrants.com",

A 21st century catwoman, complete with the sort of skimpy outfit that would make Stripperella green with envy and a bad-ass attitude that not even Elektra can match. And Sharon Stone...Well, she's Sharon Stone :P. All in all, a good cast and enough story to keep you awake, if not more. The SFX are fantastic. Sprawling cityscapes and Catwoman's aerial antics are quite literally brought to life. Set design and fight choreography were also top-notch, and it was beautifully filmed. This film's met a lot of criticism from both fans and critics alike, but if you take it as a stand-alone construct you're sure to enjoy it.

A friend and I decided to watch it on a whim and as the credits rolled my friend asked who wrote it, to which I replied \"You know, it's not always the writers fault.\" This is true is is not always the writer who messes up a story. But in this case it is very much the writers fault. Our story follows Patience as she goes from lovable shy girl to CAT-woman. I use the capitals in the word CAT because the writers seemed to feel the need to impress upon the audience at every possible turn that she is now a CAT-woman. I got the feeling that our trio of would-be poets would have preferred to stand in theaters with baseball bats labeled \"CAT-woman\" which they would swing at any member of the audience who didn't seem to appreciate the blatant cat references and mannerisms of Ms. Berry while screaming \"GET IT? SHE'S A CAT! ISN'T THAT COOL??? SHE'S A CAT!\" if they had been given the opportunity. The \"cat-bat\" is swung so often in this movie I began to feel the need for a catchers mask. The story is poorly thought out and the plot seems merely designed to let us see Halle in the leather suit a few times to distract us from considering the money wasted making this piece of litter. Oh and not to spoil things but the police in the movie are morons of the highest caliber. When presented with clues in the form of a used glass with DNA, fingerprints which were all over the jewelry store, or some lipstick? If you said fingerprints you'd be wrong, just as wrong as this movie.",

The special effects equal spider-man's easily, as you should expect, and some of the action scenes are pretty good, sadly some are pretty bad too.All in all the movie is below the standard it could, or even should be, but to give it a score of 1 is too harsh.

This is from someone who has seen quite a few over the years, some atrociously bad. This isn't one of them. The acting is passable for this sort of film, with Sharon Stone making a good villain, though not in it enough, and Halle Berry is worth a mark alone for her sex appeal. She is in fact more sensual when she is not in her bat costume, and unlike Jennifer Lopez can act with more than her posterior. The plot is okay, though I do agree with people when they say Cat Woman doesn't seem to have any sense of purpose. The effects are okay, but are average for this type of film, and I can only conclude, that a lot of the negativity for this film comes from the this.

No longer simply a sexy counterpart of Batman, Catwoman has her own agenda, her own personality.Halle is a very talented actress who brings to life a very complex character with both respect and innovation. The Catwoman idea is not used simply as a gimmick, it is a very believable and respectable transformation.I doubted the casting when I first heard the movie was being made but now, I think that anybody but Berry would have been a mistake, she brought both glamor and humility to the role. So, go see this movie and enjoy it for what it is. Don't compare it to other comic book movies because the character is not just a comic book character.

Complaints that the plot is silly, are lost on me when a scientist with 4 robotic arms is considered terrific. Others hate superhero moves because they waste too much time on the \"origin\" storyline. Are they better when they jump directly to the hackneyed evil scientist (Alfred Molina) plot line? Some complain that the special effect are bad. Well, Spidermans swinging and tumbling through New York looks emphatically phony & cheesy to me also. Catwoman is shallow, but it's nowhere near as bad as the uniformly bad reviews whine.For me, Spiderman 2 lacked any of the depth or values that everyone gushed about. I cannot stand the constant idiotic stupor on Tobey Maquire's face. Kirsten Dunst majorly sucks as an actress and the plot & villain were at least as stupid as any other.

It might be inspired by my estimation of the film's display of only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors (which I will get into more below). Or it could possibly be inspired by the many errors that there wasn't even an attempt to cover, i.e.- Patience becomes Catwoman after wandering into a restricted area. How did she get into this restricted area, you ask? By walking through the door marked 'RESTRICTED AREA,' in bold, red text, which was simply unlocked and didn't even have a significant locking device on it. You know, I might've also hated the movie (not worthy of the word 'film') because of the pointless-undeveloped story line. And, really, it's not possible to look beyond the disgustingly audacious 'style' of one-named director, Pitof, which can only be described as the style of a headless chicken running through a maze of landmines. Oh, yes, said headless chicken is also being chased by angry natives wielding machetes.I mentioned above that I estimated that only 12 minutes of living, breathing actors were shown during the entire 140 minutes of film. Almost every sequence of the movie featuring an actor seemed to be butchered by the insertion of CGI's. I'm dead serious. I'm not just talking high-flying, sucky action sequences- I'm talking scenes of Catwoman walking to a motorcycle and calmly getting on it, and the other one that immediately comes to mind is a sequence where a man (a baddie) is simply walking. Yeah, walking. It seems agents and managers are really watching over their clients these days.Now, two questions I'm asking-1) What is the point of Catwoman? What the [expletive] does she do?It's explained in the film that Midnight, the 'magical' cat, chose Patience to become Catwoman, but something is wrong here- CATWOMAN HAS NO PURPOSE!! Every other superhero out there has a purpose- They save people! It seems Catwoman's only purpose is to kill the people who attempted to kill her and chase a cricket or two. There's nothing else to her!2) Where is the REAL back story?It sure as [expletive] wasn't in the film! Why wasn't she shocked and attempting to reason and deal with the emotional ass-kicking that would come with the revelation? She's told she's Catwoman by the clich\u00e9 cat lady, she buys a mask and nails and the result is the 'superhero.' It's adds up, but not into anything of any value whatsoever. Shame on you terrible writers!Halle Berry is a good actress. I'm not doubting or denying that. She fully deserved her Academy Award nomination and win for 2001's Monster's Ball, but something bad happened here. Her acting started awful and ended awful. I'm hoping the talents and reputation of Berry won't be harmed by her inadequate performance. Now, My request to Halle Berry- Ms. Berry, I want my money back. I never thought I could see such a terrible performance from an Oscar winning actress. Maybe you were just doing your best with the material? But, you know, that really is not a valid excuse. After reading the screenplay, you should've thrown it in the face of the agent who dared display it to you. How could you not notice how awful it was? Make some better choices and hopefully your career won't plummet as so many others have.I recall an interview with Ashley Judd, the original casting choice for Catwoman, who said something along the lines of, 'Turning down the role of Catwoman is one the things I regret the most.' Ashley, never say that again. You have only been saved by not appearing in this hilariously terrible film.Listen people, don't waste your money on this glorified..er\u0085um..crap. It's not worth the $6-$15 bucks!So now you ask, why not just give it a zero? Why the zero-point five? Well, The editing was sufficiently bad; the acting of Alex Borstein could've possibly taken some effort, appropriately placed CGI's were okay, and I like cats.Directing 0/10, Writing 0/10, Cinematography 0.5/10, Editing 1/10, Acting 0.5/10, Overall Satisfaction 0/10Final- 0.5/10",

This movie, yes, does need much work on the story, and some of the special effects can be a little sloppy. The wonderful thing about this film is the camera angles, the style, art, and the unique way that it was filmed. In the opening scene with the camera angle panning over the cityscape is absolutely amazing looking! And when Catwoman jumps out of a window, the camera angles and choreography/movements are jaw-dropping. I have watched this movie like fifteen times just for the visuals and interesting music. Pitof's artistic sense is very very exceptional, but the writing should have been done by someone else. I know 7/10 is very generous, but I want to give Pitof some credit for putting in some new and original ideas, that really turned out wonderful on screen. Halle Berry's acting is a bit forced, although she plays Catwoman better than she does Patience Philips. Sharon Stone does an excellent job on screen, and still looks hot even in her late forties. Watch this movie for the visual and special effects, and tie it together with the music. This is more of an emotional film, and many people do not appreciate the artistic sides of movies. This film has very wonderful color and defined views. It is cleancut, and overall, and enjoyable movie to watch.",

Although Sharon Stone's character reminded me a tad of Poison Ivy, you know, super-beauty-products and all that jazz. But I quite liked that it showed how someone really quiet and shy can turn into a catty, sexy weirdo.No offence meant to catty, sexy weirdos.Catwoman has no real point to it, other than to explain how Patience gets her powers. It would be good if there was a follow-up where she beat Batman / Superman / Poison Ivy or whoever, but since the film did so badly this seems about as likely to happen as pigs flying, hell freezing over, and Ozzy Osbourne announcing a fondness for Girls Aloud. Which is a shame, because I didn't think the film was that bad.They'd have been better off doing a spin-off from the Batman flicks with Michelle P (or a lookalike) as Catwoman, so the back story wouldn't be necessary.Don't hate me for loving Catwoman.

She looked very good in a leather and there was some similarities with the Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman from Batman Returns. Berry didn't deserve Razzie for her OK performance. Sharon Stone gave a nice performance too as a nasty villain with some \"super powers\". Worst actor in Catwoman was Benjamin Bratt. He was real lame in a scene where Sharon Stone shot him - You should see that. :) Best part of the whole film was the CGI. All fast moving acrobatics of the Catwoman were executed very professionally. As a character Catwoman looked more realistic than Spider Man in a similar maneuvers. Spider man in his costume looks more plastic - Catwoman looks quite real in CGI shots even as she has more bare skin (skin is more difficult to make realistic).Cinematics were nice, but there was a bit too much camera gimmick - like using wide angle lens and camera speedups. I hated the scene where Berry and Bratt played a basketball - just because of bad camera work - too much useless gimmicks..Music was boring R&B and it didn't fit in most scenes.

            "content": "Don't get it twisted. This is an awful film. Halle Berry cant take full blame for the reason why this movie sucks. The script was juvenile and corny. Halle Berry gives the worst performance of her acting career in this movie. She plays Patience Williams(wasn't the original Catwoman called Selina Kyle?), a timid beauty ad designer who accidentally stumbles on to an evil plan by the owner of the company she works for. The evil plan involves marketing a beauty cream that is known to cause skin disorder and cancer. Patience is chased out of the building and into a drainage system where she falls to her doom and is revived by a cat.Opinion: This movie is humorously bad. Her origin with the cat that revives her is laughable. The way she walks so awkwardly(like she's had one too many catnip) in that tacky cat suit is a riot. The way she cracks that whip like an amateur dominatrix is hysterical. The fight scenes as well as the dialogue is laughable too. The most funniest and probably the worst scene in the movie is where she beats her soon-to-be boyfriend/cop in basketball with HIGH HEELS ON!!! She looked like a total goof dribbling that ball between her legs. Then there's those moments in the movie where you have to suspend your intellect like the time Halle slid through those prison bars without getting stuck or the fact that the toxic cream that the main villain is peddling makes her(the villain) immune to punches and kicks that would knock the average person unconscious.Closing comments: This is the worst movie that Halle Berry has ever starred in and is another blemish is her movie career. The acting is dreadful and the action is a joke. I would be surprised if she could still find work but then again if Eddie Murphy could find roles to play after the crappy The Haunted Mansion then Halle should be able to bounce back from this.To Halle: FIRE YOUR AGENT IMMEDIATELY!!!",

            "content": "Catwoman, starring the beautiful and talented Halle Berry is an interesting movie. Watching it, I could definitely see how this could appeal to someone and will not be jumping on the bandwagon in hissing any vicious meows at how bad it was.That doesn't mean it's good. Catwoman is a movie that most definitely kept me entertained, but did also very definitely lack the element of greatness of a superhero film like Superman or even the fun of Batman. What I felt mostly while I watched this was frustration. Not in how bad it was but how good it could have been. Catwoman definitely fills a niche and it isn't \"I'm walking out\" kind of bad, but it did have an interesting story buried somewhere under the leaps, jumps and dominatrix clothing and there were a few moments my attention definitely was captured in a more interesting way then just being entertained, the scene where Patience returns to Midnight's home and learns the truth about herself for instance.But much, most in fact, of what goes on in Catwoman is to campy and action oriented to really get a lot of pleasure from unless one has a high tolerance for camp and action sequences. I would have liked to see Catwoman combine the thrill of good action scenes(which it had somewhat) with vibrant, interesting dialog(which it did not have.) I know they only had 100 or so minutes but the length of the picture could have been expanded, which would have been fine, if the way the plot enfolded, had been tightened up a bit and the movie was more dialogue driven and focused on plot rather then action. The movie could have been made to appeal to those who like both types of movies and had more crossover appeal.I must confess to finding the scenes of Berry gobbling tuna and enjoying catnip to be really very funny and as I mentioned that's where the movie gets campy. I was not feeling well when I watched this and laughed a lot(maybe at scenes which were not meant to be funny) and the movie actually put me in a very upbeat mood. If I were a movie star, I could see maybe wanting to play this role. On the other hand, this could have been such a truly THRILLING movie one wonders why the creators just settled for campy action oriented entertainment.And the worst part of the movie, to me, anyway, was toward the end, where it got way to dragged out-I mean, it DID I will say, start to get really REALLY bad at that point-hurry up I wanted to say. However, this movie is pretty short as a whole, which is a good thing because, even though I think this could have been longer if there was more of a storyline, since there wasn't, it was good it stayed relatively short. To much longer and it really would have crossed into awful status. I just don't think a movie can be THAT long without some more emphasis on story rather then action.I love cats and loved the brief alludes to the Egyptian history and the ancient worship of cats. I really do think, underneath all the leather and campiness, a really great movie could have been made-even keeping the same basic plot and that's why I felt such frustration watching this.I will agree with those who compliment the beauty of the movie visually(and while Berry, Stone and Bratt are at their best looking, their not what I'm referring to.) The city looks great. The look was electric and I loved the way the rich glitter of those scenes was picked up.And I will also join those who complained about the darting camera sequences. What was up with that? That was a bit annoying in places. After just a short while, it becomes quite irritating and it gets to you. And detracts from the visuals, which are one of the movie's greatest strengths(after the cats of coarse).So-hope I've given a fair review here. Catwoman, I'll freely admit, had me absolutely and completely hysterical in some places, but that's not a bad thing, better then walking out entirely. I am sure there will be a part two and I hope it might have more universal appeal. Here's hoping but I doubt it. Meow.",

Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt are obviously having lots of flirtatious fun, and Sharon Stone chews up the scenery as an evil beauty supply spokesmodel-turned-villain.The real surprise, that I only half-expected because some friends saw it first and mentioned it, was the underlying feminist subtext. The movie smartly examines the sources of a woman's power, namely beauty and sexuality, and all the consumptive elements (fashion, magazines, skin products) that are the offshoots of same. It was surprisingly brutal in its honesty that these are the sources of a woman's insecurity: are you a nice face and good body, or do you get taken seriously as an artist, and Berry is certainly the perfect spokesmodel for this dilemma. And, as Sharon Stone is rapidly finding out on screen and off, what happens when you get too old to be considered anymore? Overall, a fun ride for the comic book fans and a surprisingly thoughtful, if subtle, underplay. Double bonus points for the mini-doc about the evolution of Catwoman, hosted by Eartha Kit. *purrr*",

            "content": "First let me say that before I saw this I expected it to be absolutely terrible. The reviews and negative buzz about this is absolutely huge. But why? Most likely because humans are heavily dependent on social acceptance for survival (at least in the old days, i.e. BC). This has an annoying effect of massing non-critical thinkers into joining a mass movement of \"public opinion\", and quite often it gains speed and soon everyone is \"doing it\". What I mean by this is that people are afraid to say that the movie was good because everyone else says it's bad and they're afraid to be outside the \"norm\" of public opinion. Another thing in this same general area is feverent bashing of something to \"fit in\". It's the same thing as with homophobia, democrats, republicans and other groups of polarized opinion holders. In order to be accepted, the person desiring to be in the group does as others in the group does... it's simply monkey-see monkey-do in order to be accepted by a group.So, with that intro into why the movie is being panned so badly, here's what I thought of the movie: It's good. The script is consistent and well written. The acting is good as is the direction (aside from the fighting sequences). There are plenty of interesting scene presentations and scene fades. The movie was not some flash-bang rushed project... there is a lot of thought behind every aspect of the movie. My only complaint with the whole film is the fighting sequences are frenetic and incohesive since the fight scene consists of MANY 1-3 second clips spliced together (the same scene filmed with multiple cameras, and switching between the cameras every 1-3 seconds). This breaks up the fight scenes into a collage of disjointed flash images that just make the action hard to follow. Aside from that, the CGI and action sequences are done quite well and are imaginative. Character development is excellent (if not somewhat predictable) but one does wind up caring what happens the protagonists. Some people complain about the \"silly\" story. Well this is a fantasy flick and I didn't have any problem at all with the evil cosmetics company threatening mankind. In fact it's just the over-the-top kinda aspect that really makes this film work. The whole film is very over the top in terms of the catwoman character and her adjustment to being infested with spirit ala cat. But it is done in a playful way and is actually the source of many of the humorous moments of the film. Overall, it's a movie based on a comic book character... don't' get all bogged down in \"it's so unrealistic\" - you'll be denying yourself some good IL' fashioned fantasy entertainment. I subtract one point for the lame fight scenes (reminds me of gladiator fight scenes). Final score: 9/10 (But I gave it a 10 in the voting to offset the bozo-votes of the sheep out there).",

            "content": "I just rented this film on DVD and I liked it a lot. I find it a perfectly satisfying re-telling of the Catwoman story, performed by an original director with visual poetry and musical flair and interpreted by a very talented actress. The only thing that I find mysterious about this film is the savage beating it took from critics, starting with the big CACA (Chicago Authority on Cinematic Art) Roger Ebert. The critics can't agree among themselves why they hate this film so much: some say it is too CGI-dependent, others that it doesn't have enough special effects. Some critics find that the character demeans women. Others that she is too much of a feminist. One critic even accuses it of \"stealing\" from \"Spiderman 2\". Others find it too sexy, others not sexy enough. Some say it's \"tired\" and unoriginal. Others say it is too original. Collectively, the critics sound like Cinderella's wicked step-sisters and make just about as much sense.One thing everybody seems to agree on is that the script-writers shouldn't have messed with the so-called original story from \"Batman\". It would seem that most film critics in America today grew up reading superhero comics and that they consider this form of literature holy writ that should never, ever be altered. This, of course, ignores the fact that in the course of 50 years, the character of Catwoman has been re-written and re-designed every two weeks or so by various people with various agendas. The fact that this latest incarnation is profoundly feminist goes a long way in explaining why a lot of critics (mostly semi-literate, overgrown teen-age boys with masturbatory fantasies of a pliant and preternaturally sexy Catwoman) are now spitting hairballs and having hissy fits.Of course, the fact that the director Pitof, is a foreigner with a strange, unfamiliar name, and a Frenchman to boot, does not help his cause. Never mind that he was Jean-Pierre Jeunet's artistic director for years or that he authored the screen's first all-digital feature film (\"Vidocq\") ahead of \"Episode II\". All those Frenchmen should be deported anyway after the way they behaved about the holy war in Iraq, right? The beating this film got is also a particularly underhanded way for White middle-class bigots to get back at an \"uppity\" Black actress whom they believe should never have gotten an Oscar because she is so pretty (and wears such \"immoral\" outfits). End of story. Thank God Ms. Berry has a sense of humour and will survive all of this",

Some actually believe that Matt Damon & all that he represents in our society are \"Born Supreme\"The movie had likable characters that you could care about. Halle Berry mad a nice transition between the meek side & the Catwoman side. She looked fantastic! The special effects were great. They were on a par with Spiderman 2. Benjamin Bratt was a good choice of leading man. I went in expecting the worst & was pleasantly surprised.

            "content": "I am always anxious to see movies that get really \"bad\" ratings, to see why so many hate it. As usual, \"Catwoman\" with Halle Berry is not that bad. Almost 40% of the IMDb votes are \"1\", which only proves that those voters have little concept of what a truly bad movie is. I suspect if you compare it fairly to other movies of its genre, \"comic book turned action movie\", then its rating should be around \"5\" or so.The formula is familiar and simple. An unassuming person (here Patience Phillips) gains super powers, puts on a costume, finds out about a sinister plot to wreck the world, and almost single handedly foils the plot and eradicates the bad guys. Very similar to \"Spiderman\" but not with the quality of acting and special effects. Here the CGI looks like CGI, and Catwoman's movements don't look very natural. Still, it is fun to watch Ms Berry go about her business as Catwoman and do her thing. I found it enjoyable enough, if only a very average effort.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Before she became endowed with her powers, Patience made friends with Tom (Benjamin Bratt) when he rescued her just before she fell off a ledge. Soon, when Patience overheard a conversation and became a threat to expose a sinister cosmetic product, she was drowned and flushed out into the river, washed up dead on shore, where a special cat breathed into her nostrils, she came back to life with super cat-like powers. Her hearing, her reflexes, her propensity for fish. (Scene in restaurant with Tom, she eats all the sushi quickly, or in her apartment, finishing off yet another can of tuna.) Evenytually we find it was not Mr Hedare, head of the cosmetics company, but his wife Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) who wanted the product on the market at all costs. She even killed him, and attempted to pin it on Patience/Catwoman. To no one's surprise, Catwoman eventually gets the upper hand, and Laurel falls to her death, the only person who could have exposed the true identity of Catwoman. Which leaves it open to a possible sequel, but I suspect there won't be one.",

The most specific complaint I've heard is that it's campy.It's a COMIC BOOK movie, for heaven's sake! It's about a SUPER HERO (or super-anti-hero, if you will). It's like complaining that a war movie is violent. Sure, not for everyone -- but I think this movie is right there with X-Men and Spider-man as excellent comic adaptations.The characters were entertaining and three dimensional. The script was sharp. The balance of action and humor was even. The pacing was tight. The cinematography was superb. The action sequences were not only technically well done, but even artistic. The acting was campy but not too over the top (as in moron flicks like Dungeon's & Dragons).Okay -- I must sound like a boob to all the folks who hated this movie. But I'm actually a well rounded guy. I'm not some basement comic book aficionado. I do love Kubrik, Gilliam, Jeunet & Caro... maybe that's what it is. I'm into art cinema writ large, which seems to piss off a lot of people for some reason. And this film is the comic book version of that.Ah well.

Of all the BAtman baddies Catwoman is the least evil.

My favourite from the 60s series was Eartha KItt, Halle Berry was very close to Eartha Kitts portrayal of Catwoman.So come on everybody, put your opinions of this film to one side, if someone else has the guts to try again with a Catwoman film I'll be there.",

That is why when Hollywood decides to make a movie on such action-heroes they have to placate the millions that might see the movie, who might get interested in reading the comic book heroes. So they always have to \"Hollywoodize\" the plots and characters. Otherwise if they stuck to the accuracy of the characters and plots the only people going to see such movies as \"Catwoman\" would be the few nerdy fans that have no life but to read and analyze and philosophize their ideals of Comic Book stories. With enough said on the matter, \"Catwoman\" was maybe not the best film, but definitely not the worse. I found Halle Berry's character extremely sexy and charming. There is something about a sexy woman in a leather outfit, whip and claws I find fascinating. I found the plot to be more realistic than the stupid version when Catwoman is featured in the Batman sequel. Although I am critical that the movements of Catwoman were a little awkward, especially when she was climbing and crawling. But then that is direction problem and computer enhancement issues. Halle Berry surprised me. Although I love her better as Storm, she did a rather good job. I found the movie entertaining. Not a complete waste of time. It maybe not as violent or explosive or raw as other Comic Book character movies, but I found it to be worth watching and making my own mind up about it.

When she finds out that the makeup firm she works for is planning to release a toxic skin cream that makes people ill if they don't keep using it, her bosses - Sharon Stone and that smug French guy from the Matrix sequels, conspire to have her bumped off, and she ends up drowning in raw sewage. She then reemerges as a \"cat woman\", with super agility and strength to rival that of Spider-Man or the Crow, and more ferocious personality, which she compliments by going with a short butch haircut instead of her initial long curly locks, and starts running around in a hooker/porn outfit with a whip and begins beating up people. Naturally, she's looking for revenge, but falling in love with cop Benjamin Bratt complicates things.Like so many others, my mind is boggled as to how this piece of crap came to fruition. The plot is horrible, the dialogue and acting laughably bad, and the special effects and action sequences pitiful. There are no words out there that can sufficiently describe this failure among failures. True the film has problems that extend well beyond her, but Halle Berry, a former Oscar winner, is simply terrible in this film - and no, showing off how great she looks on the edge of 40 does not redeem her for this piece of junk (either they offered her too much money or she was so depressed over her divorce she just didn't care what the work was as long as it got her away from home and her troubles). Hell, Benjamin Bratt probably gave the film's best performance, and he was stuck playing the hapless love interest/boy toy cop.In closing, this piece of crap makes other similarly crappy films like \"King Arthur\" look good by comparison (and KA was awful).",

For its runtime of nearly two hours I can safely argue I wanted more. \nThe film directed by French visual effects supervisor newcomer Pitof feels like a comic book come to live with its vivid colors and wild editing . Countless times we get insane CG crane shots of the beautiful Salt Lake City and the dark alleys Catwoman prowls . While unnecessary it makes for campy fun considering it was the early 2000s and they didn't know how it was gonna fare with audiences.\nPlenty of people judge its 100 million dollar budget when they forget Halle was paid 12 million dollars and they made statue figurines and a video game that further added to the budget not to mention the promo they did.

            "content": "i loved it! i went into the theater excited because i love the idea of a separate catwoman franchie but i was also abit skeptical after the negative reviews it is receiving and the very low score it has garnered at the IMDb.com. i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised that i liked it as much as i did. the special affects were really nice, not the best i have seen but still really smooth! another thing i was expecting to hate was the costume! i will be the first to admit that my 8 year old nephew could have designed a better costume after only seeing the one in batman returns, but i will also admit that as badly as i wanted to hate the costume, i couldn't! it helped that it was draped on the lovely ms berry but that withstanding...it served its purpose! patience starts out as a dowdy artist, but then she becomes catwoman! she isn't really sure of herself or her powers so she kind of approaches it slowly. at first her costume is just leather pants and a leather jackett...but as she learns more about her abilities and her powers progress, she becomes more open/provocative with herself and her costume! the best part of the movie is the relation ship between tom(ben bratt) and patience/catwoman. it is very reminisant of the batwoman/selina/catwoman triangle! this i the element in the movie that is the most catwoman~esque. the way she toys with men, falling in love with them as her natural self but tormenting them as her alter cat-ego. there is avery good balance between the action and the story. one thing that really stands out in this movie is sharon stone! she is amazing! i only wish she had more screen time. many people are also complaining about the plot twist...i will not give it away even though you learn of it less than 10 mins in to the movie. i will defend it though. i think it is a very good plot that fits well with a female superhero, not that catwoman would have trouble taking on the likes of doc-OK or the joker...i just think the plot fits. the one thing i do think is horrible in this movie is the editing! critics are complaining about the editing, saying that it makes the action scenes not flow well enough or makes them to choppy...i disagree with that...the thing that really bothered me about the editing was this: in the beginning, patience goes to work...goes home and goes to bed...gets up and goes to work in the same cloths...this would have been an affective way of showing how sloppy the character is, to wear the same thing to work 2 days in a row, but when she gets to work, all of her cow workers have on the same things too? not only that, but they use the exact same shot when she goes into her office...a sweeping shot the goes from the building door, up a set of stairs, and into her cube. its not that they used the same camera angels or track, it is the exact same shot, same people doing the same things...EXACT SAME SHOT!it really buged me, but maybe it was just me. the theater i saw it in was very empty...maybe 20 other people. i was surprised how big of a reaction the movie got. people were laughing outloud and cheering for catwoman at a certain part!, myself included. when it was over people clapped for a good 2/3 mins! so it wasn't just me that really enjoyed it! i wouldn't be surprised it catwoman makes more in its second weekend than it did in its first, after word of mouth travels and people get over the change of history...it really is adequately explained! so...in conclusion...SEE CATWOMAN THE MOVIE.....SOON!",

But I got so much more than that, I found a movie , all be it not Oscar or Award worthy, but a movie, that really did take me from reality for a bit, I become completely emerged in the story which may be silly, but who cares! The fight scenes, where all in my opinion beautifully choreographed, and the CGI, I thought was definitely above average. Hallie Berry was excellent both as Patience and Catwoman. Playing Patience with real raw emotion, and she genuinely did look frightened to speak her mind, but on the other hand as Catwoman Hallie exerts all the sexiness and confidence needed to pull of such a sensual character, and in that tight leather suit she does look HOT!! Sahron Stone is delicious as the sexy villain, and Benjamin Bratt is good enough for he's mainly unimportant character. A lot of people have given this movie a lot of flak and I can kinda see why but not really, if you can call this movie anything it has to be VISUALLY STUNNING, like Gothic, mixed with modern art. The backing Track is excellent, the stunts are better than you would be led to believe, the CGI is definitely a lot better than people have been saying. All in all no where near as bad as it could have been, And isn't it worth going to see Hallie Berrie and Sharon Stone in a cat fight anyway. All in all a fun filled, visually striking twist thrilled ride from begging to very end.Go See Honestly",

The ratings are unfortunately low but the movie was great and entertaining and that is what matters the most. I would love to see a sequel but i don't think there's any chances. This movie is definitely way better than any Batman movie out there, i am not into batman at all as it is a boring movie and a boring character compared to superman and spiderman which are 2 wicked characters. Despite the fact that Catwoman may not fit into the 'super-hero' category and therefore might not be expected to be great but i found the movie to be worth a top rating of 8 out of 10!!

            "content": "I have a secret. A dark, troubling secret which I must unburden myself of. You see, gentle reader, I have seen Catwoman. And enjoyed it. I know, I know, it doesn't do to confess to such a thing in polite company. Suggest that I had taken leave of my senses and my only response is a shrug and a smile. Yet, I say, I enjoyed Catwoman. And not in that oh-so-ironic 'so bad it's good' way either. No, I liked it in the 'well I thought that was rather good, actually' kind of way. Which is particularly worrying, because if there is one thing that the world and his wife can agree on, it is that Catwoman is this year's shoe in for a golden turkey award (excepting 'Thunderbirds' and 'the Chronicles of Riddick' of course). I, however, found it to be a fun ride, full of good, schlocky moments, some nice action and boasting a confident visual style and a performance from Halle Berry which falls just the right side of parody. Oh, and the much-derided catsuit definitely gets my vote. I also thought the pairing with Benjamin Bratt worked a treat and Sharon Stone made a satisfying villain. In short, plenty to enjoy.Naturally, until now, I have been careful to keep this strangely positive reaction to myself. In fact I was so disturbed by my feelings for the movie that I decided to see it again just to make sure I had not missed any of the innumerable horrors the reviews had promised. The second time, to my astonishment, it seemed an even better movie than the first. A few details had initially bothered me. While, for example, some of the special effects worked really well (the transformation scene, Catwoman sliding between two buildings, or tumbling out of one in graceful slo-mo), some didn't. But on second viewing I was surprised to find all these details seemed somehow better integrated into the movie as a whole. I am now thinking of seeing the movie for a third time, but in a decidedly more relaxed frame of mind. Well, I have heard of people that have seen Catwoman up to seven times. Are we all mad? Perhaps so. But I guess we might as well enjoy it. It would be such a shame not to.",

A STORY ABOUT BEAUTY CREAM, come on guys how much were you expecting from this for you to hate it so much, it's not like the production company hadn't been warning you for several months prior to release.If you take this movie for what it is, i thoroughly believe it competently does what it set out to do, which is entertain.

Although there was too much animation opposed to real life, me and all my friends thought it was good.

            "content": "From the very start, ever since I heard that they were making a Catwoman movie, I was like: WOW! That sounds nice, recalling the scenes of Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns. Then I found out that Halle Berry was cast as Catwoman. So I said to myself: OK, let's at least give it a try. The rest of the cast was revealed later on and I thought: Sharon Stone as the baddie? A former cosmetics model? Right... I still decided that I would give it a try when it was released and see how it was like. I love any movie that is big, dumb and entertaining. I'm a guy who gave Van Helsing a 10/10. That was how much I was entertained. I'm not one who listens to critics. Not for these kind of movies anyway. BUT, so that you don't think I'm some dumb 16 year old who has absolutely no idea about film-making, check out my IMDb profile and see my Top 10 movies. I'm sure you'll find it ... interesting. Nevertheless, the trailer was released. I thought it looked really good. It was of the likes of Spider-Man and Daredevil. Something between the two. Then I made the mistake to visit the IMDb message boards. These people just don't know when to quit. It's a movie. If you don't want to watch it, then don't. You don't have to diss it so much. Catwoman got negative reviews from the users even before it was released! How could you possibly know whether it would be good or bad? The thing with them is that they're stubborn and nothing can change their minds once they set their thoughts into motion.When I went to the cinema to watch it, I was expecting to at least say it was OK. I came out being COMPLETELY swept away. I simply loved it. Yes, so what if the story could have been written by a five year old? So what if some of the dialogue was cheesy? It's an action movie. About a woman who gets supernatural cat powers. How wise and life-changing could this movie be? Does anyone judge Spider-Man or X-Men for having ridiculous story lines? No... But the point is that they're superhero movies! Since when do superhero movies have to be clever? It's fantasy. It's action and adventure. It's even comedy! And with the case of Spider-Man 2, it's drama.I'm not saying that Catwoman is in any way better than Spider-Man 2, but I enjoyed it anyway. I thought it was creative and different. You people just keep on trying to make yourselves look wise by pretending to be critics when frankly, you're not. And what do critics know anyway? They've given hundreds of movies bad critiques when these movies deserved much better.POSITIVE ASPECTS OF CATWOMAN: These are even more than the bad aspects. But then again, this is my opinion. -Editing: I simply LOVED the editing! It's the best I've seen since Moulin Rouge! was released. Many of the people said that they lost track of what was going on because there were too many angles being switched to or it was too fastly paced, but that was the whole point. When you're a cat, EVERYTHING is fast paced. The editing have the effect it needed and it successfully did it with me and a bunch of other friends I took along to watch it. We were put INTO the movie, and that's the whole point of fast-cuts like these - to put you INTO the movie. My friends actually didn't even want to watch Catwoman and two of them hate Halle Berry, saying she's untalented, but after watching this, they adored both the movie and the poor actress who's been slashed into pieces by all you 'critics'. The action scenes were edited greatly! The scenes were cut appropriately according to the music or song. I even loved the infamous Basketball Scene, even though I'm not a fan of Mis-Teeq at all, and for one, I hate their song Scandalous. But it all worked perfectly! The action scenes keep you in suspense, even though, yes, they are predictable. -Camera Work: It was fantastic! The mixture of the camera work with the special effects and the editing have Catwoman a unique style and look. From sweeping camera movements into twirling angles and fast-switching close-ups, you really get to feel the movie. The scene at the Ballet was beautifully shot. It gave different perspectives into an action scene and really made you say: WOW! I'm sure most of you didn't even go that far. You were too swept away by your own thoughts of hatred towards the movie.-Music: Klaus Badelt created an amazing score. It was really something unique, ranging from Egyptian style melodies to action-suspense scenes that along with the editing and camera work put you into the movie and raise the hairs on your back. Even the songs in the movie were good! Everything was all twisted together perfectly. I can't wait for the soundtrack.-Directing: Many of you criticize Pitof for either being French or not known in he business, but just look closer and see that the man knows his stuff. I haven't seen his other work, but from what I've heard, it's visually impressive. So is this movie. Pitof directs his actors, camera men, lighting and editors to combine everything together in such a beautiful way that it is a treat to look at. It's really Eye Candy. Even the special effects were good, even if they were more obvious than some other superhero movies. But come on now, could you really have Halle or any other stunt woman jumping around and doing flips in the air like that? That's where the special effects come in. All of you claim to say how rubbish they were. They looked absolutely fine to me. Didn't see what was wrong with them. Even the 3D landscapes used to swish the cameras back and forth in were good.Halle's coming back to life scene was extraordinary! I was simply swept away. Visually brilliant and scored amazingly, that scene is one of my favourites ever filmed. And I've seen a great deal of good movies.Also, she had her take on showing off her acting skills, and managed it very well. The scene when she is trying to explain to Benjamin Bratt's character why she is Catwoman, was very believable and if you look at the whole movie together, she is a very believable Catwoman. Sharon Stone was brilliant as the evil one and you really do get to hate her. She was a good choice.NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF CATWOMAN: Judge me all you want to, this is my opinion. -Plotline: Yes, it wasn't very smart was it? But I believe it was enough for a Catwoman movie. The ending wasn't really what I thought of it, and as predictable as many thought it would be, it never fails to be entertaining like any other movie. Of course, make-up that makes your face rock hard is just plain stupid, but you don't really think of that while watching the movie. Yes it is dumb, but come on, it's a superhero movie!-Screenplay: The dialogue was cheesy. Now that's said, the comic relief put into Patience's best friend was good. Her relationship with the doctor was quite refreshing and her gay friend made almost everyone in the cinema laugh out loud. I was, though, pretty angry when no blood was spilt by all those punches Catwoman gave. They seemed pretty hurtful and nothing happened. Nevermind, it's quite understandable for the PG-13 rating. Also, some dialogue like: \"You died, but you were reborn\", was just plain pathetic; and I must say that Halle's prologue was quite pathetic as well: \"That is me, dead\". They could have at least changed it a little, before having everyone in the cinema laughing their heads off. But the movie as a whole overshadows these bad aspects.I for one enjoyed myself a lot. I would watch it again and again and I would even buy the DVD. I fully support this movie. Hell, it's no Godfather. It's no Lord of the Rings. But it's one hell of a good superhero movie! Doesn't beat Spider-Man 2, but what other superhero movie does? It's useless to compare the two. Just to p*** all of you off and show you how I love this movie, I've given it a 10/10. I know that one person's 10 won't make a difference but my recommendations in my community are respected and I'm sure to recommend this movie to almost anyone I know. Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 10/10 - This pussy definitely purrs for me.",

But, compared to horrible comic book films like Daredevil and The Hulk, Catwoman is OK. The many behind the scenes specials that was aired to promote the movie, you see that Halle is doing most of her own stunts in this film.In the film, it is put together very well with over the top CGI effect so Halle did have the whole Eartha Kitt/Michelle Pfeiffer vibe, if not better because Michelle nor Eartha did their own stunts, sorry, but they were just pretty faces but great actors.Batman Returns is the only good movie coming out of the Batman series.So Michelle is one of the best infamous catwomans. So Halle becoming a fighting machine is applauded.The CGI effect could have been a lot less in the film and Sharon Stone performance in this film is overrated, but not as bad as Demi Moore's comeback.(Sharon Stone is trying to make a comeback right?) Benjamin Bratt is a great leading man, but we all know a leading man, or what Hollywood like to call it \"love interest\" ,had to be in the film.Superheroes are best defined by the qualities of the villains they must overcome. Some action sequences are really good, then some are mediocre, and then some are just plain boring. Halle one liners are hilarious and of course she is great to look at. She did an \"ok\" performance in this movie and the many people that was in the private screening, it was too many people in there I might add and there were even more outside trying to get in, seem to enjoyed it. This movie is not to be taken that seriously, compared to Spiderman and X-men, it is not on its level. Even though Spiderman and Catwoman, both had overrated CGI effects, like the poorly I, Robot,please skip that movie, not worth your money, its an enjoyable movie with likable and non-likable characters with added great performances from Frances Conroy, Lambert Wilson and even the animated Alex Borstein.I also might add it is not as terrible as Batman& Robin, Daredevil, or The Hulk!!!!!!! 7/10",

All of the S&M accessories of Catwoman pleased me immensely. \"Catwoman\" was made for only one purpose: To put a supermodel into a leather dominatrix outfit. So \"Catwoman\" succeeds in exploiting leatherbound Berry for all that she's worth.But I am afraid \"Catwoman\" fails as an action/superhero flick. It's as simple as this: A superhero needs a supervillain. Spiderman has Dr. Octopus. X-men have Magneto. Catwoman has...Sharon Stone? Middle aged cosmetics executive is not the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of a worthy adversary. \"Catwoman\" is aimless and pointless. It only finds its purpose when Berry is strutting her stuff. Strut, pout, work it out. And whip it. Whip it good. So Halle Berry becomes Catwoman because...why? Because some cat eyeballed her and decided she'd make a good feline. Berry slowly realizes she's a Catwoman but has no idea what to do with her powers. So she prowls around town waiting for something interesting to happen. Soon she picks up a troublesome scent. This leads her to a cosmetics company and Sharon Stone, (Stoneface? hmmmm...), decides to skin the cat. Halle Berry looks hot in a leather cat outfit. That's the only good thing about this movie. If you want to watch her slink around rooftops, see this movie. If that doesn't do it for you, it's probably best to skip this one. \"Catwoman\" doesn't have much, but it's got Halle Berry in leather. It may be enough.",

I watched the whole film just on the off chance that it would get better. Low and behold it just kept getting worse. Don't get me wrong i like Halle Berry but for her even to take a script like this it was obviously the money talking. OK the start of the movie where she happens to save a cats life that was hanging off a balcony and the man whom happens to turn up every second of the movie happened to bear witness to this and thought halle was gonna jump off the balcony, and turns out to fall in love with her straight away. Then a few minutes later halle goes to work and somehow ends up in a totally private and confidential area of her workplace where she witnesses her evil boss conjuring up some \"addictive\" make-up (how corny is that), then she gets shot at by some goons that couldn't shoot at an \"open goal\" from point blank range. Well i suppose halle did do some incredible matrix style dodging of bullets. Then to cut a long story short she ends up on the edge of a cliff where she plunges to her doom, all to be washed ashore where the cat she saved from the balcony gives her mouth to mouth resuscitation. Then low and behold, she turns into catwoman. And yes you guessed it she is now a \"super hero.\" Now shes on a mission to avenge her death. Oh yeah the man who thought she was gonna kill herself turns up everywhere she goes, surprise surprise and cant even use his thick head to understand they are the same person, even though there is no difference in looks except a silly black thing covering her eyes.

After all, I've never been led astray by IMDB. \nMy wife, a Berry fan, wanted to see it and since I'd seen everything else that was fit to be see (per IMDB) I decided to score a few points with the Missus by going.  I kept my expectation low which was the best thing I could do since the only way to go is up.   After watching it, I now know why the ratings were so low.  All the purist DC comic fans were upset because they expected Michelle Pfeiffer and instead got Halle Berry.  (The geeks that read the comic books. I happen to be a comic geek, but I understand that the formula can't always be followed -- so I try to keep an open mind.)  \nOk, ok, so it doesn't follow the Batman series created by Bob Kane.  Who says it has to?  It had decent action and fairly simple story.  (This story doesn't take a lot of brainpower to follow).  We don't have Selina Kyle, but Patience Phillips a young artist stuck in a job drawing ads for Cosmetics Company.   A rather wimpy character (ala Peter Parker) \u0096 She's a doormat for everyone around her.  Then, she sees something that she's not supposed to. Bad guys try to take her down then, BAM - POW, an accident happens.  Cat brings her back. (The resurrection of Phillips is a little lame, but, hey, this is based upon a comic book universe.  Don't expect much).  Now, the formally meek Phillips comes out of her 'cage' looking for revenge on the people that 'killed' her.  I didn't walk out wishing for 2 hours of my life back.  It could have been much worse.  Go to this movie, forget about the comic books and enjoy a fairly decent show.  The kids will like it and so should the men.   Of course, when you return, input an honest vote.   It doesn't deserve to be a 2.7 on a 10 scale.   Maybe 5.5 out of 10, but not 2.7.",

It's refreshing to see a positive spin put on the Catwoman character and my oldest daughter loved the fact that she was just one of a long line of catwomen. My youngest daughter loved the fight scenes, booing the villains and cheering for Catwoman. My husband, who is also a fan of the Batman movies, liked this version of Catwoman more than the Batman Returns version. He has no problem with strong female hero's, bless him. My daughters will be seeing this movie with their friends again next weekend and I just may go with them!",

No it's not Spiderman 2, there's no deep character conflicts that wrap the viewer in the complex mind of a conflicted confused hero, that's all Marvel babe and this is DC. The comic book styles are different and so are the movies. Anyway you look at it Catwoman is an excellent origin film. That's why I can't wait of Catwoman II to see where and how the character develops. Catwoman is fantastic. Halle worked that cat suit, she even inspired me to go to the gym. Berry became Catwoman, she embodied the feline femme fatale. The way she moved after becoming Catwoman would've have made my kittens proud, it was feline fantastic. Then there's the romance. Berry and Bratt made a sexy couple and their chemistry was magical. Sharon Stone was purrfectly b___y and I mean that as a complement some times a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do. It's a fun film all around. Love the catfights, love the romance, love the man crazy friend, I loved this movie. If it were the 90s I'd give it two around the world snaps. It's not about feminism\u0085 it's about independence. It's not about the old Catwoman\u0085its about the new Catwoman and she still could kick Batman's butt if she wanted or seduce him if she chose to. If you look closely Halle pays homage to the other Catwomen. To top it all off the soundtrack is grrreat.",

            "content": "Interestingly, one of the more recent movies I've seen is 1985's \"Cat's Eye\", a trilogy of horror stories by Stephen King that are strung together with the help of a tabby cat that appears in each of the chapters. The idea of a cat stealing the breath of a child in order to take her life was utilized in reverse for \"Catwoman\", as Halle Berry's character is brought back from near death by a mystical cat named Midnight. But just as in \"Cat's Eye\", the symbolism of a black cat was wasted by not using an ebony feline. Was that so hard to think of? Well I've seen too many bad movies to call this one awful, but it certainly doesn't rank up there with your better comic book flicks. The first thing that caught my attention was the name Patience Phillips; why the writers dissed Selina Kyle is a mystery to me, though not enough to research for this review. With virtually no character development for the film's heroine, it's hard to get too worked up about events on screen, so I guess the thing to do is just sit back and enjoy if you can, some of the whiz-bang stunts and fight scenes Catwoman gets involved in.As far as the story goes, it takes some stretch to believe that even the most unscrupulous corporate behemoth would stoop so low as to disfigure their customers for short term profit. Of course there are those who believe that capitalism exists to screw everybody, so maybe the lowest common denominator was served here. You have to hand it to Sharon Stone, she was absolutely evil as the new boss of Hedare Enterprises and had a lot of her own brand of meow going on.Obviously, going in to this thing the film makers must have been thinking sequel because the ending just seems to beg for it, but I think we all know better now. You can't really build a franchise on a cat-astrophe.",

It stands alone, and only flaw I could detect was that cat, Midnight, was an obvious computer-animation at one significant juncture - but even this can be forgiven. Hence, for sheer entertainment, I give this movie 9 out of 10. It is a cartoon-creation and not to be taken too seriously, hence cardboard cut-out characters, and corny dialogue; but such is permissible in this kind of film. If this movie happened to flop at the box office, I'd claim it's not the film's fault, but more a stupid and unreasoning bandwagon chorus of condemnation. This is a super heroine movie and not inferior to others of its type - if you judge it purely on its own merits. The story is easy to follow, music and sound effects blend in well, and computer-animation supports the story and doesn't overpower it. All actors do a good job. The whole is a pleasant experience.",

Having watched it with the lowest of expectations, I have to say - this was not the rancid piece of muck I expected.To my surprise, behind the stereotypical characters and formulaic superhero plot structure, lies a pretty well made piece of trashy entertainment. True, the script follows the formula to a \"T\" and borrows heavily from pretty much every other superhero film since Batman, but due to its flamboyant Fifth Element-ish style, its shameless over-the-topness, its slick visuals and some rockin' action sequences, the film somehow worked for me. There was even something charming about its naivet\u00e9; I could totally imagine the creators sitting in the editing room, nodding to themselves and saying, \"Wow, this is some damn good stuff,\" only to be caught off-guard later when the reviews came in.Halle Berry, who I usually dislike, is quite delightful here, going all out and not shying away from the hammy style of the film. Face it, it takes some balls for an actor to deliver a line like \"What a PURRRRRfect idea!\" while keeping a straight face. She's really giving it all she's got. What's more, I enjoyed seeing the change in her body language from shy nerd to an actual cat - most of the cat-like gestures were extremely convincing.I think the strongest thing going for the film is its editing and sense of rhythm. Think of the action sequences like really well made music videos, and I think you'll be able to enjoy them as much as I did. I especially liked the scene in the opera (or whatever), with the swinging lights - beautiful art direction. The film's technical aspects alone are reason enough to see it (I LOVED the wacky camera movements!).To conclude, yes, the movie is shallow, formulaic and predictable, and you can easily make fun of most of the dialog and find the movie ridiculous if you want to. But if you approach it with an unbiased attitude, and you enjoy hamminess and camp, you'll find Catwoman to be an enjoyable and technically superb film.",

And it would have been interesting to have seen \"Catwoman\" taken in that direction; however, it was not, and we should appreciate and enjoy the movie for what the writers and director chose to do with it. It is as much about Halle Berry as it is the comic book character herself. When Halle makes her appearance in that leather suit, walking along seductively, that will go down in film history right alongside Raquel Welch in her cave woman outfit that we have seen so many times on posters. When Halle throws that little overdone strut into her walk, that brings a smile to my face and actually makes me laugh out loud at times. True, Sharon Stone is over the hill as an aesthetic pleasure, and the plot is as silly as any we have seen. But that is the whole point! Laugh at and with this film, enjoy it as a piece of work not meant to be serious drama. This film rates a B in my book, whereas \"Sky Captain\" is barely a C.",

That concept may be scary for some people.Warner Bros. did themselves a disservice by promoting this as being about the comic book character of \"Catwoman\", because it simply isn't.This is a completely newly developed character with a new back story, new powers and a new costume. After you realize that you are going to see a really exciting, well made and interesting movie. The story itself is simple but except for a few cheesy CGI scenes it is well executed and played by a group of really capable actors. It doesn't have the unnerving pathos and the gaping logic-holes of \"Spider-man 2\" or the stupid history bending storyline of (an otherwise nice) \"Hellboy\". This movie has a nice bit of European touch by director Pitof, combined with the American influence from the production team and actors.Halle Berry's Oscar-winning acting rings this character to life and her stunning looks in that revealing costume will have some guys close to a heart attack.

Restore her back to life by way of a mystical cat until she morphs into this super human hunk of gorgeousness who can leap enormous heights in the blink of an eye and voila, you have Catwoman, the new super heroine.The thrust of the clich\u00e9d plot is that her evil boss, the tyrannical George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his icy supermodel wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone), have created this fantastic anti-aging beauty cream, albeit actually disfigures the user after a period of time, which they plan to unleash upon the public. Patience discovers the plot and is killed by the wicked henchmen of Laurel. A mystical feline and her furry friends restore patience back to the living whereupon she realizes that she has these amazing powers and strength.Unfortunately, while fighting crime in her skin-tight, leather, slinky, sado-masochistic cat outfit, the world mistakenly believes she is actually the criminal.

            "content": "After reading some horrendous (and I mean really, really bad reviews of 'Catwoman', I was definitely considering giving it a miss). I have to say that after having seen it, I am absolutely at a loss to words as to why the critics have mauled it so doggedly, and in my opinion unfairly. Were we watching the same film? What was so bad about it? Sure so the plot was on the thin side and the dialogue was highly camp, but other than that I can't see what has provoked the spewing of critical vomit all over this film. Halle Berry makes an adorable Patience, and displays her vulnerability believably and effectively. On the other hand, she really sexes up the screen as Catwoman with the witty one-liners, the hot costume and the raunchy whip cracking. Once again Halle has displayed her versatility.This film is called Catwoman, the name should explain itself. I don't understand why people are ripping it to shreds or calling it laughable, e.g. as in the way Patience acts becoming Catwoman, i.e. the catnip incident (once), the hissing at dogs (once), the tuna (once, which I found to be amusing), the prancing around. What exactly did you expect her to do? How else do you act like a cat? How else does a human gain feline tendencies? Got any better ideas? I didn't think so. Yet we don't rip Toby Maguire to shreds when he shoots web from his arms (yeah like THAT makes sense.) There is clearly a double standard approach adopted by some critics, who contradict themselves more then they'd care to admit. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy Spiderman as well as this.This not brain food and you don't have to evaluate your life after it but hey, people need that once in a while. It's a fun movie... The CGI was NOT bad, sure it was obvious at times that it wasn't Halle but for the most part it was done to a high standard. Let's be honest here and give credit where credit is due the cinematography is superb. It has such a visual allure, a dark, rich atmospheric look, and it is almost sexy to look at. The camera work is very original looking, kudos to Pitof, am I the first person to actually praise him? I think so. The scene where the Egyptian Mau brings Patience back to life is beautiful and picturesque. The music creates an epic mood.Sharon was fun to watch as the 'past it', shallow, bitchy Laurel Hedare. Alex Borstein shined as Patience's best friend and Benjamin Bratt did the best that he could with what he was given as dialogue. Lambert Wilson plays his part, in the usual camp style, but does it to perfection. All in all the acting is not bad, and unless somebody has a personal vendetta against Halle Berry, it can't be said that she didn't put her all into the part. She was sizzling as Catwoman. One critic in particular said that she looked \"as sexy as a hairball in the outfit\". Either a jealous woman or a man with terrible taste in women must have written that. Halle has undeniable sex appeal in the part. The soundtrack is typical summer movie fare with the usual dramatic theme song, mixed with the current popular styles, hip-hop, r'n'b. This is after all a film that has to appeal to a teenage audience. The action scenes are exciting and well executed. The ending is suitably over the top but still entertaining. One scene that I thought was ridiculous was the basketball scene and some of the dialogue could have been much better, however the positives weigh out the negatives for me.This is no Citizen Kane or Pulp Fiction but its no Gigli or Swept Away either. I have seen way worse comic book movies. Daredevil, Hell Boy and undoubtedly Hulk were worse than Catwoman. It is, on no level one of the worst films ever made. What were people thinking writing that? I went in with the lowest expectations possible for Catwoman and came out of the theatre having seen a supremely entertaining, undeniably above average film. Critics should be ashamed of themselves and audiences should not be puppets. This is worth seeing. There has been a 'Let's jump on the bandwagon' attitude regarding this film. One person bashes it and suddenly everybody does. I'm glad I went to see this film so I could make up my own mind regarding it. I usually do agree with critics but on this one, I beg to differ. Everybody is entitled to an opinion, you might not like mine, and I might not like yours but there is no need to be downright nasty and unfair when reviewing something. There is such a thing as being balanced. Oh and before people start complaining about the absence of Selina Kyle, and Gotham city, who cares, life is too short.So if you want to some light, leave your brain at the door entertainment, go to see Catwoman. If you want to see a high drama Oscar category film, go to see something else. It's fun, sexy action-packed, camp, stylish summer fare. It is a step above the usual Hollywood fare in the style stakes. Pitof shows a typically stylish French attitude. Halle Berry does herself proud. If you want to be a gullible puppet, believe the 'we're failed artists', overly critical, intellectually snobby critics. I don't really care if that seems like a generalisation because it is most likely true. I bet many of them haven't even seen it. See it for yourself, and make up your own mind. I look forward to a sequel\u0085..",

            "content": "Shy and sweet Patience Phillips is a designer for the advertising team within a large cosmetics firm. Working late one night she discovers that the new anti-aging formula has terrible long term effects \u0096 a discovery that sees her killed by goons in the employment of the Hedare's. Dead and dumped, Patience is brought back to life by a mysterious cat and finds herself blessed with new confidence and powers. Using these she sets out to find out who killed her and why.Most of the time professional and amateur reviewers see average films that are 'OK', they write about them and they move on. Occasionally they see a great film and it is fun to gush about that. However it is a great deal more fun to put the boot in \u0096 however many truly bad films do not get seen and get pushed onto cable or video where many publications will give them a small review if anything. So when a blockbuster comes along that looks like a turkey, the critics swarm around it sensing the blood in the water and the feeding frenzy begins, with each critic seemingly trying to outdo the others with how nasty and harsh they can be while still being creative and enjoyable to read. This is not to say that the film is great but they still overdo the attacks and this is the case with Catwoman, a film that has been selected for this years kicking.Of course it is not totally unwarranted because the film isn't any good and has major problems in several key areas but, having seen some horrid films in my time, it amuses me to see this in the IMDb bottom 100 \u0096 voted there mostly by viewers with, shall we say, a narrow viewing spectrum of Hollywood movies in their multiplex. The film's main problem is the script; the film falls into easily making Catwoman a superhero instead of a person and vaguely tries to explain it away and just move on. Then we have a very thin story with the usual 'discovering and coming to terms with new powers' stuff before we get to an ending that makes little actual sense and is more like a release than a conclusion. The script had potential but it does nothing of interest at all and even struggles to deliver good dialogue with a host of clunky lines standing in for witty repartee and natural conversation.With such thin material to work with the cast are lost. Berry's Patience must have worn thin when she realized that basically all she was required to do was to slink around and look sexy \u0096 there is no character for her, no struggle and no interest. Patience is not a person so much as an extreme shy girl clich\u00e9 that we know is such to allow her to change easily \u0096 Berry looks great even here and she didn't convince. As Catwoman, Berry seems to be with the audience in not understanding who she is meant to be and she does what she can \u0096 slinking around in silly fashion and hissing at dogs; again, pretty unconvincing and serving only as eye candy. I can forgive her for going after the cash but one has to wonder if the first non-white woman to win the BA Oscar should be content with roles that are 100% based on how well her breasts sit up in a backless suit. Stone was clever casting as a woman who has hit hard times with age \u0096 however the script never uses this angle at all and says nothing clever, and when Stone's character reveals her skin is like armour and she cannot feel anything (simply to allow an extended final fight) I felt the audience (all 16 of us) collectively sigh and shake our heads. Bratt looks good but he has very little to do but either flirt or scratch his head and wonder if the sexy black woman who is physically very strong could be in any way related to the sexy black woman who is very strong and fast but wears a mask. Wilson is poor; Borstein is supposed to be comic relief but is annoying and why Massee and Mann both accepted such minor roles that give them nothing to do is beyond me (although I reckon $ had something to do with it). All scenes with Frances Conroy could have been cut \u0096 she is flat and silly with no character; I was actually annoyed for her rather than with her because she has been consistently wonderful on 6 Feet Under and it hurts to see her with nothing at all to work with here.Director Pitof has his background in visual effects and the film does look good generally with an early scene where Patience is chased being very impressive with good use of colour filters etc. Even the CGI effects are not actually that bad, it is just how they are used that is. The Catwoman figure looks like a good video game character but that is not enough for a film. The way she moves is silly looking and actually takes away from the action scenes and it would have been better to get Berry into hard training and try to make a lot more use of wirework than cgi. Of course this is to suggest that the action has any tension or excitement to damage \u0096 they don't. Generally the film crawls along with a silly plot and has no tension or excitement \u0096 mainly, I think, due to the total lack of characters in the whole thing. Contrast it with Spiderman or Spiderman 2 (a film that effortlessly succeeds in every way that this fails), the characters were interesting and on the screen \u0096 here they are neither. Other things that damage it that are less significant include the constant pop soundtrack that blares over most scenes; the silly scenes that serve no purpose (that basketball corn); Berry's constant hip swinging and nothing of any interest happening with our characters heads or below the surface of the basic script.Overall this is not the worst film ever made but it certainly is one of the poorest pieces of popcorn nonsense that I have seen this year. The poor script and total lack of characters is the nail that kills it and no amount of pace in the direction, good set design, sexy minxing from Berry or CGI is able to overcome this very basic problem. Teenagers will lap it up no doubt and to be honest it is no worse than Charley's Angels 2 was last summer but with Spiderman showing us that superhero films can be fun, dark and interesting, Catwoman stands out as a dog of a film \u0096 a dog that has been treated harshly by critics but a dog nonetheless.",

It's not enough that she's meek and mild and won't wear leather. Why does she risk her neck to save a cat? And if she really digs this handsome cop, why doesn't she make more of an effort to keep him around? (Their relationship is like a screenwriter's afterthought.) It's never explained why Patience drops off the art-designs down in the belly of the building--or why the heads of the cosmetics firm think that, by not saying anything about their toxic product, they'll be in the clear when it's discovered somethings wrong with it. But two segments really stand out as idiotic: Halle Berry challenging Benjamin Bratt to a little one-on-one court action and Berry's night flight on a motorcycle (did becoming a cat-woman suddenly make her adept at sports and cycles?). There's no character here, so we really don't care about Catwoman--there's no interest in what's at stake for her. The villains (particularly Sharon Stone) are so poorly defined, we can't even accept a double-cross on face value. And the lovey-dovey stuff seems shoehorned in at the last minute, which bears the question: Why do the makers of these superhero movies always feel their films need a romantic angle? If it's here to titillate the target audience with some hot action, then that failed, too. *1/2 from ****",

            "content": "While one would have to be kitten to call this the cat's meow, \"Catwoman\" is so bad that it may be catalogued as good--so catastrophic in conception and made of the waste one finds in the litter box, that it's as amusing as watching a kitty playing with yarn. At least, it left me feline good. Halle Berry's performance, while surely compared to coughing up a hairball by someone, was worth it merely as the catalyst for her to hold up her Oscar, for \"Monster's Ball\" (2001), in one hand and her Razzie, for this, in the other as she accepted her award at the Golden Raspberry ceremony.Her Patience--already baring the name of a pet--begins generically as supposedly less-attractive, or at least not as sexy, although all this amounts to is Berry (this sentence is cataphoric, by the way) generally pussy-footing through life and wearing loose clothes. While not exactly the cat's pajamas, her wardrobe is loose enough to comfortably sleep in. Since it's a superhero movie with a female lead, the filmmakers, apparently, thought it appropriate to turn the first part into a rom-com. \"Saturday Night Live\" later made a joke of a Black Widow movie as a rom-com, seemingly too scatty to recall that DC and Warner Bros. had already done that with their superheroine here. Thus, Patience has two co-worker friends who interfere in her sex life, one being the rotund comic-relief type and the other the stereotypical gay guy friend. They even provided her with a latex fetish garment, which she repurposes for her first catsuit. And much of the movie is spent on this mouser dating that hot detective from \"Law & Order,\" including some ludicrously-inappropriate sexual flirtation and pawing during a one-on-one basketball game they perform in front of a crowd of school children.While the rom-com high jinks continue, we're also introduced to some hissingly-bad CGI for everything from artificial environments, to magical cats, to Berry leaping across buildings, along with a wretched, if catchy, pop-music score, whooshing sound effects for kicks and twirls and dizzying edits to workaround the choreographed fight moves. Patience receives her second of nine lives by being resurrected by an Egyptian Mau's bad breath, which causes her to become another breed of cat, so to speak--actually, some sort of human-CGI-cat hybrid, as she rubs catnip on her face, prances about her furniture, hisses at barking dogs, scratches men, hates rain, loves sushi and lies in bed eating eight cans of tuna by hand. She learns that a cat in gloves catches no mice and, thus, starts running around and performing catwalks on ledges in a shredded dominatrix cat costume complete with a whip.The best worst thing of all here, however, has to be the dialogue, which is full of some remarkably bad comebacks, puns and, if lucky, catchwords and catchphrases. While Patience is a graphic artist, she lays into her boss with the musical reference, \"Then let me try the remix.\" Even better, she responds to another villain's line of \"game over,\" with the least clever of rejoinders, \"Guess what. It's overtime.\" And, back to the rom-com part, her retort to a warning of a deadly loose electric cable is, \"I know I felt a spark between us.\" Then, of course, there are the cat puns: \"What a purr-fect idea\" or \"Cat got your tongue,\" when, in fact, she is holding his tongue. She even orders a White Russian at a nightclub, but with \"no ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua.\"Sharon Stone is also an appropriately catty glamour puss scorned by her tomcat hubby (in other words, she doesn't like \"Sharon\" her man). There's some ridiculous plot involving a beauty product with hideous side effects, and Berry tries to let this cat out of the bag, but it also gives Stone superpower skin... like a stone, so that she and Berry may catfight, or, if you prefer, fight like cats and dogs. Otherwise, there's a silly science scene where a technician can supposedly tell personalities and genders from handwriting samples. Another scene has Berry slipping like a cat through the bars of a jail cell. There are also clich\u00e9d shots of her posed in front of a gigantic moon, and the copycatted orange-and-teal color grading helps make everything look super unrealistic. It's enough to make a cat laugh.",

However, that alone is not necessarily a negative, unless you are looking for a depiction that follows the source material, in which case, you should know up front, this ain't it. It can be justified to alter fiction over time. This flick serves a couple of purposes, although not one of them was intentional. The two most obvious being revealing that, in spite of the undeniable appeal, a sexy woman behaving in a cat-like manner can actually make her less attractive; and proving that Pitof, as I realized when I watched Vidocq, has absolutely no business directing. He can do FX, few problems there. Meanwhile, any movie he does is going to be driven by the special effects(which are frankly, terrible at times in this), and otherwise be flat and soulless. I mean it, compare any frame of this to that of Batman Returns, when Pfeiffer is on-screen. I've got no issue with Berry, or her skin color. She's done pretty good acting elsewhere. And she definitely looks hot, and not only in this. Here, you too often have to look past the ridiculous things they have her do, right down to numerous of her movements. Burton's transformation sequence was Gothic and disturbing... this one is silly, plain and simple. Meet Patience Philips. She is sad. That does not appear to stem from her fashion sense being arrested sometime in the 80's and continuing to be held for questioning... no, it's because she's mousy and scared. Then... actually, I'll spare you the details. A lot of the plot is beyond ludicrous, and this thing gets stupider the further it goes. The basket scene does add some weight to any insistent arguing that said sport... and indeed, many others that involve men and balls... are homo-erotic. Acting tends to be poor. Merv from the Matrix sequels is here, playing his role in that same way, presumably because it was not believed that American audiences could handle a foreigner doing 2 completely different performances in as many years. The fight scenes are OK. There's actually a decent idea here and there in this. The comedy is never funny. The title female is overly powerful, and nothing particularly threatens her. They go to great lengths to make her seem like a superhero, because, to Hollywood, ambiguity is a city in Russia. I recommend this solely to those with low standards, and anyone wishing to witness Halle embarrass herself. 1/10",

Also some of Halley Berry's acting was very cheesy and laughable. I did like the final action scene between Barry and the Stone, I found that entertaining.

And when I say mess - even when Halle Berry is a mess, she is still a hundred times better than others at their best! Fact - you can't deny that (at least not in a way that I would accept it ;) ). Having said that, there is also Benjamin Bratt here - so almost everyone is covered when it comes to eye candy in the movie. Although you can add Sharon Stone and Kim Smith to those who are into females I reckon.Halle still was able to have a career after that and most did more or less. Kim Smith though - well she wasn't so lucky. Though it is tough to judge or to know if she even was up to the task (acting wise, because she had the looks down for sure). Why am I focusing on the acting? Because a lot has been said about that - and yes it is a bit campy to say the least. But it is the feel they (hopefully) went for anyway.The story is comprehensible, but there are a lot of bad puns along the way and I understand if people are not patient enough. Especially considering the quality the (comic book) movies have nowadays. Not just Marvel - but even DC (I reckon most Snyderverse fans will see it that way).Most probably will still have Michelle Pfeifer as their favorite Catwoman - on the other hand Zoe Kravitz might just have gone and stole that \"crown\" (jewel), especially from younger viewers. Story wise there is not much to tell - and while Hally may look ridiculous in certain scenes (I don't mean the aged CGI mind you), she is still making more sense as a cat lady (no pun intended), than anything that was shown in the movie Cats a few years ago ... just saying.",

This movie had me going the whole time and i love the ending. It is was just a round about fabulous movie. It is a must see movie. I want to buy this movie and i know since it got such bad reviews that they will not finish the once anticipated sequel. But if they were to do a sequel i would be first in line to see it. The only reason people didn't like this movie is because they didn't watch it all the way through or they expected it to be about bat man. But that is all upon them cause it was great and this film deserves a grammy",

            "content": "\"Camp taste draws on a mostly unacknowledged truth of taste: the most refined form of sexual attractiveness (as well as the most refined form of sexual pleasure) consists in going against the grain of one's sex. What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine. Allied to the Camp taste for the androgynous is something that seems quite different but isn't: a relish for exaggerated sexual characteristics and personality mannerisms.\" - Susan Sontag Jean-Christophe Comar's \"Catwoman\" had the potential to be a campy melodrama in the vein of \"Showgirls\", \"Basic Instinct\" and \"All About Eve\". Comar gives us larger-than-life brush-strokes, raging prima donna's and vampish acting, and seems to be trying hard to turn his source material into a Paul Verhoevenesque satire; a gaudy indictment of made-by-committee feminism, the beauty and fashion industries, canned female empowerment and lug-headed consumerism. Unfortunately Comar doesn't seem to know what his film's about. The result: the cinematic equivalent of a Beyonce music-video. Only worse.Halle Berry plays our hero, a meek office worker who markets bad beauty products to youth obsessed women. \"I'm a woman,\" an oppressed Berry moans, \"I'm used to doing all kinds of things I don't want to do!\" Luckily Berry dies and is reborn a self-assured, independent cat woman. \"You are docile yet aggressive, nurturing but ferocious,\" Berry's mentor tells her, \"a cat woman not contained by the rules of society!\" It's hard to know how seriously Comar is taking this little tale of female empowerment. Is he being sincere, or is he mocking poor Berry? Catwoman's free, sure, but only to wear bondage gear, strut about like a hyper-sexualised object and parade her body on rooftops like a catwalk model whilst hilariously over-the-top hip-hop music assaults our ears. Bizarrely, the film's villain is herself a sassy, independent woman \u2013 Sharon Stone in another gloriously camp femme fatale role \u2013 whom our hero defeats during the film's cat fight climax. Like the Ripley vs Queen battle in James Cameron's \"Aliens\", this scene encapsulates Hollywood's view of \"feminism\": code for \"masculinized women killing masculinized women\" (post-feminism seeks to retain the sexual objectification of women under a cloak of ironic emancipation that only really applies to women from privileged backgrounds). Berry wins her battle, of course, but the film makes it clear that both Stone and Berry's characters have essentially been reduced to self-destructive fetish objects by and for powerful men. The film then ends with Stone suicidally throwing herself off a building after catching a glimpse of her ageing reflection in a piece of glass. Berry doesn't win, she's just Stone's replacement. A younger face and tighter body for the camera's salacious gaze. So the film seems like it wants to be a parody of a very Hollywood (and comic book) notion of femininity and female empowerment...only it can't quite muster the energy to push its camp/satirical potential far enough.Regardless, Catwoman always was just a dumb sex symbol. Back in the 1940s she played the Batman's volatile love interest, and was modelled on sex-sirens and screen idols like Hedy Lamarr and Jean Harlow. \"You always need to keep women at arm's length,\" creator Bob Kane would say. \"They're feline creatures, cold and unreliable. Men don't want anyone talking over their souls, and women have a habit of doing that!\" This kind of male chauvinism would inform most incarnations of the Catwoman character. She was conceived as eye candy, before being essentially banned from comics in the 1950s due to the Comic Code. In the 1960s the character was re-imagined in an attempt to pander to feminist movements, but this simply led to Catwoman being completely neutered; attractive, non threatening and largely absent. When the rubble cleared and civil rights movements died off, all pretence could finally be washed away. Catwoman became increasingly sluttier until Frank Miller dropped the charade and made her a former prostitute. In the 1990s DC comics re-branded her as an \"indepedent\", \"sexy\" and \"free\" woman, while giving her bigger boobs and tighter costumes. With comic books increasingly hyper-sexualised and hyper-misogynistic, today she's essentially a porn star, thanks to artists like Greg Horn (one of the few decent Catwoman artists is Adam Hughes). As if to coincide with Chris Nolan's latest Batman film, DC even rebooted its Catwoman line of comic books. This new incarnation keeps the bulging bosoms and sexist imagery \u2013 Catwoman seems destined to always be a male fantasy - but goes further and kicks off with Catwoman having rough sex with Batman. Seriously.5/10 - Worth one viewings.",

Subconsciously, this is your body using its animal instinct, fight or flight if you will, in an attempt to get as far away from this 'movie' as possible. This is the worst film ever made. Halle \"I won an Oscar for sleeping with Billy Bob Thornton on camera\" Berry pretends to act here, portraying Patience Phillips (Selina Kyle anyone?) a loser who works at an evil makeup company, wherein she stumbles upon an evil makeup plot by Sharon Stone and her evil homosexual sidekick. I guess it makes sense, especially to a man simply known as Pitof, who directed this mess. Direction would allude to clarity, which this film does not contain, most likely due to the fact that does not speak English. If he could, there is NO WAY that he would have read the script and felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and make this into a film. Lets not even get into specifics here, because the cinematography, soundtrack, CGI, and especially the acting is the worst I have ever seen. If you don't believe me watch the basketball scene and see if you don't want to hurt people. Watching this film is like someone punching your mother in the face. I tried, I desperately tried to finish the film twice, and neither time my intelligence and dignity simply wouldn't let me. Its just that bad. I could go on and on..... the scene where the cat lady explains to Halle that cats choose one woman like Neo from the Matrix and that cats are magic and whatever else was said while I wasn't paying attention....the laughable fight scenes, the fact that she becomes cat like and licks herself clean and chases crickets etc.... I'm mad at myself that I'm even writing this review, maybe its like Freddy Krueger and we can make it go away by not fearing it. Awful. Disgusting. Disgraceful to all of film. Catwoman.",

The only thing I think was a bit weak was the cgi (about the same level as Spiderman 1) but they only used if when she runs up walls etc-all the ground fighting looked really good.

Patience decides to deliver her work by hand & accidentally overhears George's wife Laurel (Sharon Stone) talking to a scientist who reveals that BeauLine is both addictive & has harmful long term side effects, Patience is discovered & killed. However Patience is brought back to life by an Egyptian Mau cat, somehow. Patience discovers that she now possesses cat like ability, agility & super sensitive senses. Patience decides to use her new found abilities to avenge her own death...This American Australian co-production was directed by Pitof (make mental note to self: do not watch another comic book fantasy film directed by someone who calls themselves by one silly word, McG of Charlie's Angels (2000) & Kaos of Ballistic: Eks vs. Sever (2002) & now Pitof with Catwoman not helping their cause) & has been totally trashed by just about everyone, audiences & critics alike & after seeing Catwoman it's very hard to defend it or disagree with the terrible reviews. I mean as far as female comic book superhero films go it's even worse than Elektra (2005)! The script by John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris & John Rogers (although rumours persist that many more worked on it at various points in it's production) is an absolute mess, it's really slow going with an alarming lack of action or dramatic incident, the character's are awful & one dimensional, the dialogue is horrible with cheesy puns like Catwoman saying 'purrrrrr-fect', the story is badly lacking & even as a fantasy superhero comic book adaptation it is poor. There are many embarrassing scenes that I assume were meant to be serious but come across as laughable, the scene when the cat brings Patience back to life (how did her dead body get on land?), awful scenes of a CGI Catwoman leaping between buildings, the Basketball game between Patience & Tom, Patience licking catnip, the confrontation between Patience & her noisy neighbour & the horribly put together dance floor sequence to name but a few. The film isn't even that faithful to the original comic book source, there's no mention of Gotham City, there's mention of Batman & unlike the literary source the Catwoman on show here actually has cat like superhero abilities rather than just dressing up as one.Director Pitof, real name Jean-Christophe Comar certainly shoots Catwoman with a fair amount of style & there are some cool sweeping shots of the city but other things let him down. Putting the awful script to one side for the moment lets talk costumes, it's very hard to bring a comic book character to life on the big screen since by their very definition they are comic book character's designed to look good as 2-D drawings on a page. Some films have managed it, the Batman franchise, the Spider-Man films, Judge Dredd (1996) & Hellboy (2004) while other's haven't but surely none have realised the central character as badly as here in Catwoman. I don't know what the costume designer was thinking but Berry looks awful in ripped leather trousers, a bra with some straps across her midriff, clawed gloves, horrible open toed shoes & a fancy dress head mask. I actually thought she looked better in that leather catsuit she worse to tackle the gang who are robbing the jewellery store & come to think of it Michelle Pfeiffer looked much better in her PVC catsuit from Batman Returns (1992). I can't remember a comic book film where there is so little action, there are a few OK fights, a scene of Catwoman racing through the city streets on her motorbike, the jewellery store scene & that's just about it. Apparently due to such poor reception from test audiences there were re-shoots, if this one contains some of those re-shoots & still turned out this bad I shudder to think what the original cut was like.According to the IMDb Catwoman had a budget of $85,000,000 which is simply amazing since it's so bad, the CGI effects are varied but the action is almost none existent so I can't really see where the money went & I hated the R&B style music as well just to top if off. Flopping at the box-office with a opening weekend of less than $17,000,000 it was nominated for & won several 'Razzie' awards in 2005 including worst actress (fully deserved & there is some justice after all), worst director (maybe a bit harsh because it does look quite nice) & worst picture (hard to argue). Apparently Berry was paid $14,000,000 for this, personally I think she is a terrible actress, made the worst Bond girl ever & isn't that attractive either. Meanwhile another terribly overrated actress Sharon Stone makes for one of the worst comic book villains ever seemingly only interested in beauty cream! It's not completely her fault though as she only gets about fifteen minutes of screen time to do something with a 'nothing' bit-part character. The rest of the cast are also awful with Alex Borstein as Sally the comedy relief particularly irritating.Catwoman could have been great, I mean it's a fantasy comic book film about a woman dressed in tight leather beating bad guy's up with a whip, how on Earth could this turn out so bad with such a simple fool-proof premise? For those looking for a leather clad female superhero flick then watch Barb Wire (1996) instead because Catwoman doesn't do the business at all.",

And THIS is the most riveting storyline that people who are actually PAID to write screenplays could come up with? And was she a strong woman? No, we had pathetic maladjusted kitty here, getting caught by the police, crying in the interrogation room, her identify blown within the first 45 minutes. Sela Kaye must have shed a few pounds of fur on that one.Halle may have been OK with the cat-suit, but just didn't seem comfortable in the role.

Both the editor and director have absolutely no idea how to cut an action sequence -- all close-ups without even the illusion that Halle was actually working that day. And the CG was not up to the task. Dumb story, dialogue sounding like it was written by a seventh grader, bad directing, bad editing, bad acting, awful and inappropriate music, and a ridiculous catwoman mask. It's completely unwatchable. Even Halle Berry's beautiful face, sexy body and round booty would not justify a five minute look. Pitof thinks he's a DIRECTOR, but this movie proves he's not even a competent VISUAL EFFECTS DIRECTOR. It's a crime that any studio would blow $100M on a pseudo director when this country is chock-full of actual directors who could have taken that same budget and made 40 good movies.",

            "content": "It is confusing to why any distributor would want to release a film explaining the background of a less noted character. Catwoman is a very intriguing character but as the saying goes, some mysteries are better left unsolved. It's good to leave the audience questioning the background of certain characters, otherwise the mind isn't allowed to explore and create the reasons why that character is the way they are.This version of Catwoman tells the story of down on her luck artist Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) who ends up learning a dark secret behind the company that she works for. Once she discovers the truth she's transformed into a human with super cat-like reflexes by a bazillion year old tabby called Midnight. And the fact that Phillips is now called herself \"Catwoman\" is not a new thing. According to the script, there have been woman picked by Midnight to become this Catwoman in the past. So in a sense, the term Catwoman has now been generalized. So now it's just a term for those specific ones chosen by Midnight. It's a neat theory, but this should have not been penned into the actual script that was to be approved.The whole concept of Catwoman was about her strong interest in the way of the feline. To think that she was more inclined to just acting like a cat than having super skills like a cat was more acceptable. Then there's the subplot of Tom Lone, a police officer, who dresses nothing like one. Lone is played by Benjamin Bratt who ends up getting wound up in the usual superhero clich\u00e9: the superhero doesn't tell the lover who they really are until the lover finds out for himself or herself.Plus, as any comic book fan would know, although Catwoman loves to flirt with men, she never settles down. She's a solitary worker. And for almost the whole time during this movie, Phillips is trying to settle down with Lone. Sharon Stone also plays in here, and like most films, she's a baddie. Still seductive, and still dangerous and that's good. Which now leads to the few positives in this bad apple. Halle Berry as Catwoman was a fair choice. Berry can be alluring and quite lethal at the same time so that's a plus. The way she moves is also attractive and her skills are impressive even if there were times where I knew I was completely looking at CGI on the screen. That frustrated me, how could a production with such a high budget make a film with such obvious computer renderings? We're better than that people! Same goes for the cats too; supposedly 43 cats were trained for this film. I only saw one real one and that was the cat who played Midnight and even then, there were times where it looked completely fake. What's the deal?!However, the action scenes were nice. They're not amazing or spectacular but they were entertaining none the less. The flexibility of Catwoman was always cool to watch but that's about it. The dialog was too puny for me. There were too many lines that were said one right after the next that had a cat pun in the sentence. Enough! This isn't a contest, screenwriters! Not even the music by Klaus Badelt helped and he's not a bad composer either! His score to K-19: The Widowmaker (2002) was very moving but it feels like here, he got lazy. Hey Badelt, wake up!Halle Berry and Sharon Stone give passable performances as their characters but nothing else is really noteworthy. Catwoman tries to entertain but it misses with each swipe it takes.",

I liked it so much I went out and bought a DVD copy of my own. I am at a loss as to why so many people feel the need to blast this movie; the acting, casting, direction were all good. OK, the plot wasn't brilliant but then, when was the last time Hollywood produced anything (and I mean anything) brilliant? I am sure the reason so many people were upset with the movie was that it varied from the comic book - Selina Kyle mythology. The problem with comic book movies is that they are going to be seen by comic book readers and therein lies the problem: comic book readers have little or no imagination. Why else do they read books full of pictures? The Selina Kyle model was boring and barely worked as a Batman spin-off. Why would anyone want to see a movie about a \"normal\" chick whose only claim to fame is that she dresses up like a cat. The studio's decision to create a whole new Catwoman with actual cat-based superpowers was a great one and made for a much more interesting movie.Halle Berry was fantastic as Catwoman. The dejectors can say what they like (and they already have), but Halle was awesome. The Catwoman costume was very creative as well. The combination of Halle Berry in the Catwoman costume was unbelievable - veeeerrry sexy.Whilst Catwoman was not the best flick ever made, it is far from the worst.

When I read about Angelina Jolie starring in the role 2 or 3 years before the movie's opening, I was ecstatic. Then, it switched to Nicole Kidman, and then Halle Berry. I was skeptical about how the movie was going to turn out, because at first the plot sounded dumb, and the outfit didn't impress me. After awhile, though I began to love the costume, and after seeing it on opening night, I've been completely obsessed. I've bought all the merchandise, the DVD (watched about 10 times since I bought it), and I believe it is one of the best movies ever! The plot is stupid, I'll admit, and Sharon's acting was terrible, as well as Lambert Wilson's, but I don't understand everyones hatred of Halle's. She was superb in playing all 3 roles in it, Patience, Patience/Catwoman, and Catwoman herself. The movie lines were campy, but who the hell cares, it is a fun action flick, and shouldn't receive all the hatred its getting. The people picking the razzies should take another look at the other loads of crap we got this year, such as Baby Geniuses 2, and Harold & Kumar (which I still don't understand why they made those pieces of crap). Also, everyone was saying how the CG was terrible, and how great Spiderman was. Take a look at the facts, Spiderman is completely covered from head to toe, of course he is going to look good in CG, as Catwoman is mostly skin-showing. I was also disappointed that it wasn't Selina Kyle, but after seeing the movie, it explains that there isn't just one Catwoman, there are many Catwomen, and I think people don't here that part, so they just keep on complaining about a Selina-less movie.

It's not: different name, different premise and totally different interpretation of what it might be like to become a Catwoman. Some of the critics are saying that Halle's performance is too \"over the top\" after she is transformed. Maybe for a 100% human lady but hey this is CATwoman, brought back to life by a magical Mau on an errand from Bast the Cat Goddess! Says Halle: \"I was very committed to bringing this character to life and being as catlike as I could....I spent a lot of time watching my own cat listening to how he purrs and plays and walks and when he gets angry. And there's a sound that he makes that I've tried to use, too.\" She also watched videotapes of lions and tigers and worked with animal co-ordinator Boone Narr, lead trainer Mark Harden, their staff. and the 43 cats that appear in the movie. (99% of the cats you see in the movie are real, not computer generated!) Choreographer Anne Fletcher also helped Halle learn how to move like a cat.

Her great role was first in \"X-Man\" and her greatest performance was in \"Monster's Ball\". However, some critics have written that she is beautiful and hot and, the worst, she believed in such a lie. In \"Catwoman\", she is dreadful in both characters (Patience / Catwoman), specially trying to be sexy in the role of Catwoman. I missed a lot the class, the movements and the charm and sensuality of Michelle Pfeiffer in \"Batman Returns\". At least the soundtrack is reasonable. By the way, who is this awful director? My vote is four.Title (Brazil): \"Mulher-Gato\" (\"Cat-Woman\")",

Spiderman had NOTHING new to contribute its in many ways a clone of its own ... Catwoman may not have a lot of new techniques but it works !! some people badmouth it without the knowledge of the real catwoman ( the marvel cartoon ).. eg just because Catwoman jumps from building in stealth doesn't make it a bad movie maybe you all should take notes or something considering that hale berry is catwoman and not a cat .. The statement that a cat would make noise is plain stupid .. Besides Hale does a far better job than Toby she identifies herself with catwoman Toby does not.. About the plot i really cant sea what all the fuss about what about Spiderman then ? thats a joke .. This ain't a thriller its based on a cartoon and plots in cartoons is for the common folk .. since comics is directed at kids..",

Halle Berry was very believable as the Catwoman and her beauty just added spice to the movie. I was also impressed with Benjamin Bratt, what a hunk, and with Sharon Stone as the villainess. The intense chemistry between Halle and Benjamin made the screen sizzled. The duality of Patience/Catwoman was interesting to view. What happens when a timid, shy woman gain strength and confidence in herself? That the answer that Halle portrays so well in the movie - it's a struggle between these two personalities before they merge into one exciting and mysterious woman still capable of displaying sensitivity and wonder.

But then again it does show the duality of her and that is down to Halle Berry's great acting skills. In my opinion she is the purr fect Cat woman.\nSo before you judge this film, watch it with an open mind and you might just enjoy it. Oh and there is no shame in saying you enjoyed it either ...",

I enjoyed it, and thought that the film delivered.  The story, action, and special effects were good to great. Catwoman, like Daredevil, relishes in the romanticism of the superhero archetype.  Both motion pictures are stylish and sexy, and Catwoman did bring plenty to the screen that is admirable.  The special effects were far from cheesy, and the acting was good.  They managed to make a good superhero film and a \"Lifetime\" movie simultaneously. I understand that a lot of people don't like the Patience Philips character, since she is not the same Catwoman from the comics - but give it a rest!!  This movie was in development for years, and they said as far back as 1999 that it wouldn't be about the usual Catwoman.  If you enjoy movies for fun and the sake of it, check out Catwoman.  It's nowhere near as terrible as people are saying.  And trust me, the same people dissing the film now, will be the first ones in line to purchase the DVD when it's released.",

Amazingly bad. My friend had to tell me the premise \"Sharon Stone invented a facial product that will destroy your face if you stop using it.\" I had to ask him to repeat it. No way did they spend $85 million dollars to base a movie on that premise. No chance. That's simply obscene. It's stupid. It's beyond base. But yes. Now, did the producers pick three writers randomly off the L.A. Metro and force them to decide on the premise before the next stop? What was their first choice? \"Act 1: Catwoman gets feline leukemia and must save herself by traveling into the sun for radiation treatment...\" This is a classic case of giving a project too much money and allowing utter amateurs to get behind and in front of the camera. Every scene was framed and executed with the absolute minimum of forethought. It was as though this had no development time. But I expect it had too much development time. Everyone said their piece, hundreds of opinions were sorted through and lastly, no one was satisfied. When the script started to suffer they hired another writer to help. Then the lawsuits started. So they split the credit but no one wanted or was able to IMPROVE THE SCRIPT. I guarantee the writers lost jobs because of this junk. The producer is probably delivering mail in Glendale. With $85 million dollars they made a movie that is not watchable except in the most vegetative state. It is distracting like chicken mcnuggets. You eat one and forget you ate it.

This is an awful movie loaded with unintentional hilarity.Berry plays Patience Philips, a different kind of comic book loser than we're used to. Meek, humble, totally gorgeous and scared of her own shadow, Philips is lured to her apartment ledge to save a cat. She's rescued by gallant cop who sees instant potential in this distressed damsel \u2013 perhaps it's her supermodel appearance.Cut to the important stuff: Patience, an underling at a cosmetics corporation headed by Sharon Stone and her husband... distributing non-aging makeup with bad long-term effects... takes a package to the factory and, for no apparent reason, is hunted and killed by goons. Now her life, or um, death changes everything. Revived by the same feline that'd lured her to the edge, Patience becomes Catwoman: a lithe vixen climbing walls and leaping around at will. Whenever Berry provides her feline traits \u2013 like hissing in the face of her adversaries or sensuously purring dialog \u2013 the film goes from vapid to pure camp cinema.In fact this entire adaptation of the Batman heroine, with horrendously corny dialog and limp action sequences pumped by a techno/R&B soundtrack, constantly reminds us we're not supposed to laugh.

Then, amazingly, she develops cat-like skills and decides to expose the cosmetics company for what it is.\"Catwoman\" is not as bad as its reputation suggests...but it's still a bad movie in many ways. The dialog is often rather stupid, the story is bizarre and the film is a great example of style over substance. The script is stupid and doesn't make a lot of sense--nor does it make sense when Catwoman instantly believes everything her evil boss, Laurel (Sharon Stone), tells her. So, the director tried to hide these and many other deficits by having loud and abrasive music, big stunts and lots of weird artsy moments. Overall, I'd say that the film is notorious mostly because it was so expensive and glitzy and yet so hollow and ridiculous. It also has a story line that simply wasn't going to work no matter how they tried to disguise it.",

Halle Berry's acting skill brought this movie to justice. It was very action packed and very sexy and romantic. No Catwoman ever did romance like this movie did it.

Apart from The Fantastic Four, it's the only one that gave me the same kind of square, giddy delight comics themselves used to, when I was young enough to be steeped in them, and before they became \"graphic novels\" and gained academic approval. It also recalled the kindred simple pleasures of the early James Bond films. More than any other picturization of a superhero, and especially in contrast to the Spider-Man series, Catwoman follows through on its central fantasy: to suddenly have superpowers and to find out how to use them. The movie shows you how it would feel to be a superhero, and leads you to imagine yourself as one. But it's only for people who want to surrender to that fantasy, not those who are set on holding back and feeling superior to it. In other words, it's for kids, not people trying to be grown-ups. But apparently many former children who haven't quite managed to put away childish things have cast off the only ones that mattered; and so they rejected this movie en masse. But I was content to let it bear me whither it would, and this it was able to do easily, since it has a spry, catlike grace of its own, and a rich, posterlike beauty besides. Not to overlook Halle Berry: although she did some dissing of the movie after the fact, by the evidence on screen she was fully immersed in the fantasy, and fully enjoying it. Cultural forecasts are always risky, but I predict that in twenty years' time, when some of the people who first experienced this movie when they were too young to resist it begin writing about movies, Catwoman will acquire a reputation more in accord with its deserts.",

Law and order, appropriately enough, comes packed in the form of Benjamin Bratt. But, no! You'd be wrong.The most interesting thing about the movie -- or the least uninteresting, depending on your metric -- is Halle Berry's Catwoman disguise. First of all, it doesn't disguise much of this cutie-pie's figure, which is why I gave it two stars instead of only one.The director, Pitof, has only a single name because, as far as it's possible to judge, he hasn't earned a second. He's given the juicy Berry a black leather jump suit with a very low top in front and no back at all. If it weren't for that costume, Pitof wouldn't even have ONE name. Oh -- and he gave her what I assume is a kind of feline walk, which most of us would call slinky. She thrusts her hips forward, lowers her face, glowers up at the target through her perfunctory mask, and walks by placing one foot directly in front of the other, like a runway model.That's enough. The pattern is surely exhausted by now. I'm beginning to loathe the original \"Superman\" which started this whole business of comic-strip heroes and their sequelae. What is Spider-Man up to now?

            "content": "The problem with \"Catwoman\" isn't so much that this isn't the one from the Batworld (the city it's set in is never named, but it's not likely to be Gotham City), but that it commits the dual offence of spitting in the face of buffs while providing hardly anything for newcomers. With writers including the team of John Brancato and Michael Ferris (whose disappointing CV already includes \"The Net,\" \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" and the equally dreary TV series \"The Others\") and direction by Pitof - whose name, as Jasper Carrott once put it, is one letter away from the truth - this origins movie even achieves the seemingly impossible in making Halle Berry unsexy. I blame that horrible costume.Our heroine's friend Alex Borstein has \"comic relief\" stamped all over her face, but the whole movie has the worst kind of campy vibe about it - impossible to take seriously, but done in such a straight-faced way that it's equally impossible to laugh at it. Badly-done camp isn't the only way it's reminiscent of earlier \"Batman\" efforts - the plot point of face cream that has a drastic effect on women comes from the first Tim Burton movie (though Beau-line isn't as deadly as Smylex), and no one can think of Catwoman without thinking of \"Batman Returns,\" although Halle Berry isn't half as effective as Michelle Pfeiffer was. Though it has to be said that Michelle had much better material on her side, so you can't blame Halle for the end result.But you can blame her for not being that convincing as Catwoman, you can blame Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson for being useless villains (Wilson's acting as the head of the cosmetics firm our heroine works at is excruciating), and you can blame the fight scenes for being constantly undercut by out-of-place songs, in addition to not being terribly exciting to begin with (Klaus Badelt's score is another minus). You can also blame the bad effects, the draggy pace, the silly plot turns (about the only thing she doesn't do after she gets her cat powers is cough up a hairball)... \"Catwoman\" would make \"Daredevil\" look like a masterpiece if it weren't for such a thing being impossible. Special lament to Frances Conroy for slumming it here between episodes of \"Six Feet Under.\"Halle and Sharon notwithstanding, it's Kim Smith as the company's new model who sums up \"Catwoman\" in one of her two lines of dialogue (both to Wilson) - sitting in the audience of a ballet, she gives new meaning to the expression \"Out of the mouths of babes\" by saying \"I think this is a total waste of time.\" Shortly afterwards she walks out of both the ballet and the movie; many would be wise to follow her lead.",

            "content": "You know the old saying, \"Do not change horses mid-race\", well I think that heavily applies to this film. I think the biggest hurdle that most of us had to overcome in this film was that Catwoman was not Michelle Pfeiffer. Most of us are still a generation of Batman Returns fans, as well as Tim Burton's darkness, and Halle just couldn't fit those shoes. Pfeiffer gave us this unbridled performance as this tormented woman who is given a rebirth by some cats, while Berry continually felt as if she was just going through the motions in order to try to be cooler than Pfeiffer was. You could see the competition going on in the film, and it hurt the overall story and characters. I will agree, this film had a very weak plot, but with the right person behind the mask of Catwoman, this could have been a decent film. Sadly, Berry just didn't put the force into it that I felt Pfeiffer did. There wasn't enough passion in the eyes, just this uncanny ability to act like a cat. Catwoman was more than \"just a cat\", she was this troubled soul that had to deal with both the good side of her actions as well as the devilish. That is what never came through with Berry.Outside of the complete miscast of Halle Berry, there were a couple other points that I just felt cheated after watching the film. The scene where the cat breaths on Halle was too eerily like Ralph Wiggum's \"My cat's breath smells like cat food\" moment. I kept waiting to hear that whenever possible. It would have granted this film one additional star more. Sadly, we had to live with what was in this film, and not what wasn't. What was in this film was shoddy acting, a very flimsy script, and scenario after scenario that just didn't seem to work. I realize the Pitof (the director) was trying to show a very feminine film that could be seen as a feminist picture, but to me it just didn't work. All of the sudden this cat brings out what Patience couldn't in the past? Suddenly, with the quick breath of a cat, she could play basketball better than ever, crack a whip, and drive a motorcycle. There was no development here, just plain assumption. I needed more development of this character instead of just this light-speed characterization that lead nowhere.Another element that didn't brood well with me were the villains. Who were they? What was their purpose behind their situations? Without giving us any of this information, we can only assume that they really weren't evil and that perhaps Catwoman was caught up in this big misunderstanding? I know that is far fetched, but honestly Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson were not that sinister. Sure, every company that you work for has that boss that is not going to treat you with the greatest of respect, but does that make him the super-villain? Then you have Sharon Stone with this pathetic super power that works and doesn't work half the time. I just didn't care at this point what Catwoman was to do to stop the corporation. It was this huge dilemma that I could have solved quickly by perhaps incorporating something about the Umbrella Corporation and a tie into Resident Evil 3. Anything could have been better than what Pitof presented here.The themes were also as jumbled as a child's playroom. Scattered throughout this picture you had different themes that never quite tied into the big solution. There were the feminist issues, the skin care/growing old is \"ok\" theme, the dual personalities and to live life to the fullest moments, and then there was the pro-self sidesteps that just never took us anywhere. It was like bobbing for themes in this mess. Nearly every five minutes, Pitof would present to us either a new theme or an older one that should have been dropped, but instead found itself back in the picture. It became increasingly clear with these scattered themes why Berry couldn't quite capture her character. There were supposed to be several layers to her character, but instead with all the layers everywhere except on Berry, it became increasingly more difficult to uncover. This caused both problems for the film itself as well as for the audience forced to sit through this mess. I mean who wants to visit a place of rest and have to clean up before being able to enjoy it. Not me, and that is how I felt with this film. I felt that it was this huge mess that Pitof created and wanted me to clean up. It was pathetic.Overall, I was not happy with this film. Either Pfeiffer should have been in it or it should have been shelved. With the growing business behind superheroes in today's cinema, Hollywood studios will have to pick and choose which ones they think will be big. You cannot release them all, and it proves with the attempt to capitalize on this small hero that ultimately failed. I hate to go with the rest of the critics with this one, but I just did not enjoy the final result. The costume, the style, the themes, and the acting all put a hinder on this film that was unrepairable from the beginning. This is a perfect example of a film that should have been scrapped from the beginning instead of rushed to theaters. Procrastination does not pay off in the long run!Grade: * out of *****",

Now that I think about it, that's probably about all it does.We have the same borrowed Marvel story about how an ordinary woman becomes superhuman. This is given a little more development though, showing us Egyptian roots to cats as sacred beings and protectors. This hocus pocus background meets up with a talented and zany Berry (also carefully portrayed as weak). The transformed \"Catwoman\" seeks revenge against her murdering employers.We see way too much CG in this film, to the point that I felt entire scenes were generated by computer and didn't look very passable. *SPOILER* As a way of doing a big \"showdown\" between Catwoman and some formidable foe, the director took a new-age spin of pinning superwoman versus superwoman. An aging Sharon Stone plays a villain whose skin is as hard as iron and doesn't transmit pain. She and the feline engage in a pretty hokey/lame battle. This film carries several head shakes and silly laughs. 2/10",

            "content": "While I think the rating of 3.5/10 is a little too harsh, 'Catwoman' is far from the best superhero movies. The main problem about it is that everything is too over the top and the script lacks depth. Starting from the inconsistent camera-work, the acting, the CGI...it's all overdone. The CGI is so overdone that it looks fake. The characters are too sketchy and the story loses focus. Ironically the ending is very 'Spiderman' like. Halle Berry looks extremely sexy in that small tight leather suit but she really exaggerates the sexy catness too much. Think of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in Burton's 'Batman Returns' and how she fit the part so naturally. Ms. Berry emphasizes on the seduction a little too much. But it would be wrong to deny that she was very pleasing to look at. As Patience she seems a little lost. Sharon Stone's Laurel Hedare is the caricature villain but she too looked quite alluring. Benjamin Bratt is the typical boyfriend. Now Frances Conroy is another actress who's also unintentionally funny. Alex Borstein acts very natural. While 'Catwoman' is very flawed, I wouldn't say it's terrible. It's a disappointing film but not disastrous and one should just see it with an open mind. The action scenes are quite alright but for an action film, it's a little too slow-paced. Some scenes were quite entertaining like the contortionists at the opera, the interiors of the Beauty product company and the basketball scene. For a one-time watch, I didn't mind it so much. It's still much better than the Tomb Raider Lara Croft movies.",

            "review_title": "What a Load of Kitty Litter",
            "content": "Out of all the Batman characters to have their own feature length movie, none have been more infamous than one of his greatest foes, Catwoman. Made after years of development hell following the successful albeit controversial Batman Returns, a stand alone Catwoman origin story was brought to the big screen in 2004, with Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry in the title role. Despite the hype, the film was met with scathing reviews and a poor financial performance, and is often considered one of the worst comic book movies of all time, let alone movies in general. After seeing the final result, it sure is one big pile of kitty litter.As a more one off origin story of Catwoman, the film centers on meek designer Patience Phillips, who discovers a conspiracy within the cosmetics company Hedare Beauty that involves their biggest product possibly leading to serious health dilemmas. After being murdered by the conspirators, she is revived by Egyptian cats that grant her superhuman cat-like abilities and becomes the crime-fighting crusader Catwoman. While that plot may sound bizarrely fascinating on paper, the movie unfortunately comes off as way too bizarre for its own good. The main fact that the villains in the movie are makeup company owners is ridiculous enough, but their actual motives are even more baffling once you get into the film's poor take on corporate expansion. It's really insulting how the movie tries to present this huge theme of female empowerment, yet it comes off as manipulatively sexist, as if the script was made up by a bunch of old men in a boardroom rather than a passionate screenwriter. Then again, the whole movie reeks of sexual overtones that you can't take it that seriously.A good example would have to be Catwoman's outfit, which looks so skimpy and unintentionally degrading that Patience comes off more as a gimp than an actual superhero. Also, given that the film's director was formerly a visual effects artist, one can understand a lot of gritty backdrops and computer effects throughout, including some portions of a computer generated Catwoman for hard to reach places. The sets do look pretty grim and disturbing from time to time, but the visual effects actually detract from their frightening look and age the film like rancid cat milk. That joke may have been bad, but it's still better than any of the tired cat puns this film's script coughs up. However, the greatest crime the film committed overall might have to be the editing. A lot of the sequences have so many cuts per second, and it becomes so hard to comprehend what is happening on screen, be it an action scene or a casual conversation. It feels like the filmmakers couldn't trust their audience to sit still for one whole minute that they desperately wanted to jump around with one shot after another.If there is one true saving grace throughout the whole movie, it would have to be Halle Berry performing her damndest as Patience/Catwoman. Granted, her hoaky acting does explain why she received a Razzie, but she is definitely the most convincing in terms of bringing this oddball woman to life through the weak dialogue and jumbled narrative. She also does a good job transitioning from neurotically quiet mess to cat conniving crusader, even if some of her scenes can come off as a little too corny. As for the rest of the cast, Benjamin Bratt is hammily charismatic as detective Tom Lone, Alex Borstein is annoying as Patience's comical friend Sally, and Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson might have the most boring roles in the whole movie: the Hedares. While seemingly subtly sly at first, they barely have much going on outside of being the one note baddies, and let's just their performances are not the least believable in the slightest. It really is saying something when a movie about a feline-esque superheroine has a less fascinating cast than it should.Catwoman has seen better days in a lot of Batman accompanied properties, but it seems like that little kitty couldn't quite land on her own feet. After almost twenty years, Halle Berry's Catwoman venture still stands as one of the most laughable embarrassments of an ambitious experiment gone horribly wrong. Maybe one day, the cunning feline will get her chance to truly shine once more standing alone, but there's a reason why even die hard comic book fans don't like to look back on stuff like this. At least now we can remember Halle Berry as the ultimate dual Oscar and Razzie owner?",

I really like the soundtrack, visuals (Remember that club with all the lights?) and the action scenes are pretty mighty. I would feel very cool if I could do those things, and isn't that the point of action movies? The special effects are veeery well done, they really surprise me to this day... I like the main character Patience a lot, she is a little like me, simple, shy and doesn't really express herself through clothing and a sexy style, but rather through her personality and talents. But her beauty still does shine through and the movie teaches us that we do have to let go sometimes and not be our usual selves to be even more attractive. We need to have some fun! No one is just one-sided! Even the movie itself has kind of earned that title, not very respected and loved in general, but there are people like me who find it to me damn good and that's all that matters!

            "content": "Usually, when you watch a movie with a bad reputation, you're pleasantly surprised. Or else, that means the movie is VERY bad (Judge Dredd, for example). Don't worry, unlike IMDb's infame-ous troll (I won't say his name but his initials are SV), I won't try to pretend Catwoman is the best superhero movie on the market. That would be a lie. But at least, it's watchable. I found myself watching it from the beginning to the end without feeling bored, despite the many plot holes and continuity errors.So, what are Catwoman good parts? 1-The opening credits, with clippings and articles about cats and the previous Catwomen (I don't think Pitof directed it, since there's a similar scene in the movie which is poorly edited). 2-There are a few beautiful shots: the very first scene, an underwater shot of Patience, alas spoiled by a stupid voice-over; or the two shots of Catwoman in front of the moon. 3-The first Catwoman costume. The one she's wearing during the jewelry's heist. How come they thought the atrocious second costume was better? 4-Halle Berry. Like Helen Slater for Supergirl, Halle was blamed for Catwoman's failure while she was the only actress who took the project seriously and gave us a convincing acting, both as Patience and as Catwoman. She did the best she could with the script and truly didn't deserved her razzie.The bad parts? 1-Pitof! He's unquestionably the worst director on the market! This man knows nothing about storytelling, using a dozen of shots when one would be sufficient, and sometimes filming everything except what is happening. Most of the fighting scenes are confusing since it's hard to figure what's going on. 2-The CGIs! As someone already noted, the best CGis are on par with Spider-Man's worst. Worst of all, they were used for scenes that would have looked better with trained animals, animatronics, stunt women and wire works. 3-The promotion. First, they pretended Catwoman was a serious movie with a message about female empowerment. When the movie bombed at the US box office but was about to be released in other countries, they said it was an humorous, tongue-in-check movie, not to be taken seriously (And note how Pitof, after telling everyone he had never read anything about the comic's Catwoman, was then pretending he has been a fan of the comic for years!). Unfortunately, Catwoman was none of both, so the spectators were disappointed in both cases. Not to mention the trailers only used the corniest scenes and dialogs of the movie. 4-The main villain. It would have been a great plot twist if Laurel was first shown as a likable allie for Catwoman, while her husband looked like the real villain (according to earlier Sharon's interviews, it seems it was the original intent). Unfortunately, she's immediately revealed as the main villain. Another problem is the villain in a good superhero movie must be a) someone with powers or abilities that made him equal or superior to the main character (Zord, Joker, Selena, Magneto, Green Goblin, Dr Octopus), b) someone smart enough to find the main character's weaknesses and use them to get the upper hand on him (Lex Luthor, Top Dollar); in both case: someone that can be a match for the hero(in). What are Laurel's powers? She can't be wounded. That's all. She get her indestructible ass kicked for about 3 minutes, get the upper hand for a few second, then get her ass kicked again and die. What a looser! I think it would have been better if the writers had made her a former Catwoman gone bad, with the same powers than Patience.All in all, it's a movie that is watchable... on TV! This way, you don't get your guilty pleasure spoiled by the thought that you gave money for seeing this.",

            "content": "Though there was never any great public outcry for it, the idea of producing a Catwoman movie had been in one stage of planning or another ever since 1992, when Michelle Pfeiffer memorably brought the character to the big screen in BATMAN RETURNS. I'm not sure why. Certainly Pfieffer's sensual interpretation of the character was one of the few pleasures to be had in that woeful sequel to Tim Burton's equally bleak and depressing original: but even so, Catwoman, in and of herself, is not really all that interesting as a character. Without Batman, there is no point to Catwoman -- just as there would be no point in making a movie about Prof. Moriarty without Sherlock Holmes or about Ernst Blofeld without James Bond. Catwoman's allure -- cheesy sexual fantasies aside -- exists solely as part of the Batman mystique. Even going back to Julie Newmar's purrrfect incarnation of the role in the 60's TV serial, Catwoman never stood out as a criminal mastermind or a colorful adventure figure, but rather as one of Batman's more memorable props, the one criminal who might seduce Batman into being bad, or at least naughty. Like all the other cartoonish villains in the series, Catwoman is a gimmick -- a clever gimmick, in that her black cat imagery is both a counterpart and a contrast to Batman's dark, yet heroic, persona -- but a prop nonetheless. Like the Batmobile or the Utility Belt, she is just another part of the Batman play set. Thus, it is curious that not only does the CATWOMAN movie have no Batman, or even a reference to his existence, but apparently this isn't even the same \"catwoman.\" As played by Halle Berry with a strange sense of desperation, this Catwoman is Patience Phillips, not Selina Kyle. So, even though the character is credited to Batman creator Bob Kane, the film really isn't even a sequel or a spin off of the Batman franchise, making it even more perplexing as to why it exists at all. Unlike her original incarnation, this Catwoman is more than a glorified cat burglar with a cat fetish and a delightfully eccentric sense of style. Patience is murdered and -- for mystical, ancient Egyptian reasons the aren't made a bit clear -- she is instantly reborn with cat-like superpowers. Which probably explains just why the film finally got made; it has more in common with the freshly released SPIDER-MAN than with anything in the Batman universe. Like Spider-Man, Patience finds herself with a batch of superhuman skills; unlike Spidey, she can't decide whether to use them for good or evil. That's intriguing. But what shows promise as a quasi-feminist lesson in female self-empowerment, quickly falls back on predictable sexist stereotyping. Instead of becoming a super criminal or super crimefighter, Patience spends most of the movie confused and indecisive. Though it is clear that her newfound skills make her a match to any man, the lame plot pits her against a female adversary, and not a particularly threatening one either. Sharon Stone does the \"special guest villainess\" bit as Laurel Hedare, a cosmetics titan who wants to flood the market with addictive face cream that ultimately destroys the wearer's face. That's just dumb; the potential lawsuits would negate any profits. And Catwoman ends up being little more than a consumer advocate. Besides, dropping a dime to the FDA would accomplish the same thing as all of Catwoman's rooftop hopping.The film plays like an unsold pilot for a TV series, or worse, a Lifetime TV movie. The director, Pitof (never trust a director with only one name), is addicted to clumsy, excessive editing and the film has the hollow, pretentious feel of one of those artsy TV commercials that tries to sell an attitude, rather than a product. Wearing what must be the most god-awful, ugliest superhero costume ever, Berry looks more slutty than slinky, more trailer-trash tacky than comicbook cool. Compared to Newmar's classic leather jump suit (less skin, more style), Berry looks like a parody of a low rent hooker. But, at least, she tries to give a performance which is preferable to when the character is taken over by the CGI guys; it is always painfully obvious when Catwoman switches from being human to being cartoon, the latter never looking real or even surreal, just fake.CATWOMAN is one of those projects that gets kicked around so much and by so many over the years that by the time it gets to the screen it is clearly damaged goods. Yet, it's hard to be forgiving; despite its pedigree (pre-sold concept, Oscar-winning star and all the time, money and talent that Hollywood can afford to waste), CATWOMAN ends up being just a disagreeable alley cat, a stray that has lived one too many lives.",

I think there are things that could be been better (supporting cast, Ben Bratt taking his shirt off more, a more believable evil plot than cosmetics) but for what I paid, it was fun and campy. I think that for the camp value alone of Sharon Stone, this should be seen. Also, I loved Mo Collins - she was the perfect best friend for this movie!",

Unfortunately, while \"Catwoman\" is bad, it's no so bad that it actually becomes funny again. Instead, it's the incredibly boring, lame, and predictable kind of \"bad\".This is one of those rare movies where nothing seems to work. First of all, the plot is awful. It's silly beyond belief, lacks any kind of tension, and is so predictable that you can pretty much guess it all after having seen the first five minutes of the movie.Next, there just aren't any good action sequences. Granted, there are a couple of sequences in which Halle Berry runs around in a silly leather costume (or should that be \"lack of costume\"?) and does some supposedly sexy stuff with a whip, but with no memorable villains or situations to speak of, the most likely reaction these scenes will invoke is tedium.Furthermore, I often found this movie quite embarrassing. Halle Berry's transformation from super-shy nobody to scantily clad feline, and her subsequent flirting with Benjamin Bratt are supposedly meant to be sexy and erotic, but everything is so obvious, lame, poorly acted, and unconvincing that watching all of it becomes a chore.Finally, there's just nothing else the movie has going for it, from the soundtrack that consists mainly of girly R&B, which is unlikely to appeal to super hero movie fans (or anybody above the age of 14 for that matter), to the overuse of barely competent CGI.I've once heard that cats sleep about eighty percent of their lives. If Berry had done the same in this movie, it couldn't possibly have been any more boring than it is now.* out of *****",

It is not a fair comparison given between this version Ms. Berry does versus Michelle Pfeiffer, Eartha Kitt, or the others. She does it different & is painted as a different kitten.Halle Berry would have been better suited if she had been given more acting in the way of scripting. What she gets she brings out well but the problem she is lack of scripting she needs to bring her talents out. She does not get enough to do & Halle is capable of so much more.Computerization of special effects is ruining a lot of newer films and it gets hokey in this one. Why is it that in some films, computer effects can be made to look real & in others, it isn't? Sometimes I think the film makers are playing to a video game audience in live action films. That doesn't work for me.Sharon Stone as an evil femme fatal gets a gold star for her performance in this. She gets more script to work with in her role & it shows as she steals the acting in this film. Even her evil husband is totally upstaged. Only problem with Sharon is the poorly staged final battle with Catwoman where the woeful staging makes the battle laughable though the barbs her and Catwoman throw back & forth during the battle are not bad at all.This film is worth viewing, & the DVD features a special about all the Catwomen hosted by Eartha Kitt & featuring all of them in interviews. This special is a real bonus. If Halle Berry & I were alone & she had Eartha's sexy voice too, she'd melt my socks!",

It was NOT Batman & Robin, like a lot of people are saying. It takes a simple concept and does so much with it. The creators of this film do so much with what they are given. The characters, unlike what previous posters have said, are very well developed, and there is much raw emotion displayed, especially between Halle and Benjamin, who fit together in this movie like hand in glove. And Sharon plays the baddest b-word you've ever seen!Over all, this movie is a weird but creative combination between Ready to Wear, Spider-Man 2, Batman Returns, The Matrix, Batman Forever, City of Lost Children, Batman, and The Crow. Everything is satisfying in this film, even the music. I can't describe what a treat this film was, just because it was so unique. My advice is to go see it yourself. You may like it, you may not.

So sooner or later a woman had to come into the picture and since Supergirl never satisfied anyone, they had to look for someone else, someone a little bit more attractive. And since Spiderman had many long legs and arms blocking the way they had to look somewhere else farther out of the way. They looked in Egypt, they looked in China, they looked in the Middle Ages for an animal connected to women and who was both satanic and in relation with freedom, liberty and freewheeling. That's how the cat came out of the wizard's hat or bonnet. Catwoman was thus saved from the water of the river, which is absolutely accurate, and brought back to life in the human world of the night. She became the queen of the roofs. Then add a dishonest but successful industrialist exploiting women with beauty products that you must definitely not stop if you don't want to develop some strange Karposi syndrome or cancer. Then add his wife, an old belle who has aged faster than necessary and who wants to get rid of her husband and put her hands on the golden goose and the bank reserves before he finally realizes he does not need her anymore. And then you have the perfect thriller. A little bit of romance between the cop who is supposed to arrest Catwoman and the woman she is supposed to be and you have a heartbreaking story. But the poor Catwoman cannot stay because she is nothing but a living dead. So sadness takes over and she can only exist at night and on the roofs of the city. And there you have some kind of a myth of the cat seen as a symbol of \u0085 what have I said already? But what's the meaning of this fable?

            "content": "I want to start off by saying I've never read the Catwoman comic books, or watched Batman (the show from the 1960s is too goofy for my taste), but I found this movie intriguing. I think Halle Berry is more than just a beautiful face, as she is a talented actress as well. Her character's name is Patience Philips. She's an artist who is employed at a cosmetics company, Hedare Beauty. They're planning to ship a new skin cream, Beau-line, that promises to reverse the effects of aging. During a visit to the R&D laboratory facility, Patience overhears Dr. Ivan Slavicky (Peter Wingfield) telling Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone), who is the wife of the owner, George Hedare (Lambert Wilson), about the cream's harsh side effects if used for a prolonged amount of time. Laurel's guards spot Patience, chase her, and as she is running through a conduit pipe, she's flushed out of it, subsequently drowning. When she is washed up onshore, an Egyptian Mau cat revives her, turning her into Catwoman. During the day she's polite, soft-spoken, and somewhat of a doormat. But at night she becomes a hardcore, sharp tongued vixen.I thought Sharon Stone was cast perfectly as the villain (or rather villain-ness I should say). Although I enjoyed the movie, I found the romance junk to be annoying. I'm straight and I even get annoyed by the heteronormativity that is so prevalent in the media. It was also sexist at times. I did tell myself okay, this was 2004, but I'm sure even back then, society was more progressive than what was spoken by Patience's coworker and friend, Sally (Alex Borstein). Before Patience even became Catwoman she encounters Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), who discovers her out on her apartment ledge. He thinks she's suicidal (she was trying to coax the cat who would end up being the one turning her into Catwoman to come down), so he tries to save her. Afterwards he comes to her job to return something to her that she had dropped as she was rushing off to work. This is when the audience is introduced to Sally, who, must I say, is so pushy in trying to get Patience to go on a date (well, let's be honest, sleep with) Detective Lone. If she was my coworker, she would get on my nerves. Good grief, there's more to life than sex! She definitely wouldn't be a person who I'd be friends with outside of work. She's too intrusive. I also thought the basketball scene was pretty weird. Patience and Detective Lone cross paths again when she goes to an elementary school where he's giving a presentation to a class. They all go out to a basketball court, and thanks to her cat like abilities, Patience runs up a wall, impressing Detective Lone. The two of them play with each other. Based on their one on one game, there was obviously sexual tension. It was bizarre how they were lusting after each other in front of the kids. He was even checking out her butt while she was dribbling! Having kids be in a scene that implied erotic feelings between adults was just wrong. When she's telling Sally about the game, Sally tells her to never beat a man in sports. What kind of bullcrap is that??? I'm sure that line wouldn't be in a movie nowadays, but for the early 2000s it was highly outdated. Once you get past the beginning portion, it's a really cool film. I loved the action sequences. Even for people who aren't superhero fans, this movie is still enjoyable.",

One day she witnesses something she shouldn't have and she's murdered. Before long she's brought back to life by a mysterious cat and soon after that she's fighting crime as the title character.CATWOMAN is a film that I've wanted to check out since its original release simply because the reviews were so bad and the film become somewhat notorious for how bad it is. It took me thirteen-years to finally see it and I wish I would have waited another thirteen. There are all sorts of issues with this film but I must start off by saying that Berry is a very beautiful woman and the film does a nice job at showing off her body. With that said, if there was ever a comic book movie screaming for a R-rating this was it.As I said, there are countless problems with this film but I guess we can start with Berry. As the Patience character I thought she was pretty good as she did a good job at playing the sillier side of the character. She was believable in the part but all of this changes when she became Catwoman. There are countless problems with the character itself including some really lame one-liners as well as Berry's delivery. The cat sounds she makes is just embarrassing and I couldn't help but feel bad for Berry because she's the one being embarrassed.Benjamin Bratt is okay in the role of the love interest but Sharon Stone is downright awful in her role. Again, perhaps I shouldn't blame the actress too much because the screenplay is very poor. With that said, there's no doubt that Stone's character is one of the worst villains in film history. Not just comic book film history but film history in general. Her entire scheme is just lame and it doesn't help that you're never threatened by her.The screenplay is full of issues but the direction by Pitof isn't any better. The wannabe fast, MTV-style editing is just lame and I'd argue that there's no one well-directed scene in the picture. Just take a look at the ferris wheel sequence or a really embarrassing basketball game. Two really awful scenes but there are more scattered throughout.

And for the record, there is never a time when Halle is on screen that should be classified as being boring or UN-entertaining. Yes the story was weak and the other actors were not up to par, but Halle was not \"awkwardly cast as the lead.\" I would go as far as to suggest that if Chris Nolan ever does a Batman film with Catwoman (which is inevitable) it would be imperative that Halle be cast as Selina Kyle/Catwoman.",

Kudos for Halle!!! It's nice to see Lambert Wilson in an evil guy role again and Sharon stone finally plays good in this movie. Also I would like to stress out that the music is very good and catching.Summarizing Catwoman is a far better movie than Daredevil, Hulk, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin.I would love to see a sequel of that film.",

            "content": "This is what happens to a comic book movie when there is no central intelligence or guiding hand in control who understands and respects the character. It makes me doubly thankful for the Spider-Man and X-Men films, which could easily have had the same thing happen to them.The sad part is, there are flashes, here and there, of a much better movie which is hopelessly buried under the main portion of schlock.1) The opening credit sequence is interesting, and intriguing, with it's suggestion of a 'cat cult' that runs throughout human history. It's an element that never really gets touched on in the comics. It's just that Selina Kyle really likes cats, and the role suits her personality. 2) Catwoman's 'first' outfit, the black patent leather suit with the domino mask, is 100 times more convincing than the horrible thing she eventually ends up in.3) And the whole scene in which that she wears the black leather outfit,where she kicks the bejeezus out of the hoodlums in the jewelry store because she wants to rob it herself...THAT'S the movie they SHOULD have made.4) When Catwoman uses her 'feline' abilities to slither through the bars of her jail cell, that is pretty cool. It's something that a 'normal' person couldn't do, but something a lithe woman who was 'channeling' a cat might be able to pull off, and it is understated and quirky enough to make the viewer say, \"Hey, that's an interesting ramification of being 'cat-like' that I hadn't thought of.\" It looks good.5) And even with all the stupid 'cat' jokes - the tuna consumption, hissing at dogs etc., Halle sometimes gets enough 'ooomph' into the character that you suspend disbelief for 3-4 seconds at a time. A lot of actresses wouldn't be able to pull it off in the middle of all the other stupidity ...even Michelle Pfeifer and Julie Newmar might not be able to make that stupid outfit work at all.6) In spite of the fact that Sharon Stone's villain has an extremely stupid superpower - skin turned to stone by her own product - and in spite of the fact that the character of the villain is a one-note caricature, she is a good choice for the role, and she actually sort-of makes the character work for about one scene in every 4-5.7) The final knock-down,drag-out between the heroine and the villain-ness doesn't succumb to most of the easy clich\u00e9s movies used to fall into with girl fights (b*tch slapping contests or WWE cat fights.) They punch each other around pretty good, with a lot of energy and physicality, and leave most of the sleazy 'girl fight'/femdom porn aspects alone. 8) I have to grudgingly admit that the closing 'coda', where Berry voiceovers the character's mission and vision, while a great sexy \"TLC\" type song sets the mood and the character struts away from us into the moonlight...that was a great little movie moment. So that's maybe 30% of the movie that doesn't insult the character or goes for the cheesy cat jokes. The rest of it, while made in an ultra slick MTV video style, is a waste of time and money. It's pretty and shiny as hell, but has no guts or heart to it. I'm not saying that a movie about a superhero has to take itself ultra-seriously - see the humorous parts of the first two Superman movies, or either of the Spider-Man movies. Those movies made wry self-aware comments that were also loving tributes to the energy and vision of their creators. But while \"Catwoman\" (the character) is about an interesting, freebooting adventurer with her own standards and nobility...Catwoman (the movie) is about a bunch of Hollywood hacks spinning some kind of \"Cosmo\" girl/\"I walk alone\" fever dream. Oh, and I hope I never see Benjamin Bratt in another movie again, ever. Sorry, Ben.",

            "content": "Yes, it's true. I sat down to watch this movie with the enthusiasm I usually reserve for MST3K films, expecting nothing but the worst movie of the century. You can imagine how disappointed I was then, when the film actually turned out to be quite entertaining.Now, before you gasp in horror and wonder whether I've lost my scornful touch, I have to say the movie was far from perfect. But, compared to what I had been expecting, it was little short of amazing.OK, so the story is silly, but is the idea that a woman who dies and is revived by a mystical cat any less ridiculous than someone being bitten by a spider and developing super-powers? I think not. The plot is simple, which actually serves to help the story, rather than hinder it, since you don't waste time wondering what the hell is going on. And Halle Berry is likeable enough in the main role that you can believe in her as the titular character. The action is fairly well done (see below for further thought on it) and keeps things moving along at a brisk pace.Now the bad things.Firstly, and once again I have to bitch about this because it is becoming a festering epidemic in Hollywood that must be stamped out! Stamp it out I say! - the CGI effects. They suck, quite frankly. At no point in the movie are you ever in any doubt whatsoever which Catwoman is a real person and which is CGI. It's doubly irksome here because, in addition to being glaringly obvious, the CGI animators still haven't got to grip with basic physics concepts like mass and momentum. Catwoman (whom we can assume weighs at least 120lbs or so) leaps about more like a demented flea than a cat and lands from great heights without even the slightest noise. Anyone who's ever owned a cat should be able to attest to the fact that they're anything but silent when running and jumping around. In fact the based on the CGI alone it would probably be better to rename the movie Monkeywoman.Secondly, the action scene editing is just awful. I don't know who had the bright idea that, if you cut and chop scenes endlessly during an action set-piece it would make things look faster and more agile, but it don't work buddy! In several sequences - the basketball scene, the motorcycle ride and the \"playing\" with the cop above the theatre stage scenes the cutting and chopping is relentless. In most instances you get far less than a second to try and make sense of an image before it cuts to the next, then the next and so on. You must get thirty or forty cuts during a short scene. All it succeeds in doing is completely disorienting the viewer until they don't care what's going on, they just want it to be over. In fact, I actually felt a bit nauseous during the basketball scene (which is the first time you get the treatment). After that I got my spacelegs and could tough it out, though I still had a headache by the end.A third annoyance were the cat traits that Halle Berry's character developed after she became Catwoman. She became fond of fish for a start. Well, that's stereotyping cat behaviour if ever I saw it. My cat preferred cheese to anything else. Catwoman also preferred milk and hissed at dogs. These might seem little things, but they were somewhat silly and aimed at cheap laughs. However, despite my fervent hopes all through the film, not once did she lick her genitals. Nor apparently, did she develop six nipples, or I'm sure her boyfriend would have noticed. Or develop a foul cat-breath with all the fish she was eating. So it amused me that she was given some, but not all, of the traits that cats are famous for.Despite my lengthy gripes, the film was OK to watch and much better than I was fearing. If they'd have addressed the problems above, the film could really have been quite good. As it was, it was a harmless way to spend an hour and a half.",

Kitty litter jokes come to mind, but this thing smells even worse than that. Everything went wrong, starting with the script. It's hardly at a kindergarten level: some nobody at a cosmetic company comes upon a sinister plot by her greedy corporate superiors. Wow: corporate bad guys; creative, original, brilliant. The evil corporate baddies off the girl, who gets miraculously resurrected by a bunch of out-of-work alleycats. She then adapts a feline persona, and the inevitable vengeance rampage commences.It gets worse. What's with Halle Berry's bad hair day? It looks like a hundred cats buried rats and other stuff they had killed in her hair, then ripped some of her hair out by the roots. At least she wears a hood that covers that mess through most of the movie. It's ironic that the Catwoman was originally a campy satire of the femme fatale character type in movies, since this movie makes an attempt to reimagine the character as a serious figure. The ineptitude of the film makes Halle's Catwoman the lamest and campiest of them all. The director tells the story poorly, and Berry's acting is as dull as a de-clawed fang. Everyone in the cast looks embarrassed to be a part of this, and with good reason. As some of the previous actors to play the role might say: this movie is a complete cat-astrophe.",

Resurrected by a magical Egyptian cat (yes, you did read that right!), Patience is imbued with supernatural feline characteristics: incredible agility, fantastic vision, a love of catnip (yes, you read that right too!).After kitting herself out in a rather fetching black leather outfit complete with whip, she sets off into the night to get revenge on the evil Hedare head honchos and their henchmen.A mess of dreadful visual trickery, Catwoman is an embarrassment for all involved: the director (and I use that term loosely), Pitof, has no idea how to construct a movie, and a barrage of CGI replaces any attempt at decent storytelling (not that there is much of a story to tell since the plot is asinine to a degree that beggars belief); the acting is uniformly awful; and the special effects leave a lot to be desired, ranging from OK to downright dreadful.Deserved winner of multiple awards in the 2005 Razzies (awarded to the year's worst films), Catwoman is a stinker from start to finish.",

But she overheard something that she wasn't supposed to hear and is trying to flee throu the pipes but they get flushed and she is dead. Well almost. A cat is giving her the breath of life. And after that, she can (after midnight) move like a cat, that means like climb walls jump very far. (well cat can't climb walls but she can). So to sum it up, she can do a lot of stuff that normal people can't. And she is very fast too. And her goal is too expose the evil company with their beauty product, which, if you stop using it, kinda dissolves your face. Well I leave you here to watch the rest. I don't wanna spoil everything. But the effects are very good, Exremly good.. they look realistic (the effects). You should watch the movies for the effects alone. I know this movie got a lot of bad reviews.. but I think you should get it and watch it and form your own opinion. I certainly did. Oh and on the DVD there are great extras.

And Catwoman takes two steps backwards. But what action- filled and colorful steps those are!Catwoman is cheezy. It throws the cheese on the floor, ankle deep, and ROLLS in it! And what is the soul of cheese? The soul of cheese is that you took milk, inoculated it, then contained it. This film is peppered with little pockets of moral containment; places where certain \"comic book\" conceptions of how the world works come into fragrant cheezy bloom. From cheezy romantic office dialog, to cheezy stagings of big business boardroom presentation banter, to cheezy comic booky conceptions of the law enforcement process--up and down the line--the film is redolent.But: I like cheese! Don't you? I sort of enjoyed the way the film heads off the problem by going full-bore/headlong into that territory. That's actually sort of laudable. For my money, it does also feel like a case of taking a certain, limited storytelling aesthetic to a very high place. Monies were disbursed to screenwriter(s?) with an astounding ability to churn out this particular species of filmic cheese... and that's not altogether a bad thing, as long as you recognize it as such, and enjoy it on its terms. What these(?) screenwriter(s) did, they did with all their might. Show a little respect.In short, a whiffy cinematic snack. Don't be ashamed! Don't be a snob! Enjoy it!",

She has been reinvented from time to time over the years, but you could usually reckon on her being a slinky femme fatale called Selina Kyle, usually clad in a cat-based sexy costume of some kind, and leaning towards crime but with a degree of moral conflict going on. Oh, and she fancied Batman.This character worked very well in the comics over the years. She was also successful in the 1960s TV series and movie, even though she had been played by a succession of actresses. And her incarnation in Tim Burton's second Batman movie, as played by Michelle Pfeiffer, was probably the most successful thing in that run of 4 Batman movies.So the movie made to cash on on that success starred Halle Berry, as a completely different character, in a completely different costume, in one of the worst scripts ever written, with Sharon Stone giving a career worst performance, and the stunt work rendered by CGI which would have given computer gamers in the 80s reason to weep.Like I said, WTF?",

Stone has given this performance before in Total Recall and Basic Instinct and has given it much better.  I think Stone is a one note actress and it shows.

I went on opening night for the express purpose of laughing at it, hoping that the entire audience would be with me. Imagine my shock and horror as I found myself actually enjoying it.Don't get me wrong, this is not a GOOD movie. The plot in particular hinges on one ludicrous conceit on top of another, and many developments don't stand up to the SLIGHTEST scruitny, but you know, the whole thing is just so over the top ridiculous that you stop caring after a while. Even all the ridiculous elements (i.e. tuna cans), in the context of the movie, don't stand out as glaringly, and since they play it off as Patience is in effect possessed by her cat side, all these compulsive things she's doing sort of work in that context. I didn't like the CONSTANTLY moving camera (and I was sitting in the 3rd row, so it really was nausea-inducing) and the CHEEEEEEEESY digital effects work, but I felt that his idea was to create this very pop comic book universe, so at least it was an IDEA. It didn't work that well, but it was an idea. I think it's clear that the Sharon Stone part of the storyline was inspired in large part by THE WASP WOMAN, a 50's horror film in which a woman is the owner of a cosmetics company, and was once the lead model, but is now growing older and has to step down as model. She experiments with wasp jelly in order to hold on to her youth... and of course it turns her into a vicious wasp woman!I can't say I recommend it, but I will say I had a MUCH better time watching this than I did at Hellboy, Chronicles of Riddick, or the Matrix sequels...

It's a total mess from beginning to end, a misstep every way, featuring lousy cinematography, some of the worst special effects known to mankind, absolutely appalling acting from the entire cast and one of the most mundane and derivative scripts I've ever seen played out on camera. Yeah, I didn't like it much.From the beginning, when we meet dowdy Halle Berry and her insipid voice-overs, I just knew that the main inspiration for this film was going to be SPIDER-MAN. I was right. However, director 'Pitof' is no Sam Raimi; in fact, he's a French special effects man who seems to have virtually no idea how to make a movie. The scenes with CATWOMAN are excruciatingly painful, the most derivative and sanitised I've seen, while those with Berry as her human persona are dull and clich\u00e9d in the extreme. I despise that TV show Ugly Betty and this reminded me of that far too much.Meanwhile, stereotypes abound: the chubby best buddy, the flamboyant gay guy, etc. After Berry turns into Catwoman \u2013 in a scene that makes no sense \u2013 it becomes even worse, if that was possible. The fight scenes are over-edited monstrosities, and the CGI effects completely laughable. Berry herself \u2013 well, I won't ever be able to forget just how bad she is in this film. Her Catwoman looks like some S&M fan's dream, and every single damn scene has some kind of sassy black woman's music playing over the sound track; I can just imagine some audience member jumping up in her seat in a key scene and thumping the air, shouting \"You go, girl!\". At least, that's the intent. The supporting cast are also poor, with a charisma-free Benjamin Bratt perhaps better renamed as Benjamin Prat, and Sharon Stone's villainess \u2013 well, let's just say she's now repulsive and unable to make a good film.Previously, I thought BATMAN & ROBIN was the dumbest superhero film out there, but that's a masterpiece in comparison to this mess.

As this abomination of modern cinema went on the only way it amazed me was by how much worse it could possibly get - only topping itself. Halle Berry was weak at best and Benjamin Bratt came up with the worst acting I've seen in about 3 years.The plot only made things worse. WATCH OUT! KILLER FACE CREAM ON THE LOOSE! Can you get any more idiotic? I think not. Catwoman herself was not at all the bad-ass character she should have been, and only succeed in looking like a cross breed between a conehead and a goth. This movie is an embarrassment to the screen. With 90 million dollars you think they could have come up with something a little better for Christ Sakes.",

            "content": "It's got to take a lot of cheese for DC Comics to discreetly distance itself from one of its if not main then certainly most iconic characters. It took Michelle Pfeiffer's equally iconic portrayal of the Selina Kyle/Cat Woman character in Tim Burton's excellent \"Batman Returns\" to bring the idea of a Cat Woman film to the forefront. What might have sound like an appealing proposition back in 1992 somehow didn't feel as relevant more than a decade later. And for good reason...The shy Patience Phillips stumbles upon the dirty secrets of her employer and gets killed for it. Not to worry though since she's brought back to life by some cat/deity of some kind and is reborn as the ballsy Catwoman so she can get an hair do, go shopping, do a bit of clubbing and incidentally find out who killed her and why... Oh and then she meets some generically good looking cop along the way... Vengeance and impossible love story ensues. The end. No, I mean it: the end.Everything about \"Catwoman\" smells like left overs, the remains of a Sunday dinner stretched into a Monday casserole, exhausted from having been tried and done so many times before and bloated out of all proportions with stupidity and pointlessness so the script would be slightly thicker than a RSPCA leaflet. It would be very difficult to single out one particularly bad aspect of \"Catwoman\" from another as they are effectively interwoven into a complete disaster. This is such a formulaic Hollywood product that everything about its story (or lack of thereof) mired with plot holes the size of Australia is already known to whoever has ever watched a film before. Worse of all, it is so stereotypically marketed (even through its soundtrack) that all that was missing was Halle Berry snapping her fingers while saying to Sharon Stone \"huh huh! No you don't girlfriend!\". The performances of its cast is made of sheer non-commitment, an acute disaffection that is both understandable judging by the overall b\u00eatise of the piece and insulting considering that people had to pay to see it. Last but certainly not least, the faux gloss of its CGI effects and the posturing of most of its camera works all conspire to hide the general lack of depth but actually manage to raise the bar of ugliness to brand new heights. So much so that it would be difficult to believe that it was all accidental.It boggles the mind to think that Halle Berry could have ever thought \"Catwoman\" to be a good career move. Witnessing her, dressed for the oldest profession, struggling to act through this aimless debacle, the word \"trapped\" springs to mind. Was this some contractual obligations? What is certain here is that artistic integrity took a back seat after enough zeros were laid down on a cheque.",

            "content": "As of the day I'm typing this, imdb rates \"Catwoman\" 3.3 out of 10. Let's put this in perspective. \"Electrocuting an Elephant\", a 1903 film starring an arrogant, smiling Thomas Edison as he cooks a 13,000 lb elephant to death to show of the power of \"his\" new invention electricity, rates 2.9. This means audiences are just slightly more inclined to watch \"Catwoman\" than graphic animal torture.If you can get past that, knowing that this film probably isn't Citizen Kane (or even Citizen Stupid), you can still enjoy this horrible flick. Why is it horrible? I'm sure imdb has a 1,000,000,000 word limit to these reviews so I won't go into it. But all sarcasm aside, I still had fun watching this movie, and in case you decide to watch it (rather than watching pachydermal persecution) here are some tips.1. The first 30 minutes of this flick is a romcom. Seriously. We are introduced to the character \"Patience Phillips\" (Halle Berry) who is a clumsy, somewhat neurotic loon who looks like she failed the audition to be on the HBO series \"Girls\". Believe it or not, I thought this was a great angle. For real, who has ever blended action-crime-adventure with romcom? Love it or hate it, props for the attempt.2. Utterly wtf plot elements. Be prepared for scenes that are so incongruous and absurd that you wonder if the screenplay was written by an ex porn screenwriter. For example, Catwoman decides to go window shopping and happens to visit the same building where a totally random jewelry heist is taking place. Another example: Catwoman decides to ride on a ferris wheel (don't ask. part of the romcom) and suddenly the ferris wheel has a random malfunction, turning it into a spinning vortex of death. Other examples: every fight/chase scene is set in a cool, stylish, abandoned industrial manufacturing plant (even if they're in downtown Soho?). It's like the director insisted on having big generators, turbines and swinging metal things in every scene. Alice in Wonderland meets Repo Man.At times the dialogue is so bizarre that, midway through the flick, I started imagining what the movie would be like if it starred Leslie Nielsen from Airplane (\"Surely you can't be serious!\" \"I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.\"). Deadpan comedy gold. It was around that point that I realized, possibly in a mind-numbed delirium, that Catwoman is a work of utter genius. All of these insane \"plot holes\" were deliberate, and this has to be the cheekiest, most satirical outright parody of the superhero genre since the original 1960s Batman tv show.I really think that's the case. I really do.Then again, an argument can be made that this film damaged so many of my brain cells that I've lost the ability to reason.",

A shy graphic designer (Halle Berry) for an anti-aging skin corporation unintentionally overhears a deviant scheme perpetrated by the company's power players (Lambert Wilson and still erotic wife Sharon Stone) to corner the market on its product. Berry's bad luck leads to her murder, but her life does not end. Instead she is reincarnated by cats and becomes the titled character, a super-sexy woman that toes the line between good and evil. Berry's new persona makes her both a mystery and an enigma not only to Stone and company, but also police detective Benjamin Bratt (who has eyes for Berry). French director Pitof (a nickname from his childhood that he still uses)  actually shows quite a lot of potential here. \"Catwoman\" appropriately has that spooky look of the two modern \"Batman\" installments that Tim Burton worked on. The cinematography, art direction, editing and of course Berry's costume designer (how could you not like how Berry looks in this picture?) are all impressive. The key performers (Berry and Stone in particular) are believable and well-developed. The big problem with this film is the script as it staggers most of the time and just never quite meets its potential. Berry also adds much complexity to an already rich role as she outdoes all other ladies who ever played the role. Still not a great movie, but for the genre it is not as bad as many think. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I just finished reviewing three Ingmar Bergman movies and now I have to write about \"Catwoman\". Gee, I feel like stepping on an ant-hill after climbing Kilimandjaro. Now, where do I start? (since the question is not whether the movie is good or bad, but how bad it is). Well, there is this quote from the TV show \"Malcolm in the Middle\" that had me laughing to tears and I've got to hand it to the writers for coming with such a fine and brilliance piece of cleverness. After they finished celebrating his birthday, a cone-wearing Dewey is asked if he liked the party, his comment is implacable : \"I expected nothing, yet I'm still let down\" Now this is how I feel about \"Catwoman\".I won't throw more rotten tomatoes at \"Catwoman\" because I didn't expect much to begin with. I registered on IMDb the same year as the film's release, I had all the time to know about its reputation, its flop at the box-office and unanimously disastrous reception, so there was nothing to heighten my expectations except the slightest hope that the film would belong to the 'so bad, it's good' category... but even then, there should have to be a good reason for me to watch it instead of a film that just happens to be 'genuinely good'. It took 10 years but between two remote control's clicks, I caught the movie right in the beginning, and I decided to give it a chance.By chance, I meant the benefit of the doubt. And it didn't last, Halle Berry portrayed a woman who, for some no other reasons than plot requirements, became a cat after the opening scenes showed her in every possibly kitty-like situation (almost) in case we forgot. Why all the rush? You've got an A-actress like Halle Berry (well, that's what she used to be anyway), she had just won an Oscar, she could have put some three-dimensionality within her character so how about sitting on a lonely place and trying to give her more substance and not just turn the woman into a cat-like creature right on our nose.I have a confession to make, I haven't seen Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' movies yet, yeah, yeah, shame on me, \"booo!\", I know. But I'm going to say something positive: from what I understood, his movies did well because the scripts didn't rely on special effects, but on characters' development. This is not character study or some kind of intellectual stuff, but just a way to inject some humanity, anything to enhance our empathetic process. Instead of that, the French director Pitoff, who lacks both talent and a first name, focuses on an unpredictably bad and basic antagonism between Patience Philips (Catwoman's real identity) and a big cosmetics corporation selling an eternal beauty-cream, whose only secondary effect is to burn the skin when they stop to use it.And I thought the whole fiscal subplot in \"Star Wars Episode I\" was pointless, how about that? What kind of vileness is supposed to come out of such a plot? Or is it supposed to fit the casting of Sharon Stone as Catwoman's nemesis and Lambert Wilson who does nothing else than embarrassing himself. All these actors proved to be capable when given a good script, I don't know who wrote \"Catwoman\" but I'm an aspiring screenwriter, I'm not 100% sure about my talents, but that a script like that got a shot sure gives me hopes.And I'm also a feet-fetishist, and as much as I love the toes sticking out Berry's boots, damn, even I knew it was aesthetically wrong, unless it proved the movie's real intention which was to appeal on the lowest levels. After all, Catwoman is too sexy a character not to have her sensual savagery been exploited, but then how about injecting some sensuality and make the film a bit more adult, instead of just some paws's traces in her friend's back. I don't remember the name of the actor, but I'm sure I'm doing him a favor by not trying to.Catwoman's outfits were probably designed to inspire the lustiest appetites, but if it failed as a superhero film, it did as well as a soft porn spin-off, while in both ways, it could have been interesting. And all the attempts to make Halle more feline... meeooo... ouch! I wish I could find one thing to appreciate, but it's as if Pitoff deliberately sabotages his own film, by inserting some stupid random basketball scenes or some cringe-worthy CGI effects, and don't get me started on the whole Egyptian mythology, Alex Borstein and... did I mention the basket-ball scene? Is making a good film that complicated? Sometimes, all you have to do is write one great scene with two characters sitting in front of each other, and it can provide something interesting. Nope, Pitoff wanted his \"Catwoman\" so badly it ended among the movies considered the worst of all time. As an aspiring filmmaker, a film like \"Catwoman\" is the kind of nightmare that makes me wonder if I shouldn't also shorten my name just in case.A wasted use of talents because of a lack of direction, too much CGI, a lack of script, too many hackneyed situations, a career-ruiner move, definitely. Do actors read the script, I don't know. Proof is that script is the movie's spine. Indeed, as I started this review with, I just watched three Ingmar Bergman movies recently and I have no doubts that even someone like Pitoff can recreate the same shots, so technically speaking, he's got it. Just learn to use some close-up, one good script, and even the crappiest thing can redeem itself.Why am I talking about Bergman anyway? Well, sometimes it's the plain that give its emphasis to the mountain.",

But when I see the movie and saw Halle's performance my doubts were all gone.Catwoman (Spoilers******) For those People who came late, Catwoman is a character from Batman comics created by late Bob Kane. Her true name is Selina Kyle who gets some mysterious animal abilities after an accident and became Catwoman. She is an anti-heroine, not exactly a villain and often romantic interest of Batman. Selina Kyle's/Catwoman's first silver screen debut was in 1992 block buster sequel 'Batman Returns' portrayed marvelously by Michelle Pfeiffer. In this movie everything changes, there is no single resemblance to that previous world except in name, which I think is good but also bad in certain aspects.Director Pitof tells the new tale set in a new surroundings called Lake City ie, not Gotham City, this is the story of Patience Philips (Halle Berry), a graphic artist who is murdered or nearly died when she finds out a dark secret about the cosmetics company Avenal Beauty she works for, which is a front for criminal exploits of Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone). However Patience is brought back to life, by an Egyptian Mao cat that is indebted to Patience for saving its life once. Reborn with a new attitude, Patience Price becomes a new Catwoman and takes a different path for avenging her sufferings.Written by Theresa Rebeck, John Rogers and John Brancato & Michael Ferris (the sucking duo I hated the most, only because they wrote Terminator 3!) tells the reinventing story of Catwoman. The fancy screenplay failed to give proper rhythm to the story telling, even though it showed Patience Philips's pre-Catwoman and post-Catwoman life in an interesting manner. Absence of a great negative character for Catwoman made the movie unappealing. Sinking actress Sharon Stone sucked in her role, she should at least see Demi Moore's performance in Charlie's Angle 2. Plus incorporating myth to Bob Kane's saga, by telling Catwoman was born after one's death makes twisting. (Boy, does Batman make love to a Zombie Selina.) I am sure it must be from the stupid minds of John Brancato and Michael Ferris, really they have sucking thoughts. Or did they copied Brandon Lee's Crow.The soul for Catwoman was from Klaus Badelt, Blake Neely and Geoff Zanelli. The score didn't emotionalize the story, it's merely bulge up the tensions when it comes to unrealistic action/chasing scenes. Plus adding unwanted CGI compositions to unwanted scenes makes the movie laming, all the blame goes to director Pitof.Anything good in this movie is Halle Berry, I was blown away by her performance, I didn't expect such cat like mannerisms from her, she was truly great. She simply broke Michelle Pfeiffer's definition in every means. I wish she should have played original Selina Kyle in 'Batman Returns'. Those looks, those walks, those reflexes and that back ROCKS.All in all it could have been a great movie if the studio hired good writers and a good director. Instead their attention was to bring a good actress for the title role. That's way the movie got so much negative judgment from viewers and critics. And I am very upset to hear that Halle Berry got Worst actress award for her Performance in this movie. It deserved to all other people cooperated with this movie, instead of Berry. And also, Razzie award critics SUCKS! Catwoman = James O'Barr's CROW + Bob Kane's Batman.",

So, from the beginning; the flaws are there regarding getting the film's priorities right and the main character correct.My first suspicion that Catwoman was going to end up being a little disappointing was the first scene that we see Halle Berry's Catwoman (A character called Patience Phillips) and Tom Lone (Bratt) interact. Phillips is out on a ledge bizarrely attempting to save a stray cat in an unsafe place (something Lone then questions the sanity of) but Lone thinks she's attempting suicide so he tries to save her. The fact he manages to cover something like three floors in under ten seconds and then the fact we are presented with Philips realising she's late, not even offering an excuse, not even coming to terms with what it is she just did before literally grabbing her gear and leaving Lone there by himself; exclaiming 'Sorry, gotta go. I'm late(!)' was enough to have me praying it wasn't going to do this for the rest of the film.Fortunately; or maybe mercifully, the film doesn't really have too much of a script so there isn't much dialogue once Phillips becomes Catwoman. There are some excruciatingly bad exchanges between Phillips and her co-worker Sally (Borstein) about finding the perfect man, etc. and the scenes with Lone, the love interest, aren't as awful as they could've been. So instead of shoddy dialogue writing, we are presented with action sequences the bulk of which fall flat for a few reasons. To say Catwoman moves like a cat would actually be a bit of a lie as she moves around more like a flea or a squirrel. She can run up walls, jump from building to building and basically defy psychics as much as she wants. I read after the film that some scenes were inspired by Spider Man \u0096 he's a spider with artificial webbing \u0096 a cat and a spider are two very different things. Apart from anything else, the scenes weren't even that entertaining in a 'guilty' sort of way.I think that when Bob Kane thought up Catwoman, he was thinking along the lines of: femme fatale, Bruce Wayne's female foil, a dominant woman amongst the crime and male run corruption of Gotham City. In Catwoman, she is as shallow as she should be deep; Catwoman is relegated to being a fetishistic object of desire who can do you damage but only because she's able to, not because she's forced to. This is hammered home during a fight scene in and outside a night club whilst a song is playing; the lyrics seem stuck on: \"I'm ready to make you mine\". Catwoman in Batman Returns was very different to this and this only makes Catwoman (2004) look more like Batman Forever or Batman & Robin rather than Batman Returns.With the film already failed, the final nail in the coffin is the horrid finale fight sequence where two dominant female characters are bashing each other with poles and whips and through glass yet no broken bones or blood ever seem to show themselves. By this point, Catwoman has come close to relegating itself to B-movie status and thus is a film to ultimately avoid.If you're thinking of watching it with the idea that possibly, you might see Halle Berry as a dominatrix type figure then even then you're going to be disappointed as she isn't even that alluring in the film \u0096 how they even got that wrong, I'll never know.",

            "content": "Catwoman is about a shy and timid woman named Patience Phillips who, after discovering something horrible about a product called \"Beau-line\", is killed by their henchman before she can make her escape. From there, a magical cat named Midnight breathes onto her dead face and is brought back to life, with a few feline characteristics. After her resurrection, she makes a decision to repay those who killed her and along the way, she will stop the contamination of beauty products by Beau-line. By the way, I liked Catwoman's outfit, minus the mask, shoes and gloves.So much for the plot. To be honest, it was not anything more outrageous than plots for Spider-Man, Batman, etc., but it seemed to be a hybrid of a super hero movie and a chick flick. While the movie did have some interesting aspects to it, such as nice camera views and a few scenes with the whip, the CGI was pretty bad and that interfered with the movie for me. I thought the special effects were on par or worse than Hulk's (I liked Hulk better). But I did like Catwoman's suit.I thought the whole cat thing was WAY too forced. Purring loudly, hissing at dogs and the whole catty attitude. I thought the scenes where she was performing various balance acts in her apartment while discovering her new abilities were more than enough to get the point that she was cat-like.Overall, the movie was pretty bad for what it was. Comparing it to Spider-Man, Punisher, X-Men and the like makes it look far worse than it is. I'd say this movie is pretty much middle of the road, around a 5.5 - 6.5 of 10. It was better than the old Spider-Man movies from the 70's. If you want to see some real trash that deserves a 1 rating or lower, see Savage Roses or Plump Fiction. Did I mention I like the outfit?",

            "content": "When I tell my friends my opinion of the movie, Catwoman, even before I get the first sentence out of my mouth I can hear the counter argument already. \"Lighten up. This is a movie where you turn off your brain and just have fun with and enjoy Halle Berry in scantily clad attire.\" The frightening thing about this review is that that *was* my attitude when I first rented it and I still hated it for reasons to follow.According to Jean Luc Godard, \"Film is truth at 24 frames per second\" and \"every cut is a lie.\" Catwoman is a compulsive liar.I don't believe I've ever felt so annoyed with a film's editing and photography style--More specifically: the camera movement. I actually enjoyed the colorful nature of the photography. And, unfortunately, editing and cinematography can do more to make or break a film than the actors and writing involved.For example, I really did not care about the plot, the characters, Halle, the score or anything in this film due to the screwed up (not to mention distracting) rhythm set up by the, you guessed it, editing. So now that director Pitof has lost my enthusiasm and interest in the first five minutes, the crucial suspension of disbelief that all movie rely so heavily on, will never come. I'd talk about the plot and characters, but honestly, I'm sure I've praised the plots of movies with better editors on staff for plot devices equally as stupid as Catwoman.For those who haven't made the connection yet--the constant movement of the camera and constant cuts reminds me of a cosmetics commercial. What a clever coincidence that the plot just so happens to center around a cosmetics conspiracy (gasp)! Granted the idea and approach is interesting enough to warrant a screen test or two after which it should become apparent that it does not work for a feature length film. Something is drastically wrong when the viewer feels like they can call now and get free shipping and handling when ordering their very own Halle Berry! And granted, the film aims for a certain cartoony feel (after all, Catwoman is a comic book character), but the scales have been tipped too heavily into the land of disbelief. I sense the filmmakers were shooting for Catwoman to be a sexy, sympathetic, and over-the-top bad ass; instead she's just over-the-top and goofy. Again, this is not necessarily a reflection of Halle's performance since the presentation of said performance irritated me so much.And once again just to re-emphasize a point that probably gets lost in a lengthy review: yes, I did grade this film on the no-brainer, drinking-game-worthy, free-rental popcorn flick scale. If you wanted me to grade it on the Casablanca scale, I'd probably laugh at you.",

With all super hero movies a good writer must give the audience the background into how the 'superhero' came into being. So to the less cultured audience this may make the film appear to be slow. However I appreciated this story buildup. Halle Berry! What can you say, as a woman it is hard to understand why some men could not be content with her. What a BOD!! As an actress I think she realistically went from a dowdy miss to a sex bomb. The 'CGI' was quite obvious in places but the story was believable and I was glued to my TV. I disagree most strongly that this is a bad movie I believe it can stand proudly next to all the other superhero movies and I for one would love a sequel however thanks to the critics this will never happen.",

The reason for the movie's score being so horrendous is VERY justified! To put it mildly.Halle Berry is supposed to be a frightened little girl without style, and in becoming Catwoman, she suddenly gets \"balls\" and style. Overnight! Wow! I loved what Tim Burton did in Batman with the Joker and his evil regime, this worked perfectly because the world surrounding the evil empire that the Joker built, matched. But HOW THE HELL DID anybody get the idea that An Evil Empire of Cosmetics, producing addictive and acid-like creams and potions, would ever seem remotely credible.Basically, just see the beginning and when she \"dies\" the mish-mash animated cats bringing Halle Berry back to life, sets the setting for the rest of the movie. And the amazing thing is that it is running on my TV right now, and I some horrified that I needed to post this for you.

            "content": "So the studio that green lighted this extremely high profile and big budgeted summer blockbuster that stars an Academy Award winning actress decided to hire a guy with one name who had very little directing experience. Maybe someone should lose their job! Story is about Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) who works for a high profile cosmetics company but while at home in her apartment she notices a cat hanging around her window. One night when Patience delivers her ad campaign she overhears the owner George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his wife and former model Laurel (Sharon Stone) discussing that their new brand of cosmetics will make users sick but dependent on their brand and if they stop using it their skin changes back to it's original state. They chase Patience and she's flushed out of a pipe and perceived as dead but she's awakened by cats and with new found powers that are like a cat.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Patience dresses up in a skimpy leather outfit and seeks to get revenge on those that tried to kill her and stop the cosmetics firm from distributing their deadly make-up. Laurel decides to combat Catwoman by framing her for a murder that she didn't commit and Patience must be careful since her new boyfriend Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) is a cop.This misfire is directed by someone named Pitof who is making only his second attempt at directing and he's known mainly for visual effects which is also surprising because the special effects are terrible. Where do you begin with the problems? The effects are terrible and when Catwoman is jumping around she looks like a cartoon character and this is the same complaint I had with \"Van Helsing\". It doesn't look remotely real and it's eons away from great special effects like \"Jurassic Park\". Catwoman's outfit while very sexy is ridiculous in it's purpose. Batman's outfit served a purpose with a cape that helps him glide and deflect things and his utility belt has saved his life countless times. Besides making a fashion statement I don't know what else to say except that Catwoman has open-toed shoes and shows off her belly and wears a mask that barely hides her face. Couldn't her boyfriend Tom see that it's obviously her? Not to mention the fact that their both black! The film is also badly edited in that god awful music video style where if you blink you miss three scenes! Berry supposedly trained a long time to master the whip which is a waste because in practically every scene we see it's a CGI effect and looks completely phony. Catwoman actually scales walls and circles the room sideways and I have to ask if she's suppose to be like a cat or a jumping lizard? You can't blame Berry for trying to cash in on her Oscar win but every indication said that this film was in deep trouble and you have to wonder why a studio didn't get a competent director for such an ambitious project.",

But it has a definite plot and it played out, the execution of that plot is to be debated.\nThe CGI is bad, it's certainly not the Catwoman from the Batman universe. Halle looks insanely hot, weather as Patience in plain clothes ( purposely bohemian, and ragged) or scantily clad and golden in her full blown CW outfit, that's undeniable. And to note she always does a lot of work to get in shape and train for roles... ( CW - whip action, Die another Day - fighting, John Wick 3 - gun play) Here's my disappointment in Halle- She had just won an oscar, she was in a Bond movie, she had a blockbuster or 2 in the X men movies. She shud have flexed a bit of actor muscle and told the director, - No Way !!! i'm not doing this! - on the catnip scene, the sushi scene, the hissing sounds. And they could have deleted the entire basketball scene .... and the dumb unattractive sidekick friend, that makes an absurd sexual reference every time she opens her mouth. A good second fiddle to HB could have made a huge difference - like Giovanni Ribisi did for her in \"Perfect Stranger\" ( HB's best movie, imho) .\nIf the CGI was a bit more realistic and the absurdity of what this wacky director had Halle do, this movie had a chance to make it as an alternate universe ( non Batman) Catwoman, they obviously intended to make more of them.Bottom line-\ngood plot, Halle was smoking, and her acting was fine - keep in mind, actors normally do what the director tells them to do, but again, she shud have spoke up, she got paid a ton and again, she must have had some power at this point. i don't see Meryl Streep or even Michelle Phiffer doing what they made HB do. But it's a visually exiting, very colorful film and u can get lost for 2 hours and escape reality with this film.... isn't that what it's all about?",

            "content": "[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS, ONLY SO OTHERS WON'T HAVE TO ENDURE THIS FILM.]Earlier this year, I was certain I wouldn't see another film to rival \"Connie and Carla\" as the worst film of 2004. Little did I know \"Catwoman\" awaited me. Irritatingly directed by Frenchman Pitof (aka Jean-Christophe Comar), this turgid mess begins with a dreadfully dull prologue and only gets worse once our heroine metamorphoses into Catwoman. The film explains why Catwoman is mousy artist Patience Phillips and not Selina Kyle - apparently there've been numerous Catwomen through the ages and a mysterious academic Ophelia (Frances Conroy - what's this fine actress doing in this film?) shows Patience photos of the other Catwomen. I'm certain one photo was of Michelle Pfeiffer, but that only reminded me of her delightfully inspired turn in \"Batman Returns\" (1992) and that Halle Berry pales by comparison. \"Catwoman\" plays like a horrid mix between a video game and music video. Did Pitof learn nothing about storytelling working for directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet? In \"Catwoman,\" shots last just three or four seconds, and Pitof doesn't know where to place the camera, what to do with it or how to shoot fast-paced scenes. Instead of being graceful, fluid and exciting, a one-on-one basketball game between Patience and her object of desire, Detective Tom Lone, becomes dizzyingly confusing. Fight sequences, too, end up choppy, distracting and annoying.Three writers - John Brancato, Michael Ferris and John Rogers - claim credit for an appalling script that's devoid of a vibrant story, captivating characters or good dialogue. Superhero films need lively villains. Here, the bad guys are vapid cosmetics moguls and it's awfully hard to imagine mankind being threatened by facial cream. And their villainy seems like an offshoot of the Joker's plan.Any irony is unintentional - for instance, Sharon Stone's villainous Laurel quipping, \"I'm doing all kinds of things I don't want to do.\" Her scenes with Catwoman should be delicious battles; instead, the writers saddle the actors with embarrassing one-liners, such as Catwoman's \"It's overtime,\" when Laurel points out the game's over. Patience's workplace scenes are mediocre sitcom stuff, and her friend Sally remarks Lone's name rhymes with \"Cone, phone, bone.\" Later, Catwoman actually grabs a man's tongue and quips, \"Cat got your tongue?\" This is what these writers consider clever dialogue.We can only wonder what Nicole Kidman or Ashley Judd, who were both once rumored to play the title role, might have done as Catwoman. Because as appealing as Berry is, she's horribly miscast. She's atrocious, hasn't a clue how to approach this role. She takes Catwoman too seriously; she's not playing Cordelia, after all. There's nothing gleeful about Berry's performance. She doesn't so much act as model her revealing outfit. Instead of giving us several close-ups of her derriere, Pitof should've given Berry some direction.Benjamin Bratt, playing quite possibly the world's dimmest cop, proves he might be better off sticking to TV. An emotionless actor, Bratt's apparently of the David Duchovny School of Wooden Acting. Wiping his brow is about as expressive as Lone gets. Superhero films require tremendous chemistry between the stars. The Flintstones generate more fire than Bratt and Berry. Hollywood, however, sees a future in this coupling because Brattberry will next appear in a remake of Robert Wise's 1949 boxing noir, \"The Set-Up.\" Just what cinema needs.\"Catwoman\" ends with Patience's voice-over telling us her journey's just begun. It's the promise of a sequel. After sitting through this mind-numbingly boring film, it sounds more like a threat.",

This did weaken the plot, I must say, they should have thought of something with a little more depth.

I'm a straight woman myself, but I'll admit, she was absolutely riveting!  I don't think it's fair for critics to slam the movie so hard and compare the character to Batman's catwoman.

The story and the main villains plot is beyond silly and for that reason alone this movie is already a waste of time.But there is more wrong with this movie. First of all this movie has almost nothing to do with the Catwoman who we all knew from the Batman franchise. The makers have taken lots of liberties and changed the character and settings entirely. Why? Whatever their intention was, they failed terribly with it. The character isn't interesting and the story also doesn't make her always understandable. One time she has a sort of amnesia and she doesn't remember what happened when she Catwoman and vice versa when she was Patience Phillips and then at other points of the movie she remembers everything perfectly. It makes the movie confusing at times and the main character a totally unbelievable one.Disappointing was also the main villain(s) who are perhaps always the most important element of a superhero movie. Like I mentioned before, the villain(s) intention were totally lame and not likely, even by comic-book-movie standards.The movie features some at times horrible (and pointless) CGI-effects. Also the action sequences weren't much good, this is due to the absolutely horrible and just totally wrong action editing.Quite honestly, Halle Berry isn't horrible as Patience Phillips although she isn't great as Catwoman. Please give the Razzie's to really bad actors and not to good actors who play in bad movies. Her Catwoman costume was however quite ridicules to look at. Does she has no self respect as an actress?

Thousands of people can't have banded together to trash this movie as part of a giant vendetta conspiracy? There has to be SOME reasonable grounds for this film to have attained its status as a byword for awfulness, doesn't there?! Well... yeah. The reason to hate this movie is its CGI. It's extremely poor in several instances, and it could well spoil your enjoyment of the movie, and deter you from having anything nice to say about it at all. Dare I say it though; but if you think you can stomach glaringly obvious 'effects', \"Catwoman\" turns out to be a more than bearable experience - at least for me; who doesn't mind if things look a bit 'wobbly' every now and again...SFX aside; the movie's greatest flaw lies in failing to keep pace with the current trends that go along with handling such material. \"Batman Forever\" was the last movie to get away with opting for the 'campy' approach; and \"Catwoman\" is VERY campy - so if you like your superhero exploits served deadpan and with a realistic coating, forget it, because \"Catwoman\" is not for you. Myself, I don't mind either route; but what we have here certainly contrasts with the brooding intensity that lately seems customary from similar types of movie.I was disappointed to see Halle Berry siding with the critics, and not even attempting to defend the film. If Jennifer Garner has the strength of will not to badmouth \"Daredevil\", then \"Catwoman\" deserves at least SOME props, too...There's a playful tone to the movie; and in keeping with that, it's inspired casting to mark Sharon Stone as the female antagonist - complete with barbed comments on how nobody seems to want you after you turn 40. Ouch, Hollywood! Not slow to seize an opportunity; the film of course culminates in the cat-fight to end all cat-fights...There will be many whose biggest axe to grind is that it's not at all faithful to the comics. True though this is; advance publicity for the film made such details common knowledge. The script also points out that there are several incarnations in this constructed universe. Links to other franchises are severed, and not exploited. To complain about something that has never been advertised in the first place strikes me as pretty foolish.If your ears are pricked enough to pick up on it, there's a healthy dose of fun to be had here.

But this movie isn't deserving enough to be rated a bad movie. Sure there are some stupid moments, but higher rated movies have stupid moments. The Ring is horrible, Shark Tale was disappointing. And both I rate in the bottom of the barrel. I'm not entirely sure why they used CGI for the cats when they brought Hallie back to life.

Which surprised me.6/10Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 6/10",

I know that Catwoman was a villain in the Batman comics and movies, but this was a new version for a new generation. Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is a shy artist working for a cosmetics company. While she is delivering a new design to her boss, she overhears a plot to sell defective beauty products that will make your skin decay. She is murdered and reborn after a cat with supernatural abilities breathes new life inside her. Soon, Patience slowly transforms into Catwoman, and tries to bring her killer to justice. I highly recommend CATWOMAN!!!",

I understand the storyline could have been a little better I was expecting a comic book type villain not the killer make up. But it was hardly awful. I think if this film was released before spider man and xmen it would have had fantastic reviews but in comparison to the other marvel films, yes it lacks something,but still...give it a break it was good. Halle berry was fantastic and I thought it was excellent seeing Sharon stone play a simple straight forward villain it was great. It's just another good addition to the marvel comic films and if your going to like them, then you should understand that they are going to be similar for example halle narrates a little in the beginning about her life just like Tobey Maguire does in spider man, he gets his powers from a spider halle gets hers from a cat. The fight scenes were pritty good especially when catwoman fights sharon stone and her face is indestructible. I don't feel that you can hate one(catwoman) and like the other(spiderman), I really don't understand why spider-man was successful and cat woman was not.I really don't.",

            "content": "There has been a massive downpour of superhero movies. X-Men and Spider-Man have done great as far as box office and DVD sales go, which has influenced several other comic book hero based movies to be made, such as Hellboy, The Punisher, Batman, and Superman is also coming. So, hell, with all of these superhero movies coming out at once, at least one of them has got to be utterly terrible.I'm afraid Catwoman is that movie. Not only is it bad in the sense that it's not really that close in resemblance to the Catwoman in the comic books, it's just horrible in every aspect, period.First of all, I had a difficult time determining why this schlock got the green light in the first place. The plot premise is that Catwoman must stop a certain beauty cream from hitting the shelves. What a stupid idea. Superheros are supposed to fight super villains, or at least powerful opponents of some sort. In this movie, the people Catwoman brawls with (the fight scenes strangely making up about three total minutes in this superhero movie) are ordinary humans, who, of course, easily get their asses quickly kicked.At first, I thought they were just shooting this movie as a petty excuse to show off Halle Berry's \"sexiness\", but after seeing several pointless scenes of her scarfing down large amounts of tuna and salmon, I was more disgusted than aroused. I don't want to see some crackwh*re stuffing her face in tuna cans, especially when it serves no real purpose for the movie. So, she has the powers of a cat now, does it mean she has to eat like one too? Hell, Peter Parker can gain a spider's powers without craving flies or insects.It's insulting to our intelligence when some people label this movie as an 'action' because it's not at all. It's a lame romantic-comedy featuring rare action, Halle Berry shoving fish in her face, people dry-humping on a basketball court in front of elementary school children, poorly animated CGI, a decrepit Sharon Stone attempting to be beautiful, and the most moronic superhero movie premise that I've ever seen. There is not one thing about this movie that is good, so my personal advice is to just settle for the X-Men movies or Spider-Man 2, instead.0 out of 10",

            "content": "Catwoman is an obviously terrible film. It's absolutely ridiculous and I feel sorry for the people who are in it. I like Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt,and that's about it. I was never really fond of Sharon Stone, and she is ridiculous in this movie. I'll admit that the old bag looks good for her age, but she's terrible in this film. I think there is only a total of two amusing things in Catwoman. Before I list them, I want to add something about the film. There are some awful films that I am actually willing to watch on rare occasions. For instance, Charlie's Angels: Full throttle, which was only good because of the chicks. Even Demi Moore looked good, but the film was awful. I am that way about Catwoman also. On some nights if there is absolutely nothing on TV, and Catwoman is on, I will watch it. Otherwise, I will not watch this trash. I don't think Catwoman is the worst, but it is definitely one of them. Anyways, the two amusing things about Catwoman are:1. Halle Berry is pretty amusing to look at in the Catwoman suit. it's not even Halle Berry's fault that the movie is so bad, it's just a terrible film. Halle Berry sexiness tries to keep the film together, fails, but somehow amuses. 2.I always like Benjamin Bratt. Bratt is one of those co-star savers. Not that Miss Congeniality was a bad film, but i think Bratt sort of saved that movie too. No, he didn't save it. But if you are making a terrible movie and need someone to keep it together, look for Benjamin Bratt. Bratt and Berry try to keep the film going. Catwoman is an obviously bad film. But because Halle Berry looks so damn good in that suit and Benjamin Bratt is in it, Catwoman is a solid 2. Catwoman is terrible, we all know it, but it's one of those films that if i'm really bored at night and can't find anything to watch, I will. it's obvious that you should skip Catwoman. I recommend it if you're really bored are high.",

He criticized the filmmakers for giving little thought to providing Berry \"with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences,\" but his primary criticism came from the failure of the film to give the audience a sense of what her character experienced as she was transformed into Catwoman. He rather referred to it as being a movie \"about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right.\" Um, Ebert, are you saying they got the costume design right? Because this is definitely one of the things that went very wrong. Not only does the film completely miss the tone of what a Batman or Gotham City film should be, it also does some very strange things with Catwoman.

And to those who say the suit is all wrong, just look at how good it looks on Berry, I don't think there'll be many arguments there.

The backstory with other \"Catwomen\" is also kinda cool, as it explains why there's a random black Catwoman all of a sudden.But seriously now.

Who can fly, and generally act like a cat. But she's supposed to do that, she's Catwoman! And then of course, there's the awful casting of Alex Borstein as comic relief (read \"waste time in this piece of garbage movie, make the audience laugh because they probably want to stab themselves for ever purchasing tickets\"). And then, the abysmal special effects. I've played video games with better CGI than this. And then, the usual sex scene and clich\u00e9d romance. And then, the horrendous dialog. Sin City was fantastic, and had bad dialog. But it didn't take itself seriously.This does.And of course, the fast paced cutting. You can barely see the action on screen.

Indeed, the opening credits said the movie was \"based on characters created by Bob Kane and DC Comics.\"  Personally, I didn't think that was very accurate.  Halle Berry's character of Patience Philips seems to me as a \"re-imagining\" of the original Catwoman.  Apart from this, the movie has its good points and bad points.

Halle Berry seems to be having a blast playing the mild mannered girl who dies, gets brought back to life by a group of cats, and suddenly is a sexy cat burgler/revenge vigilante.. Still, we dont get to know enough of her before she is murdered to really care too much for her or notice the differences upon her transformation. Benjamin Bratt, who seems to be making a career out of playing cop boyfriends here is the police detective who becomes involved with her.. of course since there is absolutely zero chemistry between Berry and Bratt the romance doesnt work at all.. in fact very little in this film works. Sharon Stone as the egomaniacal villain just makes you feel sorry for the state of her career.. the action sequences are weak and the CG Catwoman animation is just terrible and looks like a video game.

            "content": "For the most part, I found this to be a very satisfying movie. People are way too hard on this movie, and they have improper insight about it. This film was good, and Halle Berry was a much better Catwoman than Michelle Pfeiffer. The only reason why many people liked Pfeiffer better is because she was a backed by a certain dark knight that couldn't have possibly been in the new movie. To begin with, Catwoman is supposed to stand alone in this movie. That's why her name has been changed from Selina Kyle to Patience Phillips. That's also why her costume is completely different and why the story has nothing to do with the original Catwoman. Also, of course she isn't going to look like Michelle Pfeiffer's character. This isn't supposed to be Batman Returns 2! It's not even a spin off. Elektra is a spin off to Daredevil, but this was supposed to shine more light on a not so popular character in the DC Comics series. Patience Phillips is not supposed to be the new version of Selina Kyle. Patience is a new Catwoman. As the movie explains, there have been many Catwomen, and Selina Kyle was one of the previous ones. That's another point that I feel necessary to express, because that is something that I've heard many people criticize the movie over, as it was a completely new character that had nothing to do with Selina Kyle. It's not supposed to!Another major problem with this movie is that there was another certain comic book flick that sparked new light on the box office ratings for that time frame that was released only weeks before. Yes, I am specifically referring to Spider-man 2. Almost everyone that saw Spider-man 2 loved it, and it was a smash hit movie the summer that it was released, which was the same summer that Catwoman was released. I think that everyone that saw Spider-man 2 and loved it expected Catwoman to be just as good, or close, because it was two comic book films that were released around the same time, and that's what disappointed them. Catwoman is not nearly as good as Spider-man 2, so if you haven't seen it yet, and you're expecting it to be as good as Spider-man 2, I hate to be the messenger to tell you that that's not what you're going to get, but apparently, it seems to be I have to be the one to deliver the bad news.The only complaint that I had about the movie was that Sharon Stone bombed as an actress, and that affected Laurel Hedare's potential charisma. She was a terrible actress in this movie, as you could tell she was saying a line when she spoke, but it barely affected my overall opinion of the movie, because it's not even noticeable unless you pay the attention that it takes to notice. In other words, you have to know that that's what you're looking for. This is a good movie, and I strongly disagree with the complaints that many people had about it in past reviews. I believe that they were just looking for things to find wrong with the movie, because they expected another Spider-man 2, and with my regards to the many who agree with me, this isn't nearly as good, but it's still a very good adventurous ride that will cause you to think differently of Halle Berry if you always thought ill of her before.8/10!",

As Catwoman it was a bit overdone at first but in later scenes it settled into believability. The circumstances of her becoming a \"cat woman\" are of course very contrived, but no worse than Spiderman. The story was typically comic book (very shallow and distinct good buys and bad buys) but that's to be expected. The music score was superb also, which may have given the movie an extra 1.5 1-10 points in my book. The romance between the Catwoman and the Cop is much more playful than the sappy Spiderman dreck which I found very entertaining. She is also a bit too powerful a superhero meaning, I'm never really worried about her biting off more than she can chew because she has no problems handling any number of police or bad buys.",

He was in charge with the visual effects of several success movies, including one of the later 'Alien' films. 'Catwoman' is only his second film, and his first in the US. The story brings the comics female cat-hero into a rather banal bad-corporate-America plot. Nothing too special, nothing we have not yet seen in many similar films already. A feeling of deja-vu (and too often!) comes also from the hero - just-a-human duality of the character that was inserted here as in many such films to achieve some effect of deepness. Unfortunately, Pitof has nothing new to say as a director, and even not too much to say as a visual effects expert either, at least not in this film. The set and the effects looked too cartoonish to me, and the graphic approach intentionally cartoonish probably, seemed to be simplistic. For a film made the same year as 'Spiderman 2' this is not enough. The relationship between the girl/cat hero and the police inspector lacked any tension, and did not fit too well in a film that targets the whole family, unless you accept that it's aimed rather for adults with kid mindset. Sure, Halle Berry is beautiful, she fits well in the catwoman outfit and seems to enjoy what she is doing, but this is not enough. It's fair entertainment, but still 'Catwoman' is not even a good film in the comics movies genre. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale.",

How much joking, and slamming, and insulting, and constant nattering about how crappy this movie is did I hear before sitting down to actually watch it. I don't know what you folks, including critics have been watching this was SO FAR from the worst movie. Was it bad?? Yeah a little, was it campy, oh hell yes!! Bad acting...yeah sometimes....worst movie ever NO!!! Catwoman was loosely ripped from the DC Comics character of Batman's arch nemesis. Patience Phillips is the meek and quiet artist wannabe who is working for a cosmetics company on the verge of releasing the world's most ground breaking age defying cream. While delivering an ad layout to her boss she stumbles upon the secret of this cream that if a person stops using it, it makes them deathly ill. She is chased down by her bosses henchman and before they can discover who she is they flush her out an enormous drain pipe to her death. Fortunately for her a mysterious Egyptian cat has been sizing her up for some unmatchable powers. The cat, named Midnight, resurrects Patience and passes onto her amazing catlike abilities. At first she grips with trying to control both sides of her personality but gradually becomes comfortable balancing both. She sets her sights on her boss and discovering why she was killed and then realizes she must stop the release of this cosmetic cream to save the world. Catwoman is also framed for two murders she must allude her love interest and prove she is not guilty while stopping the mastermind behind it all.Halle Berry I must admit has never impressed me. I have never seen her do anything of any enormous quality so therefore she is adequate as Catwoman. I blame more the film making and the writing for the downfall of this film than her. She is not the problem. The problem started the moment Batman Returns ended. This film has been in the works since day one. It's gone through numerous casting changes, constant rewrites and even a re-shooting after test screens went horribly bad. If you have to change something that much...chances are it's not worth being made. The obvious removal from the Batman storyline is a mistake in my opinion although it can be linked to that story. Also apparently there is a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman shown with many other Catwomen that have existed. As with many action films you have to let go of a certain amount of reality and ignore some plot holes and sensible information in order to enjoy it and that is a possibility assuming it's not overwhelming and unfortunately for Catwoman it is indeed overwhelming. Why does a woman bestowed with the abilities of a cat also become a martial arts expert, motorcycle riding, whip master?? I've never seen any cat do that?? And despite the name and point of the film the constant cat references are just too much. The story is just...BLAH...it just doesn't get you going and the action doesn't exist. Love Interest in the film, Benjamin Bratt does a fair job, and actually Berry and himself have good charisma but the writing never lets anything flourish. Director Pitof is just a bad director and tries to make a comic book like feel to the film but it just leaves an emptiness that is too much to bear.Despite all this the film IS watchable. It's worth a rental and could be completely retooled for a sequel but it would have to be COMPLETELY retooled...bring in Bob Kane, get rid of directors, writers, anyone behind the scenes who didn't do a good job on the first. It's doable. There are some genuinely cool scenes, the basketball scene is fun, and the final battle between Berry and evil villain Sharon Stone is also well choreographed. And they didn't overdo the CGI, one of my grandest film Pet Peeves for this century. It's not by far the worse hour and 45 minutes you'll spend at the movies.

Comic book characters are always flat and one-dimensional, but they should be so in a funny and entertaining way, with the exception of Catwoman every other character was uninteresting. Even Catwoman had few remarkable lines and her character was rather bland. The only redeeming feature of course is Halle in a ripped - and very revealing - leather outfit. Otherwise I was hugely disappointed.",

The fact, that this isn't the \"real\" Catwoman does not even bother me that much.. but being resurrected by a campy CGI-cat? That's the great idea they had to make a new Catwoman? And do not get me started on the whole \"evil cosmetics company\" thing. Did they try to attract little girls with this or what? Ridiculous.This movie looks like someone gave the producers a couple of millions and said \"Here you have the money - now make the worst film you can do.

When Halle Berry meets Benjamin Bratt -- highly unlikely. He happens to be looking up when she's dangling on the ledge/air conditioner? And then runs up the stairs and catches her just as she's falling? Halle Berry is one of the most beautiful women in the world, and in the beginning they had to \"ugly her up\". She wore frumpy clothes, but she still wore makeup and hair extensions. Uglying up a women so she can become beautiful sometimes works -- see Cher in \"Moonstruck\". But telling Halle Berry to act ugly -- well, she just isn't that good of an actress. The editing was poor. The acting sucked. The guy who played Sharon Stone's husband chewed more scenery than Al Pacino. What was with the directing? The camera work was dizzying -- and it made me nauseous. What's with all the sweeps and pans? Deplorable, unwatchable, I would have given it a zero out of 10 in IMDb would have let me.",

            "content": "When Batman Returns premiered in the summer of 1992, it wasn't greeted too warmly.  Viewed as too dark and disturbing to appeal to children, which since it was based on a comic book was one of it's intended audiences, and not good enough to appeal to adults, the one element that stood out was the character of Catwoman.  Portrayed by Michelle Pfeifer, it was an impressive turn, a buttoned-up,mousy secretary set loose by a near death experience, she donned skin-tight vinyl, brandished a whip and vowed to take revenge against those who had attempted to take her life.  Catwoman, and Pfeifer, impressed enough to begin rumors of the possibility that Pfeifer and Batman Returns director Tim Burton would turn the character into it's own franchise.  It wasn't long before Pfeiffer and Burton were unattached, but Warner Bros. kept pushing the project along, until it finally attached recent red-hot Academy Award winner Halle Berry to the role and put the film in production.  Unfortunately, what has emerged is one of the weakest comic-book adaptations in some time and what may have seemed like a good idea originally now looks misguided.With Pfeiffer gone, the decision was made to push the reset button on this character and remove her entirely from the Batman universe, giving us a new, separate Catwoman.  Berry plays Patience Phillips, again, a mousy, buttoned-up ad designer working for cosmetics giant Hedare.  She is working on the ad campaign for Hedare's new superproduct that will reverse the aging process, and being berated by her boss, George Hedare (Lambert Wilson). Working late one night, she discovered that the cream has some rather serious side-effects and ends up being left for dead by thugs working for George's wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone), who appears to be the brains behind the outfit.  Patience is then resurrected by a group of cats that surround her, and, in the films most laughable and embarrassing scene, breathe some kind of rejuvenating breath onto her, bringing her back to life and imbuing her with an essence of a cat (or something). Suddenly, Patience develops a love for tuna, some rather impressive reflexes and the ability to jump from the street to balconies and an aversion to dogs.  Meanwhile, she has fallen for detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), who ends up investigating various strange happenings around town that turns out to be Patience trying out her newfound abilities and beginning a campaign to take revenge on those who tried to kill her. The film's first major problem is that there is hardly an once of originality on display here.  Every element is recycled from countless other comic-book origin stories, and the setup of the film is lifted beat for beat from Batman Returns.  Most of the scenes where Patience discovers her powers feels lifted from Spider-Man, where they were more entertaining.  Another scene where Tom and Patience face off on the basketball court is just a rewritten version of the showdown between Matt Murdock and Elektra from Daredevil with a different setting.  There is almost nothing to catch our attention here that hasn't been done before. Fans of the Batman comic books will find the only things in common between this incarnation of Catwoman and the one made famous over the years to be her name, her skill with a whip, and her preference for wearing leather S & M garb with cat ears glued to the top.  There is supposed to be some kind of message here about female empowerment, I guess, but it is given just the barest of lip-service over the course of the film.  Instead, Catwoman seems to be about taking every opportunity to display as much of Halle Berry's skin as possible. Berry seems to relish these opportunities, but they don't amount to much throughout the course of the film, and Berry has used other opportunities to display herself in previous films, so it's not like we are seeing anything we haven't seen before.  And I am certain I am not the first person who thinks that a plot involving destructive beauty cream to be rather lackluster. What this leaves us with is a rather monotonous experience, proving to be not the least bit entertaining for very long.In the acting department, it's a mixed bag.  Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt are both okay, but they won't win a significant notice from this film. Lambert Wilson and Sharon Stone are both mostly phoning in their performances, and neither George or Laurel make much of an impression as villains.  If there is no one to root against, Catwoman becomes an exercise in futility.  Catwoman's one diverting aspect is it's visual side.  Directed by Pitof, a French visual artist, Catwoman is pretty to look at from time to time, but, given that, it is still not much different from what has been on display in most other comic book movies to date.What we are left with, when the smoke clears, is an attempt to mine the rather successful world of comic book adaptations with material that just isn't strong enough to sustain a franchise.  Do yourself a favor and go catch Spider-Man 2 again and send this cat straight to the video pound.",

            "content": "Halle Barry is excellent as Catwoman, especially in the difficult Patience/Catwoman transition. As Patience she is convincingly innocent, self-effacing and awkward; as Catwoman she is sexy, graceful, lithe and powerful. I can't find a thing to fault in Halle's performance, especially her amazing stunt work and extraordinary physical conditioning. She clearly put a lot of effort into preparing for this role and learning to move in a convincingly cat-like manner. I particularly like the way she handles her whip, which is reminiscent of the languid motion of a cat's tail or the quick strike of a paw.As good as Halle is, overall the movie is very disappointing, a victim of both lack of imagination and heightened expectations. In fact, the only aspect of the movie that works is Catwoman herself. Her costume and diamond claws are wonderfully done, but she's all dressed up with nothing to do. While her backstory is well done, everything else seems like an afterthought. A comic book character needs a world of mystery, intrigue, danger and romance to inhabit. The story and setting need to take the viewer beyond the mundane. It needs to be larger than life, and that starts with imagining something extraordinary. The writers and director fail completely in this regard.The contradictions inherent in a character of dual nature offer ample opportunity for dramatic tension, but the story fails to take any advantage of this, either. Nor does it bother to really explore Catwoman's danger-loving bad girl side. The director, Pitof, is listed as an effects director on a number of French films and the last (and worst) of the \"Alien\" series. Clearly, he's not ready for prime time. Does an effects director even work with live actors? To judge by this effort you wouldn't think so. The difference between a blockbuster success and a complete flop can come down to hiring an inexperienced director to head an $85 million dollar project. The bottom line: this is a watchable and entertaining film. Halle Berry's performance certainly makes it worth watching. I think anyone coming to it without high expectations will enjoy it. An observation about votes and User Ratings: I noticed in the User Ratings that over 40% of voters gave this movie a \"1\". What's up with that? Considering how many genuinely crummy movies there are out there, the worst that can be said of Catwoman is that it could have been a lot better. I mean, really, you have to wonder how many of those votes are due to a herd-mentality \"piling on\". It's sad to think that this might be motivated in part by the star's race and gender.",

But the action and story is very fascinating and its probably not a movie I could watch everyday but yes, it is good. The acting is fine, which is also another thing that everyone else is saying that it's completely bad. I have watched this movie about 100000 times and let me tell you, the last time I watched will not be the last time. I will watch it again eventually.

As a result she is under a lot of pressure and those in charge are willing to do anything in order to increase their profit margins. So when Patience accidentally walks into a secret meeting where they are discussing the harmful benefits of their new product she is shot at and subsequently dies in an attempt to escape. However, she is magically resurrected by some extremely unique Egyptian cats with incredible mystical powers. Not only that but she also inherits certain feline attributes which enhance her physical abilities as well. And part of her is tired of being pushed around. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie definitely had its faults and deserves some of the criticism that has come its way. However, I do not think that Halle Berry deserved a Razzie Award for \"Worst Actress\". Quite the contrary. Although Julie Newmar essentially holds the patent for that particular role, it should also be noted that Halle Berry brought a good deal of sex appeal to her performance as well. That being said, the problems with this film centered more on the awful CGI and the overall plot than Halle Berry's performance. At least that is my opinion. In any case, while this movie wasn't nearly as good as it could have been, I don't believe it was nearly as bad as some have suggested and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",

            "content": "What's here to bug? I'll tell you:(Halle Berry) looked pathetic with weak performance, ranging between a star in a comic book action, and an idiot cat!The plot confused me a bit. First off, I didn't like the matter of dead-then-alive by the power of cats. That apart means that (Berry) was nothing but a walking corpse! Since this lead knew early about the product, why she didn't call the police, telling them to analyze it?! And what kind of oaf mentality to launch a product as destructive as this, imagining that the women will addict it; wouldn't that demand its makers' trial along the way too?! Plus, the joke of (Benjamin Bratt) as the only policeman in town; seeing the heroine in a dangerous situation accidentally, then handling the case of stealing the jewelry store, then the case of killing the company's owner! So what was his specialty anyway? Finishing the evil off the earth, or being Robocop?!!And yeah, some slight yet provocative points; (Bratt) tried to entrap (Stone) but while she didn't fall, he acted as if she did, so I thought that there was - at last - an intention for framing (Stone) after her death, but in the next scene, there wasn't!, (Stone) says to her cheating husband: \"Stop dating girls were born when the cell-phone was invented\", well, the cell-phone was invented in the early 1960s, so the man is dating \"Women\" who are in their \"mid-forties\"??, Speaking about (Stone), she was convincing, but while being a statue, lacking the wicked fun of her character. The title character's costume was degrading. And the music was a combination of so common pop melodies, without a catchy theme for the title's character.Now, about the main crime: my dear dear bitter enemy The CGI. It's bad, awfully bad, at places. It makes you ask: why didn't they make it as a cartoon in the first place?!, that could have made the movie less embarrassing. And it would eat me already if the unjustified HUGE budget, $100,000,000, went to these lousy special, rather no special, effects. Because if that was the truth, then these computer guys should be sued for peculation!But. It's not the worst movie ever made. Why? I'll tell you:The script managed to keep the conflict hot, and the events watchable. The cinematography was smooth and dazzling. The colors were soft, crystallized, and appetizing. At some moments, the editing was grisly; for instance, at the theater's fight, but in despite of that, the rest was good.There was a certain diligence to select unusual angles, achieve swift pace, choreographed impressive action, and it worked. I liked this French director's beautiful loyalty to capture the spirit of the comics on screen. His technique succeeded in making the movie's world somewhat particular, fulfilling perceptible distinctiveness. Compared to all the comic book movies in the 2000s, it got an artistic personality of its own. Or in a word: a style. A nice one too. I'm sure that the totally unlucky (Pitof) would be called \"underrated\" many times in the near future. For me, I see that many directors made once half of his work, and they got honored!So I did enjoy this movie. It's not horrendously bad, or perfectly great. It's diverting, with more than one problem, but still diverting.For the producers, they spent 100 million dollar to get 40 million back, so I can think of 60 million reasons for them to be angry. But clearly anyone from the regular viewers claims that this is tasteless, or silly movie, then whether they're unfair in their judgments, or they just didn't watch (Spider-man - 2002) yet!",

But in a world that has given us \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\", \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"Starship Troopers: Hero of the Federation\", that doesn't really say much.I watched this movie because I have a morbid curiosity about bad movies. Particularly, figuring out where they went wrong. And the consensus here is ... pretty much everywhere.Let's start with the story. The villain's dastardly plan revolves around marketing a facial creme that rejuvenates the skin, but, if one stops using it, has some very mean side effects. That's about it. MAKEUP! Oh no! The world will never be able to recover from that diabolical blow! Sure, the Joker (in Tim Burton's BATMAN) used personal grooming items seemingly at random to inflict mild cases of death on the unsuspecting public in his sadistic mind game to cause horror among the population of Gotham, but we're talking about a creme here that actually makes you look uglier if you stop using it! NOOOOOOO! Okay, snark aside, I just couldn't care about the \"evil plot\" except for the fact that they killed our heroine to keep their little secret.Which brings us to the next point. Giving Catwoman superhuman powers because she is brought back to life by some mystical Egyptian cat? Really? You're going to stick with that? That's not quite the MO for this character. Sure, she may act catty at times, but there is nothing supernatural about her. Adding this mystical element just distances the audience even further from the character. Revenge we understand. Slight insanity? Got it. Superhuman cat powers? You lost me.Then there's the kinetic, motion-sickness-inducing direction. Do you think you could lock that camera down for a minute or two? Please? The lighting and coloring don't help in the least. It is just way too visually busy. I understand trying for \"artistic\" filming, but this is ridiculous.In the end, the only reason I gave this more than one star is that, for those who want to see how to ruin a movie, this is something you could actually sit through and take notes. As the movie ends, you truly don't care about anyone or anything in the whole movie. So it gets some extra stars for the education it gives in bad film making.",

            "content": "When I recently reviewed \"Elektra\", I pointed out that Hollywood has already made films about most of the really famous comic-book superheroes (Batman, Superman, etc). There is, however, a continuing demand for superhero movies, so the studios are now forced to turn to the more obscure characters, Elektra herself being a case in point. In \"Catwoman\" the film-makers have taken this process a stage further by inventing a brand-new superheroine of their own. I am, of course, aware that there is a character called Catwoman (real name Selina Kyle) in the Batman comics and that she was memorably played by Michelle Pfeiffer in \"Batman Returns\", but the character played by Halle Berry here bears little resemblance to Ms Kyle.In this film Catwoman's alter ego is not Selina Kyle but Patience Phillips, and she is not a villainess (as she is in the Batman universe) but a heroine. Patience is a graphic artist working for the advertising department of a big cosmetics firm called Hedare. The unusual Christian name Patience (which I had hitherto associated only with the sentimental poetess Patience Strong and the heroine of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta) was presumably chosen in order to sum up her qualities; she is not only attractive but also hard-working, self-effacing, loyal and kind-hearted. Despite her admirable qualities, however, Patience is the frequent target of the wrath of her foul-tempered boss George Hedare, who runs the company with his former supermodel wife Laurel. Patience accidentally discovers that the company's new face cream \"Beauline\" contains toxic ingredients and can cause serious skin damage. (The word \"Beauline\" is not, incidentally, pronounced as one might think; depending upon which character is speaking it is either \"bew-leen\" or \"bee-o-leen\").Most businessmen, however lacking they might be in ethics or a sense of social responsibility, would realise that poisoning their own consumer base is not a smart business move, but \"Catwoman\" was clearly not conceived as a realist film, and George and Laurel will not allow the toxicity of their product to deter them from releasing it onto the market. Now that Patience has discovered their guilty little secret, she must be eliminated, something they achieve by flushing her down the drain into the river, where she drowns. Now comes the good bit. Patience is brought back from the dead by a cat with mystical powers. (I said this wasn't realistic). The reborn Patience finds that she is now a superheroine with catlike powers, which include superhuman agility, although there is a downside. Patience's dietary preferences are now for milk and tuna, and she finds herself curiously affected by catnip. An eccentric, cat-loving old lady explains to Patience that she is the latest in a long line of catwomen going back to the days of the cat-worshipping Ancient Egyptians. Patience resolves to use her powers to fight crime and to gain revenge on her killers.\"Catwoman\" was not well-received by the critics and has been given an absolute mauling on this board, where its average rating is only 3.2. I have never understood exactly why it should have proved so unpopular. The plot may be preposterous, but that is a common feature of superhero movies. (In the original \"Superman\", for instance, Christopher Reeve brings Lois Lane back from the dead by reversing the rotation of the Earth and thereby forcing time to run backwards. It's easy when you know how). My theory is that the film-makers, by calling the film \"Catwoman\" and making its heroine so different from the character from the Batman comics, have thereby offended the comic-book anoraks who make up the main audience for films of this type and take exception to Hollywood trying to rearrange the contents of their beloved \"universes\".Certainly, the film has its weaknesses. There is no attempt to provide the main character with any psychological depth as there is, for example, in the \"Spiderman\" films. One might think that someone called back Lazarus-like from the dead to find herself a curious human-feline hybrid might experience a certain amount of existential angst, but there is no hint of that here. It is, however, far from being the worst of the recent cycle of superhero films. It is, for example, considerably better than \"Elektra\", which did not come in for nearly so much vitriol. This might not be Halle Berry's greatest performance (it won her the dubious distinction of a \"Worst Actress\" Razzie to go with her \"Best Actress\" Oscar for \"Monster's Ball\"), but at least she makes a charismatically sexy heroine, much sexier than the rather dull Jennifer Garner in \"Elektra\", even if the two characters do share a similar taste in leather fetish wear. (Sharon Stone as Laurel makes an equally sexy villainess, even in her late forties). There is also some striking camera-work from the oddly-named director Pitof, including the shots of the New York skyline. \"Catwoman\" may be the purest nonsense, but at least it is enjoyable nonsense for anyone in the mood for a camp, over-the-top blockbuster. 6/10",

            "content": "The 2001 Oscars have been dubbed by many, including myself, as the Night Of Political Correctness. I still maintain that Denzel Washington has never deserved an Oscar, since to him, every character is alike and about as multidimensional as a puddle of urine. People still believe he is a great actor, unfortunately. Halle Berry, on the other hand, has set about proving me correct in my statement that during X-Men 2, one half expects Anna Paquin to turn to Halle and declare that she earned her Oscar. Halle proves this expectation in spectacular fashion here.Even if Halle were the best actor on this grey Earth, she would be utterly unable to escape the poor conception of this cinematic abortion. Spinning off from Batman is not such a bad idea, but the character of Catwoman does not work as a hero. Her sinister nature as a cat prevents it. But that is one of the least of the woes here. The plot, if one can call it that, revolves around an evil conspiracy within a cosmetics company to market a product that is destroying the health of customers. Yes, you heard me right. Mr. Cranky hits the nail directly on the head when he says that this film sets back the idea of a female lead superhero so far that it may never return. Which is a shame, because a Rogue spin-off from the X-Men series is something I'd gladly pay to see.Sharon Stone gets a thankless turn as the lead villain, who promptly tells us in the climax that using her product forever will give the user a virtual stoneskin, while stopping its usage will destroy said user. Hang on a minute, didn't Catwoman just stop her friend from using the stuff not forty minutes ago? You know, that support character who is never mentioned again, anyway? Can we say this plot detail was quite clearly not thought through? Anyway, back to Ms. Stone. Stone's career has fallen hard in the wake of the downfall of the erotic thriller, and given that she appeared in such classics as Police Academy 4 before then, it's hardly a surprise to see her so at home in something so dismal. She is quite clearly comfortable in her B-grade environment. Berry, on the other hand, looks absolutely lost with having to balance the weight of the entire film on her slender shoulders.Benjamin Bratt was basically washed up when he left Law & Order, and Catwoman does nothing to change that. Like Stone, he is a decent actor drifting in a sea of crap, and just tries to salvage a little credibility. In his favour, he manages to keep the film from becoming another pathetic feminist man-bash. How, I don't quite know, but he does. Maybe it is the fact that he is the only actor in the entire picture who doesn't look absolutely lost.They say that the name of a director can often indicate that it will be an unmitigated crapfest. Since the Alan Smithee alias has already been exposed for this, Hollywood has resorted to coming up with more creative aliases for bad directors. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle had McG, and now Catwoman ups the ante with Pitof. I suppose we could acknowledge the honesty inherent in a name that sounds like someone spitting, but really, one would think Hollywood studios could put two and two together, to deduce that maybe the money-paying public can smell crap films a mile off thanks to these names now.I won't even dignify Catwoman by giving it a one, a score that signifies to me that a film is bad enough to be good. Catwoman is so bad that it goes right past being good and ends up awful. I gladly await the use of the racism defense against the general crap level of this film.",

            "content": "\"Catwoman\" is mounted on one incontrovertible truth: Halle Berry looks great in black leather. This is a fact that is displayed over and over throughout this terrible movie. It doesn't make the movie good, it just keeps it from being completely unwatchable. Yet, you can't deny the facts, she is a wonder to behold. Great pains have been taken to photograph her eyes, her lips, her legs, her shoulders and even her bare back. Yet, the producers of \"Catwoman\" have overlooked another incontrovertible fact: As lovely as she is, you have to build a movie around her.What's here isn't really a movie, it's a perfume ad that's permitted to go on for two hours. At its center is a script that even black leather and ruby lips can't fix. Ms. Berry is a talented actress but you have to wonder at the thought process that went into this property. The poster is the entire movie. The rest is more or less innocuous.Berry plays Patience Phillips, who begins as a frumpy insecure graphic artist working for George Hedare (Lambert Wilson), a megalomaniacal cosmetics magnate who is secretly selling a toxic skin cream that will keep women looking young so long as they keep using his lousy product. Patience finds out about this little scheme and is killed and dumped in the river for her troubles. Emerging later, apparently having been brought back to life by cats (groan) she re-imagines herself as Catwoman. A trip to the leather shop, a new hairdo and - VOILA! - she's a superhero. She can leap from building to building like a jungle cat and she's crazy with a whip. Other than that, she ain't much in the way of functionality. Somewhere in her transformation, she gets Yoda-like advice from a mysterious woman called Ophelia (Frances Conroy) whose role is more or less superfluous.One her mission to destroy the Hedare and his evil toxic cosmetics factory (read that sentence again), Patience falls in love with a cop played by Benjamin Bratt who is really really slow to catch on. Patience is not only his love interest, but also apparently the only black woman in town. He is working the case to bring Catwoman to justice, but he doesn't even recognize her through the mask when they're face to face. How did he get to be a cop? The director, who calls himself Pitof, has graduated from television commercials but hasn't left them behind. He's great with the photography but as a dramatist he's got a long, LONG way to go. His scenes are set pieces in which Berry twists and kicks and snaps her whip and throws out stupid double-entendres (\"Cats come when they feel like it. Not when they're told.\") They're probably pretty pictures by themselves, but look just plain stupid when strung together.He's also made a movie that's a bit confusing. Who is this character? The opening credits tell us that the movie is \"Based on the characters by Bob Kane,\" but as far as I know, there has never been a Catwoman named Patience Phillips. The movie doesn't take place in Gotham City, there's no mention of Batman and this Catwoman isn't Salina Kyle. Who is she? Is she an imposter? A clone? A wannabe? Based on the evidence, she seems to fit all three.During this terrible movie, I had a lot of time to think. How would a movie about a catwoman really play out? She's be sullen, ignore you when you call her and sleep all day. Occasionally she'd find a corner to get at a bad itch, and she's spend most of her day sleeping. Maybe Catwoman should have been played by a teenager.",

It's way too obvious, and the care put into the animation only shows up as a slowing down of the action so that they don't get transitions they don't want.And the action is terribly mishandled, dragging the film down into impossible depths of boredom.

When she discovers a conspiracy regarding a harmful beauty line product she is murdered but in a scene too embarrassing for words she is revived by a cat that breathes life into her. Similar to The Crow only a lot dumber. Catwoman prowls about and cracks her whip at criminals while embarking on a revenge scheme. Recycled plot is one bad joke with director Pitof providing no explanation as to why this cat knows CPR. Berry's worst performance and a complete opposite to her superb work in Monster's Ball. Sharon Stone overacts hideously as the beauty line villainous. Both performances are embarrassing especially when citing superior work by both. Benjamin Bratt is expendable as the investigating cop. There will be a hint of romantic tease here but it fails just like everything else presented here. Lambert Wilson is dreadful as Berry's ruthless employer who probably wanted to fire her just for signing onto this film.

She's murdered by agents of co-owner Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) but brought back to life by magic cats and imbued with enhanced speed and agility. Along with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) Patience investigates her own 'death' and tries to stop the company before the product hits the wider market.This truly lives up to its awful status. It's a boring, unambitious story with terrible performances, an awful script, bad CGI and horrible dated music. All of those criticism pale though in comparison with the movies ultimate problem, director Pitof takes his artistic bent way too far and his constantly moving camera renders the whole effort unwatchable.There are some other aspects of the film that I might have liked, Alex Borstein is playing a fun \"best friend\" role, liked a toned-down version of her character from \"Mrs Maisel\" and I like Frances Conroy in other things. Sharon Stone is having a well-deserved renaissance now after this (and \"Basic Instinct 2\") looked like a death knell for her career. She's not actually that bad here but made to look ridiculous by the script. Her criminal plan is one of the least sane I've ever heard, as if when people start dropping dead no other scientist is going to be able to piece together that it's their product.Often emotions are heightened when a film is new and either excessive praise or criticism can be edged away over time, but \"Catwoman\" is one film entirely deserving of its initial scorn and, if anything, has aged even worse.",

I'm not sure which music videos they watch, the ones I see have better editing and actually some direction.Most know the plot already, Patience Philips a shy person, blah blah blah, gets killed, blah blah blah, brought back to life from a cat, blah blah blah, seeks revenge, blah blah blah, dates cute cop, blah blah blah, fights Sharon Stone. The plot is not original, so one wouldn't go to see it for the plot. Not when they could just rent the Crow.The editing and direction in the film is shaky. At times, the direction seems masterful, the opening credits were great. But after that the film fails. During a scene with just two people talking for about a minute or so, the camera switches angles about 6 or more times, and not even at logical places. The action sequences were horribly edited, to the point I nearly got motion sick.The acting? I know Halle has an Oscar, but geeze... The woman is no Catwoman. When she's Patience Philips, well... Let's just say, I saw nothing unremarkable about her. She was hot and sweet. Had this been in real life she'd have men lined up at the door. At least Michelle's Catwoman at least looked like a geek. Sharon Stone is a very, very weak villain. Nothing threatening about her, she wasn't even a fun villain. And then, Benjamin Bratt who plays the cop that replaces the caper crusader? Well, let's just say, I think he was trying to suppress a snicker through the whole thing. He was eye candy for the ladies, although the character wasn't quite as stupid as some people make him out, he's still not the brightest crayon in the box. Sally, Patience's friend was the comedy relief. If you want cheap sex jokes you could get on cable, or even network TV, then she's right up your alley.The effects were simply laughable. Really, they had a CGI of a cat (They could've used a real one in the scene easily.) they have a CGI of Catwoman walking and they always use CGI on the whip. And the way Catwoman moves... Its actually more like a spider then a cat. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised it they simply took Spiderman's scenes and changed him into Catwoman. Lastly, was it entertaining? No. Not for me, I was counting the minutes for it to end. I could've been wowed, really, the opening credits were fabulous. But I'm guessing they knew that too since they used the same scene three times.... In the end, if I had to review it on the 4 star guideline, I'd give it zero, or perhaps 1/2 of a star. It really is that bad. When there's so many other good films out there, why waste money on this kitty?",

Sure Oscar winners have old films embarrassingly show up on DVD and after a few years and ex-wives they will take a paycheck role in some European schlock. But in your next movie in which you are the star? Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes? Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.) While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe Catwoman still falls short. Besides acting there is the horrible horrible music (a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip), a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes, and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene. Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carney ride gone bad\u0085come to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either. The direction and scripting on this scene is bad\u0085 Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever bad.

She is skilled, but is too shy to advance the career ladder. And unfortunately, the squabbling owners are not too happy with her work. She gets one last chance, but stumbles upon a dark secret about the company's latest product. To keep their secret the management kills her. She is resurrected by some cats though, and inherits some of their senses and powers, making her superhuman, making her Catwoman. She suffers from amnesia though, and must rediscover who killed her, because she is out for vengeance. Oh, and don't forget she is dating a cop, Tom, who is investigating crimes surrounding the mysterious Catwoman...Comment: The story is silly, but it is there and it is coherent. Although, the writers could have come up with a better enemy than an evil cosmetic company with dangerous products. It seems like they were thinking: \"Hey, we have a female lead role and a heroine, so lets make the movie about something all females likes, lets make it about make up.\" (Please don't think I'm that simplistic though). By choosing this enemy a lot of credibility goes out the window, and few fights are even remotely suspenseful. The movie is unfortunately easy to predict and the computer graphics not good enough. Too many scenes are spoiled by bad CGI. Halle Berry starts out very good as the timid Patience, but loses a lot of her touch as the more self-confident Catwoman. Benjamin Bratt does good, but the other cast are just average. At the end, there were a opening for a sequel. Please don't make one...(Sidebar: Saw Elektra a few days ago. In the competition for best spin-off heroine action movie I think Catwoman is marginally better, though none is very good.) 4/10",

It was definitely underrated and compared to the horrible s*** coming out today, this is AMAZING. Now, right from the start people were mad with how the movie was coming along. The fact that this Catwoman was not the Selena Kyle from the comics or movies. The fact that it wasn't set in Gotham. Get over it, please. It's a completely different film! Judge it on its own merits. Yeah, it was cheesy and campy. That doesn't mean it was bad. The eighties was all camp. That didn't stop people from going and enjoying movies. The acting was great, I thought. Halle did a great job portraying the very vulnerable Patience and was able to transform this fragile character into a stronger, sassier Catwoman. Yeah, her prancing around, eating tuna, and performing acrobatic moves isn't what Catwoman is supposed to do. But this is a completely different story. She has talents that are cat-like. Again, judge this on its own. The supporting cast is great as well. Her best friend, and villain Sharon Stone are strong supporting characters. The action sequences are a pleasure to look at and the film itself has a lot of style. The soundtrack is a nice touch, adding an urban sense to the film. The cinematography is great and it is obvious at times that it is CGI, but done very well. Yeah, it could've been more serious and the script better written. But we got a movie that entertains. It is NOTHING like the critics say. And in my opinion, a lot of the audience gave it such a low rating solely on what someone else said, without giving it a chance. The movie was made to entertain, and it delivered. Give it a chance, and you'll find that it is not as bad as people make it out to be.",

The whole story of how she BECOMES Catwoman is different too! I suggest that the film is good in it's own right and is definitely worth a look.

And there are a truckload of reasons why this movie is considered such an abysmal flick. Let's first start with the story which is not only idiotic and lazily rendered but takes nothing from the source character. Catwoman has been around since the 1940's, building a long and detailed history of which there is a lot to choose from. So when Warner Bros. decided to green light the film, they subsequently threw all that out the window and replaced it with a plot that resembles The Devil Wears Prada (2006) mixed with Monkey Business (1952). Though, don't worry there's some Egyptian cat God mumbo-jumbo wedged in to make the action make cursory sense.Patience (Berry) works for a cosmetics company who is about to release a new skin cream line which has some interesting side-effects. Patience finds out but is drowned before she can notify anyone. Washed up on the shores of an unnamed city, Patience is revived by a magical Mau cat thus giving Patience cat-like abilities. She then uses those abilities to dress-up in a slinky leather costume and fight the CEO of the company Laurel (Sharon Stone) before she releases her skin cream to the masses.Let's assume you know nothing about Catwoman and thus don't care that the story of the film is almost offensively derivative from the source material. The film is still a jumbled mess of overt plot holes, conspicuously broad characterizations and a particularly fearless performance from Halle Berry who doesn't quite yet know she's about to be put down. Her performance is so emotionally invested in the story and physically over-the-top that you can't help but feel bad for her. Truly, this film is a disaster for all involved.",

And Sharon Stone is a great witch, as beautiful as she is deadly. Let's give the movie a break. As Patience says, \"It's only coffee.\" It's only a comic book come to life. Not an Oscar contender.

She is not good or evil, she is catwoman.She beats up bad guys and takes on the cosmetic industry.There are many problems with this rendition of the character of catwoman but it is not quite as bad as many people make out.Firstly there is the character of catwoman. Catwoman is a projection of the male fantasy woman, but with a twist. She is more, beyond his control. This is why she is the perfect enemy/lover of batman.But in this version Halle Berry is just not sexy enough. She might be the sexiest woman alive but catwoman is not just sexy in the playboy centerfold way. Instead she is desirable because she is in control.Also, there are not many female superheroes and this one belongs in the 1950s. Catwoman is sexy and powerful. But catwoman is something that controls the character of Patience rather than being the power and sexiness she finds in herself. It is not a character than woman for the last 30 years can identify with.Where is the supervillan. I mean, she gets to fight a woman whose only power is that she has a face like marble from using a new super cosmetic. If you don't have a good supervillan you don't have a good superhero.The story, I mean, really, it was so full of holes the working title of this movie was probably \"Swiss Cheese\". There is no development of the evil, no reason for the murders. The bad person is a woman who is powerful (this is not a spoiler you find this out near the beginning) and beautiful. There is no choice presented to her or Catwoman to be good or evil. Powerful older woman = evil. Young beautiful powerful woman = good.The CGI. Computers mean you can make people jump around in an unrealistic way. Guess what, to the audience it looks silly. Siperman only got away with this because a lot of it happened during some interesting plot and character development.The clothes. Nothing special there. She should either have stuck to the first outfit or had a lot of costume changes (something I like, I mean unless people from Krypton don't have Body Order superman's costume probably spells something shocking).However, the story introduces the character of catwoman, and makes it interesting enough to think about.

Some scenes are genuinely good and interesting, athough it did have many flaws.

I'm incredibly tired of hearing how great the acting was because the character was \"over the top.\"  Well, guess what?  That over the top villain is the one that's farthest from real life behavior!

I know no system is perfect, but I think the IMDb could do a little more work at flushing out all the Haters.The movie nailed its target spot on: some movies are too smart, and make too much of their audience feel alienated; some movies are too dumb, and make OTHER parts of their audience feel alienated. When a piece of garbage like \"Van Helsing\" comes along, it's not so much that it has no brain, it's that its brain is very, very tiny. A good example of a movie with no brain would be \"Catwoman.\"The film is not too smart or too dumb, it just is. It's exciting, visually arresting, and even with some choppy editing that's supposed to be stylish (the butchered, lame-o basketball sequence), it mostly works. The writers give Patience a best friend who actually DOES seem to have a life of her own, a genesis that's as PG-13 as possible (much less likely to give kids nightmares than Michelle Pfeiffer's death scene), the soundtrack is just barely averagely mediocre, and Benjamin Bratt is perfect as the love interest who's just supposed to stand there, look pretty, bed the hero, and then go away. Much like every female in every action movie since ... ever.Without the stylish direction, cinematography, and costumes, the story is only so/so-- neither good nor bad-- much like another film from screenwriters Brancato and Ferris, \"The Game,\" directed by David Fincher in 1998. \"Catwoman\" has no great one-liners, but passable acting, special effects as unobvious as 2004 technology will allow, and a lead role that absolutely requires casting with the hottest woman alive. Purr.I enjoyed it while watching it, but it occurred to me that if anyone asks me what I thought, I really have nothing to tell them except, \"Halle is freakin' HOT.\" Which we already knew. At the end of the day, I think we can say the filmmakers made a good movie, not a great one, and every other action movie that comes out during the summer of 2004 can be grouped into two categories: better than \"Catwoman,\" (Spider-Man 2) or worse than \"Catwoman.\" (I, Robot).

Catwoman falls squarely into the latter category. After Michelle Pfeiffer's revelatory turn as Catwoman in Batman Returns, many waited anxiously to see a re-teaming between her and Tim Burton in a separate film. Sadly, that did not happen. Instead, we get this cheesy, congealed mess, which feels like it is still in the development stage. Halle Berry does the honors this time as a mousy woman, who mystically survives a deadly experience and returns with feline powers. Her story feels like an incredibly limp and aimless rehash of what Batman Returns did much better. Berry, crammed into a ludicrous outfit that looks like a cross between S&M bondage and a cheap bikini, plays the role like she is a frustrated runway model. The sequence where she balances cat-like on furniture in her apartment while chatting nonchalantly on the phone is particularly laughable. There is no edge to her work here - whereas Pfeiffer's Catwoman was a woman on a mission of revenge, Berry's Catwoman seems oddly aimless. The supporting cast does not help. Frances Conroy shows up briefly in an embarrassing role as some sort of librarian who has to explain Berry's newfound powers to her. Alex Borstein is intolerable as Berry's typically loud-mouthed friend/co-worker. Benjamin Bratt is unimpressive as the cop who falls for Berry resulting in non-existent chemistry. And for the villain of the piece, we get a diabolical cosmetic queen, played by a shell-shocked Sharon Stone. To be fair, early in the film when her husband replaces her with a much younger woman, Stone does manage one or two affecting moments as a woman whose youth and glory days are falling by the wayside, but said depth evaporates quick. A late plot twist with Stone seems to come out of no where and she never seems much of a match for Berry. It may have been helpful if she had a character that would have allowed her to go over the top, but the character even on paper does not seem especially notable. There are literally no action pieces that stand-out and whoever is responsible for that ear-shattering warble that passes for music throughout the film should be throttled. Sadly, the film never achieves the level of so bad it is fascinating. Rather it is so bad it is just plain boring.",

I love her coolness and the way she moves!It was mostly thanks to her that I had so much fun while watchingthis movie. There was a clever idea in the final fight between Catwoman andher opponent Laurel Hedare: The \"good one' has black skin, hairand clothes, the \"bad one' has white skin and clothes andlight-blond hair. That is really an interesting change of the typicalcolors! And the criticizing of obsession with beauty was successful, frommy point of view. The whole atmosphere in the beauty carecompany Hedare was so cold and empty, it really showed howsenseless it is to care only about looks. I don't find such criticismoften in movies based of comic books.Rating: 8/10Not a movie for the eternity, though, but a nice one!",

If you don't believe me, go waste your time and money to find out for yourself.Not only were the visual effect and CGI's poorly done, but there was no plot, storyline or even plausible dialogue. The producers and scriptwriters did not build a credible hypothesis to launch their logic for this story.I'm sorry for all the comicbook catworman fans out there.

First of all I'm a cat lover myself. Though was this the major reason to see this movie? Nope the major one was Kitten Hall versus Kitty Stone. And do they deliver some damn hot kitty fighting onto your TV screen. Yes sir! I did read in the past some comments that a veteran in the movie industry as Ms Stone herself would blow away a kind of a newbie as Ms Hall. Though the opposite is true. Ms \"H\" for sure knows how to handle her female opponent \"Laurel Hedare\" set on screen by Ms \"S\". Both ladies are definitions of \"Sexy\" and \"Hot\"! One thing I know for sure after watching this movie is the fact that how hard even a Whitie tries to beat the \"attraction -SEXY-percentage\" of a black woman she will always will be loosing this fight. I would say in this case \"Power to the Blacks\". So these two hot steaming ladies in a simple action flick, based on a simple story in a mixture of some cool CGI effects and by times some damn funny and surprisingly good dialogs, will be served on some good brainless fun to watch movie. Of course if you don't expect an Arty quality filled masterpiece of a movie! One thing thought that bothered me throughout the movie was the way how they did edit the fighting scenes. They used a fast edit of different shots and angles to create these Blade/Matrix styled action scenes. By times hard to follow and serious annoying. But like I said no architectural masterpiece but a great movie if you wanna know all about the Hall versus Stone\"\u00857/10Dario/",

I think that more importantly, the multiple critiques of this patriarchal society was fantastic.

From being considered old, ugly, nonsexual after 40 to being alone and misunderstood when a woman chooses to walk the road less traveled leading a woman to finding freedom, but also a lot judgment. Yet there is power in that freedom. This is a great movie and everyone should watch it.I've noticed some of the comments made (primarily made by men) are judgmental, are not insightful, and unfounded. Many men may feel insecure when women are portrayed for what they are: powerful, intelligent, and strong. To those men who feel like they have to put women down in order to feel better about themselves or less afraid or in control, or men who disapprove of the messages in this film, I say, maybe you should consider taking yourself to the year 1700 B.C. It's 2012, and women need more inspirational stories that are reflective of a woman's struggles these days. So to the sources of media & film I say, get it together and realize the world has changed and women's roles have changed. A woman is complex and has multiple priorities she juggles constantly, making sacrifices left and right, and if you want to make a meaningful movie that sells women are ready for it! Bring it! Men, if you are afraid that women won't love you or won't be with you because they are no longer property, and because they have the right to vote, I say get it together!

Eventually we meet Hallie Berry's Character mild mannered, quiet and UN attractive Patience Phillips, who works for Sharon Stone(Who through out the movie is an unpleasant scowling bitch) at a Make up company as the Art Designer for their magazine ads. They're famous for apparently a whole line of make up, but all they seem to supply is Beau Line a deadly face cream. Not only this, but Sharon Stone's husband is as unpleasant and cold hearted as she and is also sleeping with their make up model. Sharon is mad at him and acts like she is a five year old who never got her Barbie for Christmas. Patience has a friend, played by the otherwise talented Alex Borstein(More well known as the voice of Lois Griffin on Family Guy)as Sally, her wisecracking friend who makes awful wisecracks through out the movie, AND is addicted to Beau Line which causes her to faint and keep her under hospital care. After we assemble these characters, we show Patience and her daily life. This includes her trying and failing at stopping a party next door, and trying to save a kitty and almost killing herself, but is saved by Benjamin Bratt, or Mr. Ex Julia Roberts. He's a cop(again), she's an artist with make up, so opposites attract. Pretty soon, Beau Line is ready to ship in a week or so, and Patience finds out that it's deadly and damages skin severely(Which from what I've heard sounds like Batman, or I'm just mixing up my movies.) They find out that she found out and kill her. Eventually, cats find her and after saving a cat becomes reborn as cat woman.A problem I had was that Hallie Berry, as talented as she is abuses her Cat powers by playing Ben Bratt 1 on 1 in basketball, and not only eats tuna like a junkie,but orders milk at a bar, and is attached to a ball of catnip. Some other parts involve a makeover in 5 seconds, Catwoman learns how to use a whip after one try, and robs, but gives almost every item back, and the most famous part, when Patience struts out in an S&M style cat suit as Catwoman. Also, the scenes with Sharon Stone are just as unpleasant as the last. She never smiles, kills her husband and frames Catwoman, and just has an icy voice that makes her the irritating Ice Queen she really is. Also, who thought of the idea of a Shut in Cat lady as one of Catwoman's friends anyway? Or who came up with the soundtrack sounding like music at an orgy or a rave.All in all, this movie is like i said terrible, but watchable, on HBO don't rent, cause you won't want to pay for this hairball of a popcorn flick.",

The CGI animation of her leaping about as a cat is burst out loud laughing terrible and for me the wrong tone as it took me out of whatever atmosphere they failed at generating.

            "content": "So...when I think about Catwoman, I'm thinking about a feline-themed thief, a complex relationship with Batman, her sassy wit. I'm not familiar with the Batman franchise, but I have played Injustice, so I sort of know how Catwoman is. Batman is a franchise I'm not into, but I know that his TV shows and movies can have deep, complex, relatable characters with a meaningful plot, and with villains that are memorable.This movie has none of that.I only watched the movie once and I was like 'never again' but with more and more reviews talking about it still today, when the movie came out almost two decades ago, I don't think I'm too alienated to give my own two cents to this movie.The plot is just really pointless and disjointed. We have a meek, unconfident lead working as a graphic designer (which is EXACTLY what you think of when you think about Catwoman) dying because she finds out about a makeup line that...makes your face like brick, and if you stop using it, your face will just disintegrate, even though a like million-dollar company like that will lose money and will be subjected to lawsuits if they do this. But I guess it's just like 'screw all our customers, we're evil and we don't care if our company gets a bad name for this.' But then we have Patience Phillips, not Selina Kyle, not really acknowledge this because she gets distracted in a rom-com, so she screws around not caring up until it actually matters to her. What's the point of her knowing about the evil plot if she herself is not going to care?The whole 'Egyptian cat' thing is just...silly. Like, why is that a plot point?And the changes to Catwoman's character, they only make the movie worse. She's not Selina Kyle, she's an OC. I was just rolling my eyes when the prologue started, which could've been cut out as well. Especially when she gets revived by burping CGI cats later.You wish I was joking.The characters are really lacking. They don't feel like real people to me. And I think I know where some of the budget went because we have Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Alex Borestein. Don't get me wrong with the actors, they're great actors. They're just not given good direction. Patience Phillips herself feels like a character I've seen before, and while I love Halle Berry, her performance is definitely not one of the better ones out of all of her films. A lot of people give her flack for her performance, but she is doing her best despite what she's given. And I barely remember much about her otherwise. The cop, Tom I think, is weirdly the most frequently seen cop in this movie. And he's also a creepy stalker, tracking down her workplace to talk to her. To me, he's probably the most likeable character in this movie. And if that's the main characters, how do you think the side characters are? We have 'Man Sandwich', the thirsty best friend...both of them are very annoying, to say the least.And I haven't even gotten to the villains yet. Sharon Stone is just awful. Her reasons for her scheming and her plan just seem very superficial, I get the same feeling from Diane Simmons from Family Guy. Except, you know, far worse. When you have a character that is more awful from someone from one of the worst cartoons ever, that is saying a lot. Her husband is just an outright jerk, definitely the worst character in the film.What really gets me in this movie is the editing and the script. The editing is SUPER obnoxious, and the script is not much better. The editing has all of these rapid cuts and establish shots that just made my eyes roll. Not only are they distracting, they give you instant whiplash just watching them. You can barely take in what's going on with the action either because of these cuts, like really, they're so fast and ridiculous. Who even edited this movie? Because even in 2004, we had the means to fix this kind of stuff. We also have characters teleport somehow with no explanation, and then a scene where Halle Berry slips through bars...somehow. And the script, ugh. I don't think one line in this movie works, most of the lines are just forgettable, nonsensical, or stupid. I have to wonder how the actors felt saying these lines because they want you to take this film seriously, but with everything else going on, they are definitely not succeeding in that front. I'm not gonna bother repeating any of the lines, because that would give off the impression that I actually cared enough to memorize any of them. But they make this movie really lame and really unrealistic. The scene I hate the most is definitely the basketball game.The story is bad, the characters are bad, the editing is atrocious, the script is just insane...just...there is not gonna be a worse comic book adaptation than this. Instead of taking the time to have this movie exist against all odds, they just badly missed the point. I don't know where the 100 million budget went, but it definitely wasn't towards making any sort of effort.",

(By contrast, Pfeiffer played a very smart, likable downtrodden woman - someone who better deserved the empowerment of becoming Catwoman.) I have never seen \"Monster's Ball,\" so I couldn't say if she deserved an Oscar for that performance, but Berry is certainly wooden here and in the X-Men films; I can scarcely believe that she's famous, much less an award-winning actress. She does look good in normal clothes, though. (Her fetishy Catwoman outfit is too tacky to do anything for me.) The only thespian who escapes (largely) unscathed is Sharon Stone, who at least understands that her role demands a high-camp performance. She's a pretty lame entrant in the halls of super villains, however - a woman made super-tough by too much funky skin cream. The presence of such a silly antagonist clearly suggests a lack of good source material; since when did Catwoman work as a solo character, anyway? Her comic has always been a fairly lame T&A book.Most dreadful action flicks like this can at least be redeemed by good special effects, but alas, Catwoman is a bomb in this respect as well. Cartoony CGI constantly fills the screen - it's used to render Catwoman herself (why not hire a competent stunt woman instead?), her army of feline helpers, and the fashionable-looking cityscape. It looks like Spider-Man on half the budget, which is exactly what it is.I did like one bit - when Berry escapes from prison by slinking through the bars. Catlike. That earns the film 1/10.

I have thought and cannot think of a better choice. I suppose I am just not as \"astute\" as other commentators, knowing less of their elicited \"finer points\" contained in their comments about this film.

And I'm not generally a conspiracy theorist, but after enduring \"Catwoman,\" directed by Pitof (who? who?), I'm convinced that someone (or ones) are out to sabotage the careers of both Halle Berry and Sharon Stone (not to mention Benjamin Bratt). It's one thing to set out to make a \"B\" movie, but to waste such talent and beauty through sustained incompetence (yes, sustained, this movie wasn't filmed in a single day, was it? Come to think of it, maybe it was...) is nothing short of criminal (cinematically speaking).I do not like to dwell on the negative aspects of any film, and I always attempt to seek out the positive (even most bad movies have something good in them, though you often have to look hard and deep to find it), but in fairness to Halle Berry, it must be noted how badly the script, editing, graphics and visual f/x, choreography and the director-- especially the director-- failed her here.This misfire shouldn't allow us to forget Berry's excellent performances in such films as \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\" and \"Monster's Ball,\" for which she deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Best Actress. The extent of her talent is undeniable and evidenced by the fact that her presence alone can add the necessary spark and elevate the stature of movies like \"Bulworth\" and \"Die Another Day.\" So the million dollar question is, how did she wind up in this embarrassment? She (as well as the audience) deserves better. Obviously, she put her trust in the wrong people this time around, and at the top of that list is the \"director\" of this mishmash, Pitof.I guess the lesson here is that even a major star should be wary when approached with a project that's been placed in the hands of someone whose name sounds like one of those ridiculous vanity plates you try to figure out while sitting at a red light and staring at the car in front of you. To put this as nicely as possible, Pitof (who? what does that MEAN?) didn't have a clue about what to do with this film, and especially with his actors. How could this have happened? He's given all the ingredients (Berry, Stone, Bratt, big budget) to make a prize winning cake and he turns out a lump unfit for consumption.Add to Pitof's incompetence a laughably bad script (even the ability on the part of the viewer to suspend disbelief won't help with this one), bad editing and exceptionally poor computer graphics and visual f/x that look like something left over from the Stone Age of technology (when Catwoman is bounding and leaping about it has the appearance of an early generation video game; she looks more like a frog than a cat) you have a film that should be expunged from the resumes of everyone involved.But, like I said, even a bad movie can have a high note if you look for it, which brings me to the only redeeming aspect of this film, the performance by Alex Borstein as Sally, one of Catwoman's co-workers. Best known as the voice of Lois Griffin in TVs \"The Family Guy,\" Borstein has a charismatic presence that, within the context of this film at any rate, outshines even Berry and Stone. Better off for all concerned had this movie been titled \"Sally,\" with Borstein given top billing and accordant screen time.Unfortunately, too, for all concerned, \"Catwoman\" will enjoy it's full nine lives on the shelves of video stores everywhere. Just keep in mind, when you come to this shelf, pick up \"The Cat's Meow,\" \"The Cat In the Hat,\" \"Cat People.\" \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof,\" or anything with \"Cat\" in the title that isn't followed by \"Woman.\" Take it from me, you'll feel a lot better in the morning.",

I don't mean just disregard their opinion, I mean you should cease to associate with them altogether as they clearly have some kind of mental problem.That's right, if you liked this movie there is something wrong with you and you need to seek help immediately.Problem #1: The main character is boring. You simply can't feel anything for her. She isn't interesting enough to invest any emotion in at all.Problem #2: Sharon Stone is the villain. Sharon Stone is famous for only one reason. She showed her naughty bits in Basic Instinct. That's it. Basic Instinct wasn't even a good movie either. Anything that has Sharon Stone in it without her exposing herself isn't worth anyone's time.Problem #3: The dastardly plot. A company is selling a beauty product that is addictive so people can't stop using it. That's pretty much it. They kill Catwoman to shut her up, but she comes back and gets revenge. In an attempt at a clever plot twist Sharon Stone has super-toughness from using the evil product in question. So wait... the evil beauty cream gives people superpowers? Then why is it evil? Problem #4: The effects are inconsistent. Some of them look pretty good and some of them totally suck. It looks like they pulled the effects budget halfway through the film and some of the rough animations were passed off as final effects.Problem #5: The costume. Man did it suck. The outfit she wore early in the film (in the bank heist scene)looked good, it fit the character. The outfit from later on was just stupid, especially the mask/helmet. It made her look like a special ed kid.This movie isn't even good to make fun of. My roommates rented it and made me watch it thinking that we could have fun mocking it. What followed was three hours of total silence. The movie was like 90 minutes long. For the following 90 minutes we just stared at the blank TV screen in utter amazement at the crap we had just watched.Anyone that tries to get you to watch this movie is not your friend.",

Like Jamie Fox doing Stealth after Ray. Or Cuba Gooding Jr. making movies like Snow Dogs after Jerry Maguire. Or, you know, Halle Berry's entire post-Monster's Ball career.After Michelle Pfeiffer wowed audiences as Catwoman in Batman Returns, a spin-off was announced. It sat in development hell before Warner Brothers canceled Batman vs. Superman and needed a film to take its place.Audiences today are spoiled by superhero movies. This is what we got in 2004 - even though if you told me this movie was made in 1996, I'd say, \"Well, yeah.\" Instead of comic referenced and audience-pleasing movies, we got loosely based upon slabs of pure ennui like this caper, which had a costume that didn't even look like the comics, but instead showed the \"sensual awakening of a sexy warrior goddess.\"Pitof, who directed this mess, said, \"I checked out some to see how Catwoman is treated in the comics, to make sure that our Catwoman was in the same vein. But I didn't want to be too influenced by the comic book.\"I'd say that the comic was never cracked open.Instead of Selina Kyle, Catwoman is Patience Phillips, who works at Laurel Hedare's (Sharon Stone) cosmetics company. She learns that the company is covering up the dangers of a new cosmetics line, so she's killed but saved by a bunch of cats. This leads to a game of basketball with Benjamin Bratt, who plays a cop.This movie cleaned up at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards, winning worst picture, worst screenplay, worst director and worst actress, which Berry picked up herself, showing that she has a sense of humor. In her acceptance speech, she said, \"I'd like to thank Warner Brothers, for making me do this godawful, piece of **** movie!\"Sadly, someone out there has to develop and maintain the web page for the movie at Warner Brothers. If you think your career is rough, you never had to redesign and keep the web page current for Catwoman.Is that job any worse than the food artist who had to mold fruit into fake sushi for the date scene between Berry and Bratt? Why did it have to be sushi? Why couldn't they just use sushi? Why did they even need to see the food? Instead, someone had to spend hours painstakingly making fruit look like sushimi.It took fourteen writers to make this movie, a story that is supposedly about Catwoman but just rips off The Crow without the emotion. Pure junk on celluloid, this movie is a reminder that at one point, studios paid big money to make comic book movies and never once thought that the source material was worthwhile.",

To say I agree would be an understatement. Holy leather catnip! This was torturous! Patience, a designer for a cosmetic company, is killed after witnessing the side-effects of their product. She is then (stay with me now) brought back to life by a cat who breathes on her corpse, granting her agile abilities of a cat. Thus becoming Catwoman. Completely disregarding its source material, Pitof's adaptation is \"Purrfectly\" terrible in every way. The story is quite simply nonsensical. A cat foresees the fate of Patience and decides to \"test her\" before choosing her to hone the powers of Catwoman. The eponymous anti-hero is not just the nickname for a jewellery thief. Oh no no! Pitof has better ideas! Catwoman is actually an entity of some kind that has been passed down since the Egyptians, bestowing the user the ability to climb walls, leap gracefully, devour fish and cat food, rub their nose in catnip and hiss at dogs. Quite literally embodying a cat (giving Patience a complete personality change). Why? Who actually thought this was a good idea!? Was it Halle Berry who nearly destroyed her career the same year as winning her coveted Oscar? Nope. Was it Sharon Stone who, much like her character, attempts to stay relevant and youthful? Perhaps. What about the overuse of horrific human visual effects that caused me to hiss at the screen? Nearly. The dull story that thinks it metaphorically showcases the negative connotations of using makeup? \"Purrrhaps\". Was it Pitof? Oh, definitely. The clich\u00e9d romance, plot conveniences and unusual addition of an R&B pop soundtrack made for an already outdated experience. But the sheer amount of quick cuts during the action sequences were unforgivable. Physically making me feel nauseous. To be honest with you I could go on and on and on, but you don't want to hear me drone on about how bad this disaster is. Everyone involved should be ashamed.

Well, because I only vaguely remembered the movie, well honestly, I remembered Halle Berry as the Catwoman character, and that was about it.The storyline in \"Catwoman\", as written by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato, Michael Ferris and John Rogers, is sort of a mixed bags of nuts. If you sit down to watch \"Catwoman\" with the notion of it being a DC movie with the Selina Kyle character and watching a movie tied in with the \"Batman\" universe, then you will be sorely disappointed. Because that just simply isn't what director Pitof delivered with this 2004 movie. If you, however, sit down to watch \"Catwoman\" with the notion of it being a somewhat cringeworthy movie based very loosely on the DC character of the same name, then you might actually find a shred of enjoyment in this movie.I have to admit that I had expected it to be a DC-based movie, so I found the movie somewhat of a swing and a miss. But if you step back and look at it objectively, and forget all about DC and Selina Kyle, then \"Catwoman\" is a decent enough movie. Sure, it had flaws and such, but it does make for some cheesy enough entertainment.Personally I didn't care much for the costume that they opted to strut Halle Berry around in here. The costume was way too revealing and made very little sense for someone to wear, especially for someone on the edge of the law, as in doing robberies, fighting criminals and such. Sure, I can see that there is some appeal to a certain demographic audience by having Halle Berry running around scantily clad, but it just was too tacky.The acting performances in the movie were fair enough. I know that the acting performances have been disliked broadly. But I actually found them to be adequate enough when you take into consideration the shortcomings of an improperly written script and storyline. The movie has some good talents on the cast list actually, with the likes of Halle Berry, Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Lambert Wilson, Frances Conroy and Byron Mann.Visually, then I found \"Catwoman\" a bit too gritty and dark, and the underlaying references to matters of an adult content was just growing tired really quickly. Again, not the best of choices for the movie. The special effects in the movie were okay, not great though, but passable enough to make the movie watchable.While the 2004 movie \"Catwoman\" is not a particular great cinematic gem, then it actually makes for an adequate enough, although somewhat corny and cheesy, viewing pleasure. I have, after all, seen the movie twice now since 2004.My rating of \"Catwoman\" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.",

            "content": "How to describe Catwoman? Well I think my one line summary is fairly to the point. There was nothing horrifically bad about the film, it just wasn't any good. The storyline to begin with was slightly nicked from Batman Returns where a mousy woman finds out her bosses secret, is killed, brought back to life by moggies, wears leather. I guess the whole back story of catwomen covered that one up a bit, but still they could have come up with something a little better. It would be unfair to compare Halle Berry to Michelle Pfeiffer because the characters are actually different in the way they react to the fact that they have these new powers. Selina was more hell bent on eliminating her killer and went quite nuts because of it. Patience seemed more determined to just bring down the empire of Hedare. Her revenge just didn't seem as believable. The action sequences where real people were involved were fairly OK but the computer generated ones were distracting because it was so easy to tell when they actually occurred. I'm beginning to get slightly annoyed with film makers constant reliance on computers to have action sequences. I know in some cases it would be physically impossible to have any stunt person perform what is required, but they should limit the amount of times that impossible stunts need to be performed. Trouble is in catwoman when Halle Berry was performing her own stunts she was slow and jerky. The final fight at the end was a fine example of this. It almost seemed like they were just fighting in a set patten, following the rehearsals slowly and methodically. Now on to the acting ability of the lead characters. Halle Berry can be quite good when she knows the film is going to be successful, there was nothing wrong with her performances in both X-men films and Die Another Day, but she just seemed so wooden in Catwoman. But if it was possible Sharon Stone actually lived up to her name and had about as many facial expressions as a granite statue. Maybe that was part of the character who was wearing so much of that face cream that she couldn't actually move her face, we will never know. Benjamin Bratt seemed almost non-existent in this, just really going along with everything and not really having much to do with anything at all. In summary, this film had so much potential to be a great action comedy that didn't have to take itself seriously like the Charlie's Angels films have managed to succeed in doing. But with a thin plot and terrible acting it was never going to be. Basically this is just a film centred on Halle Berry and the fact that she is hot property. She had better watch it though, she has done a couple of turkeys since winning that Oscar and with 6 films lined up between now and next year we could become so saturated with her that we will eventually tire.",

Sharon Stone hams it up, but that is probably the best part of the movie. The plot, centering on a beauty cream that stops aging but destroys the skin if you stop using it, is beyond stupid. The meeting of cop Benjamin Bratt and Berry is ignorant. If I had to rescue a woman who was trying to save a cat, I think I would have her committed instead of buy her a drink. But, all of this could have been campy fun. Unfortunately, director Pitof actually believes he is making a good movie. I find it more than a little sad that no one realized this kind of film-making is only good in cheap TV-movies. The real killer of the movie is it's reliance on bad computer effects. I've never been a fan of them in general (I think it takes more creativity to mold the effects out of real objects than to punch keys); I really hate bad effects.

Having also heard that this one is a stinker, I was pleasantly surprised. \"Catwoman,\" with Halle Berry, ain't bad at all. Certainly, it has its flaws, most mentionable among them is its slavish loyalty to political correctness. This is a very feminist movie in which men, particularly white men, are beaten up regularly because all the bad people in the flick just happen to be white men, save one, who is a white woman (Sharon Stone). If you can get past that, Halle Berry makes a good Catwoman -- beautiful, sexy, animalistic, and fierce. The effects are well done, particularly her very cat-like movements. The plot is rather thin, but it's a comic book story, these are comic book characters, and it is reasonably entertaining, nonetheless. If you go into this movie not expecting too much, you will appreciate it more, because it's really not a bad effort.

What an actress! I've never seen an actress being so dedicated, and so comfortable in her role like she has. Halle was BORN for this role, ignore what everyone else says! Halle, honey, don't ever, EVER feel ashamed because some fat, geeky, short-sided idiots have decided to give you a Razzie!

            "content": "Objective? Most of you who know me question how it is possible to analyze the movie objectively, considering I'm among the most vocal objectors toward the movie. Well, this is objective. I checked my brain at the door...of my room...and decided to go in ignoring the campy dialogue and the gaping plot holes. I decided to look for the good parts of the movie and gain from there my opinion of the movie.Unfortunately, there were no good parts, and my eyes bled no less than thrice per minute of mind-numbingly trite cinematic abortion. It would've hurt less to sit and watch MTV for the same length of time. At least MTV doesn't try to pretend to be some feminist statement.Anyway, for those who have only read the comics and have no clue about the movie, here's a list of things the movie has in common with the comic...and any other incarnation of the character ever to exist...:* the title.The movie opens with an ancient Egyptian map, strangely in English, followed by a quick succession of random clips of WAY MORE THAN NINE (can't even keep their own story straight) \"Catwomen,\" with no mention of Selina at all, which is both a praiseworthy thing and a slap in the face.Patience is one of the most exaggerated, unrealistic characters I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. Nobody is that shy. Nobody is that meek. Nobody is that annoyingly stumbly, frumpy, and clutzy. And this is coming from a guy who just came back from nerd camp.And don't get me started on that gay coworker.The only believable characters in this whole mess were Benjamin Bratt as Det. Tom Lone (where do these people come up with this?) and Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare. When I say believable, I don't mean well-acted. I mean that I could believe that I could believe that Ben Bratt was a cop and that Sharon Stone was an ex-model with a bad husband.The heavy reshoots shone through. The \"HELL NO!\" scene was replaced, the \"Bast is hard to pronounce\" and costume-making scenes were cut, and the \"pussy...cats\" line was cut. Unfortunately, that made about as big of a difference to the finished product as it would have to remove one hair from Halle Berry's head in a scene.Alex Borstein's character was also extremely annoying. I love the woman dearly, but she needs to make better career decisions.The camera work was excellent...for about the first four or five minutes. Then it was all over the place. I felt like an ADD kid after chugging a half-gallon of Red Bull laced with LSD. The colors were garish and the camera wouldn't stay in the same place for more than about half a second. During parts of the film, I was nauseous because the camera moved around too much. Whoever decided on that jumpy sh*t should never be allowed to work on a film again. In fact, everyone involved in the production should be forced to work the cash register at a redneck trucker stop in the middle of nowhere for the rest of their lives, except for Klaus Badelt, who is an amazing composer, Alex Borstein, who needs to go back to Family Guy NOW, Ben Bratt, who needs to go back to Law & Order NOW, and Lambert Wilson, who just needs to find a better obnoxious Frenchman part like he had in the Matrix sequels.In conclusion, it was extremely difficult not to kill myself in the face at any given point during the movie. Resisting the temptation to leap from my window when a car speeds by as to be knocked through the woods onto the highway and have my head crushed to a peaceful pulp as to rid my senses from the absolute nightmare that is Catwoman In Name Only was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. And this is coming from the guy who laughed at the Exorcist. Whatever you do, don't see Catwoman unless you're prepared for the mental equivalent of an anal probing. And remember kids: if you go see CINO, you may be maced, by the police if not by me personally.(-27 out of 5)",

Complete discussion of the movie ahead.For a movie about a woman that is 'tough' and 'independent' it's surprisingly sexist.Before this woman becomes catwoman she is walked all over, abused, yelled at, etc... Now, correct me if I'm wrong, in order to have such a high paying job in such a cut-throat competitive business as design you HAVE to be strong. So how did she even get the job in the first place? They explain this in the movie by saying \"she just that good.\"OK, so basically she gets killed and magical Egyptian cats bring her back to life....so who does she fight with her new abilities? Rapists? Murders? Child molesters? No, she fights a makeup company! Oh wow, because that is all women are concerned about - make-up! Wow how sexist.Now it turns out that the wife of the head of the makeup company is covering up the whole 'this new makeup is toxic' thing. And had to kill Patience Phillips/Catwoman since she found out about it. IF the guy switched roles with his wife, this movie would have been much improved.At this point it would have been a STRONG feminist statement about how men pressure women into looking good. But when it's the woman who is the bad guy it sort of makes no sense. I did like the statement she said in the movie though \"I'm a woman I'm used to doing things I don't want to do.\"But why would she not just tell the media about the fact that the make-up is toxic and that she needs to use it to stay alive. I'm sure they would allow it. This makes women seem stupid, selfish, vain, etc. Also the fact that she confessed to the cop was rather silly, again making women look stupid.Another sexist thing about the movie was catwoman herself. She basically was not independent at all as the movie stated. If anything she was helping the cop the whole time to crack the case. She was ANSWERING TO A MAN! Sexist....Also how can you fight in such an outfit? Most women wear more than that and are afraid of a 'wardrobe malfunction.' Also her shoes were open toe! And they were flimsy heels. The outfit simply objectified her. Sad that she seemed to be more empowered before she became catwoman, she wore what she pleased.Michelle Pfeiffer as catwoman in Batman Returns (1992) did a better job. Since SHE was in control of what SHE wanted and did not let MEN boss her around. In addition she was in control of her own sexuality. Since SHE came onto batman. Whereas with this catwoman the guy makes the first move, and she is all fawning over him. Wow very sexist....Oh, her friend is ALSO shown as vein. As she wears that toxic make-up that is causing her to be sick. And every other minute she is trying to make men fall for her. There are literally NO positive representations of females in a movie apparently about women 'taking charge'! Sharon Stone's character is shown as a vain, greedy, lying, selfish, stupid. Alex Borstein's character is shown as a dumb, man-obsessed doofus. Halle Berry's character is shown as a male puppet/play thing. And Frances Conroy plays a crazy cat lady!

            "content": "There comes a point where simply reading about cinematic infamy isn't enough, and you have to see it for yourself. 'Ishtar,' 'North,' and 'Showgirls' are all sad examples, and Pitof's much-maligned adaptation of a beloved comic book character is another. Before even watching the movie proper there's a lot to think about, and setting aside the end result, I appreciate the thought and effort that went into this. Myths, legends, and folklore from across all eras and cultures have centered around that truly superior terrestrial life form, the cat; this character is nothing if not an easy symbol for female empowerment, individuality, and a fight against oppressive systems. The writers try to play with these ideas in part, and also weave in themes of extreme corporate and capitalist malfeasance, and sexism. I admire the notion of protagonist Patience being effectively transformed as she takes on a new persona, going from meek and nervous to confident and brash; I take no issue with the way this rendition of a classic character is separated from the wider lore in which she's otherwise based - I see no reason why such a figure couldn't be treated as her very own person. Angus Strathie's guiding tack behind the infamous costume makes perfect sense to me. All this is well and good. And none of it saves 'Catwoman' from the significant problems that weigh it down and have helped it to earn a label as one of the worst films ever made.There is a tawdry, dire, overbearing, excruciating lack of tact or nuance characterizing this feature. There's a false, waxy sheen layered over the fundamental image; every instance of CGI is simply unbearable, including not least that first moment when our protagonist has her \"awakening,\" and too many illustrations of her \"powers.\" That CGI, the cinematography, the editing, and a great deal of the writing and direction - dialogue, scenes, characters, plot development, and so on - are forthright, over the top, and even overzealous to the point of being not fun, but hopelessly tacky. This also applies to any action sequences, filled with zip, zest, bombast, style, and a transparent intended \"cool factor,\" but also invariably tiresome for lack of any dynamics or subtlety. There are actually some really terrific ideas here, including the concept of Patience taking on feline traits and behavior, and these lend themselves to genuine delight and laughter at times. The fact that such wit and humor feels kind of out of place in an action flick, well, that's highly unfortunate. I like that Catwoman's fighting style is informed by capoeira, seen far too little in film or TV, but again the issue of how action sequences are orchestrated. I don't think Strathie's costume design or the work of the hair and makeup artists are inherently bad; I think their contributions, like all else here, were guided to the seediest, most blunt, most kitschy, and irritating ends they could be. Even the music, both Klaus Badelt's score and select songs on the soundtrack, are fine in and of themselves, but employed to ends that are actively irritating and far too on the nose.The production design and art direction range from earnestly fetching to excessive. For the most part I think the cast is fine, and in the very least they try to imbue their performances with sincerity that is generally far too lacking in the proceedings. All the same, there's a tinge of inauthenticity in the acting, even from the likes of Frances Conroy, Lambert Wilson, or Sharon Stone, that I can only assume is owed to the senseless overcooked ethos that defines every last element. And as for Halle Berry, well... In some moments we see the refined personality, range, and otherwise skills that we know she possesses and has demonstrated elsewhere to great success. In some moments she's at least clearly having a good time. In too many others, however, Berry is overacting with a frenetic, overcharged bluster that's just plain outrageous. Sure, we can chalk this up in part to the way Catwoman is written in the first place, and above all Pitof's direction and the overall slant of the production are a predominant factor. Still, she leans so hard into the dishonest swagger that she becomes a controlling focal point of it - its victim, to some extent, but just as surely its driving force in some measure. Golly, is this regrettable.Have I mentioned the picture's embrace of forensic pseudoscience, the favored instrument of crime shows on TV and untrustworthy state agents in real life? Have I mentioned the significant practice here of the male gaze at every opportunity - never sexy, only ever sleazy - into which the final look of Strathie's design directly feeds? The root concept of every component part is at least baseline suitable, if not also inventive, clever, and or smart. For lack of mindful care, however, or perspective, there is glaringly, appallingly little about this that actually comes off well. Through to the very end this is too often altogether boorish or obnoxious, and far too little entertaining. What kernels of value it can claim aren't nearly enough to rise above the overwhelming crudeness and bawdiness of what it ultimately represents. It turns out that 2004's 'Catwoman' really is That Bad.I see what it could have been. That is it not what it is. I'm glad for those who do get more out of this than me or many others. Unless you have a special reason to watch, however, then Pitof's 'Catwoman' is a feature that's best left to that wing of the vaults that no one talks about.",

Every time I've watched the movie and with different people, someone always seems to point out the obvious goofs.

Perhaps that's why I was able to enjoy it. I mean, it is a terrible movie, the script is somewhat incoherent, the dialog is ludicrous and the special effects are silly rather than cool. But it is also a movie that is rather amusing, sometimes on purpose, more often by accident, and it moves pretty quickly. It's certainly more entertaining than The Incredible Hulk, which is an example of a bad movie that doesn't even manage to be any fun.The general incompetence of almost every aspect of the film can at times bring it close to the level of an Ed Wood movie, but alas the film lacks Wood's pretensions to greatness, and rarely is so bad as to be laugh out loud funny (although it does happen a couple of times). The movie also manages a few legitimate laughs. So all in all, while I wouldn't want to watch it again, I don't regret watching it once.Still, this must be the worst portrayal of Cat Woman. The most interesting conceptually was probably Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns, even though I didn't think much of the movie, but for me catwoman will always be the fabulous Julie Newmar from the TV series.",

I can't believe Hollywood makes dreck like this and then blames people not paying $10 a head to see it on internet piracy. The only reason I watched it was because I heard what a train wreck it was and it was showing on HBO. The costumes, writing, and of course the acting are all horrendous. I could just see Sharon and Halle balancing their checkbook in the back of their minds as they reeled off some of the most banal dialog ever to grace celluloid.

Some say Halle Berry can't act, whatever the truth is, Halle is the Catwoman in this movie and plays her part very well. The same goes for Sharon Stone who has been leveled with the same criticism, Sharon is an evil villainess and her character is fun to hate.What i loved the best about this movie was the action. The action is beautifully choreographed, the fight scenes were energetic and exciting. I loved the little cat and mouse encounter between Catwoman and the detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) as he was trying to apprehend her. As well as the vicious encounter between Catwoman and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone).It is a revenge movie which is a favorite kind of movie for me. Halle Berry plays timid Patience Phillips who is murdered after hearing something she shouldn't have. After coming back to life with the aid of a cat, she seeks revenge.I love the assertive Catwoman in the sexy leather who doesn't take crap from people. And this Catwoman truly is a Catwoman. Unlike Pfeiffer who was a woman with catlike movements, Unlike Peter Parker who is a man with spider abilities, and unlike Batman who is a man in a bat costume, Halle is a blend between a cat and a woman.I like that this movie takes place in a normal looking modern city and not some plastic looking Gotham city. It made it easier for me to relate to and also easier for me to accept the fantasy aspects of the movie.I think the movie is getting an undeserved bad rap. I've read a lot of bad reviews/opinions from those who haven't seen the movie based on negative personal feelings they have against Halle. That's too bad.",

Banter that makes Hollywood irritating. But it's a dc comic and I like watching Halle Berry. She is unofficially assigned to de-corrupt a cosmetics company she works for. If you know the dc legend comic, you know how she gets started. Hollywood pretty much leans lazily upon the comics, here. If it wasn't for Halle's performance, I wouldn't be able to watch half of it. It's not fair to compare this to Pfeiffer's because she did no stand-alone. But you know hollywood. If Berry was in the Batman with Keaton, it would have been Star Wars 4. They don't try to give good scripts to Berry. But they always give good scripts to Pfeiffer. Also spoiled by the emotional romance of the first part of the 1987 cbs tv Beauty and The Beast series, I'm jolted back into reality, by the usual stalker-ish sex lust chase that most men writers admit they are into as the detective gets an attempt at an escape from his wham bam, mam, with Patience, through a phone call to her, while she looks for him. This movie would have gotten a zero rating, here, if Halle wasn't in it- a one, because of the rules. This movie doesn't use a sledgehammer but does effectively truth about unfair treatment of women, (in the justice system and society at large, and the propensity for both to lean on circumstantial evidence, more than hard evidence), with Halle and Stone, leading the charge.When this movie was released in 2004, the majority of the official reviewers were men. It was a tough time for Janet Jackson, and a lot of the reviews seemed to be of a sexual nature because of Berry's outfits. Objectivity was lacking and this script made it all too easy for that combination to result in disrespect in official reviews. Negative reviews are expected with a mostly bad script but this was another level. They seemed eager to give her a razzie. This reviewer was ashamedly influenced by the bad press but didn't know about the razzie. 2022 was the first viewing and razzie knowledge. Good thing there is streaming.

It certainly has its flaws, and it is not for the comic book purist who wishes to see a film about Selina Kyle, the Catwoman we all know and love (or hate.) However, Batman Returns was not true to Selina's origin, either, yet people loved it. Catwoman tells the story of the NEXT woman to wear the mantle, the next to be revived from death by a feline friend. While in Batman Returns, it was made to seem strange but semi-mundane, in Catwoman, it is purely mystical. In effect, Catwoman is the semi-sequel they promised us way back in 1992.I promised myself, when I heard the plot, heard what was being done with the Catwoman franchise, that I would not watch this movie... But, being incredibly bored and at a video store at 11pm causes lots of strange things. For that reason, I purchased this movie.If you can separate that this is not about the comic character, has NOTHING to do with her any more than the mousy blonde Selina Kyle of Batman Returns has to do with the vivacious green eyed brunette that normally goes by that name, you're on the first step to enjoying the movie.I won't lie. It certainly has many flaws, including the incessant need to include a love interest, some mediocre acting on the part of Halle's fellow cast members... and a REALLY bad mask/design for the costume.The plot is mediocre. Art designer goes to deliver latest layout for her ads, stumbles upon big corporate secret, is chased around scary warehouse, only to be killed. Her body, washed up on a nearby shore after she drowns (in sewage, no less) is revived by a mystical messenger of the goddess Bast. Adjusting to her new powers, Patience has some adventures and some amusing scenes, in which Halle Berry shows off a decent understanding of cat behavior. (Owning four, I must say, she pulled it off pretty well, as I found myself thinking of mine.) She then goes after the people that 'killed' her (sound familiar?) and the movie continues in a rather clich\u00e9 fashion.Despite this, I enjoyed it. It kept my attention, without keeping me glued to my seat (I have a bit of a short attention span, admittedly, and normally get up a LOT during movies. I only paused and got up twice.) If you like action films that are action films with only basic plot, this film's for you. If you like girl power films where women kick ass, this film's for you. If you like strange costumes that no sane woman would wear to kick ass IN? This film's for you. It's not a masterpiece, and they relied too much on CGI (specifically, around Sharon Stone, because she was injured on the set when a real whip was used) but no film is perfect. While I wouldn't say it ranks up with Spider-Man or X-Men, or any of the new hero movies, I would definitely rank it above Daredevil or either of the Tomb Raider films.To those who are comic purists (like myself) and resent the way that the movies have influenced the comics, remember that Catwoman is an Elseworlds story, and, if they had billed it as something else entirely, rather than Catwoman, it would have been a big comic book fan hit.All in all, it's not great, but it doesn't deserve the crap it's gotten for it, even from me, in the past.",

            "content": "I've always heard how bad this movie was. During the first few minutes, I was agreeing with that, but I was forgetting one thing. I knew it was possible to play an awkward, bumbling character and still be giving a good performance (since we're dealing with superheroes, look at Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent--NOT Dean Cain or Tom Welling). I just didn't think the Oscar-winning Halle Berry was giving us that. Well, I finally had to conclude she was.After all, look at what a fantastic job Berry did as Catwoman. So much more confident, so tough, a good fighter, and she moved so much like a cat. And ate like a cat. I wasn't quite satisfied with her Eartha Kitt impression, but only Eartha Kitt was PURRfect saying that word.So what else could have been wrong with the movie? Maybe it was trying to be a romantic comedy and an action adventure and failing at both? It was trying to be both, but that didn't bother me. I liked Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry together. And what happened when he found out why she was behaving the way she was.It wasn't long before I realized the standout performer in this movie (at least before Catwoman) was Alex Borstein as Patience's friend Sally. If someone is that good, how can it be a bad movie?The cats were ... weird. But pretty. Particularly the one who made Patience's life change. It was obvious those weren't always real cats, but the animators or whoever they were did a good job. Crazy Cat Lady was also good. I don't remember her name now.Sharon Stone (who I didn't recognize) also did a good job. It helps if your character is also trying to convince people you are something you're not.One thing I didn't care for was the music. You have to figure either Berry liked this music or her fans did. The music at her neighbors' apartment wasn't good either. I did like seeing her finally resolve that problem.Yes, I've seen better action movies. Yes, this one could be silly. But it wasn't a bad movie.",

After all, everyone has pretty much dissed the movie without even seeing it.  Havent we learned that trailers dont always tell us everything??  Well much to my surprise the theater was packed!  All ages in fact!  I was so excited to see there were others like me who were just as thrilled to finally see Catwoman on the screen!  I really enjoy the movie a lot.  Dont get me wrong, its no Batman but I thought it was a great new take on a classic DC comics character.  I do have to admit that it did have a slow start and there's way to many CG effects through out the film.   But other than that, Halle Berry did an awesome job as did Sharon Stone playing her nemesis.  I dont know if this film will produce any sequels but even if it doesnt, I still think its a great film that should be looked at with more of an open mind.  Even if you dont like it.... at least you can admit Halle looks great in leather! Overall, this is a fun and fast paced popcorn flick that leaves you wishing you could see more of her adventures...hopefully we will!!!",

Besides that I have a personal dislike for these comic-book based films, the only ones I like are the X-men films (whereas both Spider-man's bored me to death and the hulk made me lose faith in the way movies are written). However, boredom can drive people to doing strange and mysterious things, so when I was channel flicking, catwoman was just starting so I thought \"what the heck!\" and watched it.First of all, the acting in this film is very campy and over the top, but then it was much better than I expected! Halle Berry does what she can with her character, but Sharon Stone made the movie for me! Stone is deliciously bitchy and evil which just works for me. Benjamin Bratt also does well with what he is given (i.e playing possibly the worst detective in movie history). I think Laurel and Hardy would make better detectives! The story is your basic super-hero plot. Weak but generally nice person has some sort of accident and is fused with animal/mutant powers and thus decides that saving the world from evil is the best career choice from now on. However our intrepid hero is misunderstood by the general public (surprise surprise) and is labelled a criminal.Overall the film is silly but I rather enjoyed it! Who knows maybe you will too!!",

To be honest I didn't find this \"piece of cat litter\" that horrible (After all, I gave it four out of ten), but it is very disappointing considering the people who worked on it.\"Vidocq\", the previous film by Pitof, was quite a refreshing piece of old-fashioned mystery and thriller. Above all else, it was visually stunning and very vibrant. \"Catwoman\" also looks very sleek, but there just isn't enough substance. The whole plot is ridiculous and so simple it could've been written by school kids (Halle's transformation into Catwoman doesn't make much sense). On the performance side there's not much to say either. I think Halle is a fine actress, but here she just mews stupid one-liners like \"Cat got your tongue?\" (for some reason she reminds me of Arnold in \"Batman & Robin\"... weird, I know). And her controversial dress, well, let's just say Michelle Pfeiffer did it better in 1992. Sharon Stone, another okay actress when given proper material, goes totally over-the-top which is not a good thing, at least not in this case.I would say \"Catwoman\" is worth just a rental, it isn't the most horrible film in the world but it certainly isn't good either.

It looks that no one in the production team cared about the quality of the movie as a whole. Some clich\u00e9s are so predictable that it's hard to stand even for admirers of Berry (who is allowed to present her physical attributes, but even that doesn't save it). Catwoman is a film that, when accidentally stopped during the screening, would hardly leave anyone to beg for continuing.

And especially hating on Miss Berry seems to be the norm. Blame her interpretation of Storm/Ororo Munroe, I guess. I'm no fan of that too, to be frank.Back to Catwoman.This movie isn't half as bad as it may seem from the spitting-foaming-at-the-mouth-angry reviews here&there. It's no Citizen Cane, no doubt there, but it has a charming, campy over-acted quirky-ness far too often missing from the current glut of taking-themselves-far-too-serious Super Hero movies. In some instances I felt an undertone of the Batman series of the 60's. Shame that the filmmakers were a tad too fearful to go that way. It's unpretentious fun, a bit of an enjoyable power-trip where a meek, mousy girl/woman suddenly becomes this super-powered creature, oozing sensuality. Don't lie to me Ladies (and gents)! A lot of You have -secretly- dreamt of something like that happening to You.The sheer derision, and fulminating spit-attacks towards cat-woman are more telling of the type of people perpetrating them, than of the actual quality of this movie.Honesty forces me to admit that I wouldn't go to a theater for it, but as a Bargain-bin DVD, to be watched while enjoying a beer and the company of friends? Not bad, not bad at all.I'd classify it as an enjoyable made-for-TV type of flick. The CGI Is dated by now, true. Same goes for the way writers ignored the \"pure\" Catwoman canon, but it's 10 years old by now (!) and at that time the Super-Hero genre was not as established as it is nowadays.I feel that -would a comparable movie be made nowadays- the public and critics would be far more forgiving, no longer having the fear of being considered a freak for liking the whole crazy, odd Super Powered Super Hero genre.No, it st\u00ecll wouldn't be Citizen Kane, but it would not have been slammed with mud like it was in 2004.",

It is not enough to make the movie watchable but still it made me rate it 2/10 rather than 1/10. I guess it is something...Now the bad things... Everything else... Halle Berry is an awful actress. I know, she won \"Oscar\" for some other role but, well, she is an awful actress. All she had to do is to look sexy and she failed miserably. She is a beautiful woman and yet she looks quite ugly here. It wasn't due to her make up or something, she just walks ugly and acts ugly. Her moves remind me more of an ill monkey than a cat or whatever animal she was supposed to look like. Her walk makes her look drunk constantly. I can't even remember the way she talked. I don't remember even the name of her character. Yes, she is THAT faceless.Pitof is an awful director. 'Vidocq' was one of the most painful movie experiences I have ever had and this movie is even worse. Pitof has no sense of pacing, he can't direct anything... He may be good at doing visual effects but that's not enough. You need a real directing talent to do a watchable action movie. If you don't have it...The stunts are awful.

This movie requires someone that can make these one-liners sound cool, and that's really not Berry's cup of tea. It all just feels so extremely awkward. It's a bad sign when Sharon Stone's outplaying you. An even bigger thorn in the eye is the screenplay though because seriously, what is this crap?

She was great in X-Men and really everything else she's been in, so seeing her in such a bad movie does make me sad.Even though I really wanted to love Catwoman, I'm not a fan of the film. I think the reason why I'm so upset is because Catwoman is such a fascinating character! But then the creators decided to completely ignore the excellent character with a well developed background that was handed to them on a platter for someone else whose character was so under developed that I forgot what I was watching for a few minutes. Had they actually gone somewhere with Patience Phillips then I wouldn't have such a problem with this, but that was the definition of awful. I am actually ashamed to admit that sometimes this is a good movie to watch if you want something mind numbing. You know, just something to play if you've had a really bad day at work and just need something silly. However, it does look like they put in a lot of effort into prepping the actors for Catwoman. If I'm not mistaken, they hired someone to teach Halle Berry to walk like a cat would walk and all that jazz. I did like seeing that they tried. I applaud that.I'm not saying, \"Don't see this movie!\" but I do want to put my opinion out there. I read a few other reviews and some people loved Catwoman.

I'm not even sure Halle Berry even starred in the movie: I think it may have been an entire computer generated person that looked like her. 5. The costumes. Even the normal clothes look terrible. And Sharon Stone in all white? She looks HIDEOUS! 6. Worst camera action sequences EVER. Even the part where Catwoman has the whip and is kicking some butt the director cuts the scene up so it's hard to tell what is going on. The good things? 1. I had a free movie ticket. 2. The real cats. And the CGI cat they have isn't so bad looking either. 3. The opening sequence with all kinds of cool pictures of cats and catwomen.   Not even campy fun like I had hoped.   Blech.",

Though part of the reason I liked it may be that I've been a Catwoman fan ever since I was around 7, but if it were just that I would've probably given it a 5 or less and gotten mad because they did such a terrible job on it if I thought they had. But I think they did a good job with it. Sure, it's not an intellectual film, but most action films aren't. I don't watch action films in order to engage in deep thought; that's what the drama genre is for. Like everyone else I know, I watch movies of the action genre when I want to see some good old fashioned butt-kicking. So not only is there a new twist on a character I've liked ever since I was little, but there's also plenty of interesting fight scenes. The part where she used that guy in the jewelry store as a skateboard was just priceless.",

There were a number of instances where characters did nothing but jump around and move in action to bad autotuned soundtrack, and Catwoman is turned from cat burglar to a perverse, sexualized freak who goes so far as to wear a revealing costume and carry a whip with her.

It was so predictable, nothing memorable happens in it and I could've done without the bad dance rave party songs popping up at random times and long sequences of Catwoman shaking her butt for no apparent reason.

At least Halle Berry laughed this off, because if she didn't. I would cry for her right now.Halle Berry is literally but in a costume that reveals 95% of her body without showing the inappropriate parts of her body.

Seriously?The action scenes are very bad, and the CG just screams fake. Maybe there was a reason this movie bombed. Who am I kidding, there was a big reason! You can't even consider this a DC movie, because it's more about a woman cosplaying as Catwoman. And that awful basketball scene. Most people I know like that scene and the movie because it shows off Halle Berry's body. I admit, Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, but if you want a movie that shows her beauty, you're looking in the wrong place.So, doing a bunch of sexual moves on a basketball court in front of a bunch of kids is okay?

            "content": "Overcooked is the only way I can describe this film.What's wrong with it? Not the plot. The plot is actually pretty interesting, but unfortunately, the makers of this film chose to take the most anachronistic, exaggerated, silly and least compelling aspects of the original catwoman story and to emphasize and even embellish them. Catwoman is, in one sense, the story of a woman who must die and be reborn as an embodiment of feline magic and physical prowess in order to free herself from what appears (in the film) to be imaginary social oppression. What can we make of this? Are we being told that the lot of women is so awful that death and potential spiritual and physical augmentation are the only ways to achieve feminine freedom? Are we being told that cats are good role models for would-be strong and independent women? These themes, though treated a bit more subtly in the normally more outrageous and fantastic medium of DC comics, are raised to the level of ambiguous, slightly offensive, and really bizarre social commentary in this film.The Script. The script is the primary problem with the plot. Combined with the editing and the director's overall (lack of?) vision concerning the story The love story could have been an important aspect of the story, but it is poorly developed and only really pays off in the last scene (possibly the best scene in the film). The flirty but unemotional script couldn't even be saved by the talented Berry and Bratt combination.... while I am at it...The Casting. Bratt and Berry, as pretty as they both are, and as talented, have NO CHEMISTRY in this film. As much as I like Haile Berry, this was not a good role for her. First, she's not a very physical actress. Second, she was apparently not appropriately inspired to internalize her character well enough to create consistent characterization. In the end, she was more likable before she actually became the Catwoman. Haile - stay away from sci fi, it's simply not your genre. Bratt is fine in his supporting role - playing a stereotype TV detective - as are Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson - the heavies.The Cinematography and Camera-work. Were simply awful. The CGI sequences, which tend to dominate every action sequence, are neither believable nor artistically done. After seeing the CGI in LOTR, it astonishes me that anybody would think they could get away with what passed for action animation in thi film. I would have rather seen the film cut to a cartoon for the action sequences than to go where it went. The film also uses a lot short clips and clich\u00e9 close-ups to grab the viewer's attention. these techniques have become such a standard approach that they no longer have any impact. Ho hum. The directing. See all of the above.Catwoman is not nearly as bad as many seem to think (the modal vote here on IMDb is 1). I can honestly say that the film really had good potential and occasionally made me think. I even liked some of the characters. Hopefully the next time somebody takes on this interesting tale (if that should ever happen again), they will learn from the plentiful mistakes this version supplies.",

            "content": "This Batman spin-off, as I'm sure you know, has been very poorly received in general. I missed its theatrical run back in 2004, but that's certainly NOT something I regret! I never even knew of the film's existence until sometime later. Now that I've seen it, unlike many others, I certainly don't hate it with a passion, so I can't join the many who have voted 1/10 for it. However, it's definitely a disgrace compared to several other comic book movies of the decade, and I can still pretty much understand all the hate.Patience Phillips is a shy woman, constantly down on herself, who works for Hedare Beauty as a graphic designer. One night, she happens to overhear a conversation, and learns the truth about the company's new anti-aging product, how it will have dire results if one stops using it! When they realize that she has found out their evil secret, they chase after her and try to kill her! Eventually, they succeed, but Patience is brought back to life by a cat! After this, however, her life is a lot different! The cat has given her new superpowers, and now she is not a hero, not a villain, but somewhere in between! She is now Catwoman, and she plans to find out who is responsible for her death so she can get her vengeance! Soon, she ends up causing a lot of trouble in the city, and may pay the price for it! I never expect the scripts of these comic book movies to be absolutely flawless, but do expect them to be at least half-decent, and the script for \"Catwoman\" isn't even that. It's a very juvenile one! Halle Berry certainly can act, but she puts on a poor performance in her starring role here, obviously because she didn't have a good script to work with. Her character does some pretty ridiculous things after being rescued, such as drawing a silly picture of her boss and eating cans of cat food. Clearly, Berry realizes how bad she is in this film, and how bad this film is, as she appeared to accept her Razzie \"Award\" for Worst Actress! The film is also rather poorly directed, with some rather cheesy action sequences, though you could probably find worse action sequences in \"Power Rangers\". Certain scenes in \"Catwoman\" may be so bad that they're almost amusing, but not quite.I'm sure pretty much everything I've said about this movie has been said before, but I really don't know what else there is to be said. Now, much worse excuses for movies have seen the light of day, and I may not agree 100% with the extremely low rating for this one, but since it is pretty bad overall, I can't complain too much about that rating. Changing Catwoman's name from Selina Kyle to Patience Phillips is not a big deal, but all the flaws that I've pointed out are. Unless you're really curious, there's probably no point in seeing this film, but even if you are curious, you might regret it! If you want a good comic book movie, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere. Fortunately, one good thing I can say is kudos to Halle Berry for taking her Razzie and giving a funny acceptance speech! I guess she has a good sense of humour.",

I had read that it was one of the worst movies ever made, and wondered \"How bad could it really be?\" Well, after the first 10 minutes, it REALLY was that BAD. So I took a nap for while, then proceeded to watch the remainder of movie without the headset on. Amazingly, the movie was now watchable and somewhat entertaining. This anecdote is a long about way of saying that \"Catwoman\" will someday be a great airplane movie sans the audio headset. Yes, this is a glaring indictment of a totally inept movie that wasted 90 minutes of my life. Granted I did see the movie to kill some time. Stupid me. A dear bud, Bobby, pointed this out to me. This vacuum of redeeming quality is completely unexpected given that Halle Berry as Catwoman is one of the most stunningly beautiful women to watch on screen. Benjamin Bratt as her torn romantic interest Detective Tom Lone is a great looking leading man and solid actor. The very hot and steamy Sharon Stone plays her evil best as aging cosmetics baroness, Laurel Hedare. However, all their star power can not overcome the incoherent and incomprehensible storyline. The movie is a mess. Director Pitof has a cutting edge visual style, and provides a cool textured score. Ultimately, this does nothing. I do like stupid funny movies-- that would be intentionally stupid and funny movies. What I do find most annoying is unintentionally and ineptly stupid movies. This would be \"Catwoman\". It is a bad omen when the opening credits require an explanation later in the movie itself. The transformation of meek and mousy Patience Phillips (Berry) to the fierce Catwoman is plain dumb. Berry looks stunning in the costume, and obviously trained her body rigorously for this role, but this is all for not. Even if \"Catwoman\" had some quality gratuitous nudity, it would not have been able to salvage this train wreck. Don't see this horrible movie. It is a complete waste of time, even if you are looking to waste some time. Really.",

And we could have seen a bit more of Halle Berry in that catsuit!

But through wasting time and ideas, we were eventually given this film, an inferior movie that squanders what could've revived a part of the Batman universe a year before Batman Begins. But is it all bad?The story has its issues. \"Attack of the Killer Cosmetics!\" It's laughable, but considering the target audience for this movie seemed to be girls and women familiar with society's emphasis on youth and physical beauty, it could've been a bit of a horror story for them.Sharon Stone has always been the least fun form of camp to cast in a movie. That alone should've told everything they wanted to know about it. Halle Berry's acting has its ups and downs, though I find her acting even harder to watch in any of the X-Men films. The rest of the cast does a decent job with what they're given. Benjamin Brat's on screen chemistry with Berry isn't as immediate as they wanted it to be, but it does build eventually and has some interesting moments. Frances Conroy delivers probably the most intriguing performance in the movie. It was off-kilter, a little bizarre, and definitely not human, which makes it an easy target for critics who flip flop between calling it \"groundbreaking\" and \"horrible\" with their inconsistent reviews. Alex Borstein delivers as always, bringing some natural comedy into the film that was sadly overlooked by critics in their determination not to mention anything positive about the film.So where did it go wrong? Camp acting and a somewhat silly story-line aren't what sink films based on comic book heroes(or in this case, antihero). My main problem, as I watched the film for the first time since 2005 today, was the direction. Strung throughout the film are some really interesting lighting ideas and commendable visuals leaning towards a very art-based film. Then the action shots happen. When a director doesn't seem to know how to capture them clearly, their first instinct is to use so many cut-shots and amp up the speed so high that it becomes a blurred, almost headache-inducing mess. The motorcycle scene, some of the fights, etc. The fight at the very end of the film and bits and pieces of the scene between Berry and Bratt behind the theater show were somewhat well done, but just couldn't make up for everything else.The CGI was also a huge problem. They either didn't have the budget or the technology to make Berry jumping around look realistic. The CGI Berry, I mean. It just seems odd that they wouldn't simply film stunts on wires and remove them digitally rather than create so many CGI animations that made me feel like half the film was a cartoon. Pixar this is not.Bigger than the bad CGI was... the soundtrack and score. There seemed to be some kind of battle between trying to make an epic hero film and an urban action-comedy. Every time the film would've benefited from a good string section, they placed in some teen-pop R&B song. It seems like they decided post-production that they needed to market it towards that group instead of toward the fan-base Catwoman already had and it hurts the film immensely.All of this said, there's a decent film hidden underneath all of these problems. There's a fun, campy little slice of cinema with the decent idea to make Catwoman an anthology of women discovering how to be confident, sexy, and uncompromising. It's just a shame that it's buried under so much of a mess.I could probably sit through this and not hate it, at least loving it's intentions. And I have to enjoy a good bit of it from time to time.Some people hate this film, some people love it. I don't think it's terrible, but it's definitely not that great. I'll probably just watch it every great once in awhile to admire a handful of good choices that really shine and lament that it could've been so much more.6/10 stars.",

George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) runs the company with his supermodel wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone).  The company is about to launch a new anti-aging product nationwide.  Patience must go to the production factory to deliver her artwork, and she accidentally hears that the product has unsafe health problems.  To keep the secret safe, she must to be eliminated.  Patience runs into a large waste water pipe, where she is trapped, and they flush her into the river, where she drowns.   An Egyptian Mau cat has been watching Patience for several days, knowing that she was about to die.  The cat has special powers that are given only to a few deserving women after they die.  Patience is reborn with new catlike powers. She now becomes Catwoman with the senses and agility of a cat.  Patience and Catwoman are two completely different people, yet they are one. Catwoman goes on the prowl, looking for the reason why she was murdered, and then for revenge.  A police detective, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), who is investigating crimes, that he thinks Catwoman committed, meets Patience and asks her out for a date.   Catwoman's wild side begins to have more influence over Patience, and she begins to follow her own rules.   Of all the Catwomen I have seen, I think Halle Berry is the best.

What I saw was an average comic book superhero film, better than some, but certainly no less, than any other comic book superhero film. It had a typical comic book superhero film plot (there is a bad guy/girl, there is a good guy/girl, the bad guy/girl kills, kills the loved ones of, or maims the innocent good guy/girl, the good guy/girl forms an alter-ego with super powers and uses them to destroy the guilty bad guy/girl), it had a positive message about female empowerment, finding your own voice, and a female who did not necessarily choose a male and a relationship with a male over her own independence (how dare Halle relate what she has learned from her own life experiences!), and my 5 year old niece understood and loved it. There was no sex, gratuitous nudity, or graphic violence that I felt would necessitate explanation. There was even a little anthropology lesson about Bast, an ancient Egyptian cat goddess. When I think of how dark, dingy, and disgusting all the \"Batman\" films were, how sappy and sickening the \"Spiderman\" films were, how unwatchable \"Phantom\", \"The Shadow\", \"Unbreakable\", \"The Hulk\", and \"Daredevil\" (need I go on?) were, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by \"Catwoman\", it was better than expected. And what is wrong with marketing a comic book superhero movie for little girls? What is wrong with little girls having a comic book super heroine to look up to? Why does a comic book superhero film necessarily have to be marketed to adult comic book enthusiasts? Have we forgotten that most of us began reading comic books as children and that, except for a small counter-culture of adult enthusiasts, it really is a child's realm of imagination? I happen to like Halle Berry. When I look back at how far she has come with her acting career, from playing a stripper opposite Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans in \"The Last Boy Scout\" or a crack addict opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Wesley Snipes in \"Jungle Fever\" to producing and starring in \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge\" (my own childhood heroine as well as hers)and standing on the Academy Awards stage accepting the Oscar for \"Monster's Ball\" with the most tear jerking speech I have every heard given at the Academy Awards, I am exceptionally proud.In an industry where a woman of color has never won \"Best Actress\" ever until 2001 and where there was an eleven year gap since the last woman of color won \"Best Supporting Actress\", Halle Berry is a small miracle. The reviews of \"Catwoman\" have nothing to do with how good or bad the film actually is and everything to do with who or what it is popular to bash at the moment. Its all about who is the flavor of the month.",

            "content": "Catwoman is a movie that has nothing to do whatsoever with the Batman universe. This stand alone movie could have easily been a contender to be decent and it was hyped to be one of the biggest movies of 2004, however the end result is an epic failure. Apart from the nonsensical plot, take away the dark themes of the movie and this could have easily been aimed at children.In this disaster of a movie, Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips (who has no place in the Catwoman/Batman universe), a meek and shy graphic designer for Hedare Beauty run by the husband and wife team George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone). When Patience inadvertently stumbles upon a corporate conspiracy the company is hiding, Laurel Hedare order Patience killed. When she almost drowns in a drain, she is mysteriously brought back to life by a cat and Patience is transformed into an wild and untamed woman with cat like abilities. With her newfound transformation Patience becomes Catwoman, a sleek and stealthy creature balancing on the thin line between good and bad.Halle Berry was terrible in this movie. I was in disbelief that Halle Berry would appear in this rubbish. Catwoman also saw the beginning of the end of Halle Berry's career, particularly after she was riding high from the success of X Men (2000), Swordfish (2001) her landmark Academy Award winning role for best actress in Monster's Ball (2001), and the coveted role as a James Bond girl alongside Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day (2002). Since the box office failure of Catwoman, Halle Berry's career has never recovered. And Sharon Stone as the lead villain could not even salvage her career with an awful performance. Sharon Stone's glory days are well and truly over and her performances in Total Recall (1990), Basic Instinct (1992) and Casino (1995) seems like a distant memory. I was shocked that screen writing team John Brancato and Michael Ferris were involved in this atrocity. They both certainly have done better work in their career with The Game (1997), Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), Terminator Salvation (2009) and Surrogates (2009). Director Pitof has also disappeared without a trace from Hollywood.When I will think of Catwoman/Selina Kyle I will always think of Michelle Pfeiffer who immortalised Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992). Recently Anne Hathaway turned in an excellent performance with her take on Catwoman/Selina Kyle in The Dark Knight Rises, and for TV audiences Camren Bicondova plays a young Selina Kyle in the 2014 television series Gotham. Rewinding to the Batman TV series (1966-1968) and the movie (1966) , Catwoman was played by Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether and Eartha Kitt respectively. The 2004 version of Catwoman should be banished forever from existence.Catwoman is so bad it complements kitty litter. No wonder this deserved the title of being the worst movie of 2004.1/10.",

            "content": "A General Warning: Spoilers Ahead.This movie numbers among some of the worst I've seen. It is by no means a good movie, although it might by some means be considered somewhat entertaining. Had this movie been worse, it might actually have been better. There is a large list of \"Awesomely Bad\" movies, movies that were made so terribly, and yet so seriously, that they are more worthy to watch than most other movies because of how hilarious the creators' efforts are. Among the most notable of these movies are Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988), They Live (1988), the animated version of Return of the King (1980) and Army of Darkness (1993). Catwoman, however, is just barely, just ever so slightly, better than they are, and subsequently made all the worse than they are.There are so many things wrong with this movie, although one this the vast majority of reviewers (ranging from those who gave this movie 10 stars to those who gave it only 1) agree upon, and that is that this is not Catwoman in the truest sense. This is not Selina Kyle, the aristocratic cat burglar. This is Patience What's-her-face, a wanna-be artist working for a cosmetics company who is killed, revived, and gains superpowers.The plot itself is absolutely ridiculous. An evil businesswoman gets superpowers from years of using a toxic face-cream, and wants to flood the market with it, that will cause women to deform. After all, what could possibly be worse than being ugly? At any rate, they say that the cream will only deform you if you stop using it, and if it works as well as it obviously does, then who would really stop using it, especially when they went through all of the trouble to explain that it's addictive? And, further, how'd this stuff ever pass the FDA? Seli---no---Patience's costume borders on ridiculous, being, from as far as I can tell, open-toed sandals, leather pants, an unflatteringly-cheap cat-mask and a bra. The effectiveness of the whip is somewhat laughable. It seems to move on its own whims, not taking into account the actions of Catwoman, and seems to change lengths as is convenient. I must admit, though, that the diamond-clawed gloves were a nice touch.The acting, honestly, wasn't really that bad. Bratt plays the same role, though, that I always see him in, a cop. He played it in Law & Order, he played it in Demolition man, and he played it in Miss Congeniality. He plays it well, as always, but he seriously lacks for role diversification. But that's another matter entirely. Halle Berry was probably the best choice for Catwoman, although her talents are wasted in the role (and she truly earned her Razzie in this role). The rest of the acting was standard.The romance was horribly contrived, clich\u00e9d and, I felt, insulting. We never get near enough to the characters to really care if they're together or not, and when they lead separate lives at the end of the movie in a way that was obviously intended to be sad and touching, I can't see many people caring, especially after we get the same situation better done in Spider-Man (2002). I felt that throughout the movie the writers were constantly trying to force the two together, with everything from a sensuous game of one-on-one, to huddling together in a conveniently-timed rain-shower to cornering each other in, ironically, a catwalk.The crazy-cat-lady was an obvious plot-device meant only to explain what had happened, and move Berry along on her way. The woman says as soon as Berry comes with the cat that she (the cat) had never brought anybody home before. And yet, in the next scene with her, she makes goes to great length to show that she was not the only one Midnight brought back and gave renewed life to.To be entirely honest, my dog seemed to like this movie better than I did. Whenever Catwoman would jump around on building tops my dog would run around the room and bark excitedly. Honestly, I thought that she was having a blast.This movie is a contrived train-wreck designed to cash-in on the recent successes of both the Spider-Man, Hulk and X-Men films. It's substandard and mediocre in every way, and I would only recommend it to people who have nothing to do late at night and don't mind (very) cheap entertainment. Although I do agree with the comment that this might eventually become a huge cult-film. Until then, however, I suggest that it be avoided if possible.",

The reported budget of 85 million is way over the top, especially since special effects certainly DID NOT cost anywhere near that amount. Heh, i guess the cast got their pieces of the pie. You can't expect much from Halle Berry in this type of role but worn out Sharon Stone ( as a bad girl ) and Benjamin Bratt ( as Catwoman's/Patience's love interest ) are so bad that they don't even deserve words. Above all those \"minor\" flaws, we have director from France who signs his films as Pitof :). Man, even I wouldn't be so stupid to hand 85 million bucks into the hands of an anti talent whose only and greatest achievement prior to this was horrendous french movie Vidocq ( friendly advice : don't see it ). All in all, I wasn't expecting much from Catwoman but despite all the bad critics decided to see it. What a mistake that was...Halle, if you see this post, show compassion and return my $8.75.

Warner directives, again, making the wrong choices.More specifically that is is a piece of cheese, is that they changed the character and environment way too much to make it appealing to a younger public, which is quite an insult to anyone else that actually knows and has follow the character through the years.Even more specifically, we have horrible dialogs, overuse of CGI, a very lousy and simplistic story, HORRIBLE costume design (not saying Halle Berry is not nice to look at, more if she's half naked, but this is quite a pathetic design, the mask is so big that I was wondering how she keeps the balance jumping around), two or three shameful, embarrassing scenes (specially the basketball one, I had to pause it because I couldn't take it in a single go, I almost vomit, seriously) and I'm probably missing some more bad aspects but this is definitely getting too long.Overall a so-bad-it's-hard-to-watch movie that, if it has ANY supporters, I'm pretty sure it's guys that like watching Halle Berry shaking her beauty, but for me, that doesn't even get close to make a good movie, not this kind of movie, at least.",

Instead, she must endure day after day of thankless work for those who reap millions in the business of artificially erasing the signs of age. When she stumbles upon a nasty secret (the company's latest product has the unfortunate side effects of being mortally addictive as well as causing gruesome disfigurement) she is summarily dispatched. That would be the end of the story except for the intervention of a mystical cat. The screenwriters deserve kudos from this cat-lover for introducing at this point elements of the myths of Bast, the Egyptian Goddess depicted in the form of a cat, and the tradition of the cats that made their homes in Her temples. Bast was and is often regarded as a protectress of women; it makes perfect sense that one of Her cats comes to the rescue of the protagonist and grants her both another shot at life and feline abilities such as surefootedness, elasticity, and a taste for bright baubles and tuna. While some may regard this material as not worthy of a movie starring an Academy Award winner, I am glad that big bucks were spent on a story that pays homage to a dear animal and Deity.",

And just by watching this movie alone, I can see he's not ready to produce movies. And what proves all this is the stuff he can think of such as an unbearable written story. The action is dull and uninteresting to watch. The villain twist has no sense of surprises. The characters are all unlikable. And Halle Berry has given a really awkward performance. Along with low quality editing that feels out of place, like the CGI cats. Please if you're like me and truly a Batman fan, do not watch this film unless if you want to see what a train wreck in a superhero movie style looks like.

This film needs to die a horrible death so Hollywood can get with the program and stop making so much junk that panders to the bottom level of moviegoers.I could have made 100 great films for what this tripe cost in P&A budget alone.",

            "content": "CATWOMAN has achieved the lowest standards of film-making possible; I asked myself whilst watching this film \"Is it even feasible to get away with making a film so mediocre?\" Its insipid, abounding with clich\u00e9s, absolutely empty of character, depth or anything remotely stunning and exceptional. The film's supposed saviour is the use of antagonistic,nails-driving-through-your-brain annoying hip-hop music and the personage of the 'b****' that people seem to find so attractive nowadays. Halle Berry proves that she's just a Hollywood mannequin with no exceptional talent. Ugh...the entire film was just the most repulsive, statement-making piece of filthy trash that I have ever seen. To begin with, the most irritating aspect of this film is the fact that some brainless moron out there thinks he has the right to take somebody else's character and mutate her to the heaviest extremity- SELENA KYLE is the true CATWOMAN, a tortured, slightly insane woman whose motivation was human hatred and self-destruction- PATIENCE PHILIPS is a timid little nobody who thinks that graduating from Art College makes her an artist, and whose 'cat woman' alter ego is in all senses nothing more than a hip-hop b**** in a dominatrix costume. Tim Burton/Michelle Pfieffer's 'Cat Woman' was a genuinely dark, sensual and believable character compared to this abomination. So we're expected to believe that there is such thing as a magical,presumably immortal cat who can boost a woman's ego just by breathing on her? Wow-what an almighty gift that this cat Midnight gives to Patience! The cat breathes on her...and what happens? Nothing. She just transforms from shrinking violet into bully-girl b****, and thats considered to be a super heroine power??? So being the almighty, sacred Catwoman entails utterly deliberate, completely unnecessary, conceited, rampant, sexually desperate behaviour? Since when did cats practise these characteristics? If behaving like the stereotype 'cat' human is considered to be a power, then why aren't mentally ill people considered to be sexy and heroic? The only 'power' Catwoman has is the power that all 21st century women have, which is the power of free will, only not all free women dress up in disgusting fetish costumes pretending to be a cat, treating people like dirt! There was no motive to this character other than the fact that it is considered cool to be a b**** nowadays. Its the only indication of female power that modern audiences understand, whereas being a b**** and being brave are two entirely different things.The old woman who explained everything to Patience is clearly a cat-fixated maniac; she irritated the Hell out of me with her twitchy, whiskery face and her staring, cat-fixated behaviour; ooh blimey the old lady surrounded by the cats with the sound of sickly, wet, desperate meowing echoing all around, with the sacred, ancient history, the terrible deadly line of the rampant, nasty cat b****es!!! So all great and powerful femininity stems from being a b****? I DON'T THINK SO. GET REAL!!!! This cat woman is entirely unlovable; a motiveless hip-hop b**** with the ultimate attitude problem, more a mentally ill dominatrix than a heroine. She's out for nobody but herself and her bland little career; she gets \"flushed down the pipes\" and we're all meant to feel terrible for her, like some terrible injustice has been done to her (by the way, I was laughing my head off when she got \"flushed down the pipes\") and the ending is clearly supposed to be something special, the bulky-bottomed, bulky-breasted b**** just struts off into an unrealistically huge moon, whipping her stupid whip with the hip hop blaring! B**** B**** B**** B**** B****!!!!!!!!!I didn't think it was possible to make a film this pathetic and weak and stupid until I saw this; AVOID!!!! And another thing is that Sharon Stone is practically portraying herself and her midlife crisis... \"I was everything they wanted me to be; I was never too beautiful, never too powerful, and then I turned 40 and they threw me in the trash.\" It says a lot about her own career, wouldn't you say?",

The special effect are very good & are complemented with great soundtrack. As for Halle Berry, I think she was a great choice for the role of Catwoman: her plastic movements & expressive eyes are relevant additions to her great acting.The film features some very impressive fighting sequences, though the story in general is too straightforward & predictable with only two rather primitive story lines. The direction is also far from being perfect, to put it mildly, cause Pitof, whoever it is, definitely has problems with sense of time. Plus, the camera zooms in on Halle Berry's ass so often throughout the movie, that, I still don't know why, but it is becoming annoying.What the movie lacks is depth & meaning, otherwise it is a good action. Despite all the bad write ups & negative comments, I went to see the movie & I'm not sorry. Great Halle Berry's acting, breathtaking special effects, outstanding director of photography's job & catchy soundtrack makes Catwoman a sweet eye-candy, worth watching at least once.",

I have to say that the drubbing the critics gave it did it a favor, at least when it comes to myself and the group I saw it with.  We'd all heard how much it sucked, so we weren't expecting much.  But we were pleasantly surprised. \nSure there were some plot holes and the CGI was pretty obvious, but Halle Berry played a very likable character--and she definitely had her sexy strut down.  When Catwoman wanted to kick butt, she did it with flair.And I've got to tell you, I didn't get the feeling that the movie makers took the movie too seriously.  Watching an ignorant Patience rubbing catnip all over her face in the throes of feline ecstasy and then a few minutes later trying to deal with why she'd done it was pretty funny.  And you gotta love her method of dealing with obnoxious neighbors.If you want to pick the movie apart, there's definitely plenty of room in this flick.  But if you're willing to just go along for the ride, it's a fun one.  The storyline probably could've been better, but I enjoyed the Patience/Catwoman character and I'd be willing to check out another film about her.  Whatever problems there were in this flick, Berry's character was engaging and entertaining.  I will be buying the DVD when it comes out.",

Her portrayal of the character is just awful, although it could in large part be the fault of the screenplay. She deserved better.The supporting characters are one-dimensional and not worth caring about, and the villains (the main one played by Sharon Stone) are boring.I'm not a huge fan of CGI, and this film has some of the worst I've ever seen. The action scenes are stupid, the script is weak, and the plot has many elements that don't even make sense.This film definitely isn't worth sinking your teeth into.

            "content": "SPOILERS ALL THROUGH! A woman is out for revenge on whoever left her dead. In one scene, Patience Phillips is shown wearing a yellow tracksuit. In another, she wears leather while driving a motorcycle. In many of the fight scenes, people's punches and kicks make audible whooshing sounds, and they run up walls, in clear homage to Hong Kong wuxia movies. The best fight in the movie is woman-woman -- or should I say a \"catfight?\" And Sharon Stone's fight double is Zoe Bell, who so adeptly doubled for Uma Thurman in both volumes of \"Kill Bill.\" However, there any resemblance to the Tarantino movies ends.Tarantino, for example, knows how to edit a fight sequence. Pitof does not. Nor, for that matter, sex scenes, nor scenes of extremely elite cops computer-comparing lip prints. (I'm sorry. I am a woman. I have worn lipstick. And you would have to press VERY carefully, and fairly slowly, to create a print as perfect as that allegedly left on Benjamin Britton's cheek.) He could do with some help framing shots that are not about \"OMG sexy leading lady!\" as well. In fact, the only sequence I can fairly call well-composed is that in which Patience, having been pushed off an indoor balcony by Ophelia and having landed safely and noiselessly on all fours (I have cats, too, and even cats go thud when they jump to a surface below them), stares at a shower of pictures of previous Catwomen (yes, yes, including Michelle Pfeiffer), and is framed perfectly as Ophelia calls down to her from above. Yet even that is spoiled by Pitof's cinematographic ADHD.Uma Thurman was also costumed with a certain practicality, and, well. What the HELL are those things wrapped across Halle's middle? Suspenders to hold up her falling-down, well-ventilated pants? Must the back straps on the bra part look like tribal tattoos from last century? The contrast in the final fight sequence (literally a \"boss fight\") between Halle in black and Stone in off-white is nice, but about as subtle as a cat who jumps on the newspaper you're reading.I agree with those who have said that the music utterly sucks; that the crappy CGI almost qualifies this as a direct-to-Xbox release (the only time in my life, dear reader, that I have thought Jar Jar Binks was better than a comparable element in a different movie); that the dialogue is so bad one suspects George Lucas was brought in as a script doctor; and that the female-empowerment theme doesn't entirely cohere -- one commenter mentioned this Catwoman as a positive role model for her daughters, but I wonder if she really wants them thieving jewelry or having wild, back-clawing sex on the first date. I also agree that the Patience-saves-the-kid sequence on the Ferris wheel is gratuitous and works too hard to build audience sympathy for the heroine -- Halle should be doing that. Too often, she doesn't. Even as Patience rather than Catwoman, she has none of the hurt and vulnerability that underlay Michelle Pfeiffer's performance.Not that this movie is 100% crap. If you approach it with the same level of expectation you would the aforementioned chop-socky genre, and forget the Batman continuity altogether, you can distract yourself with it for a little while. It's just that things like having a former model with a surname pronounced \"head-air,\" who is married to a man with a godawful Eurotrash accent who is the least menacing evil conspirator on screen... the damn cats, especially the one with the stinky magic breath, are more menacing than the former Merovingian. So, come to think of it, is Sharon Stone's deservedly maligned haircut. So all in all, I'm glad I saw this one on cable.",

            "content": "Not only is Catwoman not a disaster, it's not even the worst superhero film of the year. Not that Catwoman is particularly great, but it's not as bad as everyone is saying, and in fact, it's fairly average. That's not an accomplishment, but for a film that should have by all rights been a disaster, it's a bit of a surprise.Halle Berry, of course, stars as Patience Phillips, whose introduction and storyline largely follows the territory Tim Burton laid down over a decade ago with his take on the character; Patience is a shlep who is under-confident and under-appreciated (as if someone looking like Halle Berry could turn out that way) and whose best friend Sally (Alex Borstein) always has to push her into everything. Together they work for Hedare cosmetics, run by George Hedare (Lambert Wilson, the guy who played the Merovingian in the bad Matrix films) and his bitch of a wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone). Much like in Burton's version, Patience finds out something she's not supposed to and takes an unfortunate spill that ends her life. Of course she's brought back to life by some sort of cat-magic (it's explained in the movie) and becomes the feral, ferocious Catwoman.Though it's a bit of a stretch to see Berry playing a frump, I have to congratulate whoever did her hair and makeup, because her varying looks fit the character's state of mind perfectly, and she seems just at home playing wimpy Patience as she does over-the-top Catwoman. Stone to me is the single most piece of ironic casting in ages; she plays a model who's being pushed aside due to her age and is desperate not to be put out to pasture. You'll also find some genre faces in some bit roles \u0096 Peter Wingfield miscast and strapped with an American accent as a scientist, and the Asian guy from Earth: Final Conflict as one of Stone's stooges. And of course, there's leading man Ben Bratt, playing Detective Tom Lone, who at least has the good manners to be interested in Prentice before she dons her dominatrix gear.Borstein and Berry get on well, and there is some real chemistry between Berry and Bratt, a warmth there that makes their flirtation believable. Catwoman swipes a scene from Daredevil, when Patience and Tom play hoops; it reminds you of the Matt/Elektra sparring scene at the playground, but this one's more fun and displays a lot more chemistry. In fact, the movie is pretty enjoyable right up until they decide that Berry has to dress like a stripper and act like a whore \u0096 and there Catwoman goes right out the window. No matter how you try to play the character (and Berry tosses subtlety aside in a flash), the Catwoman outfit is so outrageously stupid that it is simply impossible to take seriously. That Berry chooses a few times to try to channel Eartha Kitt \u0096 possibly the worst choice for a screen Catwoman ever \u0096 doesn't help things (any acting choice made to emulate any performance on the old Batman TV show is just a bad idea in general). The outfit single-handedly kills the film, though admittedly the crazy CGI stunts don't help much. The action is also wildly over the top, with Catwoman hopping around the place with greater speed and agility than Spiderman. Actually it's a shame, because those involved went to a great deal of trouble to draft a cogent mythology for the character, even down to the silly mask she wears, and they spent a fair amount of time trying to establish the bipolarity of Catwoman (a trait I've never cared for, but it is often a part of the character). The attempt at post-modern feminism is absurd, but a fair amount of work was put into this film in an attempt to establish a mythology (and probably a franchise). I was even impressed by the cosmetics company design work, because it was so terribly close to what real ones are like (and it was frustrating to think they had done so much with production design and dropped the ball on the most important costume in the entire movie).Most of the acting is okay. Borstein always seems like she's having a good time, and Bratt plays a slightly warmer version of his Law and Order character. But he's a very likable guy, and you can see why Patience (or any woman) would be drawn to him. Stone overdoes it a little, but really, when has she not? The irony of casting her as a former model who has turned to stone (almost literally) to me far outweighs any problems with her performance, which are minor in any case. Berry herself overdoes the Catwoman vamp, and I wish she hadn't, because this might have actually been a wholly enjoyable film if she had reigned it in a little.Catwoman is not a terrible film, though it misses its audience by a mile; it was obviously aimed at young women, but with that Striperella outfit, it's going to attract more men than gals. Actually I preferred it to the much more popular Spiderman 2; while this lacks a performance anywhere near Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, at least here the romance works, and much like Spiderman 2, a lot of the plot hinges on being able to buy into that. You can see some heat with Berry and Bratt; Dunst and Maguire sometimes seem like they filmed separately and were paired only in editing. Catwoman's probably going to be forgotten (or on deep discount on DVD by the end of the year), which is maybe not a fate wholly undeserved, but I've seen many worse films this summer. I can't really recommend this, but I can't tell you to stay away, either. All I can tell you is that it's being unfairly maligned by a viewing public who championed two films of monumental mediocrity masquerading as fun to the tune of almost a billion dollars this summer; you do the math.",

I've never been the biggest Halle-fan, but I think she does a quite believable presentation of the shy Patience Williams - shy, timid, cute.....and extremely beautiful without knowing it - where of course, Catwoman, is the meer opposite - kinky, wild, sexy like hell - but again, it works....a lot of cheesy one-liners, sure, but it WORKS..Thing that stuck to me, however, is the fact that this film could almost halfway have been written over the script of \"The Crow (1994)\", it's almost simply a female reshoot...of course, this doesn't match up to the \"The Crow\" at all, but there are incredibly many similarities...watch it to see what I mean....Still a decent film for sure..I don't know why people make such a fuss over this being that bad, cause it's really NOT.

The critics do have some ground to stand on, however. It did not make the grade for a great movie for several reasons. The main character changes greatly through the movie but these changes are not explored or explained so they seem very disconnected. The rest of the characters were rather hollow and clich\u00e9d. You might expect this from the film's comic book origin but movie goers have come to expect more.The CGI Catwoman was very obviously CGI and was rather intrusive. The animation was jerky, did not maintain constancy of form and contained movements not natural to the universe or character.I am puzzled as to why the producers felt it necessary to change the name and origin of the character.

            "content": "With the bar set high by the \"Spider-Man\" and \"X-Men\" franchises, today there is a certain expectation for movie adaptations of comic books. \"Catwoman\" fails to live up to the simple expectation that such a movie be more entertaining than \"Daredevil.\" It is as if the filmmakers simply stopped thinking beyond the concept of \"Halle Berry in a catsuit,\" and could not be bothered to fit around her an engaging story, a memorable villain, or colorful supporting characters. And most toxic of all is Berry's performance itself.Nearly a decade ago another film similarly tried to coast on the sex appeal of its central character. While \"Barb Wire\" did bomb at the box office, it nonetheless offered up entertainment. Pamela Anderson, as the title character, displayed little acting talent; as a walking, talking caricature, however, she thoroughly infected the movie with trashy appeal. Her utterly guileless line-readings even made the deadly dialogue spring to life. (\"Don't call me 'Babe'!\")Neither blessed (nor cursed) with Anderson's larger-than-life persona, Berry turns in an earnest performance not so distinguishable from her \"Storm\" in the \"X-Men\" movies, minus some garments. Whereas there she blended in as part of an ensemble, Berry's blandness is brought front and center here. Oscar-winning performance not withstanding, Berry's lack of range renders her transformation from timid Patience Phillips to Catwoman a mere cosmetic costume change from dowdy to S&M; she displays no matching inner change, aside from playing up some cattiness. And this exposes a fundamental weakness in the casting of Berry as Catwoman: instead of a transformation of a girl into a woman, the girl remains, only playing dress-up. The role required an actress who could project the sly, worldly adultness of previous Catwomen Eartha Kitt and Michelle Pfeiffer.But then again, with nothing else in place to prop up the central character, even better-suited actresses would be hard-pressed to transcend this material. Sharon Stone, as the villain, here lacks the charisma she brought to \"Basic Instinct,\" \"Total Recall,\" or even episodes of \"The Practice.\" Benjamin Bratt ends up almost as anonymous as the rest of the supporting characters. And the only thing director Pitof brings to the table with semblance a comic book is his name.Successful comic books achieve the illusion of fluidity from panel to panel. In \"Catwoman\" the effect is the exact opposite: The movie always feels oddly static, as if entire scenes are stuck in singular panels. Fittingly enough, \"Catwoman\" never seems intended to be anything more than the movie equivalent of a Maxim magazine photo spread. And the costume itself reflects this entirely: Ill-suited for fighting, and made to fall off during a pillow fight at a soft-core slumber party.",

The visuals were good and so was the acting. I came to the theater with no expectation and enjoyed it because of that. It's not a deep movie and it isn't trying to be. Cat lovers Enjoy! Dog Lovers, I think you'll like this movie as well. Halle is one sexy kitten and brings a fresh feel to the character of Catwoman. She does seem to borrow certain mannerisms from past actors who played Catwoman, but she also shows that she was up to the challenge and comes across with a solid performance. The camera work was a bit over done and most of the time you could tell of the computer generated images of Catwoman doing her cat like moves. Even certain fight scenes seemed a bit awkward at times. Sharon's Stone's performance could have been better, but she was playing a vengeful, ex-model, who was being tossed aside for a younger beauty. How deep can you go when your playing a shallow character to begin with?",

            "content": "I know, I know, almost NO ONE liked this movie. It's completely understandable why.I can get over the fact that this is not the Catwoman we know and love from the Batman series (Selina Kyle) this is a new entity. Patience has superhuman abilities, cat-like reflexes, blah, blah, blah, where as Selina is more or less a human being. But this movie just sucks. There's no way around it.First, there's the costume. The initial \"night out\" where Patience wears the full leather suit with just the little mask over her eyes, THAT would have been fine. But then she puts on the ridiculous outfit she wears throughout the rest of the movie. High heels that would give anyone wearing them for more than ten minutes blisters the size of pancakes, basically a leather bra that any adversary could open by cutting the tiny string holding it together in the middle, and to top it all off a huge, pointed-ears helmet thing that is just plain lame. Whoever was in charge of costumes should be publically shot. Anyone who took it upon themselves to fight crime would never wear anything like that, it's just nonsense. Not to mention the fact that they never show her fashioning this hideous thing. She just sort of shows up in it.Second is the directing. Pitof should be shot along with the costume designer. Every shot flies by your face before you can see what's going on, and the performances from very capable actors and actresses fell flat -- the job of the director is to coax good performances from his/her actors. I'm wondering if Pitof was even present for filming. An intern could have done a better job with the direction.Third are the fight scenes. I didn't go into this film expecting much, but at the very least I expected decent fight scenes, especially considering all the hype about how the used capoiera and all that. I don't think Halle Berry did a single fight scene herself. Everything was CGI, a fact that left me disappointed after Spider Man as well. I want to see the actor WORK for their millions of dollars, is that so much to ask? Disappointing fight scenes.Fourth, the script. Was there a script? Was there a screenwriter? If so, he/she should be shot as well. We know it's a movie about a catwoman, but does she really need to say \"purrrfect\"? Come on now. And then asking a question and before the guy can answer grabbing his tongue and saying \"cat got your tongue?\" Please!I urge you, do not see this movie. If you do, you will be severely disappointed by some tried and true actors. Why is it that whenever an actress wins an Oscar she has to go on and do a HORRIBLE action movie?!The only thing that was slightly interesting was the whole \"Catwoman Legacy\" about past women who have inherited the helm and gone on the fight crime, save the world, etc. A nice touch, but the movie is as a whole unwatchable and I really hope Halle does something a little better in her next film.",

            "content": "Having read many horrendous \"reviews\" of Catwoman, I felt obliged to judge the movie from an objective viewpoint, if such a view was possible given all the negativity it engendered from sniping critics.After watching Catwoman I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as bad as critics said it was. The film isn't brilliant or as inspired as the first Spider-man in terms of digital effects and storytelling, but it holds it own, during its best scenes as a distinctively feminine/feline action film. Using the duality between passivity and aggression for Berry's character, Patience Phillips, and her feline alter-ego, Catwoman, was a shrewd move that invested the story with a moral ambiguity but the film itself is too shallow to properly explore what it sets up as Catwoman's conflicting inner core. Berry plays the docile Patience Phillips with a fragility only she could do; while her sexuality, which so many critics derided as non-existent, is brought to the fore with her highly seductive Catwoman in S&M attire. Rather than play Catwoman as solely as campy cartoon character, Berry exudes a typically feline sexuality - wily, sometimes amoral and vivacious. Moreover, she underscores her Catwoman voice with a gentle but suggestive cat-like intensity that is both alluring and slightly vampire-like in its soft undertone. I think it was very unfair that she was maligned by critics for this role. She was clearly an inspired choice - as was Sharon Stone, who plays Catwoman's nemesis but she isn't used enough in the final cut of the film. The deleted scenes on the DVD reveals more scenes with Stone and it's a pity she wasn't given more screen time. In the scenes she has, Stone is back in fine camp form playing a faded model-wife of the owner of a corrupt cosmetics company, played in a wonderfully camp performance by French actor Lambert Wilson. Wilson, it is fair to say, has the best lines, especially in his taut exchanges with his unhinged wife and his model mistress. Stone's delivery is self-consciously \"wooden\" in a good way. She probably knew the limitations of the script but she uses the somewhat wooden nature of her lines as a pastiche of the genre itself. Stone provides a striking counterpoint to Catwoman; she's a post-feminist villain whose vanity is as much a crime as her murderous deeds. Many have said the effects are not as sophisticated as recent films. In some night scenes Catwoman's exaggerated movements are very cartoon-like - yet this criticism could also be leveled at Spider-man 1 and 2, where it is fairly obvious digital effects are at hand. In this sense, it seems unjust to criticize the effects in Catwoman as being out-dated. Some fight scenes have a wonderful intensity, and thankfully the film avoids slow-motion Matrix-style acrobatics. The final \"bitch\" fight is certainly worth the wait for fans of Dynastyesque cat fights.What doesn't work? Benjamin Bratt as the romantic lead is awful. He has zero charisma and his scenes with Berry are embarrassingly bad, especially the scene playing basketball and in the fairground. Had these awful scenes been deleted I think Catwoman would have been a better film. Pitof - go back to the editing room now.Sadly there won't be a sequel even if the film's climax suggests that was the intention. I hope this film becomes a cult classic. Catwoman- Resurrection here we come....or perhaps the director's cut minus Bratt.",

It spat in the face of the real character created by DC comics and it's a shame for the world of superheroes. First of all, the special effects are awful, there's no way that the real Catwoman makes all those climbs and jumps exactly like Spider-man does. And by the way, the references to the spider-man movies are obvious and though it is a totally different character from another comic book. WHY??? Secondly, the acting is terrible. Not only Halle Berry, but for me the guy who plays the cop is the worst. I don't remember so far having seen a single emotion on his face and he just doesn't look like a real cop on the first look. So overall I could bring so many bad things about this movie but I'm just gonna say that the plot is just uninteresting and the story boring. There you go, that's my review.",

            "content": "and that is what you get when you watch Catwoman. Personally, I don't really care that this movie is not based on the original Selina Kyle character, because I never knew much about her anyway. So big deal, though I can understand why fan boys will be upset. so why not something different? Well firstly, let's cut to the chase. Who cares if Catwoman is not white! Halle Berry is a fine actress and deserved a chance to play Catwoman. However, in terms of her performance in this movie, her acting gets a bit sloppy when she is in the catwoman suit. Her character becomes this over the top sexy woman who cracks the whip too many times and who is given a laughable script and plot line to lead this movie.Yes, my main problem with this movie is how silly the plot is. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips (how they hell they come up with an absurd name such as Patience is anyone's guess) who is a shy, timid woman who works in a company that makes beauty products. When she overhears a secret in a new product called Beau Line and that if you use it, your face will deteriorate unless you keep using it, she is killed, then resurrected by some CGI cat, which is very obviously CGI. Now she has superpowers such as leaping from building to building, walking up walls like a cat and very clear vision.**********MINOR SPOILER*************** OK, the villain in this movie, Laurel Hadare (Sharon Stone). I don't have a problem with Sharon Stone, but for one thing, she doesn't really have a superpower that can match Catwoman's abilities. Her ridiculous strength is having a face like stone because she has used that beau line product for years. Hence she can't feel pain. Ha ha ha ha ha. When she says the line in the movie in the climatic fight 'skin like living marble...and you can't feel a thing!' it is just plain ridiculous. And Catwoman is knocking the crap out of her and hitting not just her face but her legs and everything. I mean did Laurel apply the cream on her whole body as well? How come she can't feel pain in those other areas? It is really that absurd.The editing in this movie is overdone. One of Catwoman's fight scenes with a guy outside a night club has probably over 40 images edited together so you can't follow the action properly. What's more, the action scenes are totally devoid of suspense or good choreography that it feels more like they made it up on the spot.The soundtrack of the film is alright. I did like how they used the music but at other times the film feels more like a music video sometimes. The best scene is where Catwoman is walking and the camera slowly reveals her in her costume to the song 'whose in Control?' Benjamin Bratt who plays the cop and love interest seems a bit wooden and flat, and there doesn't seem to be a spark between him and Halle. I think they could have picked someone a bit better.The character development of Catwoman is also not done very well because Patience seems to accept her being Catwoman very quickly before really coming to turns with her new identity. At times, it almost feels like she has a personality disorder and can't control who she is.So this movie does have some fun moments and you really have to turn your brain off to enjoy this movie, otherwise you will just see how stupid the plot, script and in particular some of the lines given from Halle Berry are. It should have been a really more in depth movie.What we know is that Patience is not the only Catwoman out there. She is in a line of previous women who were once catwomen, thus if a sequel had been made, she could possibly have met up with one of the other catwomen and teamed up or something. But that is never going to happen since they didn't do a good job with this one. Oh well, nice try guys.This isn't the worst movie ever, there are so much worse. I think this was harshly criticised but it makes sense when you think about it. If you're going to take a character well known such as Catwoman on a $100 million budget and not do much with it that is unique or groundbreaking, then why bother? Halle Berry really should have thought about this before she took on the role. And she does try her best, but since she is trying to be both good and bad in terms of the nature of her character, we don't really see the bad side.To the writers - for your next movie, please please do not make it about face cream whatever you do!",

Likewise Halle who with the right role is one of the finest actresses around.Catwoman also needed to be an attractive, sexy person who \"looked the part\".

My expectations were low as I already knew of the bad publicity this film received during its release. Not all is bad here still there is plenty of room for improvement. I don't think the material is overly great for the actors to work with at the time yet it's probably more relevant nowadays in comparison. Many women do in fact have cosmetic surgical adjustment more than ever in todays times highlighting their insecurities and removing age lines. The point story is very one dimensional though coming off more like a romantic comedy than a fully devoted comic book adaption. Halle Berry isn't to blame for what i see as a poor depiction of Catwoman; the character development is poor here. There isn't a whole lot of obstacles for our main protagonist to have a reason for being Catwoman she just more or less stumbles upon it! By chance she comes across information she shouldn't have and bingo, through no fault of her own she is in danger. I don't think any of the actors were bad however with the material they were working with it is really hard to sell this concept. It appeared to be a movie that didn't know quite what it was. Do we go dark? Should she have a love interest? Or shall we go full on chick flick with this? Nobody seemed to fully invest into one idea so it became a movie that just didn't seem to work.

That was nearly three years ago, since that time I have seen this movie three times, and each of those three times I have unfortunately been left feeling cheated after seeing it. You see the movie Catwoman basically takes the character of Catwoman that I loved, dumps her into a bizarrely ridiculous universe revolving around make-up, gives her one of the most ludicrous costumes to date, and to top it all off just ruins every likable aspect of her character. So what's so bad about it? The action? The performances? The story? Well if I'm honest I'm not sure, the action has its moments despite hardly being amazing, the performances range from half decent from Halle Berry to stupid, Lambert Wilson, to just the plain horrifically ludicrously nasty performance by Sharon Stone. The story could have worked I suppose if given the proper treatment, even though the story about the main villain being evil because she isn't the front page girl anymore just never could work. No the biggest problem is the the fact that the script and direction basically mutilates this movie. This might have scraped mediocre had the camera bothered to stay still for two seconds and the dialogue been devoid of some of the worst clunkers in cinema history! Catwoman herself is a great character, and thankfully Halle Berry manages to make a terrible script not sound awful. Why she received the Razzie for Worst Actress is beyond me as she really does still have moments to shine. After she gets past the pathetic whimpering girl stage early on in the movie and gets serious she works very well. Of course her romance with Benjamin Bratt's policeman could never work, the pair have no chemistry and Bratt seemingly the charisma of a gnat. In fact the scenes where them two do a weird basketball sequence doesn't fell sexy as its meant to, in fact it just feels odd and misplaced. Sharon Stone clearly makes the biggest career mistake of her life in this movie though. Her character to be frank shouldn't exist in the first place, but just her performance itself is awful. I can't comment on her any more as she really is that hate-able in the movie.Catwoman isn't the worst movie in the world, and the action does manage to make the movie rise a teeny bit above one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But the fact that no real effort has been placed into it just annoys me to the extreme. I would watch a Catwoman 2 on three conditions, Halle Very is back, the director and scriptwriter are fired, Sharon Stone swears that she will never act again, especially in a superhero movie. Then I'd consider watching a sequel, but since this was globally despised I really doubt I'd ever have to endure one anyway. So if you wanted to see this, take my advice don't, go watch Batman Returns instead.",

Catwoman is a failure because they took a good actor(Benjiman Bratt, Alex Borstein, Frances Conroy) and paired them with gorgeous but lukewarm talent like Halle Berry and Sharon Stone. Couple these casting faults with an overuse of CGI tricks, gaudy set design and cutesy music video moments and you have this movie.

It is especially the synonymous of 'style over substance', ideal for futile women - who are certainly the target audience of this product. Halle Berry's portrayal of Patience Phillips is acceptable, but as Catwoman she looks more like a ho than a respectable BD character - one can be sexy without being that, as Michelle Pfeiffer.",

            "content": "Movies like \"Catwoman\" are the reason why I'm sad \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" no longer airs. This is the type of material that begs to be talked back to--misguided at its best, and utterly laughable at its worst. I almost wish there were more of it--say, for example, a scene in which Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), the newborn Catwoman, comes up with her costume. A scene which justifies the existence of the ripped leather pants, S&M bra, bullwhip, and mask would almost have to be as delightfully ridiculous as the outfit itself. But hey, there's still plenty of silliness to go around.This is what comic-book experts call an \"origin story,\" so we first meet Patience before she starts getting into leather and whips--a quiet graphic artist whose cubicle is flanked by a sex-obsessed friend and a man who's the most over-the-top gay caricature since Jack on \"Will and Grace.\" Director Pitof (isn't that a rice dish?) dresses Berry in baggy clothes and long curly hair in an attempt to convince us that one of the great natural beauties of the screen is a mousy wallflower, and has her working for that good-old standby villain, the Unethical Corporation. How do we know it's unethical? Because her boss (Lambert Wilson) speaks with a condescending British accent, and is accompanied by a shrewish wife (Sharon Stone). And indeed, it isn't long before Patience overhears the news that her cosmetics company's new anti-aging cream causes illness and scarring but (gasp!) they're going to put it on the shelves anyway, despite the protests of the resident lab rat who declares he can't support a product that turns women into \"monsters.\" (I think he's overreacting; the woman in his file looks no worse than the \"before\" picture in an average dermatology clinic ad.) Patience is drowned to ensure her silence, but she washes up on shore where a bunch of fake-looking CGI cats crowd around her, and one breathes on her, causing her to open her eyes. That's cat-food breath for you--enough to wake the dead.Sentient moviegoers will note distinct similarities between this scene and the origin of Catwoman in \"Batman Returns\"--and indeed, much of what follows has been cribbed from other, better comic book movies. Patience discovering her new cat-like abilities, crouching and twitching her head like a road-company Rumpleteaser and downing sushi at an alarming rate. The random thugs who get beat up by the new costumed vigilante, accompanied by R&B ululations that sound as if Mariah Carey has stubbed her toe. The woman who explains that Patience is now the latest in a long line of catwomen, accompanied by some badly touched-up pictures of women in cat masks. The love interest who complicates the protagonists double life--in this case, a cop blandly played by Benjamin Bratt. All of this could have been fun on its own terms--guilty pleasure fun, yes, but fun nevertheless. But Pitof doesn't know how to put it all together in an exciting or involving manner. Scenes feel like they're shot and edited at random, with the camera refusing to linger anywhere for more than a few seconds. I have no problems with quick cuts in the right place, but Pitof doesn't know how to use them effectively--a quiet scene between Patience and her friend (who's been hospitalized thanks to the Unethical Corporation's latest product) features the same frenetic cuts as the earlier fight scenes. Berry, bless her heart, tries to do what she can, but she's overwhelmed by the paint-by-numbers script and clumsy direction.There's more, of course, much more. But three scenes in particular stand out in my mind: 1) During a date between Berry and Bratt's characters, it starts to rain, and Berry dashes for cover--her cat side, of course, doesn't want to get wet. This begs the question: how is she keeping clean now? Does she still use the shower? The thought of Berry washing herself as felines do is one I prefer not to think about in great detail. 2) While trying to find her \"killers,\" Patience confronts Wilson's character--not in an empty office or deserted alley, but in a crowded theater featuring some sort of Cirque du Soleil-ballet hybrid. The police show up, and a chase scene ensues backstage--all while the performance continues. If there was a potentially dangerous criminal in the theater, don't you think the cops would stop the show? 3) Later on,Patience is imprisoned (for a crime she didn't commit, of course), but this doesn't stop her--she uses her cat-like flexibility to slide in between the bars of her cell. Mystic powers or no mystic powers--unless cats have the ability to shrink their skulls, this should be impossible.",

            "content": "I remember way back when Batman Returns was released, that warner bros. was planning to make a catwoman spin-off movie. This was back in 1992, when the \"Batman\" franchise was still going very strong. In 2004, a good 12 years later, and a good 6 or seven years after the franchise was demolished by Joel Schumaker, the people got their catwoman movie, and most of them shouted \"what the...?\" As most of you know, Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a very shy mousy woman who works at some cosmetics company in an unnamed city. About 10-15 minutes into the movie, she gets bumped off, gets CPR from a cat, gets cat-like powers and turns into Catwoman. Is she a hero, or is she a criminal, yadda, yadda, yadda...we get the idea.I'll get to the first order of business: the acting. Fairly over-the-top, but not gut-wrenchingly awful. Halle did do a decent job, but I (like many other movie fans) would wonder why she would so something like this just after winning an Oscar. Friends of mine speculated that she turned into a prima donna and started demanding movies where she gets top billing and dominant screen time, which makes sense, but something tells me that she was so hungry for it that she didn't exactly take the time to read the script.Next thing: the visuals. First of all, they spent over $100 million on special effects, and it shows. All the swooping shots of \"the city\" really looked CGI, not to mention all the parts where catwoman jumps around. They're trying to pull an \"agent smith\" and try to make every Catwoman moment look badass. Sorry, guys, but I'm just not convinced. Also, the constant scene cuts (I estimated about 3-4 cuts per second) are very confusing, if not disorienting.Now I come to my biggest gripe: the COMPLETE and utter LACK OF REGARD for the SOURCE MATERIAL! Many comic book fans (along with some lay people) know that Catwoman is a DC comics character, a very significant member of Batman's rogues gallery. In the comic, her name is Selina Kyle, an orphan who was once a hooker but turned to burglary instead. She hasn't given up on crime completely, but most of the time she works with Batman towards a common good. She has no super-powers, save for an amazing natural athletic and gymnastic ability. I guess the studio execs, however, didn't think this was flashy enough to get as many people into their seats as possible. So instead, they decide to make her have cat-like powers handed down to her from a mystical cat-god. When I finally heard about this, I, and many other comic fans were less than happy. We felt that this would not only be a box office failure, but it would hurt the chances of resurrecting the Batman franchise. The movie did fail miserably, but hopefully, there is \"Batman Begins\" which will be released this coming June, maybe warner will begin making halfway decent DC comics adaptations again.Over the past couple of years, we've seen some really good movies in general and some kick-ass comic book movies in particular. Unfortunately, for every movie like \"Spider-Man 2\" and \"X2: X-Men United\" there comes crap like \"Catwoman\" to feed the masses who don't know any better. Some people actually like that, and more power to them. I'm just glad that movies like these are the exception, rather than the norm.",

It was an attempt to make some profit without any thought to film quality.It is expected for comic films to change a bit of the context from the books. However, the character's style and arch-type was thrown away in order to make some quick cash. Unlike the silent cat-bugler of the comics, this Catwoman is a dark vigilante out for revenge...

            "content": "If they would just change this bad script into a comedy this would be a great movie. There were two movies that I can think of that destroyed comic book heroes. One was Captain America and another one is this Catwoman. Bravo! Another history in the making.The acting for Halle Berry is the worst acting I have ever seen. This show-off style she would be a shoe-in playing the dominating wife controlling Tommy Lee Jones.As a cat, while she did display many characteristic of a cat, a cat does not overact like Jim Carrey. It does things when it has to do it, quietly an unassuming and when you least expect it, whether it be going on a sofa, etc.Now this Catwoman does things unnecessary or over-exaggerates the traits of a cat. Also cats are associated with the darker side of things, more like quiet and secretiveness in the same spirit as Spiderman, instead of a show.Apparently it is understandable that catwoman tries to emulate the Catwoman played by Michelle Pfieffer from Batman Returns. However, the original Catwoman did a beautiful job in that she displayed the dark secretive hidden side of the cat. It was extremely memorable when catwoman secretly scratched the stomach of Batman without him knowing. This is the likes of the true Catwoman, secret, hidden, dark and putting you in fear.Now Halle Berry very similar to Madonna, as Michelle Pfieffer to Marilyn Monroe (almost). One is boastful and brass, the other is secretive and dark. The sadistic side of a cat is more sinister rather than boastful. For a cat the latter trait is much more desirable.Take for instance when someone called Catwoman and she starts pouncing on the sofa - the single worst mistake ever. Take her jumping from building to building, it looks like giant cockroaches jumping over buildings - and in my lifetimes, I am an authority on cockroach movement. Cats are graceful, not hippity hoppity cockroaches.People need to be convinced that Halle Berry IS the catwoman, not be forced fed down the throat that she is catwoman. O.K. some total idiot with an I.Q. of 2 1/2 might not think so. But for people like us whose average I.Q. is near Moron watching this toilet flushing movie, that is going way over the hill.Now, mind you I am sure Halle Berry will do A GREAT job as catwoman. There is no doubt about it, the hitch is that she should be at least 80 years old to do it. At that time she might learn the subtleties of being at Catwoman.As to the director of Catwoman, I don't he ever did watch Batman returns. One sheer quality that this movie totally miss is the deceptiveness of being a cat. There's nothing deceptiveness about this ego-trip Cat! I mean is there any differences in the personalities of Catwoman and those of the movie The Chronicles of Riddick. I am sure Halle Berry will do a great job doing a screen play as a Vin Diesel replacement. In fact, may I dare say, Vin Diesel looks fit to cast the role as Catwoman (after the silicone breast implants off course).Some people thing we critics are not constructive. Well here is the constructive side: Catwoman should be on the darker sinister side. Hidden from the true depths with deep inhumane emotion. Deep and uncaring. Exploring the dark side can really helped this comedy blockbuster - oh did I say comedy? I mean, unintended comedy.Great Movie I give it 2/10",

Which makes this movie one of the lowest rated comics to movies flick over the last twenty years. The grade is even lower than Batman and Robin. To be frank I was more than reluctant to see this movie in the first place. When it hit the theater it was definitely on my movies-to-skip list. And I don't actually pay to see movies in the theater so that gives you a pretty good idea of what my opinion of the film was back then. A year or so have passed since it's release and having seen all the movie at my video store I decided to give it a shot (I don't pay for rental either so it was really a matter of waste of time) I throw the disc in my DVD player and launch the Title 01 of the DVD (this way you skip all the annoying animated menus and other previews that some DVD company includes in the rentals)The beginning credit is a real bore so I fast forward my way to the actual start. Here it goes, it's pretty nice, some nice effects and camera angles. Good introduction to character somewhat cheesy nonetheless. Everything looks good so far not boring a good general pace. I'm actually surprised by the general looks of the film, having seen Vidocq I expected another Digital Effect Vomit but I guess the technology advanced really fast in the last three or so years. Because it's looks pretty real to me. Then we get to the drowning scene. The following shot feature Berry on some kind of Island surrounded by cats. Which was very lame. Because there's no way a cat or any number of them for that matter would drag a dead body out of the water, and it's kinda stupid to have CGIed the cat that's on Berry. However that lame scene apart the general tone of the movie was very good. The most important of all it was not boring at all. So except for a couple of CGI overuse and some cheesy line I just don't get why this movie got a rating that low. Because as I said before I don't pay for movies and rentals so lemme tell you I watch a lot of them (1 to 5 a day, being insomniac and sleeping three hours a day helps too)And it's one of the best I've seen so far. It's no Tim Burton's Batman or Bryan Singer's X-Men but it's way better than Spider-Man 2 who's actually number 244 out of the IMDb Top 250. And apart from a couple of good action sequence Spider-Man 2 is all about endless pathos scenes, pseudo right or wrong philosophy and cheesy love story about two actors that overplay those moments with the \"I-Want-To-Be-Nominated-To-The-Oscars\" spark in their respective eyes.So I just don't get people bitching about this movie when the Director actually tries to make things a little different and use the latest technology in order to bring this comic character to life. He did some stuff wrong but the biggest part is done right. There has been so many movies in the last 5 years that came from Comics characters and nine tenth of those movie were really poor. So why picking on this one when so much worse has been done. Daredevil, Hulk, The Punisher to name a few. So if you like action movies, with nice fighting sequences, sexy characters, and beyond laws of physics action. Then this movie is for you . Don't listen to the bad reviews this movie had because most of them are just gratuitous bitching from people who either are racist (Unfortunatly those people exist and bitch about everything with black or Hispanic actors in) or those people just don't like this genre of movie so they cannot be objective about reviewing this movie.",

I recall people saying that this Catwoman made no sense because of the origin presented. Personally, I think the origin story here made more sense than the one in Batman Returns or even in The Dark Knight Rises. Think about it. Selina Kyle in Returns and the Phillips character in this film were both found by cats after being thrown off of high distances and survive an attempt to murder them. Returns showed Kyle going completely ballistic afterwards and taking on the characteristics of a cat because of her abuse from her employer and her downtrodden life. This abuse and unhappy life was another thing that each character had in common with each other. Phillips herself became Catwoman because of an experience with more supernatural implications, which I found a bit more concrete even if I did not agree with the notion of Egyptian Deities. With Rises, Selina Kyle was shown to be a thief, albeit with natural ability to fight, but with little back-story, except for the fact that it was seen early on that she despised those that were wealthy and blamed them for the troubles of the World (whether individually or as a whole) who, too, decided to \"fight back\" by taking on the persona of a cat. When it comes to Returns and Rises, the question must be asked as to how does Kyle in either of those two films acquire her agility and athletic prowess? At least this version of Catwoman gave a reason for it. It may have disappointed those that were expecting a Catwoman movie based more on the comic book character, which would have been fine, but what I would have expected even from that is a further explanation as to why Kyle would become Catwoman in the first place, and not just what was presented in Batman Returns. There would have to be more substance to this matter.",

About the only thing I liked was Sharon Stone playing the evil cosmetics empress whose toxic products make your face go as hard as marble or cause it to disintegrate if you stop applying them. (Although it's hard to believe that a cosmetics company would risk ruinous law suits by knowingly using toxic ingredients, some unscrupulous beauticians have actually done that).

            "content": "Often you watch a film and think \"This sucks so hard that I don't know where to start\" but with Cat-woman the errors are glaringly obvious and easy to break down.1) The score, the first thing that hits you when watching this film is that the score is completely inappropriate. The timing is off, it will kick in while someone is talking and kick in with heavy rock music when a couple is on a date. When someone takes their jacket it off it will sound like the final scene from cliffhanger before a much more uneventful scene. If there was any chance of immersing the viewer in this film, the score was the final straw.2) The choreography, I'd like to think for Halle Berrys sake that someone else told her to move and walk like that when she is in 'cat-woman' mode. (In my opinion) The way cat-woman walks is not provocative, confident and carefree... it looks silly and ruins any chance of cat-woman being a decent protagonist.3) This history of cat-woman. I'm not a marvel/batman expert so I don't know much about this but I do know that Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burtons Batman universe... well she rocked as an incredibly dark and mentally disturbed cat-woman. The 'sex in the city' cat-woman created in this film just doesn't paint the same sortof picture at all and anyone over the age of 25 will remember Michelle Pfeiffers cat-woman well. While I'm at it, there are strange undertones to the dialogue when explaining cat-woman in the film, like instead of just making someone that goes a bit crazy and gets bitten by a cat they start trying to make a statement about how a woman behaves without hibitions. All a bit too much for me.4) The CGI. CGI is heavily used in this film, every single time the cat-woman does something that would seem inhuman they revert to a CGI version of Halle Berry in costume - OK, fair enough. Problem: The CGI isn't high quality enough for the close ups, they zoom right into the face of the fake Halle Berry asif to make it as obvious as possible that you're watching something that isn't real. Six years later they're just about got a believable Jeff Bridges in Tron 3D, why at that time they thought to do this I don't know. The over use of CGI continues with the use of over-zoomed shots and at one point even a CGI ferris wheel. Minutes later they use a real life version of the same ferris wheel, all seems a bit strange to me.5) The acting. There are some good actors in this film but I found the acting to be unbelievable, there was chemistry between Halle Berry and the detective but little believability to their characters in my opinion.A lot of films could take one of those 5 points and continue but cat-woman didn't have a chance. I made it an hour into the film but really felt asif every scene was ruined by one of my five points.4/10.",

I was shocked that Manos and Saving Christmas were overtaken after years being the worst, well, because they are.I'm not surprised this movie was down the list because it is a bad movie. Now, if it were meant to be campy and over the top, then I could appreciate it more. Movies like the aforementioned Manos or Plan 9 From Outer Space are cheap, cheesy atrocities but those trainwrecks are delightfully awful. This movie was trying to be serious but it was painfully awful.The writing and directing are the starting point. The directors have their vision and the actors comply. A horrible script can't be saved by even the best actors. Halle Berry is an incredibly talented actress. She has proven that many times in her career. Unfortunately, there are times where you feel her looks are front and center over her talent. She is very beautiful but this character made her look a little trashy. Michelle Pfeiffer is also very beautiful and the direction,script and her performance put her miles ahead. She was more covered up but it was sexier and more sultry. The movie was very dark yet campy but she nailed it (and a bit spooky).Sharon Stone is always a delight even though she is really not that great of an actress, it seems to work for her but not here.What does puzzle me is the people who rate something like this a 10. I'm not insulting your opinion, it's all subjective, but why a 10 when many of those reviews do have issues with it. How do you give it a perfect score!!!!!!!! 10 on this scale is perfect. It doesn't fool enlightened people. We actually read reviews, not just an overall rating. If they are predominantly bad, though it may not deter watching it because, again, taste is subjective, it kind of give it credence. I do laugh at some perfect scores because some of these people love EVERYTHING (according to other reviews) even the worst crap ever made. What do you rate the truly great movies??? Ok, I'm done there.I'm looking forward to The Batman. We will get another new version of Catwoman in Zoe Kravitz. Another beautiful young woman (look at her parents, no wonder). She will be Selina Kyle and I'm hoping for a convincingly strong portrayal. You couldnt pay me enough to watch the Twilight movies but Robert Pattinson is a very good actor so I'm praying it makes me forget Ben Affleck!!! We need to get back on the right track.",

The dialogue quality goes up and down like an EKG after a mega-dose of Red Bull, that I stopped having any expectations about 2/3 of the way through the film. Catwoman as a character gets annoying when we're supposed to be entertained by her 'cat' attributes finding their way into the picture, but are completely lame.

            "content": "After winning an Oscar for her performance in \"Monsters Ball,\" Halle Berry gradually started to buy into her own hype and this steaming pile of kitty litter is the result. \"Catwoman\" was, once upon a time, supposed to be Michelle Pfeiffer's movie due to her breakout performance as the legendary anti-villain in Tim Burton's \"Batman Returns\" but Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't really interested in reprising the role so it sat on the shelf. After a decade in Hollywood purgatory, someone got the brilliant idea to take a generic female superhero script and make it a \"Catwoman\" movie. After numerous rewrites and addressing a fat check to Ms. Berry, the movie began production in earnest. First people protested at the unusual casting choice then they protested at the exposed midriff costume design and it just got worse from there. This movie goes so wrong in so many ways, the first of which is how fake everything looks. The movie is an overblown CGI mess. The unnamed city that provides the setting of the movie looks impossibly clean and shiny and has more towering skyscrapers than Manhattan and Tokyo combined. The woman who would be Catwoman gets rescued by fake cats on an unrealistic island after getting flushed down a sewer pipe that must be thousands of feet above the ground. They couldn't even allow Ms. Berry to do her own running and jumping and thus left THAT up to yet another unconvincing CGI clone. The next failing of many is the plot. Oh Dear God, the plot. I can buy into the heroine-dies-and-gets-reborn story. It's the rest of the plot that's really awful. Catwoman must bring down an evil cosmetics company that is making poisonous face cream that is a) addictive, b) makes your face rot after discontinuation, and c) causes headaches after they try to murder her for stumbling onto their secret. This has to be the most suicidal corporation in existence not to mention the FDA would never allow such a product on the market in the first place. In spite of everything, Halle Berry gives it her best shot, but she's given awful one liners and forced to act like an actual cat (at one point, she goes nuts over catnip, no really\u0085) so I don't honestly believe any actress would've come out of this not looking stupid. Benjamin Bratt, the designated love interest, could pretty much be cut from the entire movie and you wouldn't notice. They do try to ratchet up some sexual tension between them though by having them dry hump on a basketball court in front of a bunch of kids while horrendous R&B music blares. I'm seriously not making this up. The characters that do have personality are incredibly annoying. Catwoman, naturally is given a chubby comedic foil best friend, except she just ends up being annoying. This movie has all but guaranteed that Alex Borstein will probably be voicing Lois Griffin until she dies. She also has a camp gay stereotype friend, not that either of these people matter once the\u0085 ahem\u0085 plot kicks in. These people are meant to emphasize that Halle's character, pre-transformation, of course, is a mousy frump with no social life. However, Hollywood never seems to realize that even if you give a woman like Halle Berry a bad hairstyle and ugly clothes she will still look like\u0085 Halle Berry. Frances Conroy gets stuck with a thankless mentor role, only this time as a Crazy Cat Lady. Finally, we wouldn't have a superhero flick without a villain. Since Halle Berry is not exactly an imposing figure, they wisely gave her a female villain to square off against. Unfortunately, they gave her\u0085 Sharon Stone. A past-her-prime Sharon Stone. A younger Sharon Stone from \"Total Recall\" might have been convincing but instead we have the obligatory third act smackdown with opponents almost as mismatched as Steven Seagal beating up an unarmed, flabby, middle aged Michael Caine in \"On Deadly Ground.\" It's almost as if the writers realized she made a lame sparring partner because they invent a new plot twist where it's revealed that the EVIL face cream also makes its user resistant to physical attacks?! Um\u0085 Sure, why not? The movie stops making sense long before this revelation anyway. Still, Catwoman inexplicably breaks through the villain's supposedly indestructible face mask, she falls to her death and the day is saved. And since we can't have any loose ends for the sequel the boyfriend has to go too. Like so many other bad movies, you can't help but wonder why no one could see how awful this was. \"Catwoman\" would die a quick death at the box office and become a punchline for many years to come. I saw the movie at a discount theater and only did so because I was bored and had nothing to do that evening. It was certainly the worst three bucks I'd ever spent.",

            "content": "'Catwoman' is not a typical sequel by any means. Although its origins are firmly embedded in the 'Batman' comic franchise; there were no references on any level to the Caped-crusader or the city in which he set up shop. Most 'sequels' enjoy the luxury of not having to waste precious screen time to introduce and develop characters through back-story. Often times in a 'sequel', the backdrop has already been laid out and all that needs to be presented are the harrowing situations and diabolical evil foils confronting the protagonist.'Catwoman' didn't enjoy any of these luxuries and in turn created for itself more obstacles to overcome. Deviating from the original storyline of 'Catwoman' with the character and story of 'Selina Kyle'; an all-new set of characters and relationships were created to tell a 'new' story of the feline burglar.This 'Catwoman' is the story of a Hedare Beauty cosmetics company executive who through revenge and divine feline intervention finds the power and motivation to avenge her own murder. (I couldn't help notice the seeming alliterative link between 'Hedare Beauty' and 'Halle Berry').Halle Berry is arguably in uncharted waters; deep, uncharted waters with this endeavor. The responsibility of delivering a successful summer blockbuster is tremendous. Star power is most often measured with respect to your cinematic resume generated between May and August. Many careers have gone in divergent directions because of successes or failures during these few months.Unlike 'X-Men', there was no ensemble cast surrounding Halle Berry. As well, there will always be a plethora of action films targeted at the same demographic, the same pockets of disposable income. The competition is stiffer and the stakes are considerably higher.The good news is that Halle Berry did her part. The bad news is that many of the parts around her either did not fit or just couldn't deliver.There will be no denying that Berry delivers a spirited and sensual performance as the conflicted Patience Phillips as she undergoes the metamorphosis into Catwoman. As well, there shouldn't be any denying that both the script and supporting cast were ill-suited to make 'Catwoman' as dynamic as it could have been\u0085as dynamic as it should have been.Love interest, Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) seemed uncomfortable and mismatched against Berry's demonstrative screen presence. It was increasingly hard to believe that the two lead characters were really as smitten with one-another as the story led you to believe. After awhile, it seemed that the pair was better suited as 'good friends' rather than of intimate disposition. Even a clich\u00e9 moment atop a Ferris wheel couldn't change this fact.A common thread of successful 'superhero' movies is that the 'hero' or 'heroine' has a worthy and truly diabolical adversary that he/she must overcome to save the day. George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) as Mr. and Mrs. 'bad guys' respectively were not it. I must be honest, the idea of Stone and Berry in a\u0085uh\u0085'catfight' (damn it, I promised myself I wouldn't go there) seemed like delightful fodder. But Sharon Stone as the 'arch-villain' opposing Catwoman was no Doc Ock vs. Spider-man. The character of Laurel Hedare was a nasty individual, maybe even an all-around bad person with questionable moral character. But by no means was she truly diabolical or even formidable as an opponent. Sharon Stone was little more than a jilted lover/housewife with the all-too-familiar motive of revenge directing her actions. I would've rather seen Catwoman face Sharon Stone reprising her role as Catherine Tramell in 'Basic Instinct' or maybe even Demi Moore reprising the role of Meredith in 'Disclosure'. Now THOSE heifers were incontrovertibly evil! Hell, even Janet Reno after a congressional hearing, donning a villain-like leotard would have been intriguing...I think. Maybe\u0085maybe not. I'll get back to you on that one.Anyhow\u0085Any of those match-ups would have been a hot PPV card. This was not.'Catwoman' was by no means a bad movie. It has impressive special effects and allows Berry to showcase herself in an action sense that few other movies have afforded a female lead. Her extensive stunt and martial arts training in preparation for this movie paid off convincingly. The lack of overabundant and obvious cutaways to stunt doubles allowed a sense of continuity and flow to the scenes. The CGI transitions weren't as seamless as those in 'Spider-man 2' or 'I-Robot', but again\u0085that has everything to do with director Pitof and nothing to do with Berry.This Catwoman character is arguably far sexier than Lara Croft on her best 'Tomb Raider' day and exhibited far more depth and range of emotion than any comic book character to date. Halle Berry did nothing to disparage the standard set by Eartha Kitt decades before and in some ways one-upped her.Where 'Catwoman' fails, is in its storyline. It plodded along, weighed down by extensive back-story; revealed in explanatory dialogue, instead of inventive, expository storytelling. For an 'action' movie, far too much screen time was devoted to developing the character and life of Patience Phillips. When the transformation of Patience Phillips into Catwoman is complete, 'Catwoman' does move at a brisk and satisfying pace; relying on action instead of explanation.If 'Catwoman' is to succeed, it's because the younger demographic will turn a blind eye to its plot shortcomings and dwell more on the performance of Halle Berry. In truth, that's not a bad thing at all. All eyes should be on Berry, as she manages to avoid coming across listless and unenthusiastic\u0085as do many of those in the supporting cast. If 'Catwoman' is to fail, be sure that the blame will be placed squarely on Berry, although completely misguided and unjustly assessed.'Catwoman' barely scratches the surface of its potential, but if fingers are to be pointed, they should point toward director Pitof and the attached writing team. Berry shines, despite the fact that most around her do not. At the same time, therein lies the overwhelming responsibility of starring in a summer blockbuster\u0085all of the credit\u0085or all of the blame. There's no in-between.",

I would have liked to known more about what made her who she was and also the history of catwomen.Within the movie, itself, my other interior complaint is that Lone seems to be the only cop working in New York, a city with something like 30,000 police officers.  And he seem to work as a beat cop as well as a detective. I think they could have done better with that aspect.Halle's character was a little too powerful in her abilities, as well.  They seemed to be going for the Spiderman powers without the webs.  Cats are nimble and all, but that point seemed a bit stretched.The ending, I won't elaborate, was too unsettling.  I can't buy into that being the final resolve.  Other than the fact that they are hoping for a sequel, as with most movies of this type, I think that ending scenario needs to be worked out to a more plausible solution based on the character's personalities, etc.",

First off I gave this film 4 out of 10 stars for a few reasons, but I think why people dislike this film so much is because the writers & directors tried to fantasize & upgrade a story that didn't need upgrading. People liked the Julie Newman Catwoman of the 1960's Batman TV show & Michelle Pfeiffer of the 90's Batman Returns film. It's like when the Coke company came out with New Coke in the mid 80's when everyone was happy with the original formula. Why give her superpowers where to my knowledge Catwoman was just an extraordinary person like Bruce Wayne/Batman? Also the name change to Patience may have thrown some longtime Catwoman fans off. I think that's why we see more realistic Catwomans in The Dark Knight Rises & The Batman. This film also might be the reason why we see more gritty, realistic Batman films in the Batman films that succeed this. Overall decent flow to the film, good action, varying performances by all actors & a decent soundtrack. Again 4 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "One of the most enduring and popular superheores of the modern age is Batman, and one of the most enduring and popular females in his universe is that of Catwoman. As in the comics, the character of the Catwoman has evolved thanks to the portrayal of numerous actresses, from the sexy cat-burglar on the \"Batman\" television show, to the tortured soul expertly played by Michelle Pfeiffer in \"Batman Returns.\" Now, \"Catwoman\" has her own film. Unfortunately, it's about as appealing as a lump in the litter box.Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) is a timid art designer at Hedare Cosmetics, answering to the imperious George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his icy ex-supermodel wife Laurel (Sharon Stone). Hedare is ready to release a new cosmetic line called Beau-line, which promises dire and disfiguring effects if the wearer stops using it. When Patience discovers this secret, she is killed by Hedare's goons and brought back to life by the spirit of the Catwoman. Now imbued with fantastic agility and cat-like senses, Patience sets out to stop Hedare's plans, all the while dogged by handsome detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), and having to decide if she is a hero or a criminal.Advance reviews of the movie were dreadful, and for the most part, they're right. The movie is flawed at the most basic level, and the filmmakers have decided to reject the standard Catwoman character of Selena Kyle and make an altogether new character with the same name who is in no way related to the Batman universe. Previous screen incarnations of Catwoman relied on basic acrobatics and undeniable sex appeal to have their way. By giving this new Catwoman fantastic powers, the basic nature of the character is altered, making her just another action hero in a silly costume. She is no longer the ultimate femme fatale, the one adversary Batman could never bring himself to finish off. She's simply a fashion disaster with a whip and high kicks.It's clear that Halle Berry wants to make an impression in her role as Catwoman. She has big stilettos to fill, from the sexy Julie Newmar to the exotic Eartha Kitt, not to mention the previously-mentioned Pfeiffer's electrifying turn. Berry relies heavily on Kitt's mannerisms and Newmar's attitude, but it's obvious that she's just copying the moves. Berry is a decent actress but lacks self-confidence, and while her heart may be in the right place, everything else in the film is working against her.The film's director, French music video helmer Pitof, wants to make a stylish, sexy film, and he almost succeeds. There are times when the film does have a giddily campy feel, much like the \"Charlie's Angels\" films, but a massive amount of obvious computer-generated work distracts heavily from the seamless look Pitof strives for. Even Catwoman's whip is mostly CGI. The script is equal parts camp and action, but it's never comfortable in either and mostly comes off as ludicrous and pieced together by committee: a series of scenes that were strung together with little forethought. There are a number of embarrassing performances as well, not least of which is the normally-hilarious Alex Borstein, stuck in the role of Frumpy Best Friend. Frances Conroy and Lambert Wilson also seem to be phoning in their performances, as well.The movie is prevented from being a total disaster by Sharon Stone. Stone's Laurel Hedare is a beautifully manipulative and ambitious woman, hateful of the world for the fact that she must age and make way for a new spokesmodel for her husband's company. Stone also seems to be the only one who realizes exactly what kind of film she signed up for and was determined to camp the hell out of it. In a sea of relatively earnest performances, Stone is a beacon of delightfully vicious melodrama that makes a painful film at least marginally watchable.Halle Berry deserved a better film. Catwoman deserved a better film. Anyone who's ever picked up a comic book deserved a better film. Fans of Catwoman would be advised to skip this film entirely and hunt down old episodes of the \"Batman\" TV show or watch \"Batman Returns\" instead. Meow? Yeah, whatever, kitty. 3 out of 10.",

In batman returns Tim Burton introduced Catwoman, a type of anti heroin who kicked serious ass. She was the alter ego of a woman named Selina Kyle, and she had blond hair. In this, movie...Catwomans name is Patience Phillips and she's almost more in CG character than gollum in the entire LOTR trilogy.Whats more is that catwoman is almost like some Highlander corpse of super bitches and the worst of it all....the bloody costume.They should have just re-used the old costume in which M.F. did her do's in 12years ago, that would have worked, but instead they reinvented the suit to be a cross-over between the Storm costume and that of a dominatrix.Pitof did too much with this movie and towards the end it gets a type of PS2 feel to it. Further more... Was Sharon Stone's power...if you can call it that a clear nod to one of the batman villains known as Clayface. was the setting of the movie Gotham city. Well two questions that needs no answers. >My conclusion... This movie is the worst superhero movie of the 2000's and Pitof should P**s-off and stick to SFX. thats all.",

The fighting, and action scenes were very imaginative, and fun to watch, overall, the movie was fun to watch, not very deep in emotions, but more just \"fun\", it also tells the story of how Halle or Catwoman, become a stronger person, have higher self-esteem, which is quite an important story, or message to tell.",

At the climax of the film part of me was hoping that Berry was the one to fall out of the window to her death and not the gorgeous, sexy Stone.What I really couldn't get along with was the special effects - they made the action appear very jerky and dis-jointed and extremely difficult to follow. I am not a big fan of CGI anyway and this film to me only goes to demonstrate just how bad CGI can be at times.Why did Berry have to cut off all those lovely long locks? She looked really cute with the long, wavy dark hair in the first part of the film but after she receives her powers and becomes cat woman, and decides to cut her hair I thought she looked awful. I'm one of the old traditionalists I suppose - I like women to have long hair - it seems far more sexy to me.This is a film that I would not really recommend to anyone unless you are bored out of your skull.

I'm not really sure how much of the corny, 'overdone-ness' of this movie is an attempt to pay homage to DC comics (at which it fails miserably), or more a reflection of the writer and director's lack of a creative approach, either way, it sucks.\u00a0 With the advent of an array of newly conceptualized, updated, sleek, less clich\u00e9d DC characters in recent years, Cat Woman seems to have been left in a bygone era where it was acceptable to portray female superheroes as erotic entertainment - presumably to 'pull' a male audience with all that\u00a0 shiny black leather and unavoidable bosom flaunting.\u00a0 I'm afraid to say that the obvious, (oh so obvious...) 'plot' is on a par with poor Cat Woman's one-dimensional personality . Patience Phillips/Cat Woman (Halle Berry trying her best I suppose, considering the paucity of her role), appears as a downtrodden, bullied artist working for a dodgy beauty products company whose aim is to increase and maintain their target buyers (middle aged women) with a beauty serum that will keep them young forever (just so long as they don't stop using it; then, of course, their faces will fall off, or at the very least, all the 'disgusting' flaws, wrinkles and ravaged of time will catch up with them. This aspect of the storyline makes the assumption that audiences agree that middle aged women are 'passed their prime' and have nothing to look forward to but the terrible affliction of ageing.\u00a0 This film was made in 2004 for crying out loud! - have we not moved on from the conjecture that once a woman reaches her 40s and beyond, she is 'past it' and must either skulk in the shadows for the rest of her days (because she's too hideous to be seen) or 'fight ageing' as if she were fighting the war on terror?!\u00a0 Anyway, putting these infuriating, sexist details aside (if one can), the plot is as follows:\u00a0 Patience saves a cat (of the Egyptian Temple Cat breed if you really want to know); is 'killed' by her evil boss when he discovers that she overheard his diabolical plot re: the beauty serum;\u00a0 mysteriously comes back to life (with the help of another bunch of cats); is awarded 'cat superpowers' for her trouble and goes on to wreak revenge on said boss (and anyone else she deems to be a baddie).\u00a0 It goes without saying that oodles of leather, perky (barely contained) breasts and long whips are involved in this sub par tale and I have to conclude that\u00a0 Pitof's Cat Woman is an uninspired, banal, chauvinistic waste of time and unless you have a leather fetish and really don't care about plot lines, interesting characters and intelligent cinema, I'd suggest you give it a wide berth.3.5/10",

The second thing I saw was a scene with obvious special effects in it. They were as overdone as the acting was.

If you want to be intellectually stimulated go and watch Kubrick or Truffaut or, better still, read a book. This is a no-brainer, an event movie aimed at the school holiday market with tie-in video game potential. Anyway there is actually a fair bit of mileage in the idea behind Catwoman: The comic book traditionally transfers well onto the silver screen \u0096 Spiderman 2 opened recently to rave reviews, and the Batman franchise from which the character is taken has enjoyed immense critical and commercial success (the dreadful fourth installment Batman and Robin aside). Add to that Berry's considerable Box Office clout and you have what is surely a recipe for success. Unfortunately though, even the best ideas will flounder if they are not fully thought through. Berry may be a good, nay Oscar-winning actress \u0096 better, certainly, than the catsuit's previous incumbent, Michelle Pfeiffer, and light years ahead of Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar who rubbed up against the Dark Knight in the original sixties Batman TV show \u0096 but she cannot salvage anything from this. She plays Patience Philips, a lonely, browbeaten graphic designer at a large cosmetics firm run by slick businessman George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) and his glamorous wife Laurel (Sharon Stone). After unwittingly stumbling upon a dastardly plot to thrust an anti-ageing product with hideous side effects on an unsuspecting public, Patience is bumped off only to be reanimated by a bunch of mystical moggies. Invigorated with feline zest, she seeks her revenge and falls for hunky cop Tom (Benjamin Bratt) en route. Cue lots of computer animated leaping about and plenty of catty anthropomorphism including Berry scoffing down tuna by the tinful, hissing at dogs and the obligatory milk moustache scene. Interestingly, Patience's alter ego is also surprisingly adept at basketball and kickboxing \u0096 not skills you would traditionally associate with the domestic pussycat.Berry, as always, looks terrific, but she still falls someway short of Pfieffer's seminal Catwoman. The character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns is part of a wider ensemble. Fewer scenes enable Pfeiffer to cloak her Catwoman in ambiguity and maximise her impact \u0096 most memorably when she backflips effortlessly across a deserted lot, pauses and miaows sardonically as a massive building explodes behind her. It helps that she is directed by Burton, the master of the dark, acerbic fairy tale. Berry can count herself unfortunate that her movie is helmed by the curiously monikered Pitof, a Frenchman who seems to have arrived from nowhere (and, on this evidence, will be scuttling back there before too long). Still, Pitof has obviously at least watched Batman Returns, for his movie simply lifts Catwoman's plot line out, dumbs it down and sets it to a pumping soundtrack. There is no heart, no ingenuity and there sure as hell isn't any depth. We learn nothing of Patience's past or why she has been selected to be blessed with superpowers. The villains of the piece are ludicrously unimpressive \u0096 you can imagine them being laughed out of the Global Confederation of Comic Book Baddies for sheer lack of imagination: 'So, what fiendish plans for world domination have you come up with? A super virus? Nuclear War, maybe?' \u0096 'Er, no, but we have developed a face cream that will give people a nasty rash\u0085' Wilson is a tired, identikit evil genius, and Sharon Stone is more of a loony Bridgett Neilson clone than an exotic femme fatale. Neither can touch the sinister malevolence of Christopher Walken's Max Shreck or Danny DeVito's Penguin. Their plot is also so pathetic that Catwoman needn't have bothered with a dangerous, elaborate showdown to bring them to justice \u0096 simply reporting them to Watchdog would probably have done the trick. Catwoman certainly isn't the car crash it could have been. Bratt's cop is pretty bland, but his chemistry with Berry is OK, and the computer animation whilst over the top makes for a slick cartoon landscape that is appropriate for a film like this. And, of course, if you can stomach the dizzying camera angles and stodgy dialogue, the pay-off is Halle Berry clad in leather and wiggling delectably. I would suggest that many red-blooded cinema-goers might well consider that a fair trade.5/10",

There are great films with such ridiculous and over-the-top aspects that make you laugh (i.e. Pulp Fiction, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc). And then there are the movies that are just so terrible and unforgivably bad that they become instant classics merely because you can't help but laugh at and make fun of how bad they are. Catwoman is the latter.This movie is shockingly bad. My jaw literally dropped to the ground every time Halle Berry would rub her face on catnip or an ancient cat would breathe on her. Yeah, that's how she becomes Catwoman. Some cat from Egypt or whatever BREATHES on her. That exists in a movie on planet Earth, believe it or not.The CGI is atrocious in this film. It is incredibly and hilariously obvious that almost every scene of Catwoman pouncing around is a CGI Halle Berry in a horrific CGI city.The plot is so stupid. It revolves around anti-aging cream. I'm just going to leave it at that.There is SO much unnecessary filler in this movie. At one point, Patience's (yes, Catwoman's name is Patience. Not Selina Kyle. Patience. Why? No idea.) friend just falls down on the street from a heart problem or something. Then she's treated at a hospital. Does this 3-minute scene contribute to the plot? Not at all. It just happens so randomly and feels very out of place. With that being said, the movie attempts to create relatable quirks in its side characters, but the characters end up becoming one-dimensional, not memorable, and unlikable.Catwoman is so much fun to watch with friends. If you want something that will get the laughs going, watch this movie. This is definitely up there with Batman & Robin as one of the worst comic book adaptations of all time, if it even is a comic book movie, because this movie has almost nothing pertaining to the REAL Catwoman from the comics. More like a huge middle finger to the classic character.Grade: F",

The cgi effects looked very fake,the acting was bad and the story sucked. But it didn't bore me at all and to me that makes a good movie. I just want to be entertained and Catwoman didn't fail to do that. SPOILER!!!! The one major gripe I had was when Sharon Stone tossed the gun she used to kill her husband to Catwoman in order to frame Catwoman. Catwoman had gloves on and Sharon Stone didn't. Catwoman could have just dropped the gun, tossed it back or hold on to it until the cops showed up since Stones fingerprints were the ones on the gun. Didn't anyone see that?!?!?!?

            "content": "A movie needs two things above all else: a good beginning and a good ending. A movie needs a good beginning because you have just paid to be there and you are expected to watch it for two hours. You don't want the audience members to be sitting there thinking \"Oh no, what have I done? Can I slip out of here and go see Spiderman II instead?\"A movie also needs a good ending. Without a good ending, movie goers will feel cheated and they definitely would not recommend a movie to their friends if they feel cheated.Catwoman fails on both ends. It starts with a meeting at Hedare Beauty with Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) and George Hedare (Lambert Wilson). Why this scene had to be shot like a music video with split second cuts between Sharon and Lambert and even to the board members and then back to Sharon and Lambert I honestly don't know. I remember thinking, as I watched that scene, \"So this is why people hate this movie so much! The editing is really bad!\" Maybe if the movie had been sent back and re-edited from the original footage then it would have been a better movie.Thing is, the ending was bad too. Catwoman (Halle Berry) said \"I'm not a killer,\" but this was immediately after kicking Laurel Hedare out of the window. Yes, it was in self defense but what cop after seeing this happens tells her to run away so that nobody knows that Patience Phillips is Catwoman? Doesn't that make him an accessory after the fact? Couldn't he have testified in court that it was self defense? What goes into his official report? That she slipped and fell? Or that Catwoman killed her and got away but that he doesn't know who Catwoman is? How far is he willing to go to cover up for this woman who he slept with? Surely the department knew he had slept with the prime suspect in a murder case. Why wasn't he taken off the case as soon as the possibility conflict of interest reared its head?The movie had its moments. The comment early in the movie about Patience Phillips having been given a leather outfit as a present was good foreshadowing and we did get to see that outfit later. But then the Catwoman outfit that we see in the rest of the movie is different.Couldn't we have had a scene where Patience, like Selina Kyle before her, cuts up her old outfit and sews it back together, turning a sexy outfit into a sexy costume? Ultimately, why did she even need the costume? That was never explained.Actually, the costume didn't work for me. Yes, we got to see Halle Berry's skin but a lot of the time it wasn't Halle Berry we saw in costume, it was all CGI. This aspect of the movie disappointed me more than anything else: if I wanted a sexy cartoon, I could have rented Japanese animation. I thought the whole point of the costume was that we could see Halle Berry's skin, not a computer generated character's skin. It would have been much better to have given her a full body costume and then it wouldn't have been so obvious when she was being rendered by CGI. It's clear from the way this movie was promoted in the trailers that the target audience was heterosexual males, not young kids, so why spend so much money on CGI anyway?Even the cats were CGI most of the time! Would it have been so hard to train a real cat to crawl up onto Halle Berry and then have her wake up on cue? We know that this is only a movie so why remind us of this fact all the time by showing us CGI like this? Another example is the use of CGI in establishing shots: would it have been so hard to have used a helicopter to shoot footage of an actual American city rather than having all these shots be computer generated? I sometimes felt like I was watching a video game: I felt giddy watching the city scenes swirl around in front of me in ways that couldn't be achieved in real life!I did enjoy this movie though. Halle Berry looked great and the fight with Sharon Stone almost had me cheering for Catwoman. The script wasn't bad but the ending left a lot to be desired. Don't they realize that they need to make sure that the first movie makes money BEFORE they make room for a sequel? I somehow don't think a sequel to Catwoman is ever going to happen. Halle Berry's career will go on though. I think she will continue to be offered roles and people will continue to go seeing her, hopefully in better movies than this.",

I saw this movie on DVD without much hope of seeing anything other than an entertaining if rather stupid comic adaptation, but 'Catwoman' still manages to disappoint. The plot is badly written and rudimentary even for a summer-blockbuster, even the obligatory mini-love-story is unconvincing and cold. One can't even enjoy the action scenes because they are unimaginative and badly done.The acting is OK, but the actors can only use the script they're given. The camera work is actually quite good, at least sometimes. The few scenes that do create a certain atmosphere do so because of this, not because of the plot, acting or dialog, but the (few, I think) computer animations used, look about 5 years behind their time. I don't know if the director had any goal other than showing off Halle Barry in a ridiculous costume, if he did, he did not succeed. The movie would probably have been better if they'd made it funny instead of serious (and used professionals for writing the script and designing the costumes) but since they did not:1/10, 0/10 if I could.

            "content": "As one of many recent 'cartoon super hero' films that have emerged (most of which I liked to some degree) I enjoyed this and was glad I went to see it and didn't let all the negative comments sway me. I am very surprised how badly it seems to be doing and how much bad publicity it has received - so much so that I feel obligated to write these comments.This film is NOT as action packed as Spiderman 2, nor is it as dark as Batman 2 but what it lacks in arty atmosphere and action I feel it makes up for in other areas.Firstly, Halle Berry was hot and Sharon Stone sizzled !  It was great to see Sharon back in action as a foxy femme fatale (the type of part she was once typecast for) and Ms Berry was simply drool inspiring - and she gave a very strong performance throughout the film, too.That aside, this film actually has a bit more of a story in terms of relationships between characters, which I found very engaging. I liked the Egyptian mythological elements to the film, which suggested how Catwoman came into being (but I can see how most people would think this a bit far-fetched, but then again - its a cartoon !)I noticed early on that this film was produced by Tim Burtons buddy and usual producer, Denise Di Novi (who also produced Batman 2).  And so, even if the direction was a little lacking for the fight scenes the production values were still there.  Also, there were lots of similarities to the Catwoman of Batman 2 to this new version, such as the villainous employer, the memory loss, the duality and obsession with revenge, e.t.c\nI think if anything this film is aimed at a more adult audience than teeny-boppers.  Its slower and has a much meatier story than similar film like Daredevil, which by comparison is all action and effects. \nI suppose, as with most things, its down to personal taste.  This is no masterpiece, but if you tend to like films of this genre and want something that tries to be a bit more grown up than Spiderman, than this film could be for you (despite what the critics say)...",

When someone joked about it being the next great horror story, he was half-right. It was horrifying, but not great.Even years after the movie's release, I still can't buy Halle Berry in the Catwoman role. I have a hard time believing that she was the absolute best woman for the job when there were probably tons of more qualified actresses (regardless of ethnicity) that could have fit the role just fine. I think the decision to cast Berry has more to do with her popularity at the time than anything else. And you know what? She's a fine actress in her own right - won Oscars for a reason - but this Catwoman role is beneath her. And the hapless script gives her little to do to make the character remotely likable.So they changed the back story of the character; instead of thief Selina Kyle, we get graphic artist Patience Phillips. You know what? I'm cool with that. It doesn't really bother me. But while the original Catwoman character is supposed to be somewhat of an anti-hero and has somewhat of an interesting history and character, this Catwoman is more of a prostitute than anything else, the flimsy costume (ugh) contributing to that image more than anything else. Nothing she does in this movie gives me a reason to care about her plight because she comes off as really unlikable. In fact, none of the characters seem interesting. They're just there.As for the rest of the movie... it's terrible. The acting is below par, the visuals are dark and murky, and the action is pretty underwhelming. The plot is horrible girl power clich\u00e9 garbage involving toxic cosmetics and... I'm entirely convinced that there is no script despite writers being credited. I can only assume they wrote this on a couple napkins and someone thought this was a good idea to turn into a movie.Overall, Catwoman is one of those movies best left in the gutter. There's nothing remotely redeeming about this film; it's just terrible, terrible stuff. So terrible that it will kill your cat and strip it of its remaining lives at the same time.

The plot ,that sees our cat powered hero taking on a killer cosmetic company , is just ludicrous. After a short while you wont care about which character does what to who and if you haven't walked away from catwoman after about 20 minutes of screen time then you'll probably be sticking around to criticise its many , many flaws . Flaws like the cringe worthy acting , the atrocious dialogue , the embarrassing cat resurrection scene , the poorly shot action , the hatefully crappy and unnecessary cgi stunts \u0085. Its all just embarrassing ! The film would have benefited from sticking to batman returns continuity and following the further adventures of Selina Kyle (a far more charismatic character than this movies catwoman ) as she faces another DC villain .The only high points are the films stylish set design and halle berry's sassy, sexy interpretation of catwoman (and not her nerdy and annoying alter ego , Patience Phillips).

            "content": "This movie does have entertainment value. To compare it to the first Batman movie with Michael Keaton, I would say that Catwoman is slightly less dark and has a bit more humor.They used a different Catwoman than the more commonly known one used in the comics. They probably did this because the more common Catwoman was already portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer in the Batman sequel.Although I was origionally not happy with the choice of using Halle Berry as Catwoman (since she was already a Superhero as Storm in the X-Men movies), I felt she did a very good job in this role. She looked excellent with long hair at the beginning of the movie and she looked sexy in the Catwoman outfit later on on the movie. It was cool how she would walk and move around as if she were a cat and a woman.The basketball scene and the jewelry store scenes among other scenes were also entertaining in this movie.In my opinion I would say that this movie was not as good as Superman 1&2, Spiderman 1&2, The Flash (pilot), or Hero At Large, but better than the 3 Batman sequels, Daredevil, and the Hulk7 out of 10",

            "content": "(sigh) For every American superhero film we have today there are about two lying in the superhero film graveyard. The Mandrake the Magician movie that was supposed to follow The Phantom, the Wachowschi's Plastic Man movie, The Justice League movie that ran out of money, hundreds of dozens of movies that could have been great but died during production and were buried in the superhero film cemetery. But this film\u0085Whatever crime this movie commits is made worse by the fact that at one point in its life it could have been one of the best superhero films of all time. Let me explain. If you've ever had the misfortune to watch Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' you will notice that the movie ends with a shot of Catwoman looking up at the Gotham sky even though we the audience earlier assumed her dead. This was because Burton and the studio were planning a spin-off film for the character. Now if you've seen 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' one of the main problems with them is that Burton isn't interested in Batman and makes him take a backseat while he gives centre stage to his rogues gallery who are just the sort of freaks Burton is comfortable with. A movie devoted to one of those freaks would have had a lot of the good points of the Burton batman films but with the strength of being more focused. On top of that the best aspects of 'Batman Returns' were the Catwoman stuff so there was a lot of potential. Unfortunately 'Batman Returns' didn't make its money back and got Burton replaced with Joel Schumacher. Now if this had been the end of the story for the Catwoman movie it would have been fine, tragic but fine. But for some ungodly reason Warner brothers refused to let this film die and kicked it around development hell for years until they finally gave it to some no name director so the studio could spit out something to compete the marvel dominated Superhero scene. And so we got this unholy zombie of a movie that is a textbook example of how not just to write a bad female superhero movie but a bad movie with a female lead. Now before we get to the big problem with this movie I want to address the little ones. Firstly the production design is blandy bland bland, nothing interesting, nothing to right home about, just bland. This unappealing look is made worse by frequent use of really bad CGI. This movie has competent actors but none of them are interested in making a good movie so the performances aren't bad, bad can be fun, they're just weak. The plot is weak, the action is almost competent except the editing and CGI conspire to ruin it. The soundtrack is bad generic female black pop music (think discount versions of Beyonce or Brandy) that is obnoxious to listen to. Now if these were all the problems this would just be direct-to-video bad, nothing to compete with Hulk or Elektra just bad. There is one aspect of the movie that manages to single handedly make this one of the worst superhero movies of all time. The horribly misguided feminism. Dear lord this movie's treatment of women is awful! It tries to be all empowering and yet ever single female character in this movie is defined by her relationship to men. Worst still this movie has all the clich\u00e9s you find in bad chick flicks; questionable morals, idiot characters, gay friend because men and women can't just be friends, an awkward bumbling lead, a dumb leading man. And then on top of that add all the clich\u00e9s of a bad female superhero movie; objectification of women, sexist male villains, older women villains, girl power motifs and a costume designed more to excite juvenile viewers then it is to actually serve any function in combat. In summary this movie is decent idea filtered through the very worst clich\u00e9s that cinema has to offer. This isn't even fun in a bad way it's just bad. Avoid at all cost.",

Or should we give the public what it really wants, which is a five-hour computer-generated orgy starring Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and one hundred demonic aliens with phallic tentacles? They chose the former, and the result is this insulting film about cats and the women who want to be them.Cats have bad breath, but did you know? It's actually bad enough to wake the dead, literally. Also, cats have super strength, and are great at basketball.In order to make the most educated opinion I could on this movie, I watched it with no sound. Even so, I came away with a perfect grasp of the plot, which reveals that any dialog in the film is purely incidental. Take away the dialog and you're left with action scenes that look like a Playstation game. And no alien porn. It's a lose-lose situation, this movie.",

It's unfortunate that people want you to act in the movies they think you should (that's a lot of nerve). I respect that Halle is very versatile and she's a very good actress. I did not like Monster's Ball, although she did an excellent job, so to see her in such a lighter toned movie was wonderful. The movie was fun, exciting, and simply purrrrrfect!!!

But I must dare to say that as popcorn, entertainment value is on the same level. I had fun watching it. Campy fun, but still fun. I am not ashamed of it.\"Catwoman\" comes to be the anti thesis of \"Spidey \". Catwoman was ditched by most of the critics, while \"Spidey\" got an overrated love from most of them: it was qualified as the ultimate cinematic masterpiece. Give me a freaking break! It is a great film, but it's not flawless. Catwoman was a box office bomb. Spidey domestic gross alone stands close to the 400 million mark.Acting is over acting. Writing is pure trash (what would you expect if three people created the \"story\" and other three wrote the screenplay). Pitof's direction is way weak. But \"Catwoman\" has charm. Halle Berry performance is on top of overacting, but she still is so hot. Mrs. Stone's lines are ridicule and absurd, but she's having fun like a dwarf.\nIn the technical aspects Catwoman is a good film. It performs one of the best Sound Design I've heard in ages; that part is truly Oscar worthy. It is visually stunning as well.

            "content": "When Batman Returns (1992) was released people really enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's take on Cat woman and who can blame them? It was a kick ass roll that turned into one of her most famous roles. A spin off movie was planned to start shortly after the Batman returns in 1993 with Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her role along with Tim Burton directing it. The agreement fell through due to conflicting priorities with Pfeiffer's family life and Burton slowing losing interest in the project. The film would sit in development hell for years until Halle Berry would sign onto the project around 2002. The film would get released on the 23rd of July 2004....We waited so many years for this...this movie....Instead of Salina Kyle we have Patience Phillips (Halle Berry) a meek and lonely woman who works at an evil beauty company, we know that she is meek and clumsy by the amount of people and objects she bumps into and says sorry to in the opening minutes of the movie. It is about as subtle as a pancake to the face because of the sheer amount of persons she bumps into which are almost ten people. Then we are introduced to her slightly ugly (but not really) best friend and the obligatory deeply offensive gay best friend, both of these characters have very little to no bearing on the plot and will not be of any focus because the film put so little effort into making them interesting. The evil make up company (I am not joking) is run by Sharon Stone and Lambert Wilson both who have characters who are so one dimensionally evil that I half expected them to cackle like hyenas while twirling their mustaches. They are creating face cream that will cause the face to rot off if the cream stops being used (I am not joking). Halle Berry overhears this evil plot and is killed off to which a magical cat called Midnight breathes on her (Again, I am not joking) and then Patience Phillips becomes....CATWOMAN!But what is a Cat woman?Well the key, according to this movie is in the name Cat-woman, it is woman who is also a cat. The cat part is very important to this movie as after the cat breathing session Halle Berry has vertical pupils, she sleeps on shelves, she devours tuna by the ton, drinks milk, hisses at dogs, jumps and walks like a cats, ALWAYS lands on her feet and sees in the dark.The fun does not stop there as one aspect of being a Cat Woman is that she likes jewelry and skin tight leather because cats like that too I suppose.Now we move onto that costume, that infamous costume. I am sure that you the reader will know what I am talking about. It is on every single promotional material for this movie. Let me be frank, it is hideous, it is about as sexy as a festering wound, it is a BDSM costume gone wrong, I might as well as call her Cat-gimp thanks to that costume.So with the superhero thing just about set up but with no reason to care, Halle Berry sets out to expose the evil company from letting the skin rotting cream from hitting the market, all the while trying to balance dating a cop who's name I also cannot remember but I know is played by Benjamin Bratt who is also investigating the new and mysterious cat woman for a series of murders that Sharon Stone has framed on the Cat woman. He is so inept at his job that even when he faces Cat woman he can't tell it is his girlfriend despite the suit not really obscuring much, in terms of identity, no he has to go through unnecessary tasks of finger print analysis and lip analysis even when the answer is obvious to all.Eventually things come to ahead and Halle Berry and Sharon stone fight in a drunkenly edited fight scene that is too hard to follow or to care. By the way did you know that if you continue to use the skin rotting cream often enough your skin will turn as hard as granite? This is a big threat to Halle Berry until hits her enough which causes the skin to rot because reasons. Only watch if you want to see a hot, silly, incoherent scrapheap of a move for the laughs it can provide.",

No matter how many times you try to clean it, replace the battery, or alter it in some way, it will always be no longer able to function. The only solution, in that case, would be to just abandon it and obtain a new one. But if you know Hollywood, they tend to take the \"what you see is what you get\" approach in order to squeeze the next buck out of us. But this time, the joke was on them; this movie flopped at the box office at the time of its release, and for good reason.This movie was doomed from the very minute Michelle Pfeiffer and Tim Burton backed out during pre-production. As soon as you try to get someone new to direct, write, and star, people should expect different ideas from different people. So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the script was being tossed back and forth from writer to writer 27 times in order to \"perfect\" the so-called \"story\" about a Batman character that wasn't particularly strong enough to have a movie based around her in the first place, and the title role was being recast more times than was deemed necessary. It also shouldn't come as a surprise that the end result was something with so much coherency squeezed out of it that it no longer resembled Bob Kane's work (they probably should've left his name off the credits after the 5th revision).I like Halle Barry as much as the next person, but she's just way too wrong for the role, and she knows it (her Razzie acceptance speech can be found circulating around YouTube to justify this). I could be counted amongst the large mass of people that thinks the director picked her because she was able to strut perfectly in the strangely skimpy costume. But, I think I can also safely say that the poor quality of her performance that was turned out in the film was not a fault of her own; she's given so very little to work with that it's impossible for her to take the role of Patience Phillips' Catwoman seriously without looking ridiculous. (... \"Patience Phillips\"? Really, Hollywood? Was \"Selena Kyle\" too over-the-top for you?) The supporting cast doesn't help matters either, judging from the fact that they either have characters that are only on screen to be awkward, or they (almost) always give the camera the \"what-the-heck-am-I-doing-here?\" look.The visuals offered in this movie are far from practical, from a CGI Barry performing impossible stunts in some scenes, to extreme long shots of CGI buildings that seem unfinished. My guess is that Warner Brothers spent so much money on getting the script finished and Barry cast that the thought of having anything inanimate or non-human on screen was inconceivable, even if it meant they had to animate them properly (to them, of course).All in all, there's nothing salvageable here, but it's also very easy to see why it has a cult following that's developed over the years just for its horrible quality. If you have the urge to break out a DVD copy of this movie and pull it apart with some friends, feel free (though I wouldn't recommend making a drinking game out of it, for those of you of legal age; it's that stupid).",

The acting is dreadfully bad, the lines are terrible and terribly delivered (not even George Lucas could write dialog this bad), the action sequences are out of place and usually happen for no logical reason, and the film's continuity suggests that two different people with completely opposite personalities edited it.

Unfortunately, \"Catwoman\" was so bad that I couldn't do either-- it has no story or compelling characters, and is just such a pile of dung that it can only be described as an utter waste of time.

You can almost see the comic book captions beside the heads of various characters especially Catwoman. Unlike Spider-Man 1 and 2 though it often looks like these imaginary captions are anything but tongue-in-cheek.The whip work by Halle Berry is quite impressive.

Okay?Now what? it's entertaining and Halle Berry has definitely got what can be termed as \"SWAG\", adding to her swag is a very dashing looking Benjamin Bratt he's a treat to watch throughout and his exotic-ness is to die for.All I am saying here is that okay don't buy it on DVD, never make a conscious effort to watch this movie or ever try to intentionally look for it. But whenever it plays on TV and you happen to stumble upon it while changing the channels. DO NOT SWITCH IT OFF.Just have fun with smexy looking Halle Berry, awesome Benjamin Bratt, the purring and action sequences that can be described as 'feline'.Just enjoy this like a chilled out viewer, not a snobby critic.",

Sharon Stone, bless her cotton socks, does a great job portraying the character but sadly there just wasn't enough meat to it to work with and the final battle at the end if diabolically bad!As for the main star Halle Berry, once again her acting is impeccable and she looks to really enjoy the role she has but it seems too far caught up in being 'catty' and throw in humorous anecdotes about cats to be a respected character. This is not too say the portrayal is poor, she does a great job in slinking around like a feline but sometimes it looks so smutty you expect a XXX movie to kick in!So to wrap up.....A good visual film and showing great acting promise for the new role for the two main ladies but severely let down by the terrible story and script.

The expectations were high - but (un)fortunately, \"Catwoman\" is the same in name only.Michelle Pfeiffer was the perfect incarnation the the Catwoman from the World of Batman, Pinguin, etc. She fitted into this world of masks and insanity perfectly - but besides a very good scene with a lot of cats it was just that ... masks and insanity. The animals were like totems, the main characters took a lot of characteristics, but they remained human.Not so in \"Catwoman\". Here the hero has superhuman powers, is more a female version of \"The Crow\", with some hightened senses from \"The Sentinel\", but clearly not human, not even remotely. She is fast (too fast for human muscles ever to be), incredibly agile and she even has a lot of involuntary aspects of a cat (i.e. addiction to catnip). I suppose most of the worser ratings here come from the disappointed view, that they spoiled Batman's Catwoman. Well, they didn't, it's a different breed. Unfortunately, under the screams of protest the ball came rolling and once it goes downhill in a wave of hate, the ratings really go south.If you see this movie and imagine an other title, \"Bast\" for example, if you do not compare it with the world of Batman, it is not *that* bad. It may not be good ... I mean ... Bast reminded strongly of the Bast of Neil Gaiman's \"Sandman\", and the plot, saving the world from toxic beauty products? Hey, the Joker in Batman could make *toxic* beauty products, this one ... well, no, I shouldn't compare ... anyway.It's a nice flick, not good, much to moralizing for that, certainly not bad (considered without the Batman Universe), just o.k..

Dog Lovers, I think you'll like this movie as well. Halle is one sexy kitten and brings a fresh feel to the character of Catwoman. She does seem to borrow certain mannerisms from past actors who played Catwomen, but she also shows that she was up to the challenge and comes across with a solid performance. The camera work was a bit over done and most of the time you could tell of the computer generated images of Catwoman doing her cat like moves. Even certain fight scenes seemed a bit awkward at times. Sharon's Stone's performance could have been better, but she was playing a vengeful, ex-model, who was being tossed aside for a younger beauty.

It wasn't that the CG catwoman was unbelievable (although the resurrection scene was especially bad) it was just that Halle was only in the movie for about 30 min (being generous here). The plot was average, and the fight scenes were actually quite well choreographed, however the overall flick was too abrupt not giving enough time to develop any of its characters.I would say 6/10, my opinion its worth a matin\u00e9e price but not a regular night price.

Yet, I wanted to check myself whether it was that bad. To my great surprise, it wasn't. Certainly, it is not rich in ideas and witty dialogs. And the plot is far from being original. Yet, the film does well what it is set out to do. There are goodies and baddies... And they do what they are supposed to do: they fight. The baddies, by the way, are less disgusting than those Batman has to fight. To put it in a nutshell, the film has all the ingredients which make Marvel's stories so popular with the audience. I was kept on the edge of my seat from start to end. The urban scenery and special effects are just breathtaking. Halle Berry's movements are a visual treat.

No, this movie left me feeling at the end of it as if it had just murdered my entire family, and then subjected me to a couple of millennia of Abu Ghraib-styled torture.Just what is it that provokes such vitriolic hatred? The movie is just flawed, from start to finish. I know from experience not to expect too much from American superhero flicks, but this makes \"Batman and Robin\" look like a masterpiece of modern film-making. The script is embarrassingly clich\u00e9d and bad, the cinematography is average at best, and Halle Berry's acting is about as wooden as the contents of a lumber yard. Apart from Ms Berry, all of the other actors here, mostly a collection of Hollywood wannabes and has-beens, overact to a degree that would make William Shatner blush with embarrassment.Some people might think it slightly silly that I'd take offence at going to see tripe like this, but when you think about it, the millions of dollars that were spent on the bevy of special effects in this film (an ironic term, since not a single one of them is very special at all), could have been spent on cancer research, feeding starving African children, or, perhaps my favourite, actually putting together a decent film that people will watch out of something other than a sick sense of fascination with bad cinema.",

Its story is a perfect formula following almost the same pattern as that of Spider-man; which is kind of boring and even annoying. Much of stunts of the Catwoman are very similar to those of the Spider-man. Again, boring. Halle Berry did not do the bad job. Movie was written and directed bad. At times she almost amazed me with details in which she duplicated tiny movements of real cats.Just because Catwoman happens to be a woman, she doesn't need to dress extremely provocatively and her curves should not be noticed lustfully among a bunch of junior school children. Most superhero movies attract a lot of children and same could be true for this one too. Many scenes have no other purpose except focusing on Miss Berry's curves moving in an exaggerated manner; which hurts many serious movie viewers. Her Catwoman dress is unnecessarily provocative and scanty.As for fantasy, it is not bad; with a huge potential of a great story thrown in gutter. Special effects with real cats are highly detailed and almost flawless.Overall, if you have nothing else to do and you want to waist an hour and a half in a flawed fantasy, this movie is not bad.",

            "content": "Oh my god\u0085 First of all let me start with one thing: The Cat Woman is not Afro-American. I see a few people talking about an alternative Afro Cat Woman from the Comics as well as from an old TV series; OK, so, let me explain to you people: Spider Man had six arms, became evil, died, resurrected, was black in an alternative reality, was a woman and so many other ALTERNATIVES, but Spider-Man, the original character from the Amazing Spider-Man comic book is brown haired, blue eyed skinny looking guy, the other versions lasted for ONE comic book only as an alternative deal, that is it period. It does not make him Afro-American in any way, so, don't do a movie about it. The very same thing happens with Cat Woman \u0096 she had alternative stuff, but the original character IS a foxy Blonde Blue Eyed woman. Once the director and casting crew decided to change that, they lost millions of fans including me. It is a stab in the back, a betrayal worthy of trial! Don't mess with the originality of an ancient character, please, don't ever do that again.Now, lets just say the idea of a Cat Woman movie is cool nonetheless, so I did managed to watch it, I am a fan of her (Cat) after all. After ten minutes of watching, I noticed I had a pain head and realized I was going to regret renting this for my entire life, and when the movie ended I did.Halle Berry is pretty? Sure, but is she as beautiful as a Blonde Blue Eyed woman? Hell no, and I noticed this movie needed a foxy blonde, it hell needed it a lot and Halle did not manage to replace it, not in a million years. Again, the Cat woman is Blonde Blue Eyed, so, when you change that, you kill the best feature of the movie. Don't listen to the very few people who say the \"blonde\" type is a 2k stereotype, old stuff\u0085 I am sorry but it is not, if the Cat Woman was Blonde I am sure this one would get at least a 6 from me.Everyone wants to see a foxy Blonde in a costume like that; now you take that away... You simply have nothing interesting, period. OK, so, enough with the blonde deal, lets say you are a fan of Halle Berry, cool; you can see her as the Cat Woman. Don't even dream amigo! Even if you CAN manage to tolerate her presence (Impossible to me ever since she boycotted the X-Men 2 and 3 because she is \"An Oscar Winner... boohoos\"), you still have the worst movie ever made in history of man kind at your television. Why is the worst of all? Because of Halle and Sharon acting as well as everything else.I find this very disturbing because the director or \"I don't know who else\" actually thought that the mere presence of Halle would be enough to make it look good, and again this proved that I am right about her \"not deserving her Oscar\", because her acting in this movie was the worst in history of man kind. I have never seen anything like IT in my entire life. I am not joking, if you watch this movie, you will notice that Halle makes some strange faces as if she was acting in a blue screen or as if she was staring into the \"void\" the entire movie, looking like a robot or \"retard\" woman. The lack of a decent acting is so disturbing that you will start to feel like watching one of those tapes your own kids do at home. The other reasons are the lack of special effects, good fighting scenes, action, good sound effects and the most important of all: A Story. I don't know what went wrong in there, it is not the low budget \u0096 just check The Punisher, the lowest budget movie ever made and yet it looks so amazing, the actors did a superb job \u0096 So, maybe it was the presence of the short haired Sharon Stone (Someone should tell her, she is looking like a dude) who lacked to fish the blonde lovers like me, or it was the painful acting of them both, or the fact that they changed the ethnicity of one of the coolest female characters of the comic book, leaving us only Elektra and the Wonder Woman as a \"true to the fans\" crossover. It is a pity that an Oscar winner like Halle acted so badly, disturbingly I am starting to think she never deserved the statue, as it was not her first bad job, just go and see her on X-Men 3, she had a terrible performance as well \u0096 Maybe she is falling in her career, who knows? For your own sake, don't bother for this one, even if you are a fan; seriously, there is nothing to see there, other than a pain head.",

Again,it may be that Peter Parker is a more comfortable model for some of the critics and viewers than the indomitable and very puissant lady here.

For the record, I thought the setup -- the opening graphics of a series of mystic catwomen -- and I confess to never having read the original -- was intriguing, in fact one of the nicest opener-under-credits I've seen. Hallie was very nice, she had fine changes of expression, her motions synchronized perfectly with the role, she had all the requisite grace and ability of the Award Winner.

A soundtrack that sounds like it was generated by the local band who never get airplay anywhere else than their town's community radio station only helps intensify the cheesy fight sequences and romance scenes. Lacklustre costumes, effects and sets serve to further disappoint the viewer. The actors are practically radiating self-loathing with the delivery of every line, and no one can blame them, considering the script flows like a 16 year old girl's Twilight fanfiction.

Questions have been raised wondering whether Halle Berry could fill the same role as Pfeiffer. Well, in my opinion, no. The depth of acting it took for this incarnation was more geared to martial arts and being sexy in leather. Don't take it wrong, Halle Berry, an excellent actress, wasn't given any true depth of character to work with. The movie seems to be divided into halves. The first part deals with Patience Philips working for a cosmetic company as an art designer who just can't seem to get anything right when it comes to her boss. What began promising at first, turned into a disaster when Catwoman finally arrived about 40 minutes into the film. This second half lost the story with a barrage of leaps and fights mixed with a loose love story.There are a few resemblances to Batman Returns, and maybe these were a nod to it:1. Halle Berry turns towards the camera, crouched delivering the same Meow! as Pfeiffer's character.2. Catwoman, always letting her curiosity rule, goes into a store, where instead of meeting 2 security guards as Pfeiffer's did, she meets 3 robbers.3. Catwoman stands in front of the moon.4. Catwoman nearly falls out the window, and later on, is almost pushed out the window.The references are there, but for anyone who hasn't seen Batman Returns, you wouldn't notice them. There are a few more nods, but I think the point is delivered.So, what's this story all about? Well, if anyone has seen the trailer to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, then you would have the story in a nutshell. In the trailer to RE2 (due this Fall) there's a facial cream that rots your skin and its side effects are toxic. (Funny, I was reminded as well of The Jokers mixture of poisonous toxins he shipped from his factory to shelves in 1989's Batman.) OK, we have the fired employee who is killed because she found out about the evil corporations secret. A cat performs CPR (or so that's what it looks like), and she comes back to life. There isn't a comic book villain in this movie, ala Joker, Penguin, or Doc Ock (Spider-Man 2). What we have is the ruthless and completely flat corporate executives. There's no depth to these villains and no clever schemes to nab Catwoman, only pin a few deaths on her. There's your story ladies and gentlemen and I think you can pretty much figure out how it turns out.In the beginning, there was so much promise. From the opening credits showing the origins of cats in myth and legend to the meeting she has with the owner of Midnight (the cat who performed CPR.) After that, it was a downhill spiral. I will say that the catsuit was nice and very revealing, however the headpiece looks really odd. Catwoman got her claws from Tiffany's I think (they really do look like designer nails).I have to say, in all fairness, that Catwoman in Batman Returns was a lot more real and the character had a purpose. From her stitched up suit to her makeshift claws. Some may think I was going into this movie with a preception of Catwoman from Batman, but I did not. I had followed this movie since it was first announced and knew it was not the same. I also knew it had nothing to do with the Dark Knight, but I did expect one thing...a good story for the money. Halle Berry is better than a walkthrough part and deserves a good script, she's proven herself as a fine actress. Nothing is really explained in the movie and it's loosely tied together between action sequences and sex appeal.To see, or not to see, that is the question. The answer is up to you.",

            "content": "There are so many moments in this film when the music was telling me to be scared, excited, or in awe, but during those moments I was laughing hysterically. Notably, the sequence where Seline Kyle (sorry 'Patience') is brought back to life. The music was blaring to signify a wondrous turning point, but the CG was so obvious and the cat breathing cat-breath on her was so silly I didn't buy it, and hardly bought anything afterward either. Also Hallie I think is just not that good an actor. She's a looker, and tries very very hard, but just can't play anything more convincingly then a tough girl. There were some nice character moments, but a lot of them were very weird. Catwoman's powers make little sense, and her compulsions played up as heroic are NOT admirable. When did assault, vandalism, rudeness and sexual promiscuity become things to be encouraged? Originally Patience's character is pathetically nerdy to the point of being a parody, but her transformation into an over-sexed, animal always struck me as a bad thing, almost like she was being possessed by an evil entity. Her eventual transformation from thief to crime- fighter seems like an afterthought, and this is largely what makes the film feel empty. We never get to know Patience, and Catwoman keeps changing what she is. So overall the ideas are here for an interesting story, the characters are pretty interesting (except for the main character) and the art direction and cinematography are all interesting throughout, but the writing can dip into pure silliness (how dramatically can someone say 'Catnip'?) and the story dissolves into nonsense approaching the end and some things simply don't mesh, and the moral is confused and ridiculous ('Freedom is power???') Not terrible through lack of caring, but it is rendered impotent by taking itself too seriously.",

            "content": "The cat-woman film changes D.C comics mythology by suggesting that there have been countless Catwomen through the ages Selina kyle was just one off them. Patience Phillips is the contemporary take on it.I think the 'raters' are being a bit harsh with this one, there are a large amount of flaws but there are also a few plus points. First lets look at the flaws, OK well this may take a while cause there are a few so i think i will just look at the main ones. 1. the script isn't great, there were a couple of moments when i kind of cringed for instance when Hallie berry walks up to a glass door (bearing in mind its glass totally transparent so she is able to see through it) an says ' is anybody there'. there were a number of moments like this when i thought 'not to quick on the up check are u patience. 2. There is a total lack of mismatch in the villain department , cat-woman is like this karate cat thing then she is basically up against someone with really hard skin. 3. this is the biggest one for me Hallie's best friend in this movie is so annoying, when ever this lady speaks all that exits her mouth is a barrage of MTV style sentence's, she also seems to delusional think she is a fine honey, and continuously gives Hallie Berry advice on how to pull men. OK thats the most annoying things on the up side: 1. Halle is awesome as cat-woman, she is sexy and confident and i don't think many other actresses could have been as good as she was taking into account the films main falling point. 2. some of the fight scenes were quite cool, I think it was corpora the Brazilian form of martial arts she was performing, don't get me wrong, i don't know much about that kind of thing though so i may be mistaken. 3. OK the cgi wasn't brilliant but it was not as bad as previously made out. OK thats all i can think of at the moment so i will wrap it up. if you like Hallie berry watch this film, if you are an OPEN MINDED comic fan give it ago. if you are after an hour and a half of not so serious entertainment with an attractive lead and a tenuous romantic relationship give it a go. If you are a comic fan boy or are after a serious film steer clear my rating 5.5 out of ten not great but if there is nothing on or Ur a man with a lonely night ahead of you give it a look",

I read the reviews before watching the movie and was fully convinced the movie was horrible. I figured I would turn it off when it got too bad. 20 minutes into the movie I found myself liking it. Some cited awkwardness as a reason for hating it. Patience is SUPPOSED to be awkward. She's shy and lacks self confidence. Catwoman is annoying or acts badly? That's just her cheesy one liners which all Catwomen have. Cheesy one liners or puns are a STAPLE of Catwoman. Even Eartha Kitt had the one liners. Restricted door left opened? True but it was at a perfume factory. Patience needed to deliver her work by midnight or she would get fired. Was the movie perfect? Nope but it was decent. 3 negatives for me.There are a few scenes that made me dizzy. Basketball court scene had me on the verge of nausea due to motion. Some of the scenes where she was scampering around the walls were hard on my vertigo.Sharon's acting was okay at the beginning but I noticed her acting went downhill when she shared scenes with Catwoman. In their first meeting, it almost seems like Sharon was trying to mimic Catwoman. Ugh. The ending fight scene wasn't believable. It should have lasted 2 seconds. Sharon was a model with no fight experience. Idc if she can't feel her face. All the blows were not to her face. The biggest difference between this Catwoman and the others is that the director used A LOT of CGI and wanted Halle to BE A CAT. The others were just sexy in a suit. Halle scampers up and down walls, likes catnip, walks on furniture and etc.In hindsight, Catwoman probably shouldn't have her own movie. She isn't a standalone like Batman or even Wonder Woman. But given what Catwoman is, Halle did a nice job.",

Sharon like a true professional gave it her best to do this movie which like thousands of other actors in this film industry was paid millions to do this no matter how bad it is. The only thing that was outstanding in that picture was Sharon Stone whom is one of the worlds popular actors manage to pull everything she could in this lame flick which won the Whammies award as worst picture which may have been the best thing for them.

So OK the plot line, as many people says, is like an old episode or thing about catwoman...which mean isn't original! \"Joker with a killing cosmetic line of product, catwoman to stop it\" but this time, it's more \"like crazy wife(don't her name) of the owner of the biggest cosmetic line, going jealous coz she isn't the top model of the line, she got replace. Being jealous she does everything to get her revenge, so she goes to the point of still putting on marcher a deadly beauty cr\u00e8me(which is close to what Umbrella Cooperation of Residence Evil would do). Berry (Patience) heard it and gets kill. She comes back as a Cat Woman\" and I think that;s where people might confuse the Catwoman of the comics and the Cat woman of the movie. i might not be an expect of catwoman, but from what I know Catwoman comic is the only catwoman that ever exist...while here Berry is actually the 2004 Catwoman, other woman as been catwoman, that Midnight has choose <-- This differs the difference between Catwoman and a Cat Woman, which is was Berry was/is a Cat Woman. The old woman that owns Midnight, explain that Berry wasn't/isn't the only one like that...No back to that killing plot line that sucks, as many peoples says\" So the wife wants revenge on her husband and Berry wants revenge on those who killed her. So with catwoman around what better way than blame it on her and getting out of the problems? that's what goes into the wife when catwoman makes her first few appearance.So the wife kills the husband and blame it on Catwoman, Berry as to prove that she is innocent to the world and the police officer, Tom Lone, which she falls in love with, but doesn't end up with him. Near the end we learn that the beauty-line (the produce) doesn't only destroy the skin but reinforce it, making the wife a bit harder to kill than we thought. Catwoman still kills her (who would have thought otherwise?) and is proven being innocent, She leaves the officer and walks into the night with what the woman said \"Freedom is Power\" or something close to that\" Cheesy plot line? Already used ideas? What else would you have expect?And even for those \"cheesy plot line and used ideas\" it is still original in it's own somewhat cartoon version. For those who says it sucks, well find me an other plot line for that movie that wont make people say: it's sucks or already used in the \".old time\" . a plot line that hasn't been use somewhere else that would still make since with catwoman in it!Now for the dead oblivious computerize image and cat(midnight, doesn't look too real, to me) I think it add something to the story, this moment of unrealness and like some have says a comic effect, and that's what they wanted...If they had wanted for it to look real, they would have done it, coz jeesh look at LotR the orc looks so freaking real, so why would they make Catwoman look like a 90's movie if is wasn't for the fact that they wanted that way??And other surprising fact is that she doesn't stay with Tom lone, the love story end at the end, which is rare in movies.

The whole movie is somehow both insane and boring at the same time to watch. The writing has to be the worst things about this movie. The 'story' is non-existent, the dialogue is just awful. I feel bad for Halle Berry cause I feel like even to this day she could make a good Catwoman but, her whole character is laughable through just awful dialogue and a superhero suit that looks like it was made by a teenage boy looking for something to gawk at. Instead of giving us an interesting complex character that we can follow, root for and understand through out this journey we instead just get a cardboard cutout of a person that feels like it was made specially for the male gaze.

And every appearance of Moonlight made her twist the ears. In short: this movie can't be that boring, at least not for cats. ;)Human remark: As pet owner I know cats can move fast - but not like Daredevil so it was a bit \"unnatural\" watching Halle move faster than the eye can see.

If one looks hard enough, that is.Personally, I'd say that one good point, at least, is the cast. All actors seem intent to do the best with what little the script offered them. Which - and this is where we get started on the bad points - isn't much. Believable characters are a seriously endangered species in Catwoman:Take your average, but beautiful female loser with a boring daytime job and about as much assertiveness as an empty glass of water, then provide her with superpowers and a whip. Next, choose the love interest: a good-looking guy with an honorable job and the drive to prove his perfection in every situation, especially if that situation is dangerous. Then, we need the best friend: not all that attractive, not all that interesting, selfless in pushing the heroine towards the love interest (despite crushing on that love interest, too). The villain is the walking, talking clich\u00e9e of a bitter, middle-aged woman trapped in an unhappy marriage who thus gives up on all feelings and goes strictly for the money. Her husband is really just the typical asshole boss who cheats on his wife and spends the rest of his time yelling at employees.Meet the main characters of Catwoman! Hurrah!Sadly, it doesn't get much better. The plot is ridiculous; the special effects look like special effects; Catwoman's outfit appears to have been bought in a cheap s & m leather shop; and more than just a few points are made with a sledgehammer and make me wonder just how stupid the movie creators think we are. Hopefully not as stupid as the love interest aka Tom Lone, who doesn't recognize his poorly disguised girlfriend even as she's kissing him.Overall, the movie might have been tolerable had it not relied quite as much on the sex appeal of its main actress. As it is, it leaves you with a bad aftertaste and the sound of a splashing whip that you'd expect from late-night channel surfing rather than from a movie that allegedly wants to appeal to young female moviegoers.

What superheroes need is a good super villain. And since comic book movies (particularly comic book movies starring Halle Berry in a revealing leather costume) are presumably mainly aimed at a male audience, who on earth thought that a couple of executives at a cosmetics company would make good bad guys?

So I'm not an ardent Catwoman fan - which may help to keep my perspective neutral.I didn't really like this movie but it wasn't so much for Halle Berry's acting or the performance of any of the other actors. Personally I think Halle did a pretty good job. She was naive and insecure when being \"normal\" and she became sexy and self-assure when she was Catwoman. Can't fault her there. I think we all agree that she played the normal part very well - the differences in the perception of her performing skills come, when the Catwoman part is concerned. Whether you like her version of Catwoman then depends probably on how you'd like Catwoman to be. For me - who has never given a thought about that - she played well. If you're thinking along the lines of a \"real\" Criminal who enjoys her crimes and who is also cruel ... well, you may be disappointed by Halle Berry's much tamer approach.There are a couple of things, however, which are pretty bad and ultimately manage to drag this movie down - no matter the quality of the actors.The thing I found most annoying is the camera work. Three seconds this angle ... three seconds that angle ... after three seconds yet another angle. This constant change of the camera angle is making it incredibly difficult to get into the movie. Try to watch this on fast forward and you'll go nuts. Scene and angle changes are nice and sometimes necessary - one can overdo things, however, and this is horribly overdone.If you're familiar with the Catwom comic character and have formed an opinion for yourself how she should be ... you'd probably be better off avoiding this movie.

But having said that Catwoman is a disappointing movie venture.Basically the movie is solid entertainment for the first 20 minutes or so before Halle turns into catwoman, which is when the problems begin.Catwoman as a character is pretty ridiculous in this movie and I dont really know why because I really liked Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman in Batman 2. I guess the one-liners catwoman's says dont help and also her over the top strutting is laughable in this movie.Another issue in Catwoman is the thin story. Furthermore there is no proper evil villain out to destroy the world and Sharon Stone's performance and character are pretty lame! One good thing about this movie is the romance angle between Berry and Bratt, I felt it worked well and was enjoybale to watch and that is why it is a shame the rest of the movie (action scenes, story, costumes etc.) sucks!4/10",

I'd guess the thinking behind this is that if they stick a sufficiently attractive actress in a couple of leather strips, they'll grab the attention of the 13-25 year-old male audience, which will easily earn the production costs back. Admittedly, normally that would probably count for a lot with me, too, but this one just didn't do it for me.I just don't get this film.  Its cause of superpowers (forgetting for the moment that as with many characters spawned from the Batman sorylines, Catwoman wasn't supposed to have any actual super powers) is somewhat ... shaky...  \"my cat liked you, so it made you Catwoman\".  No mutant spider. No latent DNA.  No alien powers.  Just a picky cat.  Pretty naff.And what powers were they?  Not particularly cat-like ones, that's for sure. Although Catwoman would pounce around and was generally as agile as a cat, she also seemed to have the Spiderman-like ability to climb up a vertical wall, which just doesn't fit.Oh, and Hollywood producers please take note- Halle Berry is not an action star.  She was at best mediocre in X-Men / X-Men 2, and dreadful as Jinx in Die Another Day.  Catwoman was no improvement.  Next time you're thinking of putting her in an action oriented role, please just don't.Please, if you value your time, don't spend it watching Catwoman.

However, I respect that it wasn't exactly a picture if marvel, but was it really that horrific?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Personally, I really do not think it was, and I believe that many who claim to hate this title, merely just jumped on the bandwagon in a hope of looking intelligent. I really do realise that it isn't exactly good, and many aspects would drastically need to be altered, such as the following:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Firstly, as a huge comic and more specifically Batman fan, Warner Bros did have to realise that by creating a comic book adaptation, their main target audience and more importantly domestically paying audience, would be \u00a0(wait for it) the comic book fans. For example, people will pay to see Selina Kyle, in a Gotham city based escapade. But we got Patience Phillips in some hi-tech LA or something or other. That's not what the audience wants to see, it sparks the question, who are they aiming this at?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As well as this, the storyline was a bit weak; killer beauty creme? Not exactly the works of a great mastermind, let's be serious. The plot was all over the place and a bit weird, making it hard to link onto one part of the story.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0And lastly, the acting. Halle Berry sparked as the cat, but simmered as the girl. Her performance was absolutely cringy in some places, but she still did have her moments.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, rant over. Now to shed some praise on the poor thing.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The effects were great, and the action sequences were fun and exciting. I do think that, that was nicely done indeed, especially with the cat like movements of Halle Berry jumping around, and the camera angles were impressive too. I also think that the sticky RandB music created a svelte mood whenever Catwoman walked onto screen, and it really helped spice up the on screen action too. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0So, overall, we have a movie far from perfect, but also far from terrible, which is why I've given it a 5, because it really is slap bang in the middle. It's nothing special, but it's not disastrous.",

I don't have any knowledge of the Catwoman character beyond the Batman sagas, in which she is a villain, but this movie tried to spin a typical superhero yarn.  There may be lots of criticisms of the genesis of our fair hero, but what superhero does not have an origin that stretches the imagination.  I was interested to see what powers the Catwoman would have and found it to be evenly done and not over the top.  Hey if I can buy Toby Maguire shooting web from his wrists and leaping through the metropolis, I can accept Halle Berry displaying super agility, balance and leaping prowess. I will presume that her strength comes from her superhuman speed and agility. Okay, I'm giving lots of margin but I usually do in this type of movie. They tried to integrate the characteristics of a cat in her personality. I have never owned or lived around a cat, so I can't really judge about that. Hmmm, what personality characteristics do spiders possess? I guess Spiderman writers just left that alone. You can't take this movie, like the others, too seriously. Yep, I can haggle about the Catsuit--not practical at all, but I never was too sure about the whole superheroes in tights thing anyway. It's standard issue. And given the camp of the movie, why not incorporate a Julie Newmar, Lee Merriweather and/or Ertha Kit cameo! I don't know if they are all still alive.\nBenjamin Bratt holds his own not reaching far from his Law and Order ways. Sharon Stone got her b-on as a villain with 'thick skin'. The Merovingian was up to his old ways, stepping out on the wife. I was waiting for him to step through the door stage right. MAD TV was in the house.  And Halle Berry does a credible job as the sassy lassie in leather. The movie tries to cover a lot of ground in a very short time which heightens the difficulty in accepting it all especially since I know little of the history if there is one.  But I think kids can get some true enjoyment out of this one.  They tried to keep it on that level and succeeded.",

Sharon Stone with a concrete face was amusing but come on scriptwriter - what were you smoking? Berry's transformation from frump to S&M dominatrix was totally unconvincing. OK - she inherited cat-like strength and agility, but why would she suddenly be able to pull off martial arts moves? The costume is clearly aimed at men in dirty raincoats, and the silly pouting look just didn't work. I actually thought she looked far better as the frump - she is after all a naturally-beautiful woman.Since both Ms. Berry and Ms. Stone have made much better films (Monsters Ball and Casino for example), I guess we can forgive them for going for an easy paycheck, but really this is one of the worst films I ever saw.

Is it still worth your time to sit down and see this picture on your flat-screen, your PC, media-center or wait for a sequel? Well, this movie was modeled on the pedestal of a famous comic, Batman, and despite the fine cast and the good camera-work this picture seems even less convincing after six years. But hey, anyone who wants to see a beautiful power-woman will not gain himself a raw deal by buying or renting this picture. Its much, much better than the sleazy Youtube do-it- yourself seduce stuff. Anyway, after Avatar and Superman hit the box-office you should be careful as to your expectations regarding animation. It is not up to present day accomplishment and standards. Why is it, that despite the casting, this picture never became a hit? The actors are great. Sharon Stone is a very cold marble-iced beauty-queen, Laurel Hedare, who is really the boss of Hedare cosmetics, while her husband, George, is not much of a real man. He is CEO of Hedare beauty products. George Hedare is being played by Lambert Simon and is a whithering bore who fascinates young women. It turns out he wants them brainless and not to toy with, but he goes out and eats with them and watch boring ballet stuff. These women really do follow this 'ego-maniac'. And he wants to show them off like his car with driver, flashing the message, I am a great virile guy. He doesn't seem to be, at least Laurel claims. Well, perhaps he is a 'gay sandwich', who simply married to Laurel who is dissatisfied with life (and with her sex-life I assumed after hearing some of her remarks). Share stone is acting a person who is a living statue that kills anyone who gets in her way. Still a beautiful woman, this George Hedare cannot tell a woman when he sees one.But the real heroine of this picture is Patience, alias Catwoman, who is played by Hale Berry. She won an academy award for her leading role in Monster's Ball some time a go. The camera-work of catwoman is great, the animation is not bad, but the heroine was badly served by the scenario-writer Rebeck who mixed in nineteenth century Gothic with Stargate philosophy, Batman's tongue in the cheek humor, and a sort of Mary Jane Parker obsession, for as Catwoman's lover Tom is being threatened Catwoman rescues him. She is at times a nice and compulsory girl, who wants to please others, can't stand up for herself, a real do-gooder. At the opening of the picture a voice reveals Patience was killed. It later turns out for being at the wrong time and at the wrong place. But as the picture starts we know she is still very much alive, well, alive as a dualistic personality, who is caring in a very careless manner. Catwoman's adagio is freedom after the image of modern witchery. She was really made after the image Dion Fortune, a worshiper of Pan, projected into culture as a high-priestess of boundless individuality, with a strong tactile sense and sensuality. Making love to Catwoman hurts, Tom finds out in this picture, his back shows scratches. The philosophy of the makers have turned Catwoman really into a picture that belongs to a period of the last decade, and predating the financial crises. In the decade gone by ethics were merely serving our lust for freedom, or our freedom to lust. So, in the end catwoman does not care a damn about her Tom, but only wants her freedom to do good and to do bad, whenever she likes. That is hardly a program to win the hearts and minds of the viewers. Anyone who is been in a true relation knows that whimsical does not work and annoys eventually to the point of decay. The writer of this story Theresa Rebeck forgot her reality-basics. And the guy shooting the fights had to much choreography in his mind. Well, I like Margot Fonteyn and have been watching Ballanchine, and saw Rudi van Dantzig and Hans van Maanen companies in theaters, but this was too way too much for me, a girl dancing her blows. Is that serious..? Lethal weapon 4 with its martial arts altercations was more convincing in this respect. But boys and girls, if you like romance, virility, lust and beauty served on a plate, it is yours, if you are still going take this picture from a shelf in a DVD-shop. Okay, it is food on a paper plate, you get a bit of burger chewing and no high brow stuff, but on the good side: your not out on the streets doing other mischief. I think it is a shame the writer did not do Hale a better service; Rebeck should read up on her Aristotle, his Poetics and Rherotics, and about mixing improbable story lines and the plausibility of characters. In the end I thought Stone would be a marvelous villain in a new Dalmatians picture.. Improbably bad, lustful languishing bad... just beautiful. In the end Catwoman went for freedom.. a message that liked to imply the idea of a sequel, but also presented the message that Catwoman was perhaps just another egomaniac who goes for sex in the city, one night stands, and self-gain. That really killed the picture and Hale's projection of more sensitive character parts.",

Other Comics made to Movies have been worse made, than this one. What I specially liked, is the mystic and esoteric background of the cats mentioned. How's about making two more films.....

That's where she should've stayed because ultimately that's where the film began to crumble, right at the concept stage! The decision to seemingly sever all links with Batman was a monumental mistake by the producers of this movie, and gave it no foundation whatsoever. A very poor film born of a very poor idea...",

So she indeed was a Catwoman- like Selina Kyle. As for Marble-face, could have been much better I agree but this film contained all the classic dynamics of Superhero flick, not to mention she was the sexiest thing ever in a costume. The feel of this film harkened sort of a pre Dark Knight from a woman prospective. The storyline was decent and that of an introductory film with character you would not mind getting to know further.Sorry you waited 12 years for a Spin off with Michelle Pfeiffer, I liked her too- but you should take that up with her and the studio.

In all of my years on this planet, I don't think I'll ever be as touched or as moved as I was that fateful day. Catwoman gave me hope to lead a better life, and I'm already on the right path.Simply put, Catwoman is a work of art. The people who are insulting it obviously have no taste in movies.

I don't know what happened but they really screwed up Catwoman's story. They had all the pieces there with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman to make a good movie, yet somehow it morphed into this. Thank God it didn't end here for the DC superhero movies. You could tell the talent was way better than the material they were given to work with. And you can't say they didn't have any talented people attracted to the movie because Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone and Alex Borstein are all talented in their own special ways. This movie also seemed like it was rushed into production way to quick because there as some things off about both the script and special effects.

The story is somehow acceptable, the characters are pretty flat, no real psychological depth to see. But on the other hand, some Batman movies for instance suffer from the same symptoms. So what's really disappointing here is Halle Berry playing the main character. But on the other hand, I guess its a good thing, she accepted the worst actress award here. She certainly improved, got an Oscar, and so she might have learned something here. Sharon Stone on the other hand didn't do much better here and it's a pretty bad piece of job, she did here.The story is boring, but I must say my biggest disappointment was to see a movie, which wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.

As an actress I do not have a problem with her, but I do have a problem with her choice of roles... maybe she needs a new agent (Halle I am available!)What everyone needs to realize is that Halle is not responsible for this movie sucking. It's the writers who need to be shot here (maybe director too /shrug). There is nothing to this movie... the entire thing feels to me like a very flashy commercial for some kind of Dominatrix shop in Hollywood. The plot holes are too numerous to even list here, and bringing them up might put me to sleep. Halle, even your beauty cannot save this film.

            "content": "I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie this bad, and I've watched both of the \"Mortal Kombat\" movies. I managed to catch this for free on my friend's cable, so I don't feel as violated as I could if I had been paying to see the film. That doesn't mean I didn't feel plainly insulted by the garbage that this film tried to pass off as watchable. One can plainly see just by looking at this movie how horrible it is. The movie makers seem to have been trying to take the cheesiness of the final batman movie (which, might I add, made it bad) and mix it with a blatant feminist 'a-woman-is-as-good-as-a-man' mentality. The result of this cross-pollination is a blossom of something that goes far and beyond the level of asininity that any work of media should ever attempt.Halle Berry, who I don't like to begin with, acts about as well as a freshman high school student in their first school play (I wonder if she pictures the audience naked when she gets nervous?). Often times, what can help a movie recover from a poor lead are it's supporting actors. However, if by supporting actors, one means actors that help support the lead and tell the story well... then this movie had slim to no chance of recovery. Particularly rank were the performances of Sharon Stone (who always seems to be a detriment to whatever movie that was unfortunate enough to cast her) and Frances Conroy (who makes it feel like her character would do better as the insane Seer from J.K. Rowling's writing and not as the wiser woman she is supposed to be portraying). Benjamin Bratt seems to be the only one doing a halfway decent job of acting, and that is most likely due to the fact that he is once again cast as the same thing he seems to be in every work he does: a cop. With a cast that obviously doesn't have their heart in the work that they do, one can't help but wonder why they are even doing it. And that isn't even mentioning the poor writing and hideous (yes, HIDEOUS) costume design of Catwoman herself.It certainly makes me yearn for the days of yore, when Michelle Pfeiffer played a Catwoman who was more about the crime, or the 'hunt' if you will, than about the possible feminist aspects of being a strong and independent woman. The times when feline prowlers didn't have to prove themselves, and had the nine lives to back them up.",

Bratt and Berry's talents remain untapped for what they could have done. Additionally, the reduction of Berry's power to sexual attractiveness is a bummer -- and what are girls and boys to take from that?  Spiderman is sexy, but not looking like a centerfold.  Compared to Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman's walking the line of vulnerability, sexual power, and physical power, this presentation of the superhero/antihero feels like a disservice to the genre & to women and girls in general.  The base story pits woman against woman over beauty and sexual virility -- what's that about?  Is an aging gorgeous model really a sufficient nemesis?  And finally, is the overall \"moral\" that a strong independent woman cannot have a relationship? These are questions I fear the filmmakers never asked themselves, and, though this movie could have been great, it instead does a disservice both to the actors and to the audience.",

I'm not even half way through the movie and it already makes me this upset to actually write about it. I will admit that Hallie Barry is very good looking in her outfit but you cant base a whole movie around her good looks. Also, I don't understand how this is consistent with what Catwoman is supposed to be like. In the Batman movie/cartoons she likes crime, in this movie, shes a crime fighter?

Certainly, it had some SERIOUS problems - too much use of low quality CGI and occasional dragging of the storyline/plot... but overall I was quite impressed with how much this movie really DID entertain and portray the comic-book world of Catwoman.  I've always loved movies based on comic books, and never judged them for how closely they follow the \"true\" comic book events... what matters to me is whether or not the movie really sweeps me away to another world where such superheros and villains are possible.  On this level, if no other, Catwoman does succeed... and quite well.Sure... the plot sucks (when was the last time you saw a superhero movie that revolved around evil beauty cream, for christsake!)... and some of the writing was completely idiotic (the cop boyfriend finding a diamond studded claw in the living room, then - being the awesome detective that he is... decides to match lip-prints because that just ISN'T enough evidence for him??? Come again????) - but the movie DOES have redeeming qualities.  I never found myself dozing off or wishing I was somewhere else during this movie... as I did more than once at Spiderman 2... and the movie doesn't spend overly long periods of time trying to convince us that the superhero is REALLY just another vulnerable, scared human being who has real feelings and faults (GAG....!!!).My verdict?  6 out of 10 - entertaining, convincing comic book world, deducted 4 points for lame story and over-use of really bad CGI.",

Halle Berry's Catwoman just descends, more or less, from a lineage of catwomen in history. No, this movie blows because: 1) they rely on CGI way too much (the same fatal flaw that made Van Helsing crap). Whatever happened to using stuntmen? Ropes? 2) Too much CGI 3) The Catwoman costume just looked silly. 4) The evil crime plot was interesting, but poorly executed. What I did like? The diamonds in her claws, and the fact that she would accept being called Patience Phillips in her Catwoman outfit (ie - the separation of actuality and secret identity).",

            "content": "In the modern age of 'girl power', the 3 S's - strong, sexy, and smart, were powerfully represented in Catwoman 2004. The original three Catwomen (Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt (1966-68 TV series), and Lee Meriwether (1966 movie)) embodied these qualities in uniquely creative ways. Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman (1992 movie \u0096 Batman Returns) was adequate, yet one-dimensional \u0096 her Catwoman was 'campy' and lacked the degree of sensual sexuality portrayed so vividly by her predecessors. Catwoman 2004 was okay \u0096 Halle shouldn't be expecting an Oscar nomination, but the movie doesn't deserve the scurrilous scrutiny that it has thus far received. Halle's Catwoman is intentionally unique \u0096 a blending of the old with a pinch of the new. The way that some people are reacting, one would have thought that Halle's Catwoman suit had experienced a wardrobe malfunction. Its major shortcomings are twofold (POTENTIAL SPOILER):1. Catwoman 2004 was more soap opera than comic. An evil cosmetic empire doesn't quite fill the all time comic listing for villainy. The current trend of making action films more appealing to the larger female demographic by sacrificing the testosterone action (favored by adolescent males, ages 15 to 55) in lieu of the softer romantic elements only results in taking the 'edge' off. Catwoman, like Batman, is born from tragedy. Her story, therefore, should have been modeled more after Batman \u0096 darker and with a subtle hint of misfortune, even heartbreak.2. It did not feature a major comic villain. Since the movie was going for the toxic makeup why not use it as an opportunity to debut 'Clayface' with Lambert Wilson or as a female re-imagination with Sharon Stone. This one change would have tied together the cosmetic company and the toxic makeup in a typical comic storyline. Doing so would have potentially achieved the same results as Jack Nicholson's Joker. Stone's character never fully achieved a villain status. (SPOILER) When she orders Patience to be flushed, it is done off-camera, as is the murder of her husband. Comic villains need to earn their notoriety.There are three key areas that Catwoman 2004 needed to fulfill in order to successfully make the transition from comic to film \u0096 Story/Action/Characters:1a. STORY (Origin of the hero/villain) \u0096 Establishes the background of the main characters (romantic interests, friends/family/cohorts, etc\u0085), their motivations, how their powers/abilities are derived, and their inner journey of discovery (either good or bad). Heroes are fine, but everyone loves to hate a great bad guy/girl.1b. STORY (Translation) \u0096 (1) Translation of the essential story elements from the comic to a mixed audience (those who are avid fans and those who are 'un-read' newcomers), and (2) A measured degree of modernization since many of the mainstream comics have been around for almost 40+ years.2a. ACTION (Hero/Villain Confrontation) \u0096 The quintessential showdown is a mainstay of the comic genre.2b. ACTION (Cinematography/Computer Visualization) \u0096 Technology has evolved to the extent that film creators can now virtually produce anything visually with the aid of computers and digital technology. The challenge should not be how much computer generation (CG) one can pack into a scene for the sake of doing it (which unfortunately, is so often the case), but how best to compliment the story credibly and not in a cartoonish or fake manner.3. CHARACTERS (Cast selection) \u0096 How accurately a chosen actor comes to personify the essence of the character they are portraying; mannerisms/body language, chemistry with other actors, and screen presence.With all this being said I would give Catwoman the following scores: Story (6/10) \u0096 (1) Catwoman's origin was convincingly explained, (2) Patience Phillips had a life before Catwoman (albeit hectic and devoid of fun), (3) the romance between Patience and Tom Lone was sizzling (who wouldn't want to go one-on-one with Halle, even if you might get scratched?), (4) the story development was adequate, considering the fact that Catwoman as a comic book character has traditionally been supplementary, not primary, and (5) a standard villain should have been used, ideally Clayface.Action (5/10) \u0096 An effort was made to give Catwoman her own fighting style, but I am a little tired of movie characters who magically become kung fu masters. Even this aspect can't be explained away by a cat's breath (ancient Egyptian or otherwise) since I have never known of a kung fu kitty.The CG was a little overdone and lacking at times in visual realism.Characters (6/10) \u0096 Cast selection was superb: Halle Berry (Patience Phillips) embodies the 3 S's, on or off screen. Benjamin Bratt (Tom Lone) was a perfect romantic counter point to Halle drawing from his abundant TV/Movie cop experience (Law & Order / Miss Congeniality/Demolition Man). Sharon Stone (Laurel Hedare) is a veteran actress whose 3 S's have matured tastefully and were uncannily well suited for the role. Lambert Wilson (George Hedare) portrays a contemptible character (reminiscent of Matrix II & III) - a derriere silk wiping kinda guy. Alex Borstein (Sally) was outstanding in providing saucy comic relief (When does the 'Ms. Swan' movie debut?).Overall, it deserves a rating between 5 and 6. Catwoman 2004 wasn't perfect, but it was an enjoyable action film. It wasn't Spiderman, but it sure wasn't Howard the Duck either. If you have a phobia/dislike for cats or you have a pre-disposition for someone other than Halle to play Catwoman, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. But if you're just looking for an entertaining comic film, then give Catwoman a 1-out-of-9 chance.",

Its an interpretation of the Catwoman legend, not unlike all the different interpretations that have appeared in the comics over the years.I enjoyed Catwoman. I think Halle Berry brought the proper \"cat like\" attitude to the role. The character came across as sultry, playful, and very much capable of looking after herself...and the \"pre-Catwoman\" Patience was fragile without being ludicrously so. The character was truly likable, and not just because Ms. Berry is attractive. The special effects could have been better: there were times when the CG Catwoman lacked appropriate physics, but I can overlook that. There was a good \"spark\" between Catwoman and the Detective character, and I actually got to really dislike the evil makeup queen played by Sharon Stone.Frankly, I think the negative feedback for this movie was undeserved.",

I'm not going to research origins here, but this one is interesting, imbuing her with real powers. The others I've seen are women who choose to be Catwoman. Here she is turned into Catwoman and has real cat-like behavior (see the movie and try to give the graphics a break). I believe that no movie actually rates a 1 or a 10. Voting a movie up or down to change its rating is misleading, which is the worst thing you can have on rating list site. That being said, it is NOT a 1 and it is NOT a 10! Stop it y'all! The good points I've gone over. Now the bad news. Weak story, simplistic dialogue and uneven CGI ruin the great premise that I liked. It is a 4 or a 5. But, I would watch it again. Another reviewer suggested that it might become a cult classic because its so bad. I think so too. There is something about Halle Berry's movements as Catwoman, both live and CGI that truly seem inhuman, and border on hilarious.",

            "content": "Catwoman has become one of the most despised films of 2004. Critics and fans alike mauled and hissed at it, criticizing everything from Halle Berry's acting to Pitof's direction. It even got 7 Razzie nominations. However after viewing this film on DVD, I was pleasantly surprised. The film has numerous flaws but its not as bad as its made out to be.Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, shy artist by day, bank-robbing Catwoman by night. There is a plot, but it quickly takes a backseat to shots of Halle Berry strutting around in a S&M suit. While its not her best performance, Berry convincingly balances the two personalities of her character. Its the supporting cast where the movie begins to fall apart. Sharon Stone is terrible in her role as the villain, she either spits out her lines or overacts the entire picture. The other characters are not developed enough to care.While one good actress can carry a decent movie, Pitof ruins the film with heavy editing and terrible use of CGI. The fight scenes are so choppy that they allow a man to stand in as Halle Berry's stunt double. Other scenes such as Catwoman on the motorcycle look like the camera was tossed in a laundry machine. And while Halle Berry looks gorgeous in the Catwoman costume, she is replaced half the time by a CGI catwoman that seems to be able to defy gravity at will. When the lead actress is the only thing a film has going for it, its best not to replace her with a digital puppet.Overall, this film is watchable if only to see Halle Berry strut in the Catwoman costume. Other than that, its a turkey. Save your money and buy something else.",

And Halle, baby, darling, stay away from horror (Gothica) okay. It's harder than it looks. Just do your romantic films and keep the young men lusting after you. And to PITOF, if that is your real name, Catwoman is a villain, not a sometimes villain, sometimes heroine, but a villain. Read the comics and watch reruns of the TV show Batman with Adam West. She is a villain. Besides Julie Newman was and always will be Catwoman. She was Catwoman more times than anyone. And no one, not even Eartha Kitt could touch the sensuality that oozed from Julie. Even today she's still sexy as ever.",

The other is some passable CG animation, though compared to most blockbusters it's not worth anything.Here's the problem. Imagine that the director of a Brittney Spears music video is handed a budget for an action movie, and also gets to write the script. What do you think will happen? This movie will happen. The plot is absolutely pathetic, without any direction, context or motivations. It's like a 5 year old's imagination of what an action movie should be like.It didn't need to be like this. Halle Berry can act. The budget was there. But this is arguably the worst written and worst directed film I've ever seen. It's up there in the rarefied atmosphere of stinkers with \"Ishtar\". The only redeeming feature that makes it better than Ishtar is the fact that things happen and Halle Berry looks good. in Ishtar, Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman don't look that good, and much of the movie is just wandering around.But putting it in the same ballpark with Ishtar says a lot, doesn't it? There's an old Gary Larson \"Far Side\" cartoon captioned \"Video store in hell,\" and every title is Ishtar. I think we can now revise that so half of the titles are Ishtar, and half are \"Catwoman.\"",

            "content": "My conclusion:Catwoman is a movie that is perfectly watchable but not without that stinging feeling of wasting your life. The highlight of this movie is the moment when you realize that they refrained from filming the standard sex scene and left it to the imagination.The movie appears to be intended mostly for female audiences, with a lot of cheesy romance clich\u00e9s, the single female sidekick friend, and so on. However, this does not fit in with the obvious attempts to cover up for a weak story with colorful imagery of Halle Berry's body from all thinkable angles. This might be appreciated by the male audience, but all there is left for the women, I guess, is the \"story\".Also, vast parts of the movie looks (and sounds) like a r-n-b music video and I don't like it.A lot of the action reminds you of Spider-man 2. Quite overdone computer animation, and fighting scenes that try so hard to impress by being fast and innovative, that your brain sometimes can't keep up with what's going on.There is not much to comment about the story. It barely exists.The acting is adequate. Halle Berry isn't half as bad as you would expect from other people's comments, but she won't get an Oscar for this. Lambert Wilson does an exact copy of his performance as Merovingian (from those Matrix sequels I'm trying to forget all about).The movie overall feels very cheap. As of writing, the movie is #66 on the \"Bottom 100\" list, and it deserves to climb to, say, somewhere around 20-25.If you liked \"Daredevil\", you might like \"Catwoman\".--------------------------------- Detailed contents of the movie: Below is the list of what I considered to be crucial up and downs of this movie, in roughly the same order as they appeared in the movie (I wrote them down while watching the movie).Bad thing: R-n-b soundtrackClich\u00e9 #1: Evil company that's going to cause the end of life as we know it (In this movie, it sells beauty products!)Bad thing: Crappy computer animated catsGood thing: Nice visuals. That is, I like the camera framing, movements, and general direction.Clich\u00e9 #2: Fight scene that consists mostly of kicks. Choreographed to display as much of female leads legs as possible.Bad things: Overdone r-n-b soundtrackClich\u00e9 #3: Female sidekick friend to female lead: \"Oh my god, he's so hot! You have to date him!\"Bad thing: Too much chick-flick-feeling (see the introduction of the male lead and see for yourself)Clich\u00e9 #4: Scene in rave club, relying heavily on stroboscopes, slow motion and fast cuts to look cool.Clich\u00e9 #5: Male and female lead playing a game with lots of giggling and close-ups of their smiles.Clich\u00e9 #6: Child cries: \"Mom!\". Closeup on random woman in crowd that cries: \"Frankie!\". Later, they are shown happily reunited. (Otherwise not relevant to story)Clich\u00e9 #7: Male lead: \"I'll save the day!\". Female lead ends up saving the day, impressing everyone.Good thing: Catwoman actually becomes crazy about fish and catnip and avoids water! Like, did Spiderman ever eat a fly?Good thing: Recurring themes, names, and objects used almost wisely in storytelling (like the phrases \"midnight\", and \"it's over\").Very good thing: Predictable sex scene omitted.Clich\u00e9 #8: Police arrive faster than the time it takes to run out of the house.Good thing: Finally a joke I actually thought was fun. Except I'm not sure it was supposed to be that funny.Bad thing: Computer graphics that look like the worst 1% of Spider-man 2 stretched out to 1 hour.Bad thing: Product placement. Amongst other things, a video cell phone, that has far better picture quality than the real life product (which exists).Clich\u00e9 #9: Villain's evil girlfriend turning out to be a good enough fighter to stand up to the female lead who has hitherto kicked everyones asses.Bad thing: Really lousy final fight sceneClich\u00e9 #10: Evil company's logo conveniently placed so to accommodate appropriate landing spots for losers of fights enacted on the building's top floor or roof.Clich\u00e9 #11: Male lead shot, unable to participate in hero activities, not wounded enough to need to lay down and cough blood.Bad thing: The writers just remembered they had a little subplot going on with the lead's best friend, and puts in a 10-second shot showing how that ended.Bad thing: Movie ends after villain is killed. Halle Berry delivers a voice over talking about something freedom bla bla and the movie is out.Good thing: No \"bullet-time\" scenes, or at least very few. It became cool in \"The Matrix\", it became silly in \"Scary Movie\", it was made tasteless in \"Charlie's Angels 2\", and I hope to God that future filmmakers will use this technique with taste and care.",

Every aspect of this film made me cringe. And for the hardcore comic lovers out there, the only thing remotely catwomanish about this is the costume and the title. The makers of this film obviously did not give a crap about staying true to any aspect of the story. I guess they thought, \"Hey, if the movie is chock full of CGI, they won't care!

It's exciting to watch, has brilliant effects and even shows knowledge towards the themes of Ancient Egyptian mythology in terms of cats in religion.So, most people don't like this film. I whole-heartedly disagree! I think that this is a fantastic film that explores the origins of the Marvel comics character, Catwoman, that nothing has done before! Not only does it throw new light on the subject but does it in some style in my personal opinion!Now lets start...When I heard that there was a Catwoman film, my initial thoughts were \"Oh god, another attempt by Marvel comics to make more money out of a crap character\", but I'm pleased to say that I was wrong!There are a few possible plot-holes, but lets take one for example: Patients walks into the cosmetics factory for the first time. What most people don't notice is: Patients walks into the restricted area as she is desperately trying to keep her job. This door is open because the wife of the CEO of the company, Laurel Hedare, has snuck in to meet with one of the company's scientific advises about the toxic nature of the anti-ageing product.This film uses a lot of CGI sequences to great effect. The CGI that is used creates an effective feel of what Catwoman is really capable of.The most intriguing point of Catwoman are her cloudy motives. Catwoman has always been shown to be a shadowy character, never quite 'Good'. Her point in this film is revenge, and to protect the women of the planet. This is in-keeping with the Ancient-Egyptian ideologies of cat worship as were seen as protection symbols. (just research \"Mafdet\" or \"Bast\")The back-story revolves a 'Magical Cat', but the theme of Midnight the cat is in-keeping with the themes and ideologies of the ancient-Egyptians: cat's are protectors. Catwoman herself is definitely not a 'hero', I think that it's common knowledge that Catwoman has NEVER been a hero. In all mediums of the media Catwoman has been shown to do whatever suits her, regardless of if it's moral or not.Finally- Halle Berry's performance in this role brought really depth to the duality of Patient's character, showing off the almost bi-polar nature of the main character to a superb standard! 8/10.

What were you looking for an Oscar worthy performance? Tobey did Spiderman but also the Oscar picture seabiscuit ya know why? Because Spiderman was pure fun, just like catwoman was to Halle, it gave him a chance to do something other than another touchy feely movie. Halle has worked damn hard in her career to achieve what she has. Why is she being persecuted for her movie choices now...no ones seen baps but me...I think her last several films including catwoman have helped to cement her star status..Most of you are complaining about catwoman because you only noticed her when she won the Oscar and not a moment too soon. She has given great performances in a number of films before winning Oscar or had you not noticed. I think catwoman was her chance to let loose join the ranks of versatile actors, playing a crack head or a bereaved woman can kinda get to you. She stretched her paws in catwoman and I found it just as entertaining as I did Spiderman, daredevil was uh sub par even for comic book inspired movies. If you dismiss halle's role in the movie...uh ladies were you watching Benjamin bratt...that was worth both of my tickets alone... The point of my message was that if you brought half of your brain to catwoman than you brought too much...it was action and cgi induced fun and I must say I enjoyed it just as much the second time around.... I have watched Spiderman a great many of times and after a certain point you start to smell the cheese and I still recommend it... why is that black actors have to stay on their game at all times lest we forget some of the great fallen other actors...watercrap-kevin costner, Sean connery-league of extraordinary nincompoops, tom cruise- my eyes are still shut for eyes wide shut...not that catwoman was anywhere near as horrible as these movies...Common people listen to yourselves....

If however one attempts a serious analysis, the film is ludicrous from beginning to end. Although the purring is good, the dialogue is not. Best actress was the horny colleague, stereotyped to the extreme and with lines to cringe to. Only original scene was the basketball-wiggly bum-r&b game with the slightly aged, inexplicably ubiquitous hunk cop, which I thought quite witty.Although Halle is too good to be believed bad, Sharon Stone is too goodlooking to make you believe that cosmetics are harmful.

Prince lack the backbone to stand up to others, and generally stays out of everyone's way until she discovers that a new product has potentially lethal side effects that are being hidden from the public. Yep, something is rotten in Denmark.Prince is then found out by the bad guys and left to die, but she not only recovers but also absorbs some mystical cat powers. Now armed with catlike agility and dexterity, she clads herself in a cat-eared cap and CGI whip and goes out to get revenge in her new identity as a cat-burglar anti-hero. Conflicts ensue, she meets romantic interest Bratt, and dukes it out with Sharon Stone.This movie is thoroughly and unapologetically dumb. With silly dialog, cardboard acting and some pretty mediocre action sequences, Catwoman is much more corn than comic book. Halle Berry is a talented actress, but in Catwoman she acts likes she's on auto-pilot, and only drags the whole thing down further. Sure, Catwoman was never supposed to be a Casablanca, but even a popcorn movie needs intelligence and fun. Catwoman is just a sprawling mess. If extreme-campiness is up your alley it may be worth a look, but otherwise don't waste the ten dollar box office fee on this turkey.",

Catwoman would beat the crap out of someone and steal jewelry, then she returns the jewelry with a sorry bag and feels bad for the guy that she killed. They should've written Catwoman as a villain, like we all learned to love her as in Batman. I love cats, but they made cats out of CGI and it looked sorta fake.

With scripts being rewritten and retooled, it finally reached the perfection point in which eagerly anticipated fans are given a Catwoman that has NOTHING to do with Batman and is a completely different character than fans know and love from the comics.The film centres on Patience Philips (played by Halle Berry), a shy and insecure graphic designer working for a big cosmetics company, who while stumbling upon illegal activity from her bosses, is killed soon after, until being brought back to life by a mystical cat named Midnight giving her cat-like abilities. Discovering who and what she is now, Patience decides to use her new-found powers to find out who killed her and why.The film tries to be a mixture between a chick flick and a revenge action movie, it practically doesn't work, it's like trying to combine Sex And The City with The Crow. Another one of the film's disadvantages is the portrayal of the character herself, in the comics: Selina Kyle is a cat burglar who has conflicting motives between trying to do good and wanting to do whatever she wants and is Batman's on-and-off-again girlfriend. In this film: Patience has self-esteem issues and is wanting to break free from her job to become a free-lance artist, her character development is resolved only in the use of multiple personality disorder. VERDICT - Halle Berry's performance is somewhat okay but nowhere near good. The rest of the acting is a bit hokey. The editing is practically out of control, the cinematography is fine. The storyline is weak and above all else, the film is enjoyable just to look at for a short period of time not to invest in. Rating - 2/10",

Just 2 hours of hair ripping, angrily shaking nonsense! Catwoman could of had great potential however the fact that the directors casted Halle Berry as the infamous DC Villain destroys any hope for the future of all super villain films. I do not understand that some people are so blind to see that this woman is single-handedly ruining the movie business. For the next 20 years I shall not be associating myself with any thing to do with DC. Once again my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. My ears are bleeding and my eyes are scarred, from the bottom of my heart (to Halle Berry) I hate you.\nDISCLAIMER: I have not actually put myself through the horror that is watching this film (Why would you?) I am just trying to promote the fact that we should ban Halle Berry from ShowBiz altogether.",

Catwoman as a character was not as dark as it was supposed to be. Halle Berry was sexy in leather but she was not a femme fatal.The romantic scenes with the cop were very stupid and Sharon Stone is getting to old for this kind of roles.

Now if they choose to introduce Catwoman in the newly revamped Batman franchise they can without this wretched piece of film coming back to bite them in the bum.Forgive me, I need to vent this and get it out somewhere since I have been expressly forbidden to write a review on my own website (cross promotional industry deal with a couple partners... I can't believe we're supporting this train wreck of a film!) The movie started off with some interesting tidbits about ancient Egyptian beliefs about cats and the goddess Bast, that was the best part of the movie and it was inserted under the opening credits. Not caring much for Halle Berry to begin with, the first quarter of this movie is her bumbling about, over acting and trying differentiate the character from her future Catwoman persona. It's definitely like watching a car accident first hand... in slow motion.Beyond the horrible acting by everyone there's the bad direction. Pitof is allegedly a decent director but in this movie his choppy and stylized direction is like watching an 80's music video while wired on high doses of caffeine. There is very little redeeming quality in this movie save for a few witty lines and decent scenes. Definitely not worth the admission price (thank all that is holy that I got in for free) and I'm not even sure I'd recommend it for a rental. Nope. I think not.

She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti- aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever. Trust me this is not only boring but stupid. Halle really can not pull the role. Sharon Stone is just mugging for the camera. I have no idea why Warner Brothers made \"Pitof\"the director.

The special effects, action scenes, and fight choreography are a joke...totally boring, fake, and generic. The final nail in the coffin? The acting is embarrassing. I've never been a huge fan of Halle Barry, but this movie proves to me that she is far, far over-rated. She is a decent, even above average actress given the right vehicle for her talents...but her abilities are not in an elite class where she is able to make an otherwise boring or bad movie watchable. Some actors have that kind of screen presence where they can make trash seem somewhat interesting. She does not. The director should never get another job in Hollywood. This movie came off like some kind of masturbatory fantasy, like a 1.5 hr long music video gone wrong. Spend your time doing something, anything else. Mow the lawn with scissors. Turn the heat up and re-do the drywall in your house. Shove bamboo under your finger-nails. Just don't see this movie.

First off, I like movies, almost any sort of movie, so I'm able to come up with an optimistic view most of the time. Just a note on how these next paragraphs may be shaded.Any who have seen the trailers know that this film is being toted as a sexy, action-packed, superheroine film. Most will expect special effects, elegant fight-scenes and all the cheesy one-liners typically found in comic-book based audio/video entertainment. Even the IMDb totes this as Action, Adventure and Crime.This movie is mostly semi-romantic, psychological drama. Catwoman takes a back seat to Patience Phillips.Most of Catwoman's interactive moments seem forced, it's not that the felinity doesn't seem fit Halle, Catwoman's dialogue has always been a hard sell, wherever it has appeared. Halle Berry gives more life to the role of Patience, the interaction between her and Sally (Alex Borstein in a Romantic Comedy) more real than the drama between Catwoman and Hedare. All the timidity and fear of Patience and the confident arrogance of Catwoman is well portrayed, the meowing is a just little trying.Ben Bratt fits Tom Lone so well, you'd think he'd been playing him on television for years, I half-expected to see Jerry Orbach in a scene or two. His chemistry with Berry is wonderful, making it hard to believe Detective Lone couldn't see right through the leather mask.For raw hatred, behind an unmoving porcelain mask, Sharon Stone shows why she is a veteran of this industry. She puts more emotion into the eyes of Laurel Hedare than many villains have in their whole before-I-kill-you-Mr-Bond tirade.Overall I have given this a seven, with an important stipulation. This is not the movie they told you it was. If you've seen the trailers, you're probably going to be disappointed",

But all the stars are wasted in this disappointment. Although, Ms. Berry sure knows how to work that dominatrikitty outfit. In a summer full of intelligent action movies like \"S2,\" and \"Bourne Supremacy,\" this one is dull, listless, and has plot holes you could drive a semi through. I was looking forward to a decent \"tough chick\" movie this summer, but this ain't it! \"Catwoman\" should be dumped into the kitty litter.",

If you want to watch and enjoy action films like this, I suggest people don't bring their critic minds with them, otherwise this ain't the movie for you.This movie is essentially all about entertainment. It doesn't necessarily want to be the best summer blockbuster ever, it's just there for fun! And if you expect this film to have a witty plot and out of this world action, I suggest you switch over and watch something like Troy because Catwoman is just popcorn fluff for people who want to forget themselves for 1 and a half hours and have a good time.OK I fairly well admit this film has its flaws. Things like some of the acting. I admit I was a little disappointed with Halle Berry's \"sasisfactory performance\" and it was clear that she could have outdone herself a bit further. And I noticed from reading the reviews, people have criticised the plot, but its just there for you do enjoy!! Catwoman is not wanting to go for the BAFTA for the best screenplay in the world!Overall, stop being so cynical ladies and gentlemen! Catwoman is entertaining fluff! It is made to entertain!!

They portrayed Patience like she had a severe case of MPD throughout most of the movie (after the \"transformation\" into Catwoman) and really did not stay true the character Catwoman was supposed to be (see: Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's EXCELLENT Batman Returns) and basically the only reference they made to that character at all is the way they played up in the final scene that she only had one life of 9 left)They really tried to play up that Catwoman was an entirely new character (and new person that became her), and it honestly did not work.

It is light on content, light on clothing for Halle, light on well light...It is however somewhat entertaining as a simple fantasy flick. It's not a 1 or a 2, its not a 9 or a 10. It's one of those middle of the road movies, that is probably better seen on DVD or TV later. It isn't a big screen treat, but it is somewhat fun.",

There are some camera angles utilized which would have been more interesting 5 years ago before The Matrix started the trend which countless other films have now copied. The acting is what can be expected by a laughable Academy Award winner, and the writing seems like it was generated by a computer which was fed every Schwarzenegger 1 liner and simply rewrote them. What really makes this movie lame is the expectation that the public (American especially) will be impressed by a CGI superhero leaping about. We _were_ impressed by this when it was done well and they called the movie Spider-Man. The CG effects are not done well, they look overly cartoony and are used far too much; for example whenever there is a fly-by shot of the city a model would have looked a lot better. All in all, there is nothing about this movie worth watching if you are a film fan.. unless of course you are a red-blooded American male, then at least there is Halle Berry ;)",

Sharon Stone's hard as marble makeup skin isn't quite the Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus is it. One positive, thankfully because this movie met with universal despise the potential cliffhanger ending will remain without sequel.",

I would have liked it better if there had been even one mention of Batman/Bruce Wayne, her arch nemesis/true love, but no; she falls for some cop that is the same goody goody that she was pre-death.

The action was OK, the romance between the detective and her was OK, and the setting was pretty nice.So what went so dreadfully wrong in the first 40 minutes which caused movie goers everywhere to have a yuck reaction? My hunch is that there was too much: A) Mention of her first name. Patience... what kind of name is that? It seems like a name one would find in a roleplaying game, not in a phone book. I only heard it twice in the last hour and that still made me cringe.B) Catwoman doing cat things. Batman never went around eating insects, cleaning his chest hair, and doing other bat-related biological functions. I've heard from a great many people that one of the opening scenes of the movie has Halle Berry doing stupid things like drinking milk and playing with a ball of yarn. That would kill pretty much any movie if what they say is true.So my suggestion: go ahead and watch the film, but fast-forward 40 minutes or so. Then you'll get your money's worth.",

I've certainly seen many much worse films with comic book licenses, and the plot while thin, wasn't cheesy like virtually any of the usual summer Hollywood blockbusters from Emmerich and the like.The CGI wasn't nearly as bad as some people have said e.g. \"The worst CGI I've ever seen\" - oh come on! It was very obvious when they were using CGI and that was really my main complaint, but it was fairly well scripted with some interesting camera angles, was some times quite unique, and occasionally looked great (but not real).There were also some very nice visual moments in the film that I really didn't expect from this kind of film. If you didn't see them, you were either too involved in slagging off the plot, or whining about how it wasn't the same as Batman's Catwoman, or just won't sit back and appreciate the good points that films can have. Suffice to say that the director Pitof was involved in the visual effects of Messenger, Alien Resurrection (again a dubious film, but it looked good) and The City of Lost Children, and that the Cinematographer usually works on Luc Besson's films.So all in all, it was never going to be the best film in the world and I doubt too many of the moaners ever thought it would be when they entered the cinema. It was lame in places sure, but it was worth the money for entertainment and looked great in some places if you actually looked. Halle also looked great, and there were genuinely sexy moments in the film. Even my son (who can be a harsh film critic) sat still for the whole film (he hasn't for the Harry Potter films) and he gave it 20 out 10 which is a few points more than he gave Harry Potter :-)",

Good winning over Evil and the choice that Catwoman made regarding Bratt's character at the end left me satisfied.I thought Berry, Pratt, and Stone did a decent job, and of course I enjoyed seeing Berry in the Catwoman outfits.

What would really make Catwoman successful would be Michelle Pfieffer, Michael Keaton, Tim Burton, and of Danny Elfman. Pitof did not know what he was doing. Has this guy ever read a Batman or Catwoman comic book? Catwoman has always been about Batman, Not Benjamin Pratt. Batman and Catwoman are the real couple, like Superman and Lois Lane. Catwoman's real name IS Selena Kyle, NOT Patience Phillips. Catwoman lives in Gotham City, NOT Chicago, or New York, or even Canada! Catwoman is supposed to wear a sexy tight vinyl jumpsuit, not torn baggy leather pants, a leather bra, and open toed heels. That would be very uncomfortable to run and jump with without boots.I remember going out to see Catwoman with my girlfriend at the time. We did hear a lot of backlash before the movie was released. We went in to show support for DC Comics, especially since we both loved Batman and Catwoman. We hoped Catwoman would beat Spider-man 2 at the box office. But when the lights went on after Catwoamn, people got up and had a bad reaction like if they got mugged or punched in the stomach. I turned to my girlfriend and she did not say a word.

If I was leaping around rooftops and doing all that gymnastic stuff I think I would prefer to have some more protection around my back and belly, and that stupid head mask made me wonder if she was hiding some kind of brain swelling in there.Around the time the first photos of Halle in the skimpy costume came out, I recall reading it described as a costume fit for the porn version of Catwoman, very apt as far as I'm concerned.And the bad kept coming, all those cheesy one-liners that would have been more at home in the sixties show than coming out of Halle's mouth, the plot was wafer thin and predictable, the fight scenes, which in a superhero movie should be one of the high points, were cut so fast that it was hard to tell what was happening often, or else the wire work and CGI were too obvious.I rented this movie out of curiosity, to see if it really was that bad, and, well, it was... However some of the extra features on the DVD are interesting, especially the feature which has interviews with almost all of the people ever to portray Catwoman, and also many of the writers from the comics, all presented by Eartha Kitt, camping-it-up in a good way, unlike this lacklustre film.",

            "content": "This contains *Spoilers*I saw the movie on opening day, and I was originally one of those people who said, \"This movie is going to suck so badly.\" I walked out with a smile on my face, because I was wrong. When or if you go see this don't expect an Academy Award winning movie for Best Movie of the Year, just go see it to be entertained, what movies are made for.The movie starts out with Halle Berry as Patience Phillips, a somewhat clumsy girl who works in the Art Department for a cosmetics company. One day she is scolded by her boss, George Hedare, for messing up a art drawing she did for an ad. Sharon Stone plays George's wife, Laurel Hedare, who is a former model who is placed as top model for a younger model, who George pays more attention to. Laurel tells George to calm down and let her re-do the ad, which he gives Patience a dead-line for tomorrow at midnight. Patience, however, has an encounter with a mysterious cat named Midnight. Patience has no one to deliver the ad to George or Laurel, so she decides to go to the Hedare Factory and give it to an employee, and she walks into a screening of the side-effects of a new beauty cream called, \"Beux-Line\", that know one knew about, and after a certain number of years, your face will completely degenerate. Patience makes a run for it, before being chased by guards and eventually is flooded out in some waste pipes and is killed upon impact of the water. Midnight performs a ceremony where she turns Patience Phillips into Catwoman, a woman who basically has the senses and movements of the cat.  From that point on, Halle plays a sexy, bad-girl character while working with the average-looking, clumsy/always-apologizing character at the same-time. Halle Berry does a good job balancing her characters out.Now for the negatives..1) The constant camera change angles can bug the viewer, as I was bugged about how none of the fight scenes are solid, but are just a bunch of angles.2) Some of the lines were pretty bad ie. \"Time for the remix..\" during the insult scene.3) Some un-necessary CG scenes were in the movie, which got most of the complaints, but it wasn't too bad.Other than that.. the movie was pretty entertaining from my point of view. DON'T EXPECT A LOT!I for one like this movie, I guess it's because I'm a fan of Halle Berry.3/5 (Decent summer flick, go see it to be entertained, nothing more, nothing less)",

Halle Berry is entertaining as the shy, retiring Patience Philips, which makes her transformation even more jubilant. Stone is enjoyable as the aging model, Wilson is scheming as her husband Hedare. However enjoyable it is to watch, there are some flaws to the film as a whole. The characters seem less than convincing some of the time Frances Conroy's (usually fantastic in Six Feet Under) Ophelia comes across as a crazy cat lady and the Hedares seem a little too evil to be true. If you add the slightly barmy plot hinge (face cream kills!!!), there are some major problems for the more finicky viewer. However if you like your films light and campy this is for you.",

There is a dearth of that in villains these days. But it does have it's problems. I think that most people's problems with it is that it's not Michelle Pfeiffer in her skin tight leather outfit. it's halle Barry in a more revealing one. But the reason for it not being the batman catwoman is in the movie. The other problem is the costume. It's just a little too over the top and a tad ridiculous. The final problem is the plot.

            "content": "Alright there are a lot of points to hit on this one so well start small. First, catwomans name, in almost all of the batman comics here name is Selena Kyle. So what does the writer of this unfortunate movie call its main protagonist? Patience Phillips. Nice try but no. Second is the catwoman costume. It is so dumb looking that a dominatrix would think she looked silly. At first the costume looked alright but then Halle cut it up all to hell and it is bad. The movie sucks just a heads up. But it doesn't even suck in a the room, sharknadio kind of way because you get the feeling that it had the potential to be great. Instead they ruin it the minute it starts, one by telling us the protagonist dies in this movie but gets resurrected so spoiler I guess. The whole part of the movie up intel she gets her powers is pointless as all of it just stands to set of contrast for when she does get her powers. And it's not a really compelling ether. She finds this one chick who tells her that her powers are from Egyptian goddess. Then you never see her again. She's not an Alfred that might serve as a guide even though she knows everything about Catwoman apparently. So after that she dedicates the rest of the movie to attempting to stop the company she works for from selling evil makeup. That really has only on downside that it ruins your face if you stop using it. But I mean big deal just don't stop using it because it will make your skin rock hard if you apply it regularly. Sell that to the Military and everyone's happy. Moving on I hope you love cat jokes and puns because they are everywhere. Not cleaver puns and jokes like batman returns and batman Arkham city or the comic books. Nope these are bottom of the barrel dumb jokes that no one wants to here or see. Example she sniffs catnip. That is really in the movie she also sleeps on shelfs and eats tuna. Actually in the movie. I don't know how you take a character that was almost perfect for a movie and just kill it this bad. This movie doused all hopes for future movies about catwoman. Good catwoman not this. This is the zilla to Godzilla. I really do hope that one day there will be a reboot that might do this character justice",

She may have had cat-like reflexes, but she was still as human as Batman/Bruce Wayne.This movie actually lowered my IQ. I dunno why, but I saw it twice, at the time I thought, \"Hey, maybe it'll be better the second time around.\" I was wrong. As for the story, god forbid something in this movie make sense.

Yes, she is no teenager, but she still has the body, looks, and pure evil/sweet disposition to have pulled it off. Her fall at the end was SO MUCH Michael Douglas in \"The Game\", I felt slighted that Rebeck couldn't come up with something a bit more original for our villain's death-fall. Courtney Cox-Arquette would have made an excellent choice as the villain to Stone's Catwoman. Even though she is a bit young to be using the youth cream, there are plenty more victims to demonstrate it's horrifying side-effects. Also, someone with George Hedare's (Lambert Wilson's) ego would have certainly taken a much younger wife. Either way, the movie isn't as good as I had hoped, but has decent special effects and sharp cinematography.

But thats okay. This is not supposed to be the story of Selina Kyle after all. Patience Phillips is in many regards quite unlike Kyle, so it would only be natural for this Catwoman to differ significantly from the original one.The one thing I am criticizing the most is, that the plot has to less time to unfold. Everything seems a bit rushed. That's a common illness to movies of the 21st century. But I don't think CGI was used all too much. It is allowed to use some modern technology after all, isn't it?And for the closing: I have no idea how Halle Berry got that 'worst actress' Razzie Award.

The character's names (Patience Phillips, Tom Lone) are even goofier. The over-the-top cat-costume makes Halle Berry look like a mouse. Worse still, the movie has nothing to do with the comic book character. However, it happily rips off much better works (such as the first two Batman films and The Crow). A scene in which Halle chomps down sushi pretty much says it all. Unsurprisingly, Ebert has given it one star and the film won't make more more than $13 mil this weekend.

Another thing that is just weird is that they said they were trying to stray from what has been done previously. It does change but then they just pop in the \"purrrrfect!\" They bite off so many things it's funny. Another thing is that she was doing so many cat things that she lost a lot of her catwoman class.

She steals for personal gain, and is just....well, bad. That, in itself, is unmarketable. Screenwriters know this, but they also know that Halle Berry wearing tight black leather and using her model strut while representing the most universal symbol of femininity, the cat, does sell VERY well. So what do they do? They come up with a totally fabricated plot to twist Catwoman into a sort of dark hero. That alone cheapens the movie, but hey it's your call. As for the actual movie, It's alright. There's nothing great, but nothing is really bad either. The story isn't genius, but it carries it's weight. It does a good job to provide motives for Patience's/Catwoman's actions. The Characters are normal people, which is okay. Except for Catwoman, and a few major antagonists, everyone can pass for real people.The acting is great if you consider the fact that this is an action movie, so none of the lines require talent. I do applaud Halle in her roles because she really gives you the feel of someone being transformed into a new person over night.I think you get the idea. I give it a 7 because it wasn't a letdown, like say Daredevil. It is hard to expect much of the superhero genre, but Catwoman passed. I don't expect the average woman to like this movie because it is a way to average, but for any fan (straight guy/lesbian) of Halle, I recommend it.

This movie is just supposed to be a bit of a lark, and it accomplishes that. It proved to be a good bit of fun for an afternoon escape and the makers have no reason to feel guilty for putting this diversion in theaters. Halle Berry is at her best as she discovers her new powers. Once she's in full costume, this show goes completely campy. The obvious advantages to cat-like grace and stealth are portrayed humorously in this flick. Ms Berry deserves an appreciative nod for her efforts in that regard. The CGI effects are pretty cheesy in the latter half, but I appreciate that it saved me the price of a Spiderman ticket, having gotten enough swooping over and around buildings to make another trip to the theater redundant. If Hollywood can avoid making a sequel here, that'd be good. My teenage daughter thoroughly enjoyed it and that's fine with me. I appreciated that the producers managed to put another goofy adventure film out there that didn't glorify gun violence. They put out another strong female role model on film and that's another plus. I'd give this 7 or 8 stars out of ten, knocking off two for the CGI and miscasting Alex Boorstein as the heroine's pal. Alex was pretty good on MadTV but detracts a bit from this one.",

Anyhoo, Chastity runs afoul of evil cosmetic makers (no, I'm being serious here), who have her killed! Fortunately, a magical cat brings Prudence back to life, except with all these neato cat-powers. Such as being really good at playing basketball, wielding a whip, cutting hair, and riding a motorcycle ('cause we all know how good cats are at these things!) She also starts actually BEHAVING like a cat, doing things that Garfield would do like wearing tight leather and stealing jewels. Nothing really happens in the movie, but along the way you get these really hee-larious lines that will have you blowing Coke out of your nose: \"How purrrr (SNORT!!!) fect!\" \"Get your paws off me!\" \"There goes my jumpshot!\" (You can't really overstress the importance of basketball in a movie about a woman with cat powers!)Predictably, at the end, there is a, ermmm, catfight between Prudence and the evil head of the cosmetic company, played by Sharon Stone. No contest you say? Well, Sharon's been bogarting this secret beauty formula that not only disguises the fact that she's like 100 years old, but turns her skin like ROCK HARD! So Hope has to watch those nails while she's fighting! But, ultimately (SPOILERS ALERT, yawn) Catwoman throws Sharon to her death from a tall building -- the only surprise for me here being that Sharon doesn't break apart into a million brittle pieces like that guard in 'Top Secret!' Aside from me nearly falling asleep during the \"love\" scene and almost walking out in disgust during the basketball scene, I must say it was pretty fun. Three and a half stars.

There have been a lot of movies recently with their story taken from the comic books. I did not see them all, but this one seems the worst.And another thing I want to add. The character \"Catwoman\" was created by BobKane (correct me if I'm wrong, because I am not really sure on that) to support the \"Batman\" character. In this movie it is taken out of context and by my opinion it is weakened a lot. Catwoman without Batman becomes just a dull stereotype.",

But no.2? Nah, something wasn't right. So it was with great trepidation that I put that Catwoman disc in my player on a Sunday afternoon and sat down with my trashy cinema buddy and a bowl of popcorn to watch what hyped as the worst film of 2004. I mean, I hated Spider-man 2 which many regarded as a masterpiece... what hope did Catwoman hold?Lots, actually. I found myself really enjoying the movie.. a hell of a lot more than Spider-man 2.Sure Catwoman is campy and trashy. Sure it's pantomime. But it's also a comic book. People tend to forget that. The whole thing came across in a really comic book style and was much more watchable than the old web crawler. Catwoman knows it's glossy forgettable fluff and doesn't self indulge in pithy sentimentality. I got sick to death of Peter Parker's moral preaching... I didn't watch Catwoman for a lecture, I watched it to see Catwoman kicking butt.And kick butt she does. Halle Berry is perfectly cast here, as being an Oscar winner, she can actually pull of the range of emotions needed to convey Catwoman's multi faceted personality. You believe when she's meak and timid as Patience Phillips. You can totally empathise with fun she's having when first playing with her new found cat powers. And boy does she look like she can kick ass as a full fledged Catwoman.Now I gotta admit, I saw Halle's costume back at the start of 2004 and thought.. Minnie Mouse? Thought she was doing Catwoman? Well turns out that costume isn't so bad after all. They couldn't keep the Pfeifer one and with the premise that Catwoman is just an moniker that is passed down through the ages, if each Catwoman is different, why not each costume. It looked sexy, daring almost military. A real urban outfit. I forgot the ears after a while.The rest of the cast are variable in their contributions. Benjamin Bratt as Berry's love interest has the most thankless role. A by-the-numbers dumb cop (who just happens to be assigned to every incident that Catwoman is involved in) who even when Catwoman is an inch from his face, doesn't recognise the breasts that were lying on top of him the previous night! So much for police diligence! Sharon Stone is icy cool as the villainous Laurel Hedare whose relationship with her playboy husband George (Lambert Wilson) is an interesting but never fully realised story arc. Wilson's screen time is brief, but he's outshined by Stone, who plays the bitch with relish. At 40+ she still looks great and her final hand to hand fight with Catwoman proves she's in good shape.I was prepared to hate Catwoman. I kept telling myself it was awful, but then instantly correcting myself. As a superhero movie it was great - it pushed all the right buttons. As an action movie - forgettable, but enjoyable fluff.

Any time cat woman does anything supernatural the animation takes over and looks like crap. Even some of the buildings look so computerized that you can't follow the story because your to busy laughing at the images that are being presented to you.Second what is going on with Patience(cat woman's) change in attitude. I know she is supposed to act like a cat and all but i highly doubt that the attitude would change that much. Why does the performance of becoming cat woman make Patience gain multiple personality's which in turn effect the attitude. On one hand Patience is a nice calm girl but on the other hand cat woman is a irritable and inpatient person. And just because she gain's some powerful senses would she really be able to pick up a whip and use it with no practice? No she would not. Another thing the costume. Halle berry is hot and all in the costume, but get a better costume designer for god's sake. The costume looks to fake and I highly doubt that certain mellons would stay in the top with all the movement that cat woman makes.While i'm talking about cat woman, the way Patience turns in to cat woman is ridiculous. I don't know how previous movies showed the introduction of cat woman but i definitely don't believe a cat has the power to do such things. Granted that cat in the movie was a special breed of Egyptian cats, but i feel the movie could have come up with something a little better than a cat breathing in to a dead woman's mouth and bringing her back to life with abnormal yet superhuman powers.Next who on earth would accept such a retarded script. Who on earth is going to believe the writer when it comes to the anti-aging cream. True there is such thing but it does not and strictly cannot make your skin as hard as a rock. I know there needs to be a villain in the movie but couldn't they think of something better then a middle aged woman with hard skin due to a anti-aging cream. Get a better writer and get a better plot.Now one thing that i liked about the movie was the mystery involved in the murders. I liked the fact that all the murders pointed toward cat woman and although we knew cat woman didn't commit any murders it still took a little thought to figure out who committed the murders.Second i liked the actress choice for cat woman. Halle Berry made a great cat woman and looked great in the costume. Only thing is that she tried to hard. She could have lightened up and she would have been a lot more convincing. While Halle Berry did a poor job in the movie we can't blame her alone, we must also place the blame on the director. I feel if the directing were up to par then the acting would have been better and the flow of the movie would have went a bit more smooth.After letting you as the reader know what my like's and dislike's were i can safely tell you that i give the overall rating of a 5 on a scale of 1-10. I give this rating because it is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it was still just an average movie.Those were my opinions but don't let me bias what you think of the movie let myself and others know what you think of the movie. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts.",

Against my better judgment, I finally saw Catwoman on DVD. That thing about curiosity and cats? It certainly held true in this case. The only way I can rationally explain a movie like this to myself is to assume that the director and/or writer and really everyone involved with the film made a conscious, thought out decision to make a bad movie. The real kicker is that Catwoman isn't even awesomely bad, it's just bad. (If anyone doesn't know the difference, watch Catwoman one night. Then watch Pirahna the next night. Don't watch them on the same night, and don't let children in the room. I can't stress that last part enough, you will permanently damage them.) So anyway, it's like the plot was carefully calculated to be as lame as possible. Killer makeup? Magical kitties? Catwomen, existing throughout history as some kind of shadowy, revenge obsessed, zombie group? (So maybe she's not technically a zombie, but it does make the acting easier to stomach.) It is a little comforting to know that ancient Egyptians had to deal with catwomen stories too, but at least they didn't have movies.So for ignoring things that could have made the movie at least palatable, oh like Bat-man, a plot, jumping through the window of the people partying across the alleyway and ripping them all apart, or more cheesy cat references, I give this movie a 1. I guess the cat's out of the bag.",

There is a lot's of special effects (almost all was used on character of Catwoman) and the costume of Catwoman is totally different than the original from Batman Returns or from comics. Director of this movie is not the right choice for it. I think that the movie would be much better that some other director like Stephen Sommers or Bryan Singer was directed it. The story is weak and the name of main character is changed to. From Celina Kyle to Patience Philips. Who knows why. Other characters is good enough. The scenes of Catwoman in action was too much animated and faster than the real person could do it. Movie itself is to short than I've expected to be. However, Halle Berry was great playing the Catwoman as she usually is in her other movies. She always tries to give us her best performance. I recommend everybody to watch DVD edition of the movie with all extra material on it. You can see a documentary of all the women's playing the character of Catwoman from the beginning to the end. If you didn't seen this movie you must, at least once.Davor Trcovic, Croatia",

You rate the Wakanda Forever thing at 84%, a movie so horrible i couldn't even finish watching and then down play such beautifully well done pieces. Halle Berry a super hero girl is so brilliant in this movie that today she can play better than any super hero character you guys make lots of noise about. The power of Sharon Stone here makes this movie so fresh it seems like it was made yesterday. I can and am guessing even some of you guys can rewatch this 8% rated movie anytime and still enjoy it. Yes true the CGI was lucking abit but hey remember this was 2004, we are in 2023 incase you forgot. The stunts Berry pulls off here we cant even see in new movies today. The story was so natural, slow and well confined within the setting of a normal friendly neighborhood, not the multiverse fantasy crap of Marvel. This was just part 1 of the Cat Woman movie series and I believe director Pitof was going to pull off another epic cat woman part 2 movie just as James Cameron did in perfecting Terminator2 from what we saw in Terminator1. But the rush into criticizing this great movie may have caused the creators and actors of Cat Woman to get discouraged from giving us a better masterpiece in part2. My thought is that the Matrix 1999 movie special effects directors should have been put on this movie set, then we could have gotten ourselves an undisputed superhero movie. Apologies to Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and director Pitof for such outrageous, malicious and immature criticisms from undiscerning critics. Cat Woman 2004 is such a great movie at 96% Tomatometer.",

I will say this is one of those bad movies that is actually so bad it's really funny, so there's potential to watch it with friends and have a good time.

It plays like a very poorly written and executed rough draft of a script.\n\tCatwoman is about a woman named Patience Phillips. Patience ends up coming between a line of hero and villain when she becomes Catwoman. She develops catlike characteristics after she's resurrected by a cat after she's drowned\n\t   Catwoman has actors who are good, nice looking actors Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt and other relatively good-looking actors in it. One of the very alluring aspects of Catwoman is when we see what looks like a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. This makes us wonder if somehow Catwoman is set in the same universe as the film Batman Returns where Michelle Pfeiffer played Catwoman in. \n\tThere are so many flaws in Catwoman that it plays like a rough draft of a screenplay. The cop in the picture Tom Lone's last name has symbolism to it because he's a loner or vigilante. He's a policeman who doesn't like to have a partner and he likes to work alone. I however can't see analogy in the protagonist Patience Phillips name she seems to be more eager than patient. When she sees a cat on a roof, she's very eager to rescue it and doesn't really think about the consequences of saving it or how she could save it.\nI also would have liked if it really showed Tom Lone as a loner by not having him work with any other cops' period. The romantic relationship between Patience and Tom isn't very convincing. It comes across as if they should have a romantic relationship just because he saved her and, not because they have genuinely deep feelings for each other. Tom and Patience don't seem to really respect each other by deciding that they should have coffee together on a day when they both must go to work instead of deciding to have coffee together when they have time off from work. I would have liked it better if Lone had an authentically passionate relationship with both Patience Phillips and Catwoman. \n\tCatwoman plays like the 2002 version of Spiderman about a man who develops spider like characteristics after he's bitten by a radioactive spider, and Catwoman in Catwoman even climbs up walls like Spiderman. It also has some essentials of Basic Instinct. Tom wakes up with a scratch on his back after him and Patience make love a similar thing happens in Basic Instinct with the male lead having scratches on his back. Tom leaves Patience a letter after they make love and Catherine leaves Nick a note after they make love.\n\tCatwoman comes across as if it's a rough draft that borrowed or stole off everything else to be made.",

Not to mention how it takes the name ''Catwoman'' absolutely literally and the outfit for her is...well it's a sight to behold. But thankfully, the movie has a pretty banger soundtrack, especially the song ''Who's in Control'' by Natasha Schneider. \nIf you wanna have a good laugh and are looking for a guilty pleasure sort of movie, then Catwoman is one of my personal recommendations.",

            "content": "You know how audiences dismiss DC's Extended Universe movies? Well, these kids have never seen arguably the most miraculously terrible and disappointing waste of opportunity that is Catwoman, an origin story which was supposed to be for the DC villain like what Joker did far better fifteen years later. However, this one features Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a cosmetology graphics designer who gets killed in the sewers, brought back to life by cats, and discovers her new identity as Catwoman. However, the owners George and Laurel Hedare (Lambert Wilson and Sharon Stone), who discover Patience still alive, want to wipe her out from existence once again, label her as the villain, and launch their makeup that hardens skin. Unlike Joker where his progression toward evil, violence, and anarchy deemed believable, Catwoman's villainous motives aren't at all clear as throughout the film she utters insufferable cat puns, does all sorts of obvious cat-like behavior (i.e. eating canned tuna, sniffing catnip, making purring sounds, and landing on her feet), and dates the oblivious cop Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt). Speaking of, how can this guy not figure out that Patience is also the sexy feline heroine, even though her cursive handwritings, cat-like antics, and lipstick matches are so laughably obvious? Furthermore, the movie tries too hard to be visually diverse, using way too many composite shots, ugly motion capture movements, nauseating jump cuts, and glossy metal and brass tones. With Pitof's overabundance of style-over-substance nuance, the movie seems more like playing a Playstation 2 video game featuring one of those cube-like humanoids with triangle breasts and skimpy slutty outfits. Even as a retcon origin story about one of DC's best Batman villains, Catwoman is one heap of kitty litter worth scooping out and dumping in the bin.

This was a wonderful action movie with strong female lead that I recommend to anyone who likes that genre. Films w/strong female leads have a tough go of it, to begin with. Plus there's a general dislike of Halle Berry (envy?) by some. The weakest part of the movie is the casting of Benjamin Bratt. He was ineffectual as the detective love interest. His performance was flat, and the attraction between the two leads was anything but electrifying. Still, he wasn't terrible. It's just that a better choice could have been made.",

There's a bit of social commentary in here about the way women are treated in the beauty industry at a certain age or it could be about a women accepting her flaws and becoming free with herself.\nI'm not ashamed to admit I love Catwoman. For its runtime of nearly two hours I can safely argue I wanted more. \nThe film directed by French visual effects supervisor newcomer Pitof feels like a comic book come to live with its vivid colors and wild editing . Countless times we get insane CG crane shots of the beautiful Salt Lake City and the dark alleys Catwoman prowls . While unnecessary it makes for campy fun considering it was the early 2000s and they didn't know how it was gonna fare with audiences.",

The story is nonsensical, filled with thousands of misguided choices  and a conveniently idiotic cop, who can't deduce that two people who look, sound and write the same, are the same person. Despite all this, the biggest flaw present is its horrible editing. It wants to be artistic and dramatic, but instead when it has nothing to cut to, it will just cut to itself. An editors basic aim should be to make everything clear for the viewer. This consists of an incomprehensible mess of two seconds shots and low camera angles. This is not Catwoman, this is a fully grown woman going through her teenage rebelious phase, because she was brought back to life by a cat.",

I do not understand why Halle Berry wanted to do this movie, her reputation as a former Oscar winner cannot benefit from doing movies like Swordfish, Die Another Day, and this. I do understand why Halle Berry landed the role of the confident Catwoman clad in all black, but that is only half of the role. Berry flounders as her secret identity of Patience Phillips, who is a meek struggling graphic designer nerd shoved in a cubicle. The two-sided character of Catwoman could make for a complex hero and anti-hero, but heavy-handed storytelling ruins that too. The movie implies that there was a long line of women throughout the ages selected for a double life of power and freedom. The movie neglects to play up this interesting concept. How the main character earns that privilege, the transfer of that power, and how she learns about her new abilities fall short. These important plot elements are all lazy, flat, and shameless exposition. The overbearing soundtrack makes it seem like this is all a bad second-rate Destiny's Child music video. Scenes with her male love interest are particularly painful and feel like a daytime soap opera. Making the character scarf down fish, hating rain, and hissing at dogs is also too much, even for humorous relief. The villain role played by Sharon Stone is dull. She appears to be thinking manipulative corporate type of villain. She plans to release addictive cosmetics that slowly destroy people without continuing its use. Suddenly, in a plot hole the size of Texas, she reveals that the same toxic cosmetics made her superhuman and feel no pain. Poor decision-making by the director along with the Halle Berry's lack of acting range kill this movie. I will stick with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, thank you.",

First of all, this Catwoman is completely unrelated to the comic character Selina Kyle except in costume and her alter ego name, second, this movie is absolutely awful and deserves the top place on my list of being the worst comic book movie ever made. The chemistry between the two love interests(Berry and Benjamin Bratt ) is about as intimate as a one night stand it's so non-existent that you can't believe for a second that these are two romantically involved characters. And third the movie is just boring at least with Batman and Robin it was entertainingly bad, this just gives me no satisfaction what so ever. The only satisfaction I get is looking at Halle Berry and that gets old after the first ten minutes we see her in the costume. The costumes, sets and the overall look of the movie are great, but what good is that when the characters and story are severely inadequate? The answer is that it isn't good at all. 1/5 stars",

            "content": "I watched Halle Berry's Catwoman before I watched Michelle Pfeiffer's, and I gotta say; Halle makes for one smokin' hot Catwoman. So I did not know of Catwoman's connection to Batman until after I saw Batman Returns a few years ago. I agree, that the film would've been better if they stuck to the Batman origins. But the acting was off in some scenes and Sharon Stone's character had a pathetic motive and was under-explored. The actors that were chosen for their respective roles weren't bad choices, but they still lacked in the acting-department. The plotline was weak, though Halle's fighting scenes were excellent. The beauty product that featured prominently was badly named and complete bullshit. Cosmetics companies must test their products for all types of side-effects before it becomes available to the public, cuz it's consumer-law, and usually it's an independent firm that does the testing. The product's name, Bea-u-line, doesn't roll of the tongue as easily as a cosmetics-giant would want it to, plus it's a terrible name, unimaginative. Patience' role as a graphic-designer/artist was under-explored, since she assumed the Catwoman identity quite early in the film. I like the way they used Egyptian folklore as Catwoman's origins, but this contradicts her real origins in Batman. The idea of Catwoman having ''cat-powers'' is lame, they could just easily describe her as a very flexible, agile and competent fighter, no special powers needed. Costume-wise, that cat-suit is glorious. Unlike Michelle's cat-suit in Batman, it depicts exactly what Catwoman (in general) is all about: Confidence, Seduction and Power. On the plus side for men, it provides us with a whole lotta eye-candy. The only reason why most men will watch this film is cuz of Halle Berry's moves in that cat-suit. People say that men are only after looks, that's true, but most of us also go for the personality, and let's not forget that women also go after the looks. And a confident woman (whether sexual or not) are very attractive to men. That cat-suit would make any race of woman look incredibly sexy, fortunately, Halle's skin was just the right tone to match the suit perrrrfectly. Her ''dance routine'' during the club-scene was well planned and well executed, her whip's movements was spectacularly well choreographed and nicely done. Halle Berry as Catwoman was brilliant in every way, but Halle Berry as Patience Phillips was anything but brilliant. Her romance with the cop could've been more romantic and her new dual-persona was unnecessary, she could've just ''acted nice'' as Patience instead of being nice, cuz that kinda spoiled the movie. Michelle's Catwoman is a proper vigilante, as she changes from a nice girl into a fierce woman with revenge on the brain and a badly stitched cat-suit. Patience only has revenge on her brain when she's in the suit. Michelle's acting was spot-on as both Selina Kyle and Catwoman. There was an unnecessary amount of CGI used in this film: Yes the cats giving Patience her powers was needed, but the CGI used on buildings that won't be destroyed like they do in Transformers, etc, was a complete waste of time and money. The kind of time and money they could've used on writing a better screenplay and doing better research for the film's plot. In short, this film has a ton of faults, major ones at that, but Halle Berry in that cat-suit is the sole reason why you would watch this film more than once, and she's the only reason why I liked the film. Halle Berry as Catwoman is simply too hot to ignore! I want to see Halle return as Catwoman, in the same suit, but as her Batman origins dictates. This will give her better credibility as the character, plus the backstory is much more interesting than in this stand-alone flick.",

And it might have gotten a whole star if it   didn't share a title with a DC comics property that would have made a 1000 times better movie. It's like someone heard someone was actually filming and releasing Elektra and didn't want to feel left out. But they didn't want to make a film superior to Elektra in any way shape or form save hotness of it's main star. Sharon Stone reminds us how long ago Basic Instinct was and Benjamin Bratt showcases the totality of his acting talent, with a plot the seems like an episode of a cheesy 1980's saturday morning cartoon (Jem & G.I. Joe come to mind). It's the kind of movie that makes you want to put positive reviewers on trial and defend themselves in a court of law!",

            "content": "Catwoman is without a doubt one of those movies that when Hollywood loves to take a dump on everybody's favorite comic book characters. It's just blah...\n\nPatience Philips (not Selina Kyle) (Halle Berry) is a woman who can't seem to stop apologizing for her own existence. She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti-aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer (Sharon Stone) is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever. In a mystical twist of fate, she is transformed into a woman with the strength, speed, agility and ultra-keen senses of a cat. With her newfound prowess and feline intuition, Patience becomes Catwoman, a sleek and stealthy creature balancing on the thin line between good and bad. Like any wildcat, she's dangerous, elusive and untamed. Her adventures are complicated by a burgeoning relationship with Tom Lone (Benjamin Pratt), a cop who has fallen for Patience but cannot shake his fascination with the mysterious Catwoman, who appears to be responsible for a string of crime sprees plaguing the city.\n\nCatwoman is not just one of the comic book movies ever made but it is one of the worst movies ever made. It is baffling that this disastrous mess of movie was made and release into theaters. And thankfully, I didn't see it in theaters. Trust me, it is that bad.\n\nFirst of all, the story is just stupid beyond belief. Like Selina oops I meant Patience working at a cosmetics company? And how she becomes Catwoman is just ugh. At the end, I pretty much knew what was coming even though it was stupid. And speaking of her becoming Catwoman, when Patience becomes Catwoman, she wears this stripper-like costume that she could have wear in a strip club. I mean come on people, she look a stripper or hooker for that matter. It was dreadful beyond comprehension.\n\nThe effects are absolutely horrendous. They are some of the worst effects ever conceive. There is one part of the movie that Patience/Catwoman flies in the air and slides down the wall and oh my god I seen better effects on a computer game. Speaking of that, watching a computer game probably be more fun than watching Catwoman.\n\nThere is nothing to say about the acting. Everyone tried their best with this bad dialogue that the were given even Halle Berry. Speaking of Berry, this movie literally killed her career. She won a Acacemy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Monster's Ball. Berry is so much better than this. So is everyone else involve in this so-called production.\n\nWell folks, Catwoman is an utter pile of garbage that should have never existed in the first place. With the right people involve (like Tim Burton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Nolan, and Anne Hathaway), it could have been a good movie but no like Hollywood fashion, a group new people got involve in this atrocity. It is a god-awful movie that no one should see even if you are a fan of the comics. Speaking of that did you know that the movie bombed? Anyways, avoid Catwoman like the plague and watch Pfeiffer as the character in Batman Returns and Anne Hathaway as the character in The Dark Knight Rises. Just pretend that this movie never existed like Berry did (which she stated that she hated being involve in this \"production\").",

            "content": "A spin off about Catwoman that would follow on from the heavily gothic Burton Batman sequel, or so we all thought. Everything seemed good to go, Pfeiffer was set to return and Burton was gonna direct, but like always in Hollywood things changed and a whole new group of people were brought in.\n\nThe plot? the plot is actually about makeup! indestructible makeup, yep that's right. In this film the villain is creating a makeup that inadvertently makes your skin as solid as rock, hence you are unable to feel pain or suffer injury. Drawback being if you stop using it it will scar your face up badly. So its up to errr...someone called Patience Phillips to save the day.\n\nOh the problems, so many! First up if you're expecting to see Gotham City forget it, this isn't Gotham. I'm not sure where it is actually but I don't believe its Gotham, its never mentioned as far as I'm aware. As we already know the character isn't Selina Kyle either, why? I dunno, so they take the opportunity to make Catwoman black with Halle Berry. Now I don't want delve too far into this issue but for me Catwoman is white, simple as that, yes I know Eartha Kitt has played her but still, essentially the character is white so why change that lore so dramatically?\n\nMoving on, the outfit, oh Jesus! what were they thinking. There really is nothing to say here other than its dreadful, purely dreadful, she doesn't look like Catwoman...a master thief/anti hero, she looks more like Catwoman...the sleazy hooker. The look merely consists of ripped (around the her ass strategically) black leather pants and a black leather bra...oh and the most stupid looking mask I've seen for some time, looks like its gonna fall off at any moment. It doesn't help that she has some hideous makeup work on her too, really nasty looking.\n\nThe film is chock full of terrible CGI, really bad looking stuff as Catwoman scurries up and down walls and acrobatically flips all over the show as if she were an insect, Spider-Woman. This leads me back to the plot idea here. The character is killed and changed into a 'cat woman' by some mystical feline that just happened to be there at the time. Why? not sure, the cat is owned by some good witch-like character, a spiritualist kinda person, apparently the cat chose Berry's character, the cat is a messenger of some Goddess or something. Still doesn't answer anything really.\n\nFrom here on our heroine develops cat-like super powers that enable her to crawl up and down walls, leap from massive heights, be well versed in martial arts and have cat-like hearing and sight....just like regular cats really. So we now know this film isn't about the DC comic book character, its actually about a completely different character that has nothing to do with the Batman universe, she's simply a cat woman, not Catwoman, but a cat woman. A woman who died, got resurrected by a mythical cat and was given cat-like super powers. Just happens to call herself Catwoman.\n\nI still don't really get why you would get all those abilities from being resurrected by a cat? do cats know martial arts? OK I'm being silly but seriously, why would you become a martial arts master?! becoming more agile and athletic sure but martial arts?? And do cats regularly climb up and down walls, across the ceiling and jump out of lofty buildings?? wut!??\n\nOf course there are so many problems with this disaster I can't even recall them all. Berry is kinda OK for the role but she is made to look and act like some kind of slutty diva/hooker. I mean really, the way she walks and carries on, its not sexy it embarrassing! I've never seen someone try so hard to be slinky and sexy...ever! Its really awkward to watch as she purrs and meows trying to raise the average male viewers temperature, its so cheesy, did she actually try to be Eartha Kitt?\n\nMind you Sharon Stone looks awful too, how much makeup?? geez! her haircut looks terrible and the fight sequence between her and Berry is laughable. She's an everyday executive for a makeup company yet when it comes to the crunch she can fight against a martial arts supremo? wow she kept some secrets then.\n\nAn utter shambles frankly, nothing to do with what you expect...in any aspect, virtually an independent film and character. Its a shame because I'm sure this could of been pretty neat with the right people involved, its just hard to believe what we see up on the screen got approved! I think the only thing I can be positive about is the final shot in the film where she walks off across the rooftops against a full moon. That is the only nice true comic book visual of the entire film, the end.",

            "content": "I really wanted to keep an open mind about this film. Even though a lot of people said this movie was complete waste of time, I still decided to watch it... and I must say right now it was a huge mistake. Catwoman is a mess from beginning to end. It's characters are flat, the story makes no sense, the acting is surprisingly terrible and I feel like a part of my Batman Fan Boy Spirit has died away. How bad is this film? Well let's start a little history of the REAL character of Catwoman. \r\n\r\nCatwoman was of course a villain/Anti-Hero in the Batman Comics. She always had a fan base, but it grew when everybody saw Michelle Pfeifer portray the character in the film \"Batman Returns\". Ever since then, fans really wanted a Catwoman movie with or without Batman. Well the film went into Development Hell for 12 years until we were given... THIS THING.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the story in this film makes no real sense. Yeah we have a character named Patience Philips (Halle Berry) who wants to be an artist. But she's stuck being an ad designer for beauty cream. Well when she finds out something isn't right with the new cream, she is considered a loose end and is immediately killed. Then she is resurrected as Catwoman. I have a major problem with this set up for two reasons. The first, this isn't the real Catwoman. I'm not just talking about the fact that this person isn't Selina Kyle, it was also completely unnecessary to give Catwoman SUPER POWERS. Really? Did Pitof or any of the writers know anything about Catwoman? They didn't watch Batman Returns or read any of the comics? Catwoman had skill, not Super Powers. The second issues is Patience herself is a total blank slate. Both before and after she becomes Catwoman, we have no idea who she is or why she is so special. Oh yeah, we get a lame explanation that she tried to save Midnight the cat from a ledge, but what else besides that? Where did she come from? Has she suffered any real tragedy? Does she have any family? Why was she chosen to become a Catwoman? By the way, this film has another throw away explanation on why there isn't a Selina Kyle in this movie. There has been more than one Catwoman throughout the ages and eras of time. This might've worked, but not in a film about a character so iconic that practically everybody knows her real identity. \r\n\r\nAlso, the writing and acting in this film is really awkward, unbalanced and just outright terrible. There are lines such as \"I always knew there was a spark between us\", \"Lassie would've brought me a key\" and \"Cat got your tongue\". Now, these lines might've worked in a different way or context, but somehow the writers managed to make these lines silly and stupid. Even the villain played by Sharon Stone has a plan that makes no sense involving the facial cream called Beau Line. I feel so stupid writing a review about a movie that has evil facial cream that can make your face either rot away or make it as hard as Charlie Sheen whenever he has a hooker in his closet.   \r\n\r\nEven though Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and Benjamin Bratt are trying their best with a script that is horribly written, their acting is really terrible. I guess everyone recalls that scene where Halle Berry sniffs the Cat Nip like a real cat? Yeah, I laugh every time I see that scene. Once in Awhile, Stone actually does well with her role. Not only is she trying her best with a horribly written role, but she's also trying to have fun with it as well. But still, a lot of time  the acting is really lack luster. \r\n\r\nThis film won 4 Razzie Awards (including Worst Picture)\r\nand I understand why. This film is beyond bad, it's one of the worst movies I ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is not very drawn out or explained, the writing is idiotic and there is no real direction from Pitof. Before I end this review, I must address the costume that Halle Berry wears as Catwoman. Usually, I don't really care about the costume as long as the character is well developed. However, both components are really lacking for the major reason I mentioned earlier. Nobody, especially the writers and the director, cared about the real character of Catwoman. All these people saw was a hot, sexy woman with a whip. In reality, she was so much more than that. \r\n\r\nSelina Kyle had real power and strength, she didn't care what people thought of her or how she was viewed. She did her own thing because she wanted to live her life the way she wanted to. And how do these film makers portray her? They portray her as a dominatrix with an extreme cat fetish. That to me, is just out right insulting not only to the fans of the character, but to character herself.",

Maybe they were disappointed that it wasn't another chapter in the adventures of Selina Kyle. No, it's not: different name, different premise and totally different interpretation of what it might be like to become a Catwoman. What =I= don't get is why there is anything wrong with that? We're talking about a fictional character, people, lighten up! Some of the critics are saying that Halle Berry's performance is too \"over the top\" after she is transformed. Maybe for a 100% human lady but hey this is a story about a woman brought back to life by a magical Mau on an errand from Bast the Cat Goddess. Halle's facial expressions, voice and moves, especially when toying with her \"prey\", become verrrry feline which is a good part of the point of the movie. Another point is that Catwoman is both a tribute to female power and independence and also explores the darker side of power in both men and women and methinks some of the critics are a tad uncomfortable with both of these things. Whatever. There's plenty to like in this movie. A mythic storyline of initiation and rebirth, darkly beautiful visuals, a clever Egyptian-inspired cats-and-catwomen through history subplot that starts with elegant title art, solid performances from Sharon Stone, Benjamin Bratt, Frances Conroy and Hembert Wilson and a fine supporting cast both human and feline. Forget the critics. Go see this movie with an open mind and you'll probably enjoy it. And you might even love it as much as I did :-)",

The answer is...NO. To be fair, Halle won an Oscar in Monster's Ball, but how come Hollywood never listens to frustrating audiences wondering why she chose this. No disrespect, I love Halle. Her performance as Storm in the first 2 X-Men films were over-the-line fantastic. But her role in Marvel's arch-rival DC's Catwoman is the only film I watched and so far and when I get to the last few minutes, I traded this movie back at an old Blockbuster Store. Absolutely horrible. Hollywood just got the wrong cast. Michelle Pfeiffer (I howled at her catsuit and her nipples in OG Batman Returns) should've come back and reprise her role. That's sad. And why is 57-year-old MILF Sharon Stone in this movie? That also ended her career and Basic Instinct 2. And what's with those CGI stuff? Did Halle just made it herself? Oh yeah, they made crappy CGI Catwoman a snooze in that awful tie-in video game. I wish that somewhere there's gotta be a porn parody of this mess, Hustler or Vivid anyone?\r I just wasted a few bucks to see Catwoman in New York. If I were you, STAY AWAY. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't watch it on HBO or those other channels that I used to have. I have to say it, but it's worse than Green Lantern. Kinda. But be warned.

But in your next movie in which you are the star?\r Berry isn't awful as simply horrible miscast (lacks a certain erotic nastiness for the role.) and apparently doesn't have the acting chops to make up the difference. One must speculate how the studio felt when the first rushes came in. It sounded so good on paper and Berry is such a big star it's doubtful that any screen test was done. Now the evidence is in front of them and the enormity of the casting mistake is obvious. Was anyone in that room brave enough to admit the emperor has no clothes?\r Now Berry is hardly the worst actor in the movie (Alex Borstien as the fat horny comic relief is pretty awful but the honors go to Frances Conroy as the cat lady who is so awful one wonders if she has ever had a conversation with another human.)\r While the movie overall is not nearly as bad as its reputation led me to believe Catwoman still falls short. Besides acting there is the horrible horrible music (a 13 year old girls idea of what is hip), a lot of silly jumping around the city scenes, and the coup de grace, the Ferris wheel scene.\r Now no-one wants to see Catwoman save cherub face boy from carny ride gone bad\u2026come to think of it no-one wants to see Batman do this either. The direction and scripting on this scene is bad\u2026 Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever bad. If you rent this (or God forbid received it as a gift) see deleted scenes for excellent action scene involving dogs in a junkyard that rivals anything put in the movie. I guess they didn't want any dogs in the final movie. Too close to home.",

Halle Berry gives an unbelievably laughable performance as \"Catwoman\", which is directed by a person named \"Pitof\". Good use to hide your identity so nobody will know who really directed this failure.\r The action scenes are campy and full of CGI that is distracting and looks too unreal for viewers to suspend their disbelief.\r I should also point out that I didn't watch the full movie. It was on TV some few years ago and, for some reason, I decided to watch it and give it a try. What a big mistake that was, I watched up to the first hour and just switched off the TV. I could not take it anymore.\r Maybe my opinion on this movie is invalid because, as we all know, you should sit through the entire movie and share your opinion on it. But the fact that I didn't and found it impossible to watch this movie should say something.\r 'Catwoman' is officially the worst comic book I've ever seen, yes, even worse than 'Superman IV: The Quest for Peace' (1987) and 'Batman and Robin' (1997).",

Besides the feeling that this film is more or less a corny parody of an extensive and lovable Catwoman lore by DC Comics over the years, I feel that this film is an insult to the talents of Julie Newmar and Michelle Pfeiffer in Catwoman past.\r As a compromise, at least this film drives one to truly appreciate the casting of Eartha Kitt in Catwoman past and the casting of Anne Hathaway and Camren Bicondova in Catwoman's more recent years onscreen.\r A final reflection upon Halle Berry's performance is that she at least was not as bad of a choice as Catwoman as Megan Fox was a bad casting choice for April O'Neil in the new Ninja Turtles film. This is a fair compromise that allows a single point to slip through, but a horrible movie is still a horrible movie, reaching a crescendo of disappointment with a male body double, a forgettable soundtrack, and dialogue that I wish I could forget so easily.\r The acting is reminiscent of The Room, but with much less of the laughter and more of the face-palming. I do not blame Halle Berry. Instead, I blame a bad casting staff, a director who is out of touch with fans of Catwoman, and producers who did not scream for things to halt when they were going so horribly wrong. Hollywood is not qualified to create a Catwoman film without consultation and the evidence is in the frightening results.",

The other characters might not get a lot of screen time but this doesn't make them shallow, just not focused on. the outfit might seem crazy, but it actually makes sense: more skin shown symbolizes a brave, confident, catlike character. The shoes actually seem to symbolize the back paws of a cat. Remember Tigra from the west coast avengers, or Wonder woman's villain: The Cheetah.  This Catwoman fall's in line with them, but without fur. Including the connection to the Egyptian mau, and the Goddess Bastet was a brilliant decision. The CGI wasn't too bad, and you have to keep in mind they did have a budget. Another good thing is that it doesn't smack you in the face with DC. If you want a movie with bat man it it, go watch a batman film. A lot of DC characters ether have had there powers all there life, or don't have any. This movie shows her finding out she has these new ability's.  I also love the idea of a good girl by day, bad girl by night. Coming out of her shell, stepping outside her comfort zone, and embracing it. Another good this is it's not like other DC or Marvels movies, It doesn't have a big die hard sort of action, more of a slick sort of epic. The music is epic. The music in the opening, gives me chills, and her main theme (who's in control) could not fit cat woman more perfectly. The cat pun's might be kind of corny, but that's the kind of stuff cat woman say's normally: being able to make cat pun's sound sassy and bad ass. The ending lines of dialog really sum up what Cat woman is. This is a good movie: it might not be the same Catwomen from the comic's, but that doesn't make it bad, just different.

Others might consider adopting that plan. Not that fanboy purism should always carry the day, but it would have prevented this scene from Catwoman: Sent to a watery grave, meek graphic designer Halle Berry washes up on an island covered in cats. One of them, of the breed commonly known as \"CGI,\" climbs atop her chest and breathes into her mouth. Rather than getting a whiff of half-digested Cat Chow, Berry is filled with the spirit of the Egyptian cat goddess Bast. Able to leap around with feline grace, wear revealing leather outfits without shame, and improvise cat-themed puns, she is Catwoman, even though she bears little resemblance to the Catwoman from the Batman universe. It's like naming a movie Spider-Man because it's about a guy with eight legs who shoots silk out of his ass.\r Of course, none of that would matter if the movie were any good, but it's not. Mononymical director Pitof cut his teeth on digital effects and music videos, and he directs Catwoman as though he was targeting the attention span of actual cats. He cuts rapidly, keeping the camera in constant motion lest viewers wander off in search of food or a quiet place to nap. It's the least exciting form of excitement imaginable, and the story doesn't prove much of a distraction. After her transformation, Berry sets out to stop her old employer (Sharon Stone) from releasing an addictive, destructive beauty cream called \"Beau-line\"\u2014surely the most unfortunate product name this side of Go-GURT Portable Yogurt. Meanwhile, when not prancing about, Berry romances sensitive cop Benjamin Bratt and trades quips with horny, hungry sidekick Alex Borstein. In or out of costume, Berry never creates a convincing character, but it's tough to saddle her with too much of the blame; Pitof, on the other hand, seems to draw his inspiration from the Joel Schumacher entries in the Batman franchise.\r Relentlessly gaudy and in love with its PG-13 approximation of kink, Catwoman is essentially an excuse to pose Berry in ever-skimpier outfits. It's all too pre-fab to register as sexy, though, and even the fight scenes look like fashion shoots, complete with anonymous R&B bump 'n' grind musical accompaniment. The film could have turned out worse, but only via the addition of a Tom Green cameo, or an accident in which the actors caught on fire.",

Patience Phillips: a woman who works in the art department for a beauty product agency which produces beauty products such as a skin care cream. Yes, no longer selina kyle: a woman who grew up in poverty that resorted to crime, stealing bcuz it's the only thing she knows how to do best, with a tragic backstory and being chased by batman as a result of her actions. NOPE U get the most cookie cutter cop as a love interest and the most basic storyline imaginable that replaces batman replaces selina kyle. Daredevil and elektra from 2003 eat ur heart out with most cringest scenes and awful Fight choreography and the worst acting taking place at a park same location where elektra (jen garner) & daredevil (ben affleck) (what's with the early 2000's filming fight scenes and playing basketball at a park?) had the fight scene when the cop confronts her except its worst bcuz she played basketball and the cgi is so awful and the scene is so unwatchable. i never rolled my eyes so hard it felt like it i did it long enough it'll stay in the back of my head well it'll be one way of not seeing this movie.this movie and halle deserve to have these awards: Worst Picture/Most Intrusive Musical Score & Least \"Special\" Special Effects - Warner Bros - WonWorst Actress - Halle Berry - Won Worst Supporting Actor - Lambert Wilson - NominatedWorst Supporting Actress - Sharon Stone - NominatedWorst Screen Couple - Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt - NominatedWorst Director - Jean-Christophe \"Pitof\" Comar - Won Pitof was so bad that after this movie he retired with only 3 movies under his belt. Still shocked on how they managed to green light a visual effects supervisor as a director of this movie, this movie deserved to fail not just being of the idiocy of that but also bcuz of ignoring the source material completely and creating a new character instead.Worst Screenplay - John Brancato and Michael Ferris, John Rogers - Won- via 2005's Golden Raspberry Awards & Stinkers Bad Movie AwardsSelina Kyle/ catwoman is my favorite DC character the fact that this abomination shows up everytime on the search results and gets mentioned by someone on youtube whenever catwoman is talked about makes me sick to my stomach. and just for the simple fact halle said she was proud of this movie when she creep back into Hollywood when filming john wich 3. she deserves to never get that attention & spotlight that she had in the early 2000's. this movie is such a career killer it took 20 years for halle berry to seek her way back into hollywood after this trainwreck & everyone that worked on this film is no longer around. also, for anyone that says \"this movie is good, ok or not as bad as critics and reviewers say\" has to be high on drugs. THIS IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE FAN FILM.",
