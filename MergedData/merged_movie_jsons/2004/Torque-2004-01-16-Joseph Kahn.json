There is too much CGI which ruins the action scenes, the screenplay is clich\u00e9d, and the characters mostly annoying. Ice Cube seems embarrassed by some of the dialog he has to utter. This would have been better off as a tongue-in-cheek campy thriller. Sadly, the writers expect us to take what's spoken seriously. Martin Henderson looks lost most of the time. Some outrageously inserted product placement further adds to viewer misery. Avoidable.Overall 2/10",

            "content": "In reviewing the incredible annoying House of the Dead, I wrote, 'Why flirt with the concept of overkill when you can make it say 'whose your daddy?' Torque does not flirt with overkill; Torque *is* overkill's daddy, and it was fun. Just a few hours before I watched Scary Movie 3 and that film barely managed to summon a chuckle from me. Torque had me in stitches before the first sixty-seconds were up. After years of watching 'serious' films with ridiculously over the top chase sequences (especially lately), finally a movie comes along and puts them all in their place. I have waited a long time for a racing-movie to recognize its own lameness and just (knowingly) go for all the over-the-top stunts it can possibly collect in a loosely strung together plot about a bunch of stereotyped misfits no one really cares about.As stated above, the key was the fact this film does not take itself seriously. Take for example the MTV quick-cut commercial editing style, its overly colorful nature in sets and props, the comic-book-ish camera angles, the overused CG for impossible camera/bike moves, and the lighting which left the high-contrast shadows in mid-day. Want more? How 'bout when a bike speeds past a road sign, making it do a Looney Toonsesque-spin, and if you look carefully you can see the words 'Cars Suck?'Everything perfectly matched the goal this film set out to hit, which is basically a tongue-in-cheek XBox game on the silver screen so commenting on the characters and plot seems virtually pointless. It's about as well developed as most action films-characters and plot serve enough purpose to get the bikes from chase scene A to chase scene B while poking fun at characters/lines from other racing films. No more no less.I personally loved Torque. Would I recommend it to friends, family, or Joe-Shmoe who happens to pass me by in the video store? Well . . . for those who watch films with an anal eye and point out, 'That's not a logical plot point. That defies the laws of physics. That's the single stupidest thing I've ever seen in cinema?' No. Heck no. Don't even pick up the box. However, for those who can watch a film where the comedy lay not in punch lines rather in the style -- a film that's a celebration of all things lame in all of cinema's over-glorified chase scenes? Have a blast and join in with Torque's mockery of the genre.",

            "content": "A lot of people think that I love the \"Charlie's Angels\" movies because I think they're \"so bad, they're good\", when that's actually not true. On the contrary, I think they are pretty smart (especially in the precise way they constantly reference pop culture in clever and heartfelt ways). And yes, they are totally silly and unrealistic and goofy, but what I like about that is that it's completely intentional (which is what most people don't get, and is so obvious to me).\"Torque\", on the other hand, is a perfect example of a movie that is TRULY so bad, it's good. Or at least enjoyable in a surreal, lunatic sort of way. This movie seriously doesn't have a brain in its head.In every sense a B-movie, it most resembles those gleefully exploitive, low-budget movies that Roger Corman and Russ Meyer made decades ago, where biker gangs did battle with their switchblade-toting girlfriends at their side. And it's every bit as silly as it sounds, which could be either good news or bad news for you, depending on what kind of filmgoer you are.\nPersonally, I knew it was crap the whole time, but still had a blast watching it. The story is ridiculous and the dialogue is ludicrous (these characters exist in a world where when a girl says \"Nice bike\", the guy says \"Nice a**\" and she LIKES it). But I cannot fully resist a movie in which two improbably beautiful biker chicks stare each other down on their bikes in a photogenic, deserted alleyway (both of them in front of huge product logos, for extra giggles), one of them yells \"Bring it on, b****!\", the other whips out a switchblade, and then they charge! As a classic B-movie enthusiast, I offer no apologies for having fun watching a scene like that.\nIt's really not all bad, either. Martin Henderson and Monet Mazur have some genuinely nice and tender scenes together, and the great, color-conscious cinematography makes everything look so shiny you could eat off the screen. Jamie Pressly is an absolute hoot as the evil biker chick, and Adam Scott scores some laughs as a conceited F.B.I. agent.Also, several of the action scenes are pretty amazing, once you get over the idea that this movie is obviously not taking place on planet Earth, but rather some video game universe or a 12 year-old's dream.\nI wish Ice Cube was off doing the kinds of good movies he used to make (like \"Three Kings\", the original \"Friday\", \"Boyz N The Hood\", \"Higher Learning\", \"Ghosts Of Mars\"...), but he contributes some laughs as one of the heavies here. I do wish he had changed his expression at least once, though. You know the one where he grits his teeth and curls his upper lip so that he look like he hates your guts and steam is about to come out of his ears? That's the one that he has throughout the entire movie.\nBasically, I'm not gonna fight for this movie or anything, I realize it's of essentially no value. I'll just say that it made it easy for me to shut off my brain and I enjoyed it, and maybe you will too. I give \"Torque\" 3 stars the same way I would give \"Switchblade Sisters\" 3 stars. They're awful and cheesy, but a hell of a lot of fun, and that counts for something, doesn't it?",

            "content": "...And just about as nutritious for anyone seeking a coherent story or serious characters.  But being an aficionado of low-rent B movies, I took TORQUE for what it was -- a video game on film that had no relationship to the laws of physics.  Roger Corman would be proud of this puppy.I loved the look of it.  I hate the desert (where it seems 75% of this film was shot) but it seemed so lovely, I almost wanted to visit the locations.  Martin and Monet are beautiful to look at and almost pull off their \"tougher-than-thou\" attitudes.  Ice Cube was dope (meant in the good way, not the dumb one) and the bad boys (and grrrrl) were just too much fun.  Joseph Kahn shows promise as a director (if someone will please put him on Valium); his quiet moments were just as nice as his non-stop action ones.What's bad?  I can't say the script was because it's obvious there really wasn't one except in the loosest sense.  The editing was so in your face, I got lost a few times and still cannot figure out how one character died except he went BOOM on his bike in downtown LA.  I was a bit offended at how all the black guys were portrayed in a stereotypical \"bad-assed-muthaf**kah\" way as opposed to the cool as cucumber confidence of \"the lead three and she\" and the \"we're refugees from MAD MAX\" baddies.Let's put it this way -- cotton candy is probably the worst thing you can put in your body in the way of anything edible, but if you got a craving for it, nothing else will do.  And that's TORQUE, to the \"max.\"",

            "content": "What's with the hate for this movie? Why can't people just take this movie for what it is? This movie is just simply good B-movie action entertainment. Its obviously no Oscar material, no but did you seriously expected it to be? At least it doesn't take itself as serious as both the Fast and the Furious movies did. You know that when you are going to watch a movie like \"Torque\" you are going to see a bad story with some second rate actors but with some nice action.And this movie surely has some nice action. The motorcycle sequences are surprising good and tense. Most of the stunts were nicely choreographed and the movie has some nice camera tricks and nice editing. It's obvious when watching this movie that Joseph Kahn is a music video director but that certain style works perfect for a fast paced movie like this. Joseph Kahn seems like a talented and well motivated director, of which I'm sure we will hear more of in the future. Yeah sure, the ending is pretty bad and fake looking but it didn't ruined the movie for me in any way. I was entertained throughout the entire movie by some nice action.The movie has a bit of an awkward kind of humor, which they should had left out in my opinion. The script is not very well written but still the actors pull it of to make their characters likable and give them a personality. Would I mind seeing \"Torque 2\"? Most certainly not! I would rather see a \"Torque 2\" than a \"The Fast and the Furious 3\".Really, just give this movie a chance, you might very well end up liking it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Released in 2004, \"Torque\" cost $40 million and only made a little over half back at the USA box office. It's therefore not a very well-known film, but its gained a hardcore cult following in the years since. After viewing it I can see why.I thought it was going to be terrible, but it was actually great! The action goods are all there, but five minutes into it I got the joke and was laughing with it and not at it. I don't think \"Torque\" will appeal to everyone, but it will get two types for sure: action gearheads who just want a solid uncomplicated action picture, and smart viewers who can appreciate clever filmmaking and the in-jokes threaded throughout. I fall under the second bracket since I generally loathe mindless action flicks. What takes \"Torque\" beyond mindless physics-defying action is pointed out above: the film is cleverly made and filled with hilarious in-jokes. Director Joseph Kahn has a history in flashy music videos and this comes across on the screen. It's pure eye-candy from beginning to end with all manner of entertaining tidbits, like the brief close-up of the turtle between the racing cars at the very beginning.The look & vibe is pure comic book come to life. Every shot, facial expression, action scene, confrontation, word, set, pose, etc. reflects this. The bikes are mostly crotch rockets but there are all kinds. The guys are coolness personified and the girls are hotness incarnated. The cast is highlighted by Martin Henderson as the worthy protagonist and Monet Mazur as his babe. Ice Cube is great as the leader of a black gang, while Matt Schulze and Jaime Pressly play the villains. There are also a couple of FBI agents in the mix.The cinematography is gorgeous, shot in the desolate regions of S. California.The film takes no prisoners at a brief 84 minutes. This is good since films of this ilk shouldn't overstay their welcome.Believe it or not, there's actually some depth to the characters and storyline; we see glimpses of courage, love, friendship, repentance, respect, sacrifice and loyalty. If they would have upped the depth and offered some moving epic parts I would have easily given the film a top rating of 9/10 Stars.But it works fine as is. It is what it is -- perhaps the ultimate cult action film ever made, pulsating with energy, creativity and excitement.GRADE: B+ or A-",

However, my canary in the coal mine in these situations is my husband. If he finds one of these films unwatchable, then it truly is bad, and not just so bad it is good. This was the case with \"Torque\". I tried to appreciate the stunts and the occasional humor that did work such as the truck from \"Duel\" still chasing Dennis Weaver after all these years, but it just can't compensate for a lame plot and dialogue that sounds like it was written by the reincarnation of Ed Wood. I think a somewhat rearranged quote from \"Billy Madison\", another silly man's movie that I actually enjoy if I'm in the mood for it, is most appropriate at this point: \"At no point in your rambling, incoherent (movie) were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having (watched) it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.\"",

We were the target audience. \"Torque\" hit a bullseye for us. So if you're not a teenage boy or a B-movie lunatic, avoid \"Torque\". If you fit into the profile audience for an insane biker flick, see this movie immediately.\"Torque\" is hilarious. I was cheering through the whole thing. It wasn't just the stunts that had me going. It was the dialogue as well. When the main biker tries to make up with his girlfriend who he ditched he says, \"I wrote letters.\" She says, \"I made fires.\" I just had a laughing fit writing that.Ice Cube shows up as the angriest biker in the world. He has a permanent scowl on his face. Just looking at him had me laughing. All the macho elements of a biker flick are on proud display. The hard rock was cranked up as the bikers did battle. There was Kid Rock and Static-X. It was a hard rock party. I had a good time.Speaking of Static-X, the last scene with super hot Jaime Pressly has \"Push it\" blasting away as she does battle with the main blonde biker. Ah Jaime. What a special effect you are. Good Lord, she can squeeze into a pair of leather pants. Gotta love it.",

For its action moments that seems to come in every 5-10 minutes of the movie. If not for the action this movie would be dull. Martin Henderson seems to do allright, and so does Ice Cube. But it's Monet Mazur, who seems to have a great blend of beauty and toughness in her role. I think she can have a great career ahead of her. The action was awesome, but acting was dull.

Maybe that's also why i actually found this movie to be mildly entertaining? The closest movie references here seemed to be the \"Fast and the furious\"-movies, at least before the movie started. But while the setting is not unlike those movies (criminal gangs racing each other in custom vehicles) there was still a big difference in how the movies played out. First of all i like the style of \"Torque\" a lot better. Granted, the over-the-top racing sequences with quite a lot of CGI tucked in to create the illusion of speed are too much many times. But still, there is a certain style and feeling here that actually makes it work pretty well.The beginning of the movie almost made me give up though. The \"hero\" arrives at a biker meet where women with more silicone than natural tissue greet him and it almost becomes too much to bear. But when the obligatory naked skin passes by the action picks up, and so does the entertainment. Don't be mistaken, this movie is a hopelessly juvenile testosterone-fest. But in the genre it's not too bad.So if you like fast bikes and fast paced racing this might just be your choice for the Friday night entertainment. Easily digested, easily forgotten, but a fun ride while it lasts. I rate this 5/10.",

What were the producers thinking when they decided to spend 40 million on this? The extremely thin plot revolves around our \"hero\", Ford, who is set up for a murder by the bad guy. The guy killed is the brother of our anti\"hero\", Trey, who of course isn't so bad after all. Then there is a twist involving the FBI cop, but if you couldn't see it coming a mile away, then this is your first movie.There were many outrageous stunts in this. OK, I could get past two guys jumping a ramp onto a moving train and then driving through the train cars. And racing through a bunch of trees without getting killed. And I can even get past the ridiculous fight on motorcycles between the two girls. But the last 15 minutes where it looked like a video game was too much. It was so silly, them saying this bike could go over 200 mph, and then he does it through crowded city streets. Someone would be dead in seconds from running into something.But, I must give props to Martin Henderson. He was very hot and I never heard of him before. Hopefully, he'll get more mainstream movie roles because I sure don't mind looking at him for a couple of hours.FINAL VERDICT: If you like movies with ridiculous stunts, then this one is for you.

            "content": "Made by people who realise how ridiculous and excessive the average Hollywood action movie has become, Torque revels in the glorious absurdities of the genre, while simultaneously poking fun at the outlandishness of it all (for other examples that adopt the same approach, see Con Air, the Charlie's Angels movies, and the more subtle & misunderstood Escape From LA). Make no mistake, this film is - intentionally - a shiny, multicoloured live-action cartoon that has as little to do with reality as the average press conference by the Bush Administration.In this movie, every action set-piece breaks several different laws of physics. Bikes don't just crash in Torque - they explode into fireballs with such ferocity that anyone nearby is thrown twenty feet into the air. Chases through city streets are conducted at such intense speed that bystanders are blown over and car windows shatter. Product placement isn't sneaked into the background, but blatantly placed at centre-stage. Every male in the film is either handsome & slim, or bulky & menacing, while all the women are centrefold material. It's the kind of movie where a bad-ass like Trey (Ice Cube) somehow manages to lead a gang of outlaw bikers who control most of the crime in downtown LA, while refusing to deal drugs or have drugs sold on his turf. It's the sort of film in which the hero proves he's innocent of murder (when in fact his alleged 'evidence' would never stand up in court) and is promptly allowed to walk away without even giving a statement to the police, despite the fact that during the course of the movie he's stolen several vehicles, been responsible for the deaths of numerous bad guys, and caused an immense amount of property damage. It's not meant to be taken seriously for a second, and if you keep that in mind, it's a lot of fun.Since all the characters are barely two dimensional stereotypes, the cast is hardly taxed, but do what they can with what they're given. Martin Henderson as the hero is bland, but not as wooden as he could have been, while Monet Mazir as his girl (and the world's most glamorous mechanic) is fairly spunky. Will Yun Lee (from Witchblade and Die Another Day) and Jay Hernandez draw the short straws as Henderson's sidekicks: they have so little to do that there seems no point having them in the movie, and you wonder why their characters weren't written out while the script was in development. Matt Schulze as chief villain Henry James is surprisingly low key, considering his cocky, swaggering turn in The Transporter, but still makes an effective nemesis. One of those actors clearly born to play bad guys, Schulze could become the Christopher Walken of the 21st century if he plays his cards right. In fact, none of the cast truly disgrace themselves, and the only false note is skinny Brit actor Max Beesley, bizarrely miscast as James's right-hand enforcer.However, the movie's one star turn is provided by Jaime Pressly as China, James's girl. Even though she's only on screen for about 15 minutes throughout and has about five lines of dialogue, when Pressly turns up you can't look at anything else. And I'm not talking about the fact that she's undeniably easy on the eye or clad in barely-there leathers - this girl has star quality. With her face set in a permanent sneer amongst an explosion of piercings and tattoos, China is the Biker Vixen from Hell, and Pressly doesn't just steal this movie - she rules it.",

The cops think he's a drug dealer and the real dealer wants the motorcycles that Ford was to deliver to him not to mention his girl (Monet Mazur \u0096 yum) has written him off. To add to Ford's problems a rival bike gang wants his head on a spit for the killing of the leader's (Ice Cube) brother. He will need all the bike skills in the world to fight his way out of this mess.Hot on the heel of \"The Fast and the Furious\", \"Torque\" is the motorcycle equivalent. The film is one clich\u00e9 after the other. But it is loud and the cast is likable. Good looking bad boys and deadly and gorgeous bad girls are all over the place but hey a film like this is all glitz with little substance. The film has unbelievable action sequences that make James Bond look real but are presented in a decent enough way that made me enjoy the film for what it is\u0085good dumb fun.",

The action goods are all there, but five minutes into it I got the joke and was laughing with it (not at it). I don't think this movie will appeal to everyone, but it will get two types for sure: action gearheads who just want a solid uncomplicated action picture, and smart viewers who can appreciate clever film-making and the in-jokes threaded throughout. After seeing the cameo of Dennis Weaver still being chased by the truck from Duel after thirty years, I was won over by the Torque's own charms. First of all it the director, cinematographer, and editor did a great job. This film looks incredible. For those of you who actually care about film-making, this film is densely loaded with interesting angles and techniques that somehow manage to work as a cohesive style. I love the way Joseph Kahn stages scenes. It's very creative and he has a sharp sense of timing - action and comedywise. An overlooked first effort and I would like to see more from him. Second, I thought Martin Henderson as Cory Ford did a solid job as your typical running from the law good guy. I liked his charisma and hope he does more action flicks. There are some standout sequences but my favorites are the opening car chase, the train sequence, the freeway, and the surreal, over-the-top Playstation style ending. What's great is that each has its own feel so that there is no sense of repetition. You feel like each chase brings something new to the table, unlike other ilk of this genre. Need I say anything about the women in this film? Wow. I would let Jaime Pressly ride my bike anytime she wants. A word about the bad reviews here: ignore them. The film is too good as an action movie to be dismissed - what are the looking for, Cold Mountain? Disregard anyone who complains about the \"pepsi product placement\" for that is most definitely someone who did not get the joke (two motorcycle dominatrix chicks staged opposite from each other under big prominent soft drink signs - classic!). I think the movie suffers from a minor contradiction - it's script is too dumb, but it's film-making is too smart. Yes, the story is crap, but you don't watch a motorcycle chase movie for STORY. If you sit back and enjoy this modern riff on Roger Corman, you might find a smile on your face. If you have the ability to appreciate the sly wit of smart visual film-making, you could find yourself cheering like I did. Worst movie ever? Ridiculous. Three 1/2 out of five stars, maybe more.",

How is there so much money put into a bad rip-off of any given bad biker exploitation drive-in flick from the 50's or 60's?  The plot is near non-existent, mostly giving Ice Cube time to give him one-faced/voiced performance (which isn't that good considering the script, anyway), and for scenes of chases and violence and rage that have no conviction or thrilling moments whatsoever.  I'm not even sure who would WANT to go see this movie, unless they're dragged to it by a movie-goer who doesn't know better.  Bottom line, I'd rather watch a Roger Corman type of biker film from the old days- they may have been cheap, shlocky entertainment, but at least they knew it and had fun with it.  Torque is one of those action-movie nightmares where you can sense all the actors and extras and stunt-people just wanting the movie to end so they can go on with their lives.  Neal H.

With all due respect to Mr. Cube, this is not a great movie. Really.The only other recognizable name is Jaime Pressly, who was recently featured in \"Playboy\"-- promoting the movie no less. However, director Joseph Kahn does have his flashes of brilliance: provides a great-looking cast, and moves so quickly we almost don't notice the lack of story. In Matt Johnson's embryonic script, hunk Martin Henderson plays biker outlaw, Ford, who returns from Thailand exile to recover 2 motorcycles-- I seem to recall. Anyway, the real reason for his return is getting back with his old flame, Shane, played by the very hot Monet Mazur. Honestly, Henderson, Monet, and Ice Cube do their best with card board character representations.Kahn keeps our interest with CGI effects, and radical motorcycle stunts. And his cinematic highlight is a romantic scene with Henderson and Monet on a playground merry-go-round with Monet's thong straps hiked up above her jeans. Now that is genius. Who really needs special effects to tell a story? \"Torque\" smartly never takes itself seriously. This works, because no one will.",

The plot is an excuse for grotesque set-pieces and impossibly fast bike chases (one of them in a train. Yes. Not \"on\". \"In\"!), that set a new record in stupidity but have enough implausibility, cartoon violence and sense of their own foolishness to make this all wonderfully entertaining in a weird way. In terms of story, this is really a western on motorcycles, where lead character Henderson comes back in town to set the record straight, win back his chick (feisty Masur) and kill off a few bad guys (and one very bad girl). All the while being threatened and insulted by Ice Cube on top form.The soundtrack is loud, the mostly dodgy CGI is used to full and fun effect, the characters are preposterous and one-dimensional and the photography and editing make this look like a pumped up MTV video times ten! (bring your barf-bag along!). The great part is that this is all a big joke and that everyone is in on it. The film is beyond being ratable.

Then there's Torque which very well may have defined a new term of \"bad\".For those previous comments who argue that this is a B-Movie and that viewers should \"lighten up\" - you need to look up your definitions. A B movie is low budget. This was obviously not low budget. I would have to lighten up to the degree of being an overexposed photograph of the kid from Powder to even watch another minute of this film again.There is something about cult or campy flicks that is difficult to explain. On paper or at face value a campy movie can be bad but there's a sense of \"fun\" in it. You can watch Faster Pussycat Kill Kill and think that they actually had fun filming it AND screening it. You watch Torque and you think that on day 33 of the shoot it must have been painful beyond belief for the crew to answer their alarm clocks.Torque doesn't work in ANY labeling of film. It isn't low budget. It doesn't feel campy. It isn't even funny bad. Unless the real life actors are complete idiots in real life they must have been downright embarrassed by this. It paid their bills though.There is ZIP for any sort of conversation that even mildly could be construed as entertaining. The editing is a total MTV hyperkenetic ADD disaster. The stunts are neither even remotely plausible or interesting. The love interest scenario was as clich\u00e9 as possible. Ice Cube couldn't act his way out of a styrofoam cup in any movie previously and it still shows.I feel that this movie was literally a physical challenge to watch.

Its pretty obvious, even though you can't really take stuff like that serious.There are a lot of errors in this film as well, but what I didn't like about this film is that it focuses too much on the bikes and vehicles. Believe me when I say that this has nothing else to offer then people racing against each other with a very thin plot about a guy who gets framed for a murder he didn't commit. Thats basically the entire premise of this movie, so if you are not into bikes and cars (yes those people exist) then you can scratch this movie from your list now.One aspect that was not that bad was the use of CGI to create a kind of hyperdrive-feeling during some of the driving/chase scenes. But again, this feels like a bike-commercial quickly. Hell, they could paste a Yamaha-logo at the end of a driving-sequence in Torque and there you go; a perfect TV-commercial.The characters also are nothing different from the typical Hollywood-stuff, and they are just as thin as the plot they are representing. The acting could be worse, but the dialog is the most awful and laughable tripe you will ever hear.

Now here's some questions for me and the anwsers.  Is Torque stupid? absolutely possibly one of the dumbest films ever made.  Is this a bad movie? yes.  How's the acting? Bad to mediocre.  Hows the spfx and action? Pretty unbelievable but undeniably colorful.  The dialogue? What do you think? Is Torque fun? Absolutely it's one hell of a wild ride! I truly don't know what audiences expect after indulging themselves in such stupididty as Armageddon, Independence Day, Both Fast and Furious films, Bad Boys flicks and countless others. This film has everything those films had plus some creative action touches and a stellar hot cast.  Martin Henderson, Jay Hernandez, and Jamie Presley are some of the hottest things on film this decade. They wear those clothes so well.  The action scenes are slightly above PG 13 ish and although unbelievable they're undeniably creative and colorfully spunky.

Good luck with all that.As for the ending, with a jet-bike in city traffic, there are no words for how moronic that was.To top it off: Fat-boy Ice-cube on a bike? Really? REALLY? I don't think so. At best he could drive a 15hp chopper around town in about 20 mph so all his \"bling-bling\" won't fall off. Be careful to not get that too-long basketball-shirt, or the shoelaces from your untied shoes, stuck in the chain. It wouldn't be pretty. And the rest of his \"cool-boy rapper-biker-gang\" was just as believable as that 300mph-through-city-traffic-wearing-no-helmet ending. This is just another example of what's wrong with todays \"movies\". Who cares about realism and a plot, as long as it's \"cool\" and \"awesome\", and the actors curses a lot and makes degrading comments about women, and wears a lot of \"bling-bling\". It's not even bad, it's not even laughable, but it sure brings on a whole new level of stupid. What a waste of money, time and resources.",

The film just hacked me off too much to give it another star. Why? Just about everything else was too stupid, clich\u00e9, unrealistic, trendy and meaningless. After watching the first 15 minutes of this \"turd with handlebars\", I wanted punch every character in the face. I can't imagine real people acting so arrogant and pretentious and living to tell the tale. And as usual, Ice Cube puts on his patented \"constant anger\" face. And the comical one-liners put The Fast And The Furious to shame. Is this acting, or just another means to a Hollywood paycheck? Probably the latter. If this film is meant to parody the genre, then the parody part must have been used for toilet paper. If it is to be taken seriously, then it should be flushed down the toilet the producers sat on when they thought this one up. MTV would be proud of this attempt to further spread mindless, hypnotizing pop culture to the masses. Jaime Pressley is a hot one in her kinky attire, but I'd still rather sniff dog turds than sit through this crap. Terrible.",

In \"Torque\" he hasn't lost his touch with the attitude. Despite the racial slurs, language, and violence, it didn't faze me one bit. When Martin Henderson character Ford discovers the set up by his rival, he don't play around. And Ford knows how to do that. The stunts were awesome, the wreck scenes were a riot, especially the Hummer crushing the car upside-down! The turncoat FBI agent got what he deserve for betraying Ford.

            "content": "After avoiding the life of the motorcycle gangs, long-time biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) returns home, only to become at odds with the leaders of two gangs, the Hellions and the Reapers. The latter is led by Trey (Ice Cube) who thinks Cary killed his younger brother, when the leader of the former gang frames Ford for it. With the help of his friends, Ford must outrace the two vengeful biker gangs, as well as the FBI, in order to prove his good name and live to ride again.The film is pretty much as silly as the plot sounds. I saw Torque in theaters and while its not worth nine bucks to watch its still better than some people are saying it is. It's certainly not bottom 100 bad and deserves a higher rating something around a 4.1 maybe. Torque is the type of movie that you would expect in January as the month is known as a dumping ground for movies, so don't walk in expecting a good film. Torque is a lot better than Biker Boyz since it has more action and it's shorter. Still, Torque is far from a good movie.The highlight of the movie are the over the top action scenes and for the most part, they deliver. Another good thing about Torque is Monet Mazur. She's pretty and she gives a decent performance. Besides for those things, Torque is kind of a joke. The acting is horrible as all the actors seem to be looking for the exit and a paycheck. Martin Henderson plays Cary and after a nice performance in the Ring, he gives a pretty bad one here. Ice Cube isn't much better and he gives an over the top performance though that is kind of the point since the whole movie is over the top.The whole story is predictable and it looks like something a three year old put together. The film is highly unrealistic so keep that in mind if you're going to watch it. The dialog is incredibly cheesy and bad. The direction is clumsy as this is Joseph Kahn's first and hopefully last movie. Like I said before, the action is decent but it doesn't break any new ground. This is the type of movie that you might enjoy if you aren't taking it too seriously but it's really not worth watching. In the end, this lame action flick is better left on the shelf. Rating 4/10",

Torque fails, not so much because it is gimmicky but because the viewer never gets to be a part of it. From the very first minute, the movie shifts into overdrive and moves so recklessly that it becomes incoherent, unengaging and consequently dull. After returning from Tailand to his home in Inglewood California, renowned biker Cary Ford is framed by an old rival for the murder of Junior whose brother Trey is head of the dirtiest bike gang around. While on the run, Ford along with his buddies and girlfriend, are in a race of time to get the evidence needed to prove innocence. and bring down the criminals behind the real murder.Like so many filmmakers before him, director Joseph Kahn relies on style and adrenaline alone to make his film debut compelling. About ninety percent of Torque is either fighting or chase scenes. It literally zips by so fast that at times it looses track of time, space and dimension. More importantly however, Torque moves so fast that it looses the viewers, making it hard to watch let alone watch and enjoy. I'm sure there are some people out there who would be satisfied with Torque just the way it is, but I say it needs to slow down big time. I don't recommend it.",

If the action is tight, and the screenwriters and directors at least attempt to compensate for holes in the story...I'm game. But with this film, \"suspension of disbelief\" just doesn't seem to cover it. Before I go any further, let me simply say that I didn't bother with seeing 2 Fast 2 Furious. The first film in that franchise sucked enough, and I just didn't see the point in viewing the sequel. On that note, let me say that I shall make no comparison of this film to that. Now, as to the adjustment of a commonly overused plot line to this supposed world of underground biker gangs - chalk it up to the Hollywood producers doing anything for a buck. The biggest problem that I had with this film is the very thing it touted so highly: the intense action. Women fighting with motorcycle kung-fu...guys brawling on motorcycles traveling at over 200 mph through L.A. traffic...Ice Cube landing a motorcycle on top of a moving train. Um...yeah, whatever.

What I liked most about this movie were the fresh faces. They didn't rely on big names to sell this film. What I didn't like was the ending. In an attempt to peak the action, the film turned into a distorted fast-paced video game sequence. Despite poor reviews, I liked Torque, and would see it again.

Many thanks to the people over at TNT for putting this masterpiece of Grade B entertainment in its weekend rotation.No problem if you miss the first 45 minutes of the movie - in fact, I recommend it. The good stuff starts when the main characters are at a dusty diner somewhere out in the desert. I wasn't paying enough attention to tell you what led up to this, but one of the good guys pulls out a shotgun and it starts rocking from there.The special effects are way-way-way over the top and it's even better when you can replay and stop-action the stunts. The race through \"The Palms,\" the motorcycle chase on top of a passenger train, and Dane Cook's comic relief are all highly entertaining. And I'm pretty sure I've never seen anything like the 60 mph fight scene on motorcycles between between the \"bad biker chick\" (dark hair, lots of nasty piercings) and the \"good biker chick\" (blonde, no visible piercings), which ends with the viewer pondering this question: How much do you think Mountain Dew paid for product placement?

This is usually a good thing because then you don't have any prejudices against the film you're about to watch. So I started watching the movie from clear table..The movie turned out to be `the Fast and the Furious' all over again but with motorcycles. Like in Furious the plot of Torque is extremely thin and consumed. Writers have walked through door where the fence is lowest just mixing good guys, bad guys, police and possible threat in the same soup where you have ultimate fast bikes. You might think that this is a bad thing but in Torque it's not that bad. Movie is well shot and with decent editing it turns out to be pretty entertaining package. It shows that the makers have had money with them: color scheme is nice, quality of picture is high (they have used good cameras), CGI effects fit surprisingly well in the movie and are good looking and the camera man has used a plenty of tricks. Movie also shows a couple of cool motorcycle moves and even some of them is impossible the make it doesn't slow down the pace of the movie. It's funny to watch them although I have to give a minus from the last effect trick where the maker's just went too far --> you know what I mean when you see the film.Actors aren't anything special but they managed to bring the needed thing to the screen; Charismatic faces, bad ass attitude and some sort of coolness. Ice Cube isn't giving his best but he still is pretty believable gang boss. I do not know anything about bikes but I suppose that some bike fans could wet their pants because of the cool bikes in the movie. Well, I think that this movie is giving the same feeling to the bikers than `Fast and the Furious' did to the car folks. Is that good or bad thing, I really can't say. I'm not so keen in cars or bikes. The main thing is that movie is working well.Don't get me wrong Torque isn't an Oscar winning great spectacle in film history. No, it's far from that BUT if you are looking a fast paced action pack what lets you put you brains in to the off mode and just enjoy the ride while sipping your ice cold beer after long and frustrating work day Torque might just do the trick.",

His brother in this movie (Fredro Starr) is really annoying. His dumb facial expression when he is knocked off his bike by the slipstream of fords biker gang in the beginning of the movies says it all. I hate this guy, and therefore it's a plus point his character gets killed off pretty soon through the movie. Monet Mazur: Beautiful actress, really!!! But she really can't act. \"looks like you did b****\" Hear this quote at the end of the movie and cry. Matt Schulze is good as the villain. He was cast perfectly for this movie. Next stop, the action. It was terrible. These sequences are so bad, you would be better off enjoying James Bond making mistakes during filming. A Hummer that makes a bad jump and spirals through the air. It would spiral-crash back on the road or where ever, right? WRONG!!!

Now, it isn't a good movie, heck, its borderline mediocre, but it isn't god-awful, and that is frankly what I was expecting from it.  However, if you are looking for an opportunity to check your brain at the door and just relax and watch something that is engaging and even occasionally fun, then Torque is your picture.Torque seems to have been conceived thanks to the success of 2001's The Fast and the Furious, a film which I haven't seen, but what little I know about it makes it obvious that Torque is culled from similar material.  The film opens with biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) returning home after spending some time hiding out in Taiwan.  It seems that Cary fled because he was being chased by the cops for running drugs, leaving his girlfriend and biker mechanic Shane (Monet Mazur) to take some of the brunt of the bust. However, it turns out that Cary was actually holding bikes from the real drug-dealer, Henry James (Matt Schulze), who wants his bikes and his drugs back.  Meanwhile, Cary has managed to get himself in a bit of a spat with the leader of a rival bike gang named the Reapers, led by Trey (Ice Cube), and when Henry James notices friction, he decides to kill Trey's brother and frame Cary to attempt to flush him out.  All the while, Cary is being tailed by two zealous DEA agents, Agent McPherson (Adam Scott) and Agent Henderson (Justina Machado) who are still convinced that Cary is a drug dealer.As you can tell from the description above, Torque doesn't have much originality or intense plot development to boast about.  Even so, Torque isn't lacking in entertainment value.  Sure it's not the smartest film you have ever seen, and some of the events that occur defy all the laws of physics, but it's not boring.  One bonus is the fact that director Joseph Kahn keeps the action moving and never lets the film sit too long, yet doesn't shift the film into overdrive like such bloated actioners as The Rock and Armageddon.  It also runs a respectable length, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  It gets the job done and then politely wanders off screen.This is not to suggest that Torque is a great film by any stretch of the imagination.  It isn't.  The plot is tissue-paper thin, the character conflicts are rather predictable and easy to decipher, and yes, as previously stated, the film wanders occasionally into the realm of the ridiculous (The last ten to fifteen minutes or so be the most obvious application of absolute silliness).  The acting ranges from decent to lame. Martin Henderson, from the Ring, has an easy charm that proves infectious. He looks like he is having a good time, so we feel like we are having a good time. Matt Schulze turns in another slightly warmed-over, hammy villain performance, proof that he needs to find a new type of role to be typecast in.  Ice Cube is, well, Ice Cube.  He gives about the same level of performance as in any other film he has acted in, which is passable, but hardly outstanding. Monet Mazur serves the script, but is hardly a standout.Very few will find much to remember long term in Torque, and I doubt it will be the prize in most people's film collections, but not every film has to be, and Torque does all it intends to do and nothing more.  Occasionally, that's refreshing.",

            "content": "Cary Ford returns to America after running out on his girlfriend to escape the law. He returns to America but immediately finds himself in trouble with his ex over running out, leader of rival gang Trey over his brother's damaged bike and Luther over a missing consignment of drugs. When Trey's brother is murdered by Luther over a drug deal gone sour, all the clues point to Cary \u0096 forcing him to either run away again or to try and clear his name. He chooses the latter.I try not to prejudge films when I know nothing about them and I must admit that it was hard to overlook all the criticism this has had and the fact that it is in the bottom 100 on this site. However, I don't personally think it is that bad (most people don't see really bad movies too often and generally overreact when they do) but it is just very poor. Somewhere in the world, someone must have made a piece of software that generates action movies scripts, randomly filling in details like character names, motivations and other detail while still keeping the core clich\u00e9s of love, betrayal and corny dialogue. If such a thing does not exist then I can only conclude that somebody actually accepted money for writing this! The plot is hackneyed at best and it is very difficult to really care what is going on in it. The dialogue is just as bad although occasionally it has a line that is cheesy that is delivered with a knowing wink at least. I don't think it is as bad as people say \u0096 some moments are pretty to look at (if not actually exciting) and it has plenty of shots of sexy girls dancing. Of course the reason for this is that the film is almost totally targeted at teenage boys who only want eye candy and noise. In this regard I imagine the film is a success because that is all it actually manages to deliver (although it may not even please teenage boys that much!)The special effects range from the average to the stupid. Some race schemes seem real and are slightly more exciting as a result, but far too many towards the end are either stupid (the girl fight at the end) or contain graphics that you'd be disappointed with in a playstation game! Without any more than cardboard cut outs to work with, the actors struggle to make anything out of the very corny dialogue. Henderson is poor with a bland character who tries so hard not to be white that it is a little embarrassing. Ice Cube is not a great actor but even he seems annoyed about his horrid racist character speaking in constant gangsta ebonics. Beesley is not a good actor but his poor performance here shows that at least he is persistent. Milan's presence is a mystery although I assume that she hoped just looking sexy would boost her sales, meanwhile Mazur, Pressly and all manner of sexy wannabe actresses fill every club scene with flesh. A strangely comic performance from Adam Scott is enjoyable and his scenes are enjoyable even if it is hard to see 6 Feet Under's Machado doing nothing but earning money.Overall this is not the worst film ever made and, trust me, those that claim it is simply haven't seen enough bad movies! However it is clich\u00e9d, unimaginative, uninspired and not at all exciting. Undemanding teens will love it's mix of attitude, ebonics, fast machines and toned flesh but the vast majority of viewers will find it a totally derivative mess.",

Same lame lines, same terrible plot, same cartoonish action.  This one does feature a cat fight on bikes though, which was absolutely hysterical!  Made me laugh my head off. The ending is also right out of Tron with a bike that can go 50 billion miles an hour down a crowded city street without hitting a single thing. They tried much too hard during the last big chase, and it looked more like a video game than a movie.  The train scene was also hilarious, reminiscent of such dogs as Charlie's Angels 2 - Full Throttle.Ah well, at least they have a host of great-looking chicks in tight leather outfits, lots of action and tough-guy talk, and a bunch of great stunts.  I wasn't looking for Gone with the Wind when I rented it, but you would think if they were going to blow 100 mil on stunts, they would have at least paid more than 50 cents for the script.  \"You messed with the wrong chick!\" \"Looks like you did b1tch!\"  HAHAHAHHA!  Oh man is that B-movie dialogue! Terrible, just terrible....But still, a great movie to laugh at.  Makes it worth the 4 bucks in rental fees....",

There is not a bike made that can achieve 0-100mph in less than a second. \n These are but three examples of CG taking over. The ONLY stunt sequences that are even close to being 'real' (if extremely unsafe to do) are the opening race and the title credits.  Everything else is questionable for some reason or another. I'm not one to judge 'wooden' acting, or other such things.  I figured Ice Cube did a fair job.  And the pokes at other movies and such were actually pretty good.

Now, these pseudo westerns are all centered on the bad guys. That's who we want to be. The good guy here is so shiny vanilla, so formulaic (which his girlfriend) and in such predicable situations, he fades into the background as part of the score.The idea here is to give strutting teens interesting (to them) bad guys. That's why the bad guys, some of them anyway, have to have some sort of ethics, honor, even logic.The question is, whether the ones in this movie are interesting enough. 'You Got Served' is a half-click better with the bad guys. And its form of dance is a complete waste of time. Here, it is motorcycles and even less interesting, even with the 'Fast and Furious' effects.This is stylish, but the style is wasted.

I began to understand why they hated this film so much like how much they hated Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever. Why is there so much hate to some specific movies? Why can't you never learn how to have a fun time and enjoy the entertainment that they gave us? I actually don't hate that many movies. I just liked them all. I learned myself how to like any kind of movies. Torque is a film that gives you pure and mindless entertainment that will leave you on a wild roller coaster ride. I know this film has no plot but is entertainment more fun than no plot? YES IT IS! When I watch a movie, I always look for entertainment first thing before I can find the plot. Especially if there is no plot then just stick to the entertainment just like how I felt about Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. I personally think Torque is better entertainment than Ballistic. I find it funny when people voted Torque a 2.6 rating and a 3.7 rating for Ballistic. I gave Torque a 10 because of bad rating but actually I wanted to give it a 7. Three points off because of plot and because of final chase sequence at the end of movie which is plain stupid as it was used like a computer game. But overall I liked most of other parts. I really loved the opening sequence with opening credits. It was witty clever, that's what I'm looking for a pure entertainment like this as from opening sequence as where they can catch your attention. In addition to this, this film is way better than Biker Boyz because of more adrenaline rush entertainment and it's good enough for 81 minute running time compared to 111 minute for Biker Boyz.",

Although there is a nominal plot buried somewhere in the movie (the details need not be reiterated here), the story serves mainly as a device on which to hang an endless series of motorcycle chase sequences which derive their style more from CGI and video games than from anything remotely resembling the real world - you, know, the one that operates by the laws of gravity and physics.  The dialogue is uniformly ridiculous, and one can almost hear director Joseph Kahn giving his actors last minute instructions before setting his cameras a-rolling:  `OK, everybody, now strut around, look tough and scowl a lot.' Most of the performers here appear to have been only too willing to oblige. The only truly amusing aspect of the film is an entirely unintentional one, I'm sure, which is that the main villain of the piece is named Henry James. Imagining what that most literate of authors would think of this most illiterate of movies is an exercise in irony almost too rich to pass up.Motorcycle fanatics may get their kicks out of this film.

            "content": "Torque starts as hardcore lifestyle biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) arrives back in Los Angeles after six months way in Thailand, Cary heads straight for his ex-girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur) & tries to explain why he hasn't been around for half a year. Hoping to rekindle their relationship Cary starts to win Shane over, however old rivalries are renewed when drug dealing biker Henry James (Matt Schulze) finds out Cary's back in town, six months ago Cary discovered over a million dollars worth of crystal meth stashed in bikes stored at Shane's garage & hid them before taking off to take the heat of Shane & stop the deadly drug reaching the street but Henry wants his meth back & murders Junior Wallace (Fredro Starr) & frames Cary for it, now wanted by the FBI for murder & by Junior's brother Trey (Ice Cube) who happens to rule the Reapers the most feared biker gang in Los Angeles both Cary & Shane go on the run in an attempt to clear their names...This Australian US co-production was directed by Joseph Kahn & Torque is about as big & dumb as they come but at the same time is strangely watchable in a brainless sort of way, there's lots of adrenalin fuelled masculine based action featuring high powered motorbikes & lots of good looking people. The plot isn't that great, even though it only lasts for 80 odd minutes & has a terrific pace Torque is just a really dumb & silly film that will have most shaking their heads in disbelief at times. From riding motorbikes on the tops of speeding trains to turbulence from speeding bikes making the ground tremble to a last ten minutes that I simply cannot explain, as if Torque wasn't video game enough then the last ten minutes looks & feels just like one. The script seems to take itself quite seriously with little in the way of (intentional) humour apart from a yuppie couple in a yellow sports car, there are numerous heated confrontations between various character's that are meant to be tense but come across as silly posturing, the fight between Shane & China on motorbikes at the end in particular. Nothing in Torque has any rational reason, I mean what if Cary is caught by the FBI? Henry wouldn't get his meth back then would he? With Cary in the clear then surely Henry himself would have become a suspect? Couldn't Henry come up with a better plan for finding out where his drugs were than framing Cary for murder? Does that even make any sense to anyone? Why did Henry need Trey's permission to sell his drugs? Why not sell them elsewhere? Why try to set the deal up when Henry didn't even have the drugs anyway? There are plenty of questions, the one main plot twist at the end is so abrupt & seemingly thrown in there for no reason that you wonder why they bothered. Jaime Pressly steals the entire film as evil female biker who looks really sexy & slutty in tight leather.It comes as no surprise that first time feature film director Joseph Kahn background lies in music videos & Torque is a typical soulless substance over style where every shot tries to be cool, every action gets an extravagant 'swoosh' sound effect. Torque looks pretty slick & there are plenty of visually cool moments, great looking motorbikes & cars, an attractive cast & some decent action scenes including a ludicrous train roof scene, a freeway chase, lots of jumps, skids, inhuman speeds, fights, & even a few explosions as well. Everything about Torque is designed to get as many people chasing Cary & Shane as possible & nothing else matters. There are some CGI computer effects which looks alright, there is also some seriously obvious & frankly shameless product placement. Producer Neal H. Moritz previously produced The Fast and the Furious (2001) & xXx (2002) which says exactly what sort of loud, over produced under scripted film Torque is.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 this didn't do much business at the box-office, the whole film is glossy & slick & narrative plot is sacrificed at every opportunity over a flashy piece of CGI, a cool looking motorbike or some sort of macho confrontation. The cast doesn't really feature any A-listers & I certainly don't count Ice Cube as an A-lister, as I already said Jaime Pressly is totally hot as the bad leather clad biker chick.Torque is a bad film, a really bad film, it's a video game that goes for flashy graphics & cool moments rather than anything resembling a plot, I did quite like it for it's mindless action & colourful visuals (& Jaime Pressly in leather, OK I won't mention her again...). Loud music, garish visuals, a ridiculous plot & lots of fast motorbikes is about what you get here.",

But the script had some cheesy/unoriginal lines, not to mention it was a bit too predictable.  The soundtrack was fairly well-done, but didn't really feature many original tracks for the movie.  Some of the songs included Nickelback and Static-X. However, some decent acting and a good soundtrack never made up for a poorly-done movie.  Entertaining: yes.

Everybody wants to fight and when they're done fighting they like to ride their bikes until they can find reason to fight again. Title symbolizes an emotional rush or energy but the screenplay has all the energy of a third avenue drunk. Director Joseph Kahn films it as if he was making a commercial for motorcycles. Martin Henderson returns home after a long absence but trouble strikes when old enemies make demands. Ice Cube plays a gang leader whose brother is murdered by another gang but he is led to believe that Henderson did it. They will clash back and forth until viewers want to bury their faces in their hands and cry. Monet Mazur plays a previous girlfriend of Henderson's. She is basically there to bang him and make the enemies really mad. The rest of the cast is about as lively as a flat tire in a monster truck stunt. Action scenes look terrific but to what avail? Without a good screenplay to back them up, it is just a bunch of racing and crashing and fighting. For all the ambition that went into this crap, the film should be placed on the road so that every one of the bikes featured in screen can run over it until it becomes a permanent part of the road.

Also, I feel that it was more of an adrenaline rush that biker boyz. The varieties of motorbikes and the way they rode them was interesting. Critique: Three points...1)The plot is the run of the mill-action-hero-wins-in-the-end. No matter what happens you know that the main actor is going to win...Sort of like James Bond...the plot of the movie is straight forward, no brainier, no twist, and highly predictable.2) A few scenes are so ridiculous, you have to just over look them. I will describe some of them: Three or four bikers come across a semi trailer and need to break the lock, and quite conveniently they have a lock cutter. If you are on bike, where do you keep that? The train ride is so unrealistic and even unnecessary. It is far fetch but nevertheless entertaining sort of like is superman, but oh well it is entertainment. Doesn't Ford wash or change clothes. During the entire movie, he uses the same clothes and jacket, and so does everyone else.3) I hope some gullible people don't try and imitate some of the stunts in the movie. In the movie, people crash and they don't get hurt. sometimes the crashes occur without hermits. People that cannot think for themselves will think that they too are invulnerable. But one little fall at 20mph, even with full gear, can leave you a quadriplegic, brain damaged, or irreparable broken bones.",

But that isn't really very important in the final analysis as this movie is all about action excess. Its director had been famous for making music videos which comes as little surprise given the overall aesthetics in this one. Ludicrous moments don't so much happen, they are actively encouraged; with a particularly biscuit-taking sequence occurring onboard a train. The film also has the good grace to sport a few hot women too, which of course is a production value which never really gets old. Still, you need to be in the mood for this one and I can't say I am in any great hurry to experience it again. But I certainly admired its unpretentious audacity.",

Torque is bad, and not bad enough to even be called \"BAD!\" in a good way. I realize that this kind of movie is not meant to be taken seriously, and that we should enjoy it for what it is. But Torque is just a dumb movie.I won't waste my time talking about the plot of Torque. To do so would require about 10 posts. It's a basic premise that you see in all films that Torque is like.As for the script, well my five year old nephew could write better dialog than this. The only things missing where some \"Dude!\" and \"Whoa!\".Actors? Why Ice Cube and Jamie Pressley decided to do this movie, I'll never know. Jamie is better than this, and so is Cube. Martin Henderson needs to stay away from crap like this if he wants to build a career. As for Matt Schulze, well if Michelle Rodriguez is typecast, then this guy is this for male roles. Every movie he plays some bad guy, bad ass. Don't get me wrong, he is good at it. But in Torque, he can't do much cause the film is PG-13.Stunts. Well, you can do most of these in a Tony Hawk game, so figure out just how dumb and stupid these stunts come off on the screen. And this leads me to the end of Torque, which has the dumbest, most unrealistic chase/fight scene I have ever seen. I thought the final stunt in XXX:State of the Union was bad. Torque's finale is ten times worse. You have to watch it to understand just how dumb it is.Hot babes, cool bikes can't save this piece of crap. I realize that the studio wanted to make some money, and it is painfully obvious that Torque did not cost much to make. I can see sequels for this movie on direct to DVD circuit. Hey, maybe Van Damme can make Torque 2 playing a French guy who wants to get his family back (his movies seem to always have that theme.)",

Heck, the single best part of the movie was the most understated. Plus it was like all the characters from a really bad straight-to-video low-budget biker movie were transplanted to a movie with a really big budget. So you had the bad girl who was realllly bad...the wisecracking hero who's realllly a wiseacre...Awful. Truly.",

This movie doesn't claim to be \"Out Of Africa\" or Shakespeare nor aimed at those fans.. It is just eye candy; which for me is fine. It is not intended to be any kind of reality; just entertainment. To all the pompous snob critics, get a life, lighten up- not everyone wants to see a movie that is a art house therapy session or something so sublime you can't get it.I don't care about technical details. It doesn't need to be reality or to make sense in our place and time. Fast and Furious, XXX, Charlies Angels, Bad Boys etc can't be mistaken for real as well.The story was a bit thin, but that is part of the charm of this movie. However, the video game FX, editing, sound track were all excellent and over the top as expected. Martin Henerson and Monet Mazur were great in their roles, both looked great decked out in leathers and on their bikes. Ice Cube makes a great villain and played it to the hilt! (all set in my favorite City of Los Angeles!)Though violent,it was more like an old cartoon and fit in with the plot. (a Hummer crushing a Porsche roof to roof no less!). It was not gratuitous like movies are today.(It was refreshing not to have blood splatted all over the place - there was a scent where some one gets hung with a bike chain, but they didn't show it; but presented it in away that you knew what happened. You knew bad things were happening but it wasn't in your face so to speak) I caught this movie on TV and was quite surprised. I actually went out and bought the DVD. So if you want fast bikes, good guys vs. bad guys, very bad girls, heavy metal and out of this world action, this is for you - kick back, don't take it seriously and you will have a great time.I rate it as a 10 all around because it delivered what I expected from this genre of light drama/ heavy action movie.Can't believe this movie was rated so bad when there are so many other movies that are so much worse!",

He has a fresh way of seeing action sequences and the unique angles he uses and his editing style make common sequences -- very exciting. The lighting sets the perfect mood for this film and the results constantly make you think about how he shot things . Mr. Kahn is an amazing talent and we should expect exciting things from him in the future. Hollywood needs - no cries - for directors of this caliber.Peter Levy was the cinematographer - and he does an incredible job of capturing the energy and excitement of youth and speed . He shoots common things from unique angles and keeps everything fresh and exciting .I thought it would be a terrible movie but surprisingly - TORQUE - turned out to be something that I will watch many times and it \" resets the bar \" for biker movies",

Like many have said, dumb studio execs tend to confuse high grosses with film quality and what \"The Fast and the Furious\" had was not quality.Charisma? Yes. Good effects? Granted. But quality? I'm afraid not, my friend, so why do we have to suffer through these horrible rip-offs? Directed by Joseph Kahn, who is, surprise, surprise, a music video director, composes one really bad B movie that isn't even worthy of being called a B movie because it's so blatantly a really long drawn out music video sans the music ad nauseum. \"Torque\" is tagged with a movie label, but it really reads like a really bad music video or really long drawn out badly acted commercial on television, it's not a movie. Now, this has all the markings of a music video, but I keep asking without anyone to give me a successful answer: why the hell do these studios always have to recruit these music video directors for action movies?! Am I talking to myself here? There must be one person who can answer my question. Music videos are five minute featurettes, a movie is a whole new ballgame but this has all the elements of a usual music video with a lot of really obnoxious shots of motorcycles, boas, busty women bathing in water, all the usual tired music video clich\u00e9s that I'm just sick and tired of. When studios begin learning how to differentiate music videos from movies, that will be a glorious day, but until then \"Torque\" is, to put it lightly, a piece of crap. It's a steaming, fly infested, corn covered, piece of crap that I had one grueling time sitting through.It was an hour and a half and not even the holy hotness of Jaime Pressley and Monet Mazur could help me sit through the damn thing. A bunch of boneheaded bikers are set-up by another gang of boneheaded bikers for murder, and now an evil gang of boneheaded bikers are on the hunt for them. Blah is the word that really came to mind after watching this piece of junk. \"Torque\" takes place in Bruckheimer land with a lot of flashy sequences and where cops never catch on to criminals, where our heroes have great equipment and clothing with no visible source of income, and where cops are cocky and dressed in thousand dollar suits and ride around in billion dollar cars that weren't issued by the force. It's a world where anything is possible, even something as physics defying as driving a motorcycle atop a moving train, and far-fetched as driving motorcycles through city streets without running anyone over. It's a B movie right off the back, because with dialogue like \"You got loud pipes, but you ain't sayin' nothing'!\" it's hard to believe this could be anything but.B movie material it is, but entertaining, it ain't. With such a vapid plot and all style and little substance, \"Torque\" is the longest hour and a half I've ever experienced watching a movie. And, oddly enough everyone is twice as bad an actor here including Jaime Pressley who was never Oscar material, but still managed to hold her own in movies, and Ice Cube whose evolved as an actor, is just awful here. He's wildly over the top, obnoxious, and just the bane of this film with his ridiculous character. All the while, throw in some obvious product placements, cheesy stunts and comic book action and you have a product not fit to fill my movie collection. This is awful.",

            "content": "If at first you succeed, try again. That seems to be Neal Moritz's motto, anyway, when it comes to the movies he chooses to produce. The formula that made The Fast and the Furious such a surprising hit in the summer of 2001 has been tried several times since then, with varying degrees of success.Torque, it appears, will be more successful than most attempts to capitalize on the formula. Not only does Torque not flinch from the inevitable comparisons to The Fast and the Furious, it invites them. From the opening sequence, in which our hero Martin Henderson (The Ring, Windtalkers) throws a beatin' on two drag racers-one a big bald dude and the other a lean tattooed hombre driving a yellow car-it is plain that this movie is out to prove that no matter how tough, fast, and strong street racers are, bikers are tougher, faster, and stronger.The plot, such as it is, involves Henderson's character Ford returning to Los Angeles after six months in Thailand, where he fled to avoid being framed as a drug dealer. Seems Henry James (Matt Schulze, Blade II, The Transporter) had hidden crystal meth in the engines of the two motorcycles he had asked Ford to watch for a few days. Ford panicked, hid the bikes and the drugs, and ran. Now he's back, because he can't stand the fact that he left his girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur, Angel Eyes, Just Married) high and dry and the object of a federal raid (it was her garage where the bikes were being stored).Now Henry wants his drugs back, but that's not quite good enough for Ford. He wants to figure out a way he can get rid of Henry for good. Henry, however, is smarter than he looks, so he ratchets up the pressure by framing Ford for murder, promising that the eyewitness (Henry's girlfriend China, played sneeringly well by Jaime Pressly, Joe Dirt, Not Another Teen Movie) will forget what she `saw' the minute Ford turns over the meth.Much violence and chaos ensues, as the person Ford is supposed to have murdered was the less-than-bright brother of Trey Wallace (Ice Cube, Barbershop, Friday After Next), leader of the feared biker gang the Reapers. Trey is less than thrilled about his brother's death and less than patient about the idea of revenge. Meanwhile, FBI agent McPherson (Adam Scott, High Crimes) is also on the warpath, as Ford had slipped through his fingers the first time.Torque is unrepentantly silly, if you try to take it as a serious film. If, however, you choose to take it for what it is, it is an adrenaline rush not unlike Moritz's other runaway block buster, XXX. The stunts are impressive, the special effects are dazzling, and eye candy abounds for both male and female viewers.Torque has an advantage over The Fast and the Furious, and that is the refreshing presence of real actors. Henderson makes a much more believable hero than Paul Walker. Ice Cube turns in a solid performance as the angry and grieving Trey, even infusing Trey with a slight character arc. And Schulze (one of the few who bothered to do any acting in The Fast and the Furious) gets to show us distilled evil, which he plays with quiet and extreme intensity. Even the girls are not just afterthoughts, like they were in The Fast and the Furious. Pressly gives a focused, if laconic, performance and manages to make China menacing without saying anything. Mazur's Shane doesn't get much scope in the script, but she makes the best of what she has and turns Shane into a real person. There are no false notes in the supporting cast, either.If you're looking for a serious action drama complete with tortured psyches and soul-searching, look elsewhere. If you're looking for fun, intense action sequences, gratuitous flashes of skin, and sassy one-liners, then you've come to the right place. Torque doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, and what it is, is a wild ride.",

In one scene you see both girls sitting on their bikes, looking at each other ( under the bridge ) and their like about 150m away ( from each other ), but then they drive in one direction like this place would be about 500m long. And the bike handling . . . How much does Jaime Pressly weight ? ? ? 45kg ? ? ? And she's plays with this 200kg bike like it would be a piece of cake. . . Such scenes are very out of this world.

Film makers would be silly if not stupid if they bring out a sequel to this film as i think anyone that has seen this one, wont go see sequel...If you dont care bout story line, go see this film, its good for the graphics, otherwise, wait to hire on DVD and VHS etc, cause you would be wasting you time buying it on DVD or paying to see at cinemas like I and alot of others have...",

Okay, so the plot's nothing new and the bike and bike-fight scenes are not exactly realistic, but it was very entertaining nevertheless and surely that's why people go to watch a movie.It's very clearly a Fast and the Furious clone, but that's not a bad thing. There are more stunts in this film that the four-wheel movies, and that's what makes it entertaining.In summary, if you want an entertaining ride, go out and rent this one. If you want a movie that will make you think, well, there's 100s of others out there for you to watch.",

Except this is with motorcycles instead of street racing cars. This movie is about this biker named Cary Ford (Henderson) who is acused by an rival and biker gang leader for the murder of the brother of Trey (Ice Cube), the leader of the most feared biker gang in the country! Trey is now trying to clear his name and convince Trey that he did not murder his brother. When Ford tells Trey about the whole thing that he did not kill his brother they start working to together and getting the guy who really did murder Trey's brother. The best part of the movie was when Trey and Ford were doing the motorcycle train chase and also through the forest! I thought Ice Cube does really good at giving out a rough guy attitude when acting in a movie like this when he isn't doing any comedy movies.BOTTOM LINE: OKAY MOVIE BUT THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS IS BETTER!",

            "content": "\"If you're looking for trouble you came to the right place.\" \"Lucky for you, I'm running a 2-for-1 special.\" \"Can I get fries with that?\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's dialogue like that that helped me make the decision to become a movie reviewer. This is a bad movie folks, but if you like movies that are laughably bad, then this one should make you happy. Plot? I've seen more cohesiveness in the bathroom aftermath of a $10 Taco Bell binge. Dialogue? Cheesy one-liner heaven. Stunts? I've seen Wile E. Coyote pull off more believable stuff. You've got motorcycles jumping on trains, riding on the front wheel, and chasing each other at what looks to be about 400 mph (using the ever-so-hip warped speed effect). It's one eye rolling action sequence after another. You wanna know how bad the movie is? Let me break it down:*Our hero, Cary Ford (doing his best Tom Cruise/Josh Lucas impersonation) and his biker friends dress like Power Rangers. Who is going to be scared of bikers wearing red, green, and yellow leather?*Henry (Matt Schulze), the main bad guy, has the absolute WORST mullet I have ever seen on the big screen. I dare you to find one that's worse. I'm not kidding, if the hairdos of Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and Billy Ray Cyrus had a deformed lovechild it'd be Henry's mullet.*Just to make Henry more annoying, he was required to spend the entire movie talking in your typical D-movie husky bad guy voice. Imagine Alec Baldwin talking while constipated. Now imagine playing that in slow motion. You now have an idea of how Henry sounded.*Gangs had such original names as the \"Reapers\" and the \"Hellions.\" I'm gonna get a couple of friends together, and we're gonna call ourselves names like Venom, Scorpion, and Snake, and I think we'll be the Razors. It's gonna rule.*We're supposed to think closing your cell phone with your head makes you tough. I'm just glad to know that it's now socially acceptable for tough-as-nails motorcycle gang leaders to use cell phones. That's a barrier whose breaking has been long overdue.*Ford mumbles through lines like, \"I'd rather be fast than invisible\" when explaining why he'd rather ride than hide from the gang that's trying to kill him. Yeah, because that makes sense?*The FBI agents in this movie are laughable. The chick wants to be Jada Pinkett Smith so bad you can just feel her pain. And McPherson? Was this guy supposed to be a cartoon character? Oh, and you know who played him? ADAM SCOTT! I'm sure no one has ever heard of him, but during the movie I leaned over and asked Stephanie, \"Isn't that the guy from 'Party of Five' who played Claudia's boyfriend? You know, the rock and roll dude who mentioned rummaging through John Fogerty's garbage for a guitar string?\" It turns out I was right! And you know, I'm just a little too eager to share that with y'all.*Ice Cube delivered every single one of his lines with a snarl and his lip curled up to his eyebrow.I could go on, but I think you know what to expect. There actually was one clever moment in the movie. Ford and his ex-girlfriend (Monet Mazur) were having some sort of worthless discussion, and Ford ended with, \"I live my life a quarter mile at a time.\" Many of you may recognize that as one of Vin Diesel's lines from \"The Fast and the Furious.\" I started to think, \"Holy cow, they just stole a line from TF&TF?\" but then Mazur's character replied with, \"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\" I was actually shocked that they did something clever.If you want to compare \"Torque\" to other movies in its genre, well, \"Torque\" makes \"The Fast and The Furious\" (which I like) look like an Oscar winner. I take that back, it makes \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" look like an Oscar winner! Oh, and if you've seen a poster of \"Torque,\" then you've probably seen \"From the producer of The Fast and The Furious, XXX And S.W.A.T.\" in big red letters near the bottom. I think it's a pretty safe bet that you won't be seeing \"From the producer of Torque\" on any posters any time soon.In all fairness, I don't think the people behind \"Torque\" were trying to make a good movie. At least I sure hope they weren't. The entire movie has such a cartoonish feel that you have to assume that they said to themselves, \"Let's cheese this up as much as possible, have fun forcing the critics to sit through this, and make some cash.\" I kept expecting one of the good guy bikers to beat up a bad guy biker and then look into the camera, remark, \"Stick a TORQUE in him, he's done,\" wink, and then ride off into the sunset. You know what's really sad? That would've actually been one of the better lines in the movie. If nothing else, movies like this give fledgling writers everywhere a glimmer of hope.THE GIST Throw this one into the \"so bad it's entertaining\" category. If you don't like to make fun of really bad movies, and if you don't like to laugh at incredibly cheesy one-liners, and if you don't find humor in making fun of people with horrible mullets, then don't bother with \"Torque.\" But if the above sounds good to you, then I recommend seeing this with at least 4 people and spending as little money on it as possible. If you see it with only two people then you run the risk of the other person falling asleep, and this isn't a movie you want to watch by yourself.You know how when someone at work says and/or does something stupid? You laugh and can't wait to tell your friends about it, right? Well, consider \"Torque\" that stupid coworker.",

When you're making a movie that isn't as serious as a similar one that's already been released, it's important to make sure you leave no doubt in the viewer's mind that it's a comedy. Take A Knight's Tale for example. Following on the success of Gladiator, the producers knew they weren't going to get away with a serious period piece, so they made it one long running joke.The commentary on the DVD for Torque says it doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as The Fast and the Furious or xXx, two films it clearly rips off.Somehow, though, I just don't buy it. It just tries too hard to be a TFATF for motorcycle riders who felt left behind by the four-wheel craze that the aforementioned film generated. If there's \"comedy\" in this movie, I fail to see it.A very powerful soundtrack and a decent performance by Adam Scott as the unorthodox FBI agent (before the obligatory good-cop-bad-cop twist) save this film from howling louder than the engines.All in all, Torque is TFATF on two wheels, only less entertaining. It's okay for trainspotters who like to point out scenes, camera angles or dialogue where a film rips off another film. Not being a bike enthusiast myself, I don't know whether I can say they'll love it or hate it.",

The sun reflects off your slick leather ensemble as you glide your leg over the mean machine's hardened leather seat. Your hands grasp the handles as you hear a faint squeak of your leather gloves. You are ready for combat.The revving commences and in a flash you hope to leave your competitor a victim at the line. But instead you watch as your bike stalls and your enemy screeches away. The name of your enemy is `The Fast & the Furious' and you are just left being the `The Fake & the Scriptless'.And that about sums up the new action film, Torque, which is brought to you by the same producers who did `The Fast & the Furious' and `XXX'.\nIn the loose-meat storyline housed within `Torque', we find rebel biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) returning to his hometown to face his past demons and reclaim the woman (Monet Mazur) he loves. Ford must first face down a ruthless FBI agent (Adam Scott) and two biker rivals (Ice Cube and Matt Schulze).The one-note storyline allows for slick two-dimensional performances from the film's leads and forgettable one-dimensional ones from the supporting cast which includes B-movie veterans Schulze and Jaime Pressly.\nThere are a lot of western and rebel references as the recent world of the biker never seems to translate well to screen. These guys don't drive for the `need for speed' or celebrate in their rebellion but instead they just clunk around like they were lost on paper which it is no surprise that this is the first script from screenwriter Matt Johnson. There are oodles of rookie mistakes in this one.I kind of felt sorry for some of the actors lost in this film like Henderson, Pressly, Mazur and of course under-rated Max Beesley who once more finds himself in an awful project.As a B-film I did find some great belly-laughs like at the biker chick showdown between Mazur and Pressly which is probably the worst game of chicken on celluloid. And Pressly's biker chick character is ripped right from a re-run of `Black Scorpion'. It had to be with all that lip lickin'. Roger Corman would adore that character.I do have to admit that the stunts and some of the `filled-to-the-brim' cheese was fun but for the most part `Torque' should and will be an embarrassment to both the outlaw and speed-freak biker community.Just forget `Torque' if you can.

And yes it did. Violence, drugs, illegal activities, street racing, every single bad myth about motorcycles is there, along with bad acting, very bad acting! The plot is terrible, predictable, impossible things happen all the time (the way they hide when being pursued in the desert is truly astonishing!), the way they drive in top of a train made me laugh really loud, well in fact most of the time they were driving I was laughing!! By the end of the movie (well, I guess I forgot immediately how it ended), I just felt a relief because my jaw was hurting.

            "content": "**1/2 out of ****Torque has its moments. Moments of great action sequences, including at most of the time, motorcycle chase sequences. At the beginning of the movie, there is a slight feel of a Mad Max world, but with bikes, instead of cars, and in present time. Unfortunately, it ends there. The plot is quite good also, but the acting is a little weird. I'll start right off from the beginning.Ford (Martin Hendersen) is a bike repairer and driver. He works with the beautiful Shane (Monet Mazur), well, at least, used to. Until the time that he finds drugs inside the bike of the leader of a motorcycle gang, the Hellions, Henry, played by Matt Schulze. What happens here, is that Ford was already been chased by the federals, because they once thought (and keep the idea) that he's a drug dealer. The only way that Ford can prove his innocence is to show the federals Henry's bike along with the drugs (I forgot the name of it).Well, the flaws begin here. Ford could easily report Henry to the federals, but, first, he needs to get to the bike and the drugs. Without doing it, he can't prove anything. Makes sense. But the acting is terrible! When the Hellions kill the brother of Trey (Ice Cube), one of the members, Henry's girlfriend presents herself to the police as a witness of the crime scene, reporting Ford as the killer. So the federals begin chasing him. He can't report Henry without the proof that he needs. But as an action movie of many, many absurd stunts, the actors seem to perform like they were in a fantasy world.Ford shows no fear driving bikes. He may be a professional in it, but as he gets the so called Y2K at the end of the movie, the so called faster bike ever, it can go from 0 to 200 km/h in 10 seconds, even there, he shows no fear in driving. Henry's girlfriend, the witness of the crime scene, has face expressions that lie 100% to what she says about Ford. No witness would testify like her, but hey, this is an action movie! Woo!! And Trey doesn't show almost nothing at all of regret or anger for his brother's loss. The only thing that the makers of this movie seemed to care for was to shoot the action stunts, kill the bad guy and end this movie as quick as possible. (It doesn't run even 90 min).This might be fun watching, but it is nothing compared to the real action movies, like James Bond's, or Schwarzenneger's or Bruce Willis' or many others, which run longer (this is not necessary, but opens doors for a more detailed, richer plot), have greater plots and, most of all, greater performances as well. I liked watching Torque. But there are many other better action movies out there.",

The whole pseudo-mafia \"i own these roads\" mentality was a bit much but it was for plot value.Cube's brother (character) trying to act all tough, as if he wanted to prove himself, by making deals with the main biker gang antagonist was too obvious and you could just tell that this dude was gonna die quick.This movie goes from outskits of cities into the main cities and their streets so it covers a decent amount of distance. The action is pretty solid and the acting is decent as well.To enjoy this movie you have to expect characters with too much attitude (which is really common, in real life, all over where i live) and you would be better off \"not\" being \"a bike person\" and watching this because, going in with that attitude, automatically puts a strain on the enjoyment of the movie.Watch it for the sake of just enjoying an action movie and you will like it.",

NO!!Some directors need to not make movies out of everything, because it would get ridiculous just as is Torque. Acting is awful, stunts are cheap, and computer animations are so cheap it makes you depressed.

The unfortunate souls who paid to see this movie should be pitied, and professional help sought. This movie is that bad. Here's why...1) The movie is only 80 minutes long. For a 'mainstream' mass distribution movie that is short. The viewer should be thankful though because the suffering won't be that long. Also, the story itself couldn't take much more stretching.2) The story is clich\u00e9, and not even in a fun way. It is mind numbingly straight forward. The only twist in the movie isn't surprising, and the plot is about as thick as the vacuum of space.3) The acting and dialogue. Oh, it's very hard not to be sarcastic. The only thing worse than the acting is the dialogue being delivered by said acting. It is very clear that the writer was inspired by a high school hall fight. The delicate prose fluttering off the tongues of cast is so artificial and ridiculous it would make real gangsters vomit.Torque makes many attempts poking fun at the Fast and the Furious, failing spectacularly at all of them. It's hard for Torque to make fun when it sucks so much worse than Fast & Furious.4) The effects and editing are poor, to say the least. During the big fight scene in the garage I thought my cable was skipping from the abrupt and choppy camera changes. It turns out the editor is also an idiot.5) Abuse of product placement. This is the most grievous of Torque's crimes. I was compelled NOT to buy Pepsi products after watching this movie. It's hard to take the fight between the two main female characters when every other shift in the scene places one of them in front of an enormous Mountain Dew or Pepsi billboard (that is clean and pristine looking despite being under a bridge at a farmers market).Not withstanding all the things already said on why the movie is bad is also the vast amount of technical errors violating physical and natural law. I leave this to experience yourself should you choose to see this movie (which I hope you won't). If you do watch it at least you can get a laugh from the sheer absurdity of it all.2/10",

            "content": "This movie delivers a lot of goods that you'd expect: Gratuitous violence and scantily clad women - Ain't nuthin' wrong with that. Harebrained story - Gotta get from one action scene to the next. Clich\u00e9s, clich\u00e9s, clich\u00e9s - OK, OK, I get it: The good guys ride streetbikes, the bad guys choppers. Miserable acting - Goes with the territory. Unbelievable characters - The FBI guys is completely over the top, which is exactly what some of us want to see in a movie like this. Predictable ending - One more reason to watch stupid action movies, The Bad Guy always gets it in the end.As much as you'd expect these things, the movie still manages to overdo each one of them, going from \"Ok, that was to be expected\" to \"Wow, even worse acting / more clich\u00e9s / worse story / etc than Steven Seagal's (Insert name of any Seagal movie here)\".Unfortunately it only gets worse, as it also contains a lot of things that you don't expect: Bad CGI - Come on, guys, you can do better than that. Horribly stupid fight scenes on motorcycles - Doing a stoppie and smashing your rear wheels together? Hello? Are you fighting or performing a motorcycle ballett? Badly made fight scenes on motorcycles - The chicks are hitting and stabbing each other while going something like 734 mph and their motorcycles don't budge or swerve, they just don't move at all and keep perfect distance from each other. They look as if they're bolted to the ground, which is not surprising as they probably are. Action scenes that do not require suspense of disbelief, but suspense of all rational thought - We know that the good guy can perform a stoppie with one hand, fire his gun with the other and kill seven bad guys with one shot. We've seen it in MI:2, so we know it's possible. But - Jumping from one trainwagon to another without your front or rear wheel getting caught - Going from 100mph to zero and dropping in between two wagons - Racing through a train and opening doors that actually open TOWARDS you by ramming them with your front wheel - Racing through construction sites, taking out the wooden barriers with your unhelmeted head - For anyone who has ever ridden a motorcycle this is just beyond ridiculous. This kind of action gets boring because it loses all sense of suspense or surprise, it's just arbitrary. You would simply not be surprised if the good guy sprouted wings and started shooting death rays from his eyes.But the one thing, the one single thing that really, really ticked me off completely: Good guy and good chick are talking/flirting on a children's playground, with the good guy drinking a Bud (Can you spell Product Placement?) - When he's done he throws the bottle over his shoulder and it smashes on the ground. On a children's playground. Let's give that caveman a big round of applause.The movie should get a 1, but I rated it a 2 out of 10 because it has motorcycles in it. I know - I'm too sentimental for this world, sue me.",

            "content": "This movie had promise - good looking men and women in tight leather outfits, fast bikes, lots of action, a fair amount of violence, a decent soundtrack, and actually a potential plot line. And it starts out OK.But then about half way through the movie it seems as if another director took over (or maybe Joseph Kahn started smoking something funny). It appears to me that Kahn should have stuck to music videos and probably thought that the silly quick shots from MTV would carry over to a full length movie.In the second half of the movie the action sequences start taking on a completely unrealistic aspect to them that wasn't present in the first half. In one example the FBI agents are driving a large SUV at over 100 MPH when they hit a construction site causing the SUV to fly through the air as it flips over. The next shot shows the SUV falling straight down as if it lost all of its forward momentum. IT falls onto another car, crushing both. and yet the FBI agents are completely unharmed.Also, in the ending action scenes there are numerous shots that belong in The Matrix or another fantasy action movie, not this movie.I am all for slightly exaggerated action sequences and bike riding, but the outlandish shots found in the second half of the movie are totally out of line with the \"realistic\" story line in the first half of the movie.On top of that, the dialog is completely cheesy, also getting worse in the second half of the movie.So maybe another director started the movie and Kahn finished it. I can think of no other reason for such a discrepancy, other than the notion that Kahn is completely out of his depth when attempting a full length movie. Taking a video directing mentality to the full screen rarely works, and this is a good example of that.",

            "content": "If you are a fan of movies such as \"Battlefield Earth\", \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and \"Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter\", then this film is totally for you. If you know even a little about motorcycles, then you will find it funnier than the \"Naked Gun\".*MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW*The film has one tiny virtue - unlike \"Biker Boyz\", the *ahem* scriptwriters of this masterpiece have realised that motorcyclists do not regard riding in a straight line as interesting. So there IS one good sequence early on of a group of riders tackling a twisty desert highway. I was almost misled into believing that it might be a decent film, but that didn't last.Virtues now dealt with, let's explore the full artistic squalor that Torque delivers. I won't bother with the plot - suffice it to say that there are these really mean biker gangs who will happily slaughter someone with a bike chain, sell large quantities of hard drugs but who won't use the *F* word.\nThe acting - there isn't any. With dialogue like this, you wouldn't want to use real actors - their own bowels would rise up and throttle them before permitting these lines to be uttered in front of a camera.\nBut it's a motorcycle movie, so let's examine that aspect. In case anyone doesn't know, there are two main divisions of motorcycle - street and dirt. The entire design approach is different for some very good reasons - if you put a street bike on loose dirt, it will generally fall over due to lack of traction. Miraculously, the bikes in Torque seem quite capable of doing the most spectacular stunts on very loose sand. I'll forgive that - keen eyed observers will note that they simply took dirt bikes, glued some plastic (known as 'fairings') on them to make them look like street bikes and found some very skilled dirt riders for the stunts. However, as the movie progresses, the scriptwriters felt the need to delve deeper and deeper into the realm of silliness, with increasingly ridiculous stunts that first defy and then insult the laws of physics. The train scene involves one pirouette that fails to observe the rule that \"if the real wheel spins, the bike goes forward\".The final all-CGI chase sequence is so stupid it's hard to make comments - the Harley cruiser being chased probably has a top speed of 100 mph, yet it appears to be travelling at speeds in excess of 300 mph. In this era of Lord of the Rings, it's hard to believe that CGI this bad could be released - it looks like they couldn't think of anything interesting to show, so they just blurred everything. Including the jet-engine Y2K motorcycle was a nice touch at least (it really does exist).A few other technical comments - generally when moving at 150 mph, long blonde hair gets blown about by the wind, but not in TORQUE. During all that blue screen work, surely some technician could have stood in front of the girl with a hair dryer at least. The product placement is laughably clumsy - there is a \"Pepsi-Mountain Dew\" battle, and you only ever see two brand names of motorcycle (the British Triumph and Italian Aprilia) although it is obvious that 98% of the bikes are Japanese. The film has a large number of massive explosions caused by crashing bikes. As most of the bikes would have 17-20 litre tanks (5-7 gallons) and given that they have been riding around in the desert all day and so would be near empty , I find it hard to believe that they could create a 50 foot explosion, but maybe that's just me.\nEven for the fact that the bike stunts are so silly, they are still the best aspect of the film, and had they occupied most of the film I would have graded it higher. Unfortunately to get to the bike stunts we have to sit through way too many lengthy and turgid periods of \"drama\".\nI gave the film 2/10, mainly for the producers having the sheer audacity to go for a theatre release and not condemning it to \"straight to video\".",

The story about stolen bikes stuffed with drugs is interesting, but ultimately it's the visual creativity of the mtv style that hooks you in as well as the sexy cast.If there's one down point to this film, it's the Vin Diesel factor. There is none. There is no actor here who can fill his shoes, and certainly not Ice Cube. While a decent actor, I think it was a dumb part of the producers to think he could provide the Diesel factor. The rest of the cast consists of completely unknown people. They should have just paid for Vin. Then the movie would be about as perfect of a guilty pleasure as you could imagine!It feels even shorter than the brief running time because it blazes by.

And then all is left are the stupid stunts that the \"COOL\" actors perform with their bikes......Seen it in \"Mission Impossible 2\", you see it here also. Super sport bikes designed for racing or street use, going off road and in a second they become 20 cm taller with on-off tires, jumping from everything....that can give a cool jump. But in this movie it's even worst....did you watch the train scene? I don't think that I can say anything about that. Just fast forward it cos it doesn't make any sense. But wait!!!! It gets even better.....or should I say worst (?)Have you seen motorcycle-boxing? You will in this movie, I guarantee it:) YES, the 2 sexy-cool-biker women cannot only drive their bikes but they can also box them.As for last, I think the 2 bikes that go hyper-sonic is where the director went bananas.

            "content": "OK. I'm just going to cut through. I don't care if the best critics says this is crap or good. I'm tired of critics judging movies. But that doesn't make me say that this is a 'modern day masterpiece' like some idiot on the board started saying - he probably hasn't even watched any other movie in his life besides these rubbish 'biker' flicks. Anyway, so I just wanted to make an acknowledgement. All you people, who supposedly say that it's the worst movie ever, bla bla bla, DO NOT deny that the visual impact of the movie isn't at least FASCINATING. I mean, when I rented the movie, I simply KNEW that I was about to see something crap. BUT, I was greatly impressed when I watched the first quarter of the movie. The cinematography, direction, special effects and editing are VERY impressive. You have to admit, the movie is gorgeous to look at. Beautiful people, shiny cars and motorcycles, colourful cinematography and colours all over, fast-paced edited action scenes, camera work very skillful capturing different angles, special effects extraordinary (not very real-looking though - doesn't matter!); heck, even the music and songs were good (shame to hear Nickelback's 'Someday' in rubbish like this, but anyway).The screenplay is *beep*. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the first words jumped in. The one-liners were simply pathetic. I would sit there, enjoying the imagery when their mouths would just go on and on and on, and I would sit there and just nod in disbelief. Sure, the action scenes weren't that enjoyable since there is absolutely ZERO character development, therefore you don't actually give a damn if a character dies or not. Alas, the visuals made up for it and made it a tad bit of entertaining. The story is absolutely horrible. Plot holes are all over the place, for example: You don't know where these people actually got the motorcycles from and never find out; or you never get to find out how these motorcycles can actually speed so amazingly; or even what the hell those little yellow liquid bottles are. LOADS of plot holes. When the movie DOES end though, you feel as if you have just watched the biggest waste of money on CGI and cinematography. I'm still in disbelief.The director seems to be skilled, but he also seems to have stigmata with crappy little scripts like this one. Fast and the Furious was one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Seriously now. And I've even watched it three times. Just to make sure. Then comes XXX - a not-so crappy movie, but still one of the worst. And finally SWAT, the biggest waste of police costumes I've seen on film. Another horrible movie. Too bad... Joseph Kahn has a lot of potential and a unique vision. Let's hope in the future he gets better screenplays to show off his visual qualities with. Oh and let's not forget: the acting was horrendous. Of course, it isn't the actor's fault that the screenplay is stupid, so they just have to tag along and say whatever their stupendous characters say. They seem to be made up of models. Everyone is so nicely dressed and made up throughout the movie. Absolute waste of talent. What talent? I'm sorry, there IS no talent here. So, overall, I give this movie a 4/10. The four is to show how much I enjoyed the visual work. Oh and if you think I'm too strict/lenient, remember: I'm a guy who have both Charlie's Angels movies a 10/10, along with Van Helsing 10/10, and also Troy 10/10 - but I gave a movie like Casino a 7/10. That was because I enjoyed them all and, didn't enjoy them so much... So, in the end, Torque gets 3 points above Fast and the Furious and XXX, that got 1/10 (my lowest ratings ever), and 1 point above SWAT that got a decent 3/10. Savvas Stavrou's Rating: 4/10 - Watch it for the visuals, nothing else.",

Then Ice Cube and his mates turn up and it goes rapidly downhill with awful dialogue, massive clich\u00e9s and a total misrepresentation of how bikers relate to one and other from the off.\nThen there's the blatantly rubbish and obvious continuity errors, the main one being that the rival protagonists in the film end up chasing each other on their super slick race bikes, off-road, it's plainly obvious that you can't take a race bike off road, it just won't work, it's akin to taking an F1 car down a stage of the World Rally Championship.  So what do the producers do?  Dress up some off road bikes as the race bikes from the film, use nice wide shots and fast cuts then cross their fingers and hope we won't notice.  Awful.  Then there's a scene where Ice Cube's bike is smashed to smithereens under a train and he ends up with the hero's bike, cut to a few scenes later where Ice Cube is riding his original bike again.Things just get worse with the awful, awful stunts culminating in a bike fight with the two opposing female bikers and a chase scene with \"The fastest bike in the world\" against a Harley Davidson which manages to keep ahead for a time with a nitrous oxide boost that seems to last about ten minutes!  Supposedly the climax of the film is probably the worst piece of cinema I have ever seen and I've seen quite a few of Jean Claude Van Damme's efforts, too.Surely film makers can make a biker film without having to resort to ridiculous stunts which just look terrible, laughably awful clich\u00e9s and terrible testosterone fueled dialogue.Bring back easy rider.",

When a guy without a helmet crashes a motorcycle at 80 to 100 mph hits the ground, rolls a few times and jumps up and starts fighting someone ... that's friggin' funny! It seems any time anyone crashes a motorcycle there is always someone to fight the minute you stop rolling. The biggest laughs are when they're riding super-bikes 100+ mph zig-zagging through traffic as if that weren't enough they're also having a gunfight and the guy in front is looking backward most of the time! Why not an meteorite fight?As far as I can tell this is supposed to be The Matrix meets On Any Sunday meets any gangster movie meets any teen romance movie but misses the mark by so far you can't begin to believe it. BTW what the hell were the dancing horses/motorcycles all about?! I'm giving it 2 stars because I don't know when I've ever laughed that hard ...",

            "content": "This movie is a lot more fun than most of the previous reviewers have given it credit for. The actors are fun to look at, the dialog doesn't take itself seriously, and is relatively cleverly written, and the plot rises occasionally to the level of interesting (which is all it has to be for a film of this type). Ice Cube's deadpan portrayal of a motorcycle gang leader is threatening and fits the film just right. There is chemistry between Mazur and Henderson, the kind that makes you want them to get together, and keeps you watching the movie, rooting for them. Personally, I think Pressly steals the film as a pierced biker's moll--every scene she's in sparkles with a misdirected but fascinating sexual tension.The only real weakness of the film (as entertainment, not art) is that the direction is a bit uneven, and sometimes you can't tell whether the director wants the film to be realistic or totally cartoonish, and the fluctuation makes it difficult to maintain the willing suspension of disbelief that's required for this type of film.",

It doesn't have the spark, wit, or heart of even that pale imitation of \"Fast and the Furious\". Had one taken the exact script to \"Torque\" and shot it with tongue placed in cheek, it would have been a hilarious parody of overblown and over-serious summer action flicks. As it is, they shot this movie with utter seriousness, with such utter conviction that it was an amazing film, that it's still pretty funny... you're just laughing at, not with. It becomes even funnier when, after spending the film mocking \"car movies\", they wind up including a Nascar-style racer in one of the climactic chase scenes... which looks more like some sort of stunt show clip montage rather than a single chase and scene. The movie seems to take quite a bit from a video game called \"Road Rash\", right down to the style of bikers, scenes on bikes of riding along trying to punch each other off. Sadly, the game was much more entertaining than this. The movie rips off other movies and several video games very heavily, and is generally not subtle about doing so. It never bothers giving an explanation for just how these biker toughs gained martial arts skills... perhaps they came free with purchase of their bikes.It's hard to imagine a movie which rides so heavily on its explosions, stunts, and wiggling female flesh as being so full of itself, but \"Torque\" accomplishes that. It gets a rating of three only for a few clever lines, and the fact that I am indeed enough of a sap to give it an extra point for all the really neat-looking motorcycles.",

            "content": "View from the Second Star: TorqueHop on, strap in, and prepare to go nowhere; you're watching Torque, Hollywood's latest (and I think poorest) attempt to cash in on the success enjoyed by The Fast and the Furious. The film is directed by Joseph Kahn and stars Martin Henderson as Ford, a biker who sort of looks like a cross between Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai, and Aragorn in LOTR. He was set up for murder by an old rival, and now he's on the run from revenge bent gang leader Ice Cube, and some FBI guy who gets his fashion advice from Ryan Seacrest.  That's the story in a nutshell, and it's what the film force feeds down the audience's throat in the first three minutes of the film: pathetic.It wouldn't take much to save this film; just a story, characters, and maybe some element of realism. When I first saw The Fast and the Furious, I wasn't really impressed. Okay acting, not much of a story. To me, this picture was going nowhere real fast; but still, I do admit, it was fun to watch. And upon subsequent viewings, I managed to change my mind about that little fan favorite. Stories don't always have to be the only focus, and characters, as long as they exist, can sometimes forgivably take a backseat to action. On the other hand, Torque makes The Fast and the Furious look like the Shawshank Redemption.Due to the lack of any character development at all, every scene designed to put tension into the audience only results in boredom on the viewer's part. One never worries about these characters onscreen because they're paper thin lumps of flesh whom the audience has no common bond. The films characters, each with no more than one basic trait (example: I'm a drug running black guy in a gang), bombard the boring protagonist with simplistic story elements and excessively wretched lines of dialogue. In essence the film sits you on grandpa's knee and explains the entire mess in first grade vocabulary. I feel more emotionally involved after watching a bank commercial than I did after seeing this mass of garbage.This film suffers from something I last experienced while watching Xena: Warrior Princess. It's when the main characters are superhumans just for the heck of it. The uniquely named \"Ford\" fights off car drivers like he's Jet Li, and races his motorbike through passenger trains. Believe me, the train scene looks every bit as corny as it sounds. Fast cars/bikes are pretty cool, but when every single element of reality is removed so is ever iota of me caring. The endless cartoon visuals serve only as a constant reminder why the CG in Star Wars made fans hate Jar Jar Binks.I guess the characters in this film immortal. They must be: they don't sleep, eat, or get injured by anything. They don't even seem to have houses or homes of any kind. And for some reason every lead character seems think that Mexico is the land of ultimate bliss. When they mess up their bikes I guess they just find new ones somewhere and they must have a huge stockpile of cash because nobody has a job. Ice Cubes gang doesn't even seem to trade drugs, so they must have gone legit: whatever. Plot holes and surrealisms exist around every corner in this train wreck of a production. What a mess.If I was related to the director of this film, and he asked me, \"Adam, did you like the movie?\" I would probably start crying and begin cursing him for ruining the family name, but if somehow I bit my tongue and held back my tears I might be able to spout out a few nice words regarding select bits of cinematography. Joseph Kahn is a music video director and this film proves nothing different. With a great sense of camera placement, and often intriguing visuals it's no surprise Kahn has been successful with his music videos in the past. An entire Hollywood production however, seems to have been more of a challenge for him.This film was shot for the bikes, and I admit, it does a half decent job of showcasing just what rocket powered flying machines would be capable of doing. But to stray from the only focus of this piece of rubbish for a moment, I would have to give some credit for a murder that seems out of place in this Saturday morning cartoon. It wasn't the acting and it sure wasn't the story, but for some reason the editing during this slaughter threw me out of the disaster for a few seconds. I felt like I was experiencing a movie far more meaningful, far more professional that I actually was. And for those of you who wonder what I'm talking about when you see the picture, just remember, I thought this for a moment. After 3 seconds, I was drawn back into the tornado.If you don't mind watching cartoons, and you think motorbikes can fly into space you might enjoy this film. For the rest of us, I suggest a viewing of. anything else. Three out of ten stars for this piece of trash.\nThis has been a critical review by Adam Schellenberg",

There were some ehhhh lets say sensitive words in this text but, i couldn't keep them in the text. *-/*'\u00a8-. might be some spelling mistakes I'm in a hurry.PS Truly awful believe me. :D",

I was waiting for characters to start discussing why certain brand of motorcycle parts were the best and where you could purchase them, if any respectable motorcycle outfit would have anything to do with this movie is beyond me. if i was into motorcycles at all, i would be so offended. and some of you may not know this, but the director of this movie is the one responsible for one of the worst cultural phenomenons (i can't spell tonight, sorry) and that is the THONG SONG video. I can't remember his name but if he ever reads this... PLEASE STOP. THe worst thing is this movie takes itself so seriously. Oh yeah, and when they marketed this movie, they tried to throw in fast and furious so much, and literally every comic relief part was a crack at the fast and furious. i'm tired so i'll end with this: remember, if you had no interest in this movie watch it anyways because it is so unbelievably bad it's good. i bought a copy of this movie so 10 or 20 years from now, when this movie is long, long forgotten, i can hang out with my friends and we'll start talking about really bad movies and they'll give their examples but i'll just shake my head and say \"guys.... you have no idea what a bad movie is\" and then i put this in. it'll make you laugh so hard, if your eating something, you'll spit it out because your laughing so hard and maybe even choke.",

Later though, the movie becomes absolute rubbish because about half of the farken time they're riding on gravel.  Yep, gravel.  With R1's, Gixxers and Aprilia's.  It's so bad though 'cause you can clearly see that they've modified off road bikes by putting fairings around them to look like the normal street bikes.  The bad thing is that you can CLEARLY see this by the wheels, high handlebars etc.  What a load of crap.  You should also see the impossible stunts they pull in this crap.  At the end these two chicks are fighting each other while on their bikes by wheelying their bikes without moving and slapping each other in the face with the front wheels.  They also take their hands of the throttles for so long while fighting and shooting at each other without the bikes slowing down at all.  I don't know what kind of compression ratio's those bikes are running, but what I do know is that I want my money back.  Hey Hollywood, BITE ME!!!Don't go see it. Ever!

No more than two minutes into the movie (exactly one race and one fight sequence to the wind) I had the realization that this was going to be an atrocious movie. I've never before drawn such a strong conclusion on a movie two minutes into it.What was bad? Well, the plot wasn't very entertaining, not that you go to a movie called \"Torque\" for the story. I thought the dialog and most of the acting were just bad too. I'm not expecting award winning performances, but come on ...The one thing I hated most was how absurd some of the stunts and actions were. In one scene (ooooh, plot buster!) the main stunt guy drops his bike onto a walkway between a couple of cars on a moving train. Then he rotates his 4 foot long bike in a 2 foot space and races up the aisles of the train, breaking down doors and narrowly missing train occupants. His exit from the moving train is even more preposterous.I know what you're thinking, \"Well, TOM CRUISE could have done it...\"Maybe, maybe. Anyway, I won't even comment on the 200 mph chase scene at the end through heavy LA traffic.Anything good? Yeah, the girls were all hot - I raised eyebrows at the thong shots; I appreciated the Jesse James cameo; um, there was one funny scene with some tourists too. That's it.Verdict: If someone came to your house, brought you dinner, put the dvd in, and pressed play, it still wouldn't be worth sitting there.",

From that point on we saw Humm-Vees flying, ridiculous special effects, a motorbike that destroys everything around it with it's speed, the most bizarre looking backflip on a superbike, some suicidal cop blow herself up for no apparent reason, a bus driver who grew a huge bushy beard between two camera shots, and general ridiculous shots and effects.

I put off seeing this movie for almost a year , but after owning a Hayabusa for a few months now I was getting kinda edgy for some kind of movie about motorcycles. I could tell just from the previews of this movie before it ever came out it was going to suck. I remember in one commercial of it on TV seeing a motorcycle going like 90 miles an hour, doing a stoppie into a 180 degree turn into a tree and taking back off in the opposite direction......Right! And I thought jerry bruckheimer's movies were bad. Remember the car flying over the traffic jam on \"Gone In 60 Seconds\"? How about in Con Air where the car gets hitched onto the airplane and when the airplane takes off(going at least 150MPH) and is about 200 feet in the air the car gets released and falls Straight DOWN IN FRONT OF THE OWNER as if it were never moving in the first place? Well, if that kind of stuff frustrates you, this movie will send you into a cardiac arrest. In fact, Issac Newton is turning in his grave right now!Imagine a Black Hummer doing 100 MPH when it hits a sign, that has coincidentally been knocked over into a ramp, and does a corkscrew maneuver and, at the end of the shot, is halfway though its flight. Now cut to car sitting in bumper to bumper traffic when all of a sudden a very familiar Hummer falls out of the sky from 20 feet above upside down and lands on the car.......Sort of like it was dropped from a crane.....MY GOD WHYYYYYYY?????????What about the two girl's fight scene? That was good right? I mean, we all like to see two beautiful looking girls fight right? Right? There's a chance they might kiss......UNLESS THERE FIGHTIN ON MOTORCYCLES!!!! Actually, I didn't mean to say fighting on, what I meant to say is fighting WITH motorcycles. They........You know what, I'm going to stop here before I give myself a heart attack........I guess the thing that really makes me sick when I saw this movie, is the fact that everyone in that movie probably made more money on that one movie than i will make in 20 years as a hard working citizen. That and the fact that at least one person out there might have actually liked it. If you see this movie, make sure you are with at least one other person so you two can keep yourselves sane by reassuring each other that this movie and it's \"action scenes\" suck, and your now hallucinating.",

I have never experienced this before but it felt good. Anyway, from a cinematic point of view the shots were spectacular. I could not believe this was the director Joseph Kahns first movie because it was just flat out remarkable and was definitely evolution in film because if this does not win best picture of if Joseph Kahn is not nominated for best director the people who vote for the movies are retarded. Other than that i have never seen special effects quite like these. From start to finish the effects are breathtaking.

The start of the movie proved that it had potential, and for the first half hour it showed real coolness.  Then it all went tits up!  Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a cult movie.  I knew what I was walking into.  I knew that it was going to be some OTT, cheesy one lined, muscle pumped 'that didnt really happen did it' kind of movie.  But cmon!  There's over the top, and then there's plain CRINGEWORTHY!!!  I mean **SPOILERS** of course you expect the over the top stunts like jumping onto the top of a train, but the riding through the train carriages was something else.  Then when we thought it couldn't it possibly couldn't get any worse, **SPOILERS** those two women had a 10 minute fight whilst riding their bikes.  OH MY GOD!  Coupled with a policewoman who was caught in the middle of a massive warehouse explosion but managed to survive with a bruise, and a final sequence that looked like a computer game, we all left feeling pretty happy.

It's the Fast  the Furious on motorcycles! Torque is a ridiculous film from the producers of the Fast  the Furious, and it's basically the same movie except for a few key points. First they didn't have the budget of the Fast  the Furious which is evident by the stunts, which at times actually looked like a video game. I'm all for stunt men doing impossible things, and I don't mind good computer generated action either, however the CGI in Torque is just ridiculously bad, it is however nowhere near as bad as the acting. Instead of Vin Diesel and the dashing Paul Walker, the producers of this film settled for Ice Cube and some guy no one has ever heard of and trust me, the inexperience shows. This film is just as bad as all the other reviews say it is. Some poorly written, badly acted films, can be entertaining...Torque is not!",
