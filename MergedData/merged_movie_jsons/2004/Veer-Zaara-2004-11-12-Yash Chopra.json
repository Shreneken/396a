            "content": "Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara is a film about humanity, devotion, sacrifice, and the power of love. It is a visually stunning and emotionally touching picture about star-crossed lovers who meet once and are tied forever. Yash Chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion and some overdone sentimentality. Although the love story itself, the separation and everything else is very typical, Chopra creates an entirely different film in the way it portrays the respect the lovers have for each other, the honour they pay to parents and elders, and their genuine willingness to sacrifice themselves for each other. It is a cross-border love story between an Indian and a Pakistani, yet their nationality is not what prevents them from being together. That's what really makes sense in this film. It flows very well through the stunning views of Indian and Pakistani fields and groves, and colourfully shows the bright sides of each country. The film does look a bit dated, but then it does not have a defined period of historical time, which makes it an all-time saga.The film also addresses women's empowerment through Rani Mukherjee's role of a Pakistani lawyer who tries to overcome society. There are many surprising and touching moments in the film. The love story is portrayed grandiosely, with larger-than-life orchestral music of heavy violins and piano. The movie soundtrack is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack in recent years, and the fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes to the epic mood of the film. Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta are great choices for the film. They resuscitate their characters with restraint and dignity and have a credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction. Khan is the main soul of the film and he is believable in everything his character goes through. Tremendously nuanced, Zinta is beautiful and compelling as the intelligent and headstrong Zaara, and looks ethereal in traditional outfits. Rani Mukhejee makes a great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role of the tenacious, level-headed Saammiya. She is natural and impressive and walks out leaving a mark.Veer-Zaara, though a completely entertaining and often overwhelming epic romance, is not the greatest film you'll see and it often goes over-the-top with its abundant emotional quotinent. It is far from being flawless and has its share of loopholes where script is concerned. Having said that, it just doesn't matter here. This film is far ahead of anything it can be blamed for. It is about the main values a person should cherish in life: humanity, respect and love, and it conveys this message very well. Chopra manages to bring together a remarkable group of skilled actors to play the supporting roles, including Kirron Kher, Divya Dutta, Boman Irani, Manoj Bajpai, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, and Anupam Kher, all of whom play their respective parts to perfection, bringing layering and realism to their different, relatively short but memorably interesting characters. As a cinematic experience, it is both a visual and artistic treat. In this regard, it is one of those films which become classics instantly, and I recommend it to anyone, whoever and wherever he or she is.",

Just when you think you know where the story is going, you are pleasantly surprised and therefore enthralled as the story unveils.People either love SRK or hate him, but I think he delivers what is necessary for this role without going over the top.The surprise appearances are great, and Priety Zinta is getting better with every role.Last, but certainly not least, the music is superb. If you have no other reason to see this movie, see it to know the story that was finally told with these beautiful songs.10 out of 10",

            "content": "The Chopras have proved once again that you can always count on them to provide the highest quality cinema. I'd first like to applaud Shahrukh for outdoing himself once again by playing both a young, simple-natured squadron and an old, tormented prisoner so convincingly. His skillful subtleties and attention to each detail of his performance have undoubtedly turned him to the best actor I have ever seen. I think he has even surpassed Amitabh. Even though Rani and Preity's roles didn't seem to demand too much from them, they gave a wonderful performance. Even Manoj Bajpai did an excellent job. The story is fabulous. Where the traditional Bollywood film could take the same situations with different outcomes for each event to turn the film into the same familiar fare, Veer-Zaara makes turns it into an epic love story where Veer and Zaara's names can be added to the list of Devdas and Paro, Shah Jahaan and Mumtaaz, etc. The main minus point of the film is its music. Warning: Don't listen to the music before watching the film or it will sound horrendous! Tere Liye, however, is extremely beautiful and melodic. After watching the movie, Aisa Des Hai Mera and Main Yahan Hoon are quite likable. Unfortunately, the latter two are not ones that one can keep humming for several months. Another minor yet negligible drawback is that this movie can't appeal as much to the youth as Yash Chopra's previous film, Dil to Pagal Hai. An addicting soundtrack and a youthful appeal were two things that seemed to be missing, which are usually guaranteed in every Chopra extravaganza. Nonetheless, Veer-Zaara is fantastic!",

            "content": "\"Veer-Zaara\" was shown as part of an international film series at my local public library. It is the first Bollywood musical I have ever seen, and as such, I lack the critical perspective necessary to make an informed judgement about it. However, I did rate \"Veer-Zaara\" seven out of ten, because I found it consistently entertaining, and often entirely delightful. I was never once bored - in spite of its three hour plus running time. In order to appreciate any form of musical drama, it's necessary to \"surrender\" to theatrical artifice, and seen in that light, \"Veer-Zaara\" is no more illogical or \"unrealistic\" than a classic Vincent Minnelli Musical or a \"serious\" Verdi opera. I was also very intrigued at the way that the plot of the film crossed several genres and combined a number of classic story-telling archetypes: \"the star-crossed lovers,\" \"the village pastorale,\" \"the saga of family honor,\" \"the courtroom drama,\" etc.Watching this film I think I learned a lot about modern Indian culture. Although at times the sentimentality in \"Veer-Zaara\" is so gushing that it enters into the realm of camp, there is also much substance in the film which is entirely admirable and worthy of esteem: the honor paid to parents and elders, the independence and spirit shown by strong and intelligent women, the respect given to Law and Justice, and perhaps most importantly, the possibility of peace and reconciliation between two peoples and two nations who have been engaged in a long, bitter, and fruitless quarrel.",

            "content": "The main purpose of the cinema is to entertain.Entertainment can mean different things to different people.Normally we expect a lot of emotion in Indian movies.If emotion makes you feel like throwing up, you should not really be watching Indian Hindi movies.If you are really taken with realism, watch a documentary. If you want to get away from the mundane affairs of everyday life watch a Hindi movie.Veer Zaara is a Hindi movie with lots of emotion. The audience identify with the characters and go back to watching it again and again.One must realise that a movie is a hit only when the audience is able to identify themselves with the characters.Questions do come to mind. Like, how did Rani Mukherjee know Veer's name? Maybe Yash Chopra made a mistake. The mistake did not cost him anything because the movie succeeded at the box-office.It might also have taken too long a time to give an explanation.And the movie is already 192 minutes long. A flaw nevertheless, but then you can find faults with just about everything. If you have negative vibes about the person playing the principal character in a movie, you really should not be watching the movie in the first place. SRK has become a living legend.He is a good actor. He has done well as the young squadron leader as well as the ageing prisoner. Twenty two years in jail can age a man beyond his years. Shahrukh was convincing.Preity was her usual bubbly self initially, and then equally convincing.The movie was fast paced.Editing was good. No where did it drag.The songs were excellent.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Vijay Venkataramanan Reviewer's Rating: 9 out of 10It's Diwali - the time for sweets, new clothes, fireworks, and as is customary every year in India, a star-studded, feel-good blockbuster. Yash Chopra's reclamation of the director's throne after seven long years is a simple return to the classical traditions of mainstream Indian film-making. The flair and sensitivity for romance is intact along with the passion for deep-rooted cultural and traditional mis-en-scene. However, neither is \"Veer Zaara\" a classic, nor is it even remotely comparable to Chopra's earlier masterpieces such as \"Silsila\", \"Kaala Pathar\", \"Kabhie Kabhie\", and \"Lamhe\". Yet, it is an ideal Diwali gift, exquisitely packaged, filled to the brim with sentiments and emotions, presented with only the best of intentions.Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) has been decaying in a Pakistani prison for twenty-two years. Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee), a local lawyer representing the Human Rights Commission undertakes the challenge of fighting for Veer so he can return to India. As Saamiya tries to unearth the hidden truth behind why and how Veer ended up in this situation, we are taken through a trip down memory lane as Veer recollects the days when he found and lost the love of his life, a Pakistani girl called Zaara (Priety Zinta).What \"Veer Zaara\" lacks in terms of an innovative plot structure, it more than makes up for with Aditya Chopra's sometimes flawed, but sensitive writing. The supporting characters are extremely well fleshed out, and his dialogs witty and subtle. The storytelling is further enhanced with Javed Akhtar's lyrical wizardry, and Yash Chopra's tact for stretching defining moments of the story into musical interludes continues to fascinate. \"Do pal ruka, khwaabon ka kaarvaan\", a fine example of Mr. Akhtar's and Mr. Chopra's brilliance remains etched in your memory.The film's grand-scale packaging is embellished by Sharmishta Roy's artistic, and exquisitely detailed production design, with each set being highly reflective of the characters that it holds in. Cinematographer Anil Sharma (Lagaan, Kal Ho Na Ho) sets up a rustic, yet opulent scheme to the film's largely rural setting that brings back memories of the evergreen \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge\".Actors including the great Amitabh Bachchan (who makes a stunning special appearance in this film with Hema Malini) have always elevated their performances to higher levels under Yash Chopra's baton. Rani Mukherjee follows in the same footsteps, playing the rookie lawyer with an admirable juxtaposition of nervousness and ferocity. While Preity Zinta and Shahrukh Khan too perform well in their respective roles, at no point does one feel that these two talented actors are ever challenged with roles such as these. Having played the loverboy so many times in the past, Veer Pratap Singh is a cakewalk for the Khan. The lead pair's chemistry from their younger days all the way to the days of their fifties is highly appreciable however. The supporting cast comprising of Divya Dutta, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani, and Manoj Bajpai make full use of their well-defined characters to enact high-caliber performances.Other than the story of two fanatically devoted lovers, \"Veer Zaara\" is a progressive film for the Indian Film Industry because it makes an effort to break stereotypes with respect to Indo-Pak relations. It is a welcome change from the mindless Pak-bashing fare that we are routinely subjected to. Sensitive approaches like this first of all would help improve cultural ties, considering Hindi movies do comprise of a large portion of India's unofficial exports to Pakistan. Equally important is the economic factor because a culturally sensitive film like \"Veer Zaara\" is bound to officially open up a potentially huge, untapped, cinema-going audience across the border",

            "content": "Many folks around the world do not remember the history that has transpired between India and Pakistan in the last 70 years. When India was subdivided into India, East Pakistan (later known as Bangladesh) and West Pakistan, it coincided with LOTS of sectarian violence between Hindus and Muslims. It also touched off wars and between one and two million people were killed! It was an awful time and led to both nations developing atomic weapons--after which, an uneasy stalemate has existed in the region. In this problem spot of the world is where this love story is based--a story about an Indian man (Shah Rukh Khan) and Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta). The movie begins in Pakistan. Zaara's elderly grandmother is dying and begs her to take her ashed back to India where she was born. Despite the poor relations between the countries, Zaara agrees to go and during her journey (not surprisingly) she meets Veer and they soon fall in love. This portion of the film is very, very sweet--my favorite part of the film. However, things are NOT going to be easy--this IS an Indian romance and at over three hours in length, you know SOMETHING is going to come between their love.What happens to Veer is something you'll have to see for yourself-- but it clearly is an awful injustice and is highly reminiscent of Dumas' \"The Man in the Iron Mask\". This film really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster, that's for sure! In the process, some of the biggest film stars in India are there to support the main characters--with Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher and Rani Mukerji on hand. While these names may not mean much to non-Bollywood fans, they are all mega- stars and make this one of the most star-studded Indian films I have ever seen. Combined with some amazing scenery and cinematography, clearly Yash Chopra pulled out all the stops to make this film.Overall, this is a wonderful and stirring romance--and I highly recommend it. The only part that didn't ring true for me was the little speech made by Kher near the end...it just seemed a bit trite and hard to believe. Still, a terrific film and one that stars two of the most beautiful women ever to have appeared on screen as well as two terrifically handsome and virile leading men.",

            "review_title": "\"Gift of the Magi\" in Bollywood format",
            "content": "SOME SPOILERS: As some other reviewers have commented, this movie is like grand opera. That does not bother me at all--it is what I expect from Bollywood musicals of the grand, traditional type. (Better grand opera than fifth-rate-MTV cheeze.) I also wasn't especially bothered by some of the implausibility of the plot: I did think SRK's Veer was a bit too doddering for a man who is theoretically only in his early fifties, 22 years in prison or not. On the other hand, it didn't bother me that Saamiya knew his name. He had given his interrogators his name before he decided on silence, and presumably that name was in his files.What some might consider a major, major flaw (or at least deeply disappointing) is the basic premise. After Veer sacrifices himself to save Zaara's honor, she throws her honor away. What is Veer's sacrifice for, if she doesn't marry and have children, if her family is destroyed anyway? But--whether intentional or not--this is what makes the movie interesting to me, because the pointless sacrifice is mutual.\"Veer-Zaara\" is like a Bollywood version of the old O. Henry story, \"The Gift of the Magi,\" which focuses on a young married couple who are very much in love. They are poor, and have only two possessions of value: she has her long, lovely hair and he has a beautiful pocket watch. Each wishes to surprise the other with a Christmas present that will reflect the depth of their love for one another. So what do they do? She sells her lovely hair to buy him a chain for his watch, and he sells his watch to buy her an ornamental comb for her hair. The mutual sacrifices cancel each other out, and are meant to ironically underline the over-the-top foolishness of their love for each other.How much more pointless is it that Veer sacrifices 22 years of his life to save the honor of Zaara and her family, while Zaara sacrifices her honor and family in order to live Veer's life? I think the pointlessness of the sacrifice (that they cancel each other out) is deliberate, though, because we see it through the eyes of Saamiya, who says, \"What century do these people live in? Are they human beings pretending to be gods or gods disguised as human beings?\" It is up to each viewer to decide whether the sacrifices of Veer and Zaara are noble and romantic, or foolishly romantic.The only problem I have with the basic premise is that Veer's choice is presented as either/or: Either he explains what he is really doing in Lahore and ruins Zaara, or he sacrifices himself. But what if he had said that Zaara's mother had sent for him, because she wanted to meet the man who had saved her daughter's life? Ideally, the screenplay would have allowed for such a choice, and found a way to close the door on it. This was not a great flaw for me, though, because Veer is not behaving like an intelligent young man capable of outwitting his captors. He has, after all, come to Pakistan in a state of mind where he is ready and willing, and even eager, to immolate himself on the altar of love.The movie itself is beautifully filmed. There isn't much going on apart from the love story, but sometimes a grand over-the-top romance is worth watching. I did not find SRK embarrassing, as I sometimes did in \"Kal Ho Naa Ho.\" He was very good, as was Zinta as a slightly spoiled girl who begins showing her actual determination and nobility of spirit and as soon as she is tested by her nanny's death. And I found all the cast up to their roles, especially Rani Mukherji. I didn't even know, when I first saw the film, that Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were going to be in it. How delighted I was when I saw that they were! And how cleverly their roles in the film were designed: they are living the happy ending that Veer and Zaara will step into after they return to the village.",

However, I saw the whole movie and enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. Not being a hypocrite, I am giving it the score it deserves for its emotion and entertainment. This movie, almost as the epitome of Bollywood, is not one bit ashamed of having star-crossed lovers, true and eternal love and devotion, selfless sacrifice in the name of love, justice, idealistic religious syncretism, and mutually inclusive patriotism and respect for the neighboring nation. Combined with that of course you have songs sung by eminent playback singers, beautiful cinematography and attractive actors. Acting wise, initially SRK's totally fake prisoner-getup really annoyed me, with its fake powdered hair and totally unconvincing geriatric quiver. The obviousness of the dialogue when he first starts speaking also bored me. Then there's Preity's silly (but cute) little song. But these things really opened the way up for the movie, let the audience know, 'Hey, this isn't like your world, it's totally different. Abandon disbelief (completely), all ye that enter.' So I had to disarm myself and give into Bollywood, and into all the pure, romantic love, colorful clothes, wide stretches of beautiful village scenery, rather inaccurate but still well-meant depiction of Pakistani and Muslim societies, and all the idealistic sociopolitical ideas one wants in such a movie. But there is still something unexpected here. Before the resolve we see the aftermath of a sacrifice from both parties. You see that even though they are reunited, they have definitely lost a lot. SRK did a good job here in carrying through his prison mannerisms and not losing them at Zaara's sight. They are reunited but a sense of loss is maintained. A somewhat bittersweet trace in a very sweet movie.",

The film stars Shah Rukh khan, Preity Zinta & Rani Mukherjee playing the lead roles while actors like Anupam Kher, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani comes under the supporting cast. Kudos to legends Amitabh Bachchan & Hema Malini for their cameos. The movie is set under the backdrop of enmity between India and Pakistan and the way it affects the lives of two lovers. A very old and weak Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh ( Shah Rukh Khan) has spend 22 years of his life in Lahore jail situated in Pakistan abandoning his freedom and happiness only for the sake of his love Zaara's happiness (Preity Zinta). A ray of hope rises in his life when rookie lawyer Samiya ( Rani) comes for the sheer reason of opening Veer's case again in the court. Major part of the film is Veer's narration of his love story to Samiya. Scenes , dialogs and Artistic direction add up to the beauty of the film. Chopra redefines the true meaning of love through this brilliance Veer Zaara. The shots taken through Punjab and Lahore are so eye-catchy and refreshing. Yash Chopra takes u on a ride in fields of Punjab, the pinds of Lahore, the snow capped mountains that charms you in every way possible. Songs touch your heart deeply. Valuable contributions by singers Lata mangeshkar, Sonu Nigam, Udit Narayan, Roop Kumar rathod, Gurudas Mann have made songs so pure and full of good-will that u literally feel the emotion in your heart.

Until I saw Veer Zaara, I thought of Yashji as a very good movie maker. After Veer Zaara, I think he is not just a good movie maker but also a very good human being. Only a man with a heart of gold can make such a beautiful movie.Excellent direction, great acting, touching dialogues, melodious songs, brilliant cinematography, awesome locations what more I can say about the movie.

The scenery is beautiful and the actors all play their roles well. Veer's speech in court towards the end is something that will be remembered as it should be a basis of all humanity's dealings with differences. It is awesome in a world filled with hatred towards differences that a story like this can rise above and see the common thread in all humanity.

The cast consists of Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Amitabh Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Anupam and Kiron Kher just to mention a few, backed up by Yash Chopra's fine directing and his son Aditya's excellent screenplay and Dialogues! SRK plays a Muslim man from Pakistan who comes to India and falls in love with a beautiful but betrothed Hindustan played by Zinta. He is Veer and she is Zaara. She shows him India via a song number and when she visits Pakistan, he shows her his homeland via many song numbers + a trip to see his parents (played by Bachchan and K.Kher) in his village. Upon returning to India, she finds her fianc\u00e9 awaiting her at the train station and is forced to part with Veer on very stern terms. But she can't forget this Pakistani, so much so that her handmaid seeks Veer out and brings him to the palace where Zaara is about to wed to disrupt the marriage. This causes Zaara's father to have a fit and he conspires with his in-laws to be to set Veer up. They paint him as a spy for Pakistan and jail him under those terms. While in jail, he is visited by Zaara's fianc\u00e9 who tells him that if he should try and make a ruckus that Zaara would be shamed and suffer etc. etc. and so Veer takes a vow for silence that last 20 years, after which a plucky lawyer (played by Rani Mukherjee) reads about this Pakistani prisoner and comes to the jail to interview him. Through as sequence of visits, is whole the whole plot of the film is told. Veer is old and in jail telling the story, but he inspires this young lawyer to re-open and re-try the case which lets out a whole bunch of skeletons. Don't miss Anupam Kher in a fiery role as the celebrity lawyer Mukherjee's character takes on and triumphs over. This is is a rare gem and accomplishment for Bollywood. It deserves more than 10 stars!",

            "content": "I watched it twice before I was being able to make an opinion about it. Though I do have some negatives about the movie...over all it is a good value for money. First talking about the plus sides... 1. Amitabh Bachan was awesome...one of the best performances of his lifetime in a short role.... 2. Screenplay and script deserve high grade.. though the dialogues aren't as catchy as were of DDLJ, DTPH or Mohabbatein...the overall screen play and twists and turns made this movie a treat to watch...specially Samia finding Zara in India catches everyone by surprise... 3. Rani's performance is A class and will surely win her some awards this year.... 4. Hima Malini looked cool as well as did her part with perfection. 5. Choice of locations for Indian village life is remarkable. 6. Though music on the whole is just about above average, a couple of scores in Bhangra beat are catchy. 7. And last but certainly not the least... Shahrukh Khan once again walks through a role with utmost perfection. I don't know whether it was deliberate or incidental, but his casualness and under toned acting as a youth made his performance as a gray-haired guy more prominent. Needless to see he was really skillful portraying a middle age prisoner.And now the minus side.. Well the only minus that I have with this movie is the projection of Pakistani society. Every time Pakistan was shown in the film it never looked like Pakistan. The director seems quite unfamiliar with Pakistan, her society, her customs, her wedding rituals, her surroundings..just about everything. And this to me was a real big minus...that bigger a minus that it overshadowed the pluses of the movie in first viewing. No politician in Pakistan contesting from Lahore wears shirwani in his house for sure..in fact in the entire national assemblies of last 3-4 decades, you will hardly find any sherwani except the nawab's of bahawalpur and late Nasarullah Khan. No one in Lahore uses the Lakhnao Delhi style of adab for greetings. Nor does the ladies of the class shown wear jewels like Kiron Kher. It looked more like Muslim Lucknow rather than Pakistan. And this highlights one more thing - \"India and Pakistan are two different and distant societies who know very little about each other. by the virtue of history, they do have things in common, but on the whole they have turned into two different societies. Pakistani society is different than the society of Indian muslims, it's more modern and has her own set of customs. It has moved quite a lot from the pre partition commonalities between the two cultures. And this is where Yash jee got it all wrong.\"But all in all, a real good movie, with a daring plot and good screenplay full of surprises.",

But I did not rate it 10/10 because I am just another Indian who has no sense of rating movies. To me, this epic is perfect in every single sense. Casting, production, music, background score, editing, story, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics. Every single element has never failed to tug at my heart strings every single time I have watched this. And I stopped counting after 68 times.The 3 hour runtime, never feels sluggish. You are already immersed int the characters as soon as they're introduced. The highlight for most is of course, SRK and his portrayal of Veer Pratap Singh who loves without boundaries (literally) and Priety Zinta as Zaara Hayaat Khan, who is very likeable progressive woman. But for me the limited screen time of Amitabh and Hema Malini who play surrogate parents of Veer. Every single scene, be it cultural, romantic or emotional ... it just hits man. Boman Irani and Manoj Vajpayee have very little to do and yet play important part in the story and they do it very well. Divya Dutta is a comedic relief for the most part but her character too has an arc and plays an important part in the story due to which she doesn't feel like just a comedic relief. Kirron Kher and Anupam Kher both are another standout in their respective roles.The twists in the movie might not be digestible for those unfamiliar with the culture and nuances of this region but they are very well done and boy do they pull your soul out of the body.A lot is said about this movie without ever mentioning the background score which is phenomenal. Every character has their own theme which is beautifully woven into the story telling. Music by the Late Madan Mohan is one of the evergreen albums in my list. After all these years I haven't gotten tired of any song. Not only it stays in my playlist always, but I also never skip any songs while rewatching this movie.VFX in couple of scenes is little questionable but forgivable. Editing has one or two goof ups but over all very solid. Dialogues are poetic in every sense. In fact, this whole movie feels like a visual poetry.Last but not the least, I strongly believe no other director could've made this film like Yash Chopra did. This could've easily been a throwaway romantic tale like many others. Or it could have been a hit but later revisited as a cringe fest like many films we grew up with. This however, shall go down in history as one of the best romance tragedy in Bollywood cinema and will always remain my most favorite bollywood romance of all time.",

            "content": "I saw this movie last night. Personally I loved the film for many reasons. The only thing that I have to say against it is that it could have been slightly shorter. But this movie had an \"egde of the seat\" quality that I have not seen in a Bollywood film in a long time. The twists in the film are very good, and highly unexpected! The music was excellent. I have to dis-agree with some comments on this page that criticize the music, and claim it's not a \"catchy\" soundtrack! I think this music is right for the theme, and the character of this film! This movie has an epic quality to it that requires it to have a soundtrack that reflects this. I think the music is memorable.This movies has a story which attempts to explore human nature, and what makes it great. The characters develop in the story to exceed their own expectations of themselves. Especially Zaara's character as we first see it, and who she turns out to be in the end. We know right from the start that Zaara is a stubborn person. But we also see her capacity for love when she goes to India to perform the last rights for her nanny despite the opposition from her family. But we see that the strength of her feelings for Veer take even her by surprise. Veer is a carefree and daring character who takes his job very seriously, and is basically a sensible guy. He's not at all \"over dramatic\" when we first meet him. Yet he falls in love and lets go of everything he holds dear. But this is consistent with his character as we see right from the start that he dosen't do things by half. There where a few scenes in this film where the humanity of the characters are shown in great depth. One of the best scenes is the one between Zaara and her father, when he apologizes to his daughter for compelling her into marriage with Raza Shirazi.But at this point we know what the motivation of both father and daughter is. One other memorable and exciting scene is, Veer and Zaara's meeting in the Mosque when Veer comes to Lahore.The movie was well cast. Rani Mukherjee as Sammiya Siddiqui was an excellent addition to the story, and she is in more ways than one the \"Hero\" of this story. The outcome of this story is just as important to Sammiya Siddiqui as it is for Veer and Zaara. In fact they are each other's salvation.Sammiya is also a women who is trying to make it in a man's world,despite being thwarted from the likes of her opposing council.The acting was excellent. The best I have seen Shah Ruhk do in the last 5 years! I loved his acting. He depicted great depth, and also there was good control in his acting. Very well done. Priety did justice to the role of Zaara Hayatt Kahn.Very convincing. The cameo's where excellent. Amitab Bachchan, Hema Malini, Manoj Bajpai, and Anupam Kher. Kiron Kher as always was excellent in her role. The cinematography was excellent too.All in all, this movie is worth a watch, and if you have the chance see it on the big screen, because it does justice to the visually spectacular aspect of this movie. Veer Zaara was Operatic in it's presentation and style. It was larger than life!",

He doesn't say anything, do anything, but just sits there, decaying away. A local lawyer named Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji) arrives at the scene to fight his case and return him to India. As Saamiya tries in vain to bring memories back, another problem arrives. The best Pakistani lawyer Zakir Ahmed (Anupam Kher) finds it disgusting that a woman has become a lawyer, and is fighting the case. He becomes the prosecution and Saamiya knows he will leave no stone unturned to win this case and prove her incapable of being a lawyer. As Saamiya digs deep into Veer's past to uncover the truth, she finds the love of Veer's life, Zaara Hayaaat Khan (Preity Zinta) muddled into all of this. But why is Veer in jail? Why didn't Zaara save him? Shah Rukh was excellent. His performance was amazing. The conviction in his body language, and in his voice, and the way he portrayed the character, it's brilliant.I love Preity's performance in this film. I am a major fan of her work, and this one is one of my faves. She stepped into Zaara's shoes, so well, that it is almost real. Her part isn't the biggest, but she does it with dignity. She really did bring a fresh vibe to Veer-Zaara. Rani, obviously, gets the most applause. I, am not a Rani fan, never have been, but this performance of hers is one of her better ones. The role of the determined, young, strong woman lawyer is portrayed really well. There are times, however, when I thought she was dramatic, and a bit too sentimental.Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini make a small, but very important piece in the movie. Anupam Kher pulls off his role amazingly. I like seeing Mr Kher as a lawyer, he is brilliant. Boman Irani, Kirron Kher, and Divya Dutta make short, but strong performances. One performance I loved was Manoj Bajpai. He is so underrated, I reckon he is fantastic...The music is fabulous. The songs are very yesteryear in a way, and bring back some old memories. But, they are all unique and modern in their own way, which is fantastic. Lata Mangeshkar has again, proved her versatility and angelic voice. Udit Narayan also.Yash Raj, this one is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Except for a Satyajit Ray film, I do not watch Indian films for serious social commentary. I watch Bollywood knowing exactly what I will be getting (sing/dancing, romance, melodrama). I am not of Indian descent so I can't follow the songs or know any of the cultural nuances in the films, but I still enjoy them. Perhaps it is the very 'foreign-ness' that allows me to suspend disbelief and enjoy those aspects which I usually dread in American films. So I came into this prepared to watch a sappy melodrama with no weight to it. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised by the feminist tones in the film. With the exception of the 1963 film Mahanagar, I don't remember another Indian film discussing women's rights so much. So major points for that.I can not comment on the portrayals of India/Pakistan. I have been to neither country, nor do I have more than a passing knowledge of Indian history and the current conflict with Pakistan. However, I still appreciated the attempt to reach out and make an appeal to common humanity. I could definitely see some hard-core Pakistani upset that only that country is shown inhumanely detaining and setting up someone. All the Indians in the film are shown as wonderful people, all of the bad 'guys' from the truly evil fianc\u00e9 to the just plain selfish father are Pakistani. And for true happiness at the end they have to leave for India. Nonetheless, I think the overall message was fairly sensitive and well-meaning.Everything about the film is meant to pull on your heart-strings and attempts to be of epic proportions. Love, life, death, duty, heroes, tragedy, etc. it's all there. Gorgeous people fall in love, play tragic martyrs and confront injustices. Normally I would laugh and roll my eyes, but somehow I got sucked in and really enjoyed it.If you're willing to come in with an open mind - it's worth seeing.

Nothing in this movie is worth watching, the plot is totally predictable, the acting is worthless with too many clich\u00e9s, the music was maybe the best thing about the movie although it wasn't superb.In summary, the story line is a combination of Dilwale dulhanya le jayenge, chalte chalte and swades, Ya3ni nothing new at all. The movie is full of clich\u00e9s that we saw over and over again in thousands of Indian movies. The first part of the movie is similar to Dilwale dluhania and chalte chalte, where sharukh starts falling in love with the girl during their traveling and is surprised that she is engaged..*sigh*..hence we have the common problem that we have seen thousands of times before.And the part where sharukh takes pretty to his village and all the villagers including shaurkh's mom and dad fall in love with pretty..sounds a lot like SWADES doesn't it ?? and again so predictable.The dialog and conversations were so cheezy, the part where Rani starts babbling to sharukh about the rights of women in Pakistan was so boring and lame that i wanted to go to sleep. And when sharukh starts talking he always starts with poetry like talk and excessive details that was suppose to add some romantic story telling feel into it, was so silly.Oh, and the acting was terrible, except for pretty whom i think was better than the rest, sharukh was so funny playing his older character, moving so slow like a robot, made me laugh.So in conclusion this was a total waste of time out of my precious life, sooo predictable from beginning to end,boring and a total piece of crap, my advice to you is to keep away from this movie.",

I have seen Veer Zaara three times in the theatre and must say that it is without a doubt the BEST BOLLYWOOD FILM I have ever seen. The score, direction, story and acting are superb. For a movie that lasts almost 3 1/2 hours, the story is so involving that the time just wizzes by. I have taken friends, not attuned to Bollywood style films and they were as thrilled as I was. This is in my opinion the BEST FILM of 2004 period. The speech Shah Rukh Kahn gives in the courtroom at the end of the film which pleas for tolerance and understanding raises the entire movie to a rarified plane. It would have been easy to end the story at the end of the trial but Yash Chopra and his writers enter an exalted level with this scene. Please be warned that this moving film is a real tear-jerker! It is a shame that main stream American movie reviewers are ignoring the film which is apparently doing very well in England and Australia. I could not find a review of this movie in any newspaper in Chicago on a recent trip. Even though I personally left a message for the reviewer of the Detroit Free Press, he chose to ignore the film entirely. Perhaps the people promoting the movie and Indian films in general need to do some homework and try to get their movies reviewed. It is a shame that many people who rely on critics reviews before seeing a film will not even know about this fabulous movie. It should at least be nominated for Oscar BEST FOREIGN FILM of 2004.",

            "content": "I had no memory of any details of this film from watching it back then in my childhood. The only thing that I could remember was that this film got grilling reviews at home and I just went with the tide and held a negative view of this film. Song \"Tere liye\" though immediately became one of my all-time favourites and one that I have always managed to listen by applying the deep meaning of the lyrics to this or that situation of my own life.However, something out of nowhere, possibly the love for the aforementioned song itself, convinced me to give it another go. I must say I am highly impressed with the story - the turns that it took from the beginning till the end, such as Veer spending so many years in a jail in Pakistan as Zaara spends the same time in his village in India - and deeply touched by the film and the emotions that it so successfully evoked. The poem at the end there by Veer,... fabulously recited with heart-piercing emotions. A brilliant performance by Shah Rukh Khan, one of his very best.Two objections that I remember that were raised by someone at home were the futility of the roles of Veer's parents, and showing Veer as a soldier. To the first, I would say that their role was a masterpiece, given that it ultimately led to Veer and Zaara themselves leading a similar life in their old age in the same village, and like them, without offspring of their own.The other objection is a valid one. I am not saying that soldiers aren't humans or are without hearts, but it is a fact that the upbringing of a soldier is such, especially in our two countries where they are brought up with immense hatred for the other country, that it is near impossible for him to fall in love with a girl from the \"enemy\" country, let alone then taking the outrageous step of resigning from the army altogether in order to get her. So I would have shown Veer being into another profession. Only Yash Chopra knows why he showed it that way, maybe he wanted to show how for impossible things love can make happen? Either way, I am overall so touched by the film that, despite those that and a few other flaws (such as the Razaa putting the onus of his own wife's respect and honour in someone else's hand, someone who is her lover *refers to the scene where Razaa shows up to see Veer after the police catches him*), I can't resist giving it 10 out of 10.I had thought that length would be an issue for me, but I was engaged into it that I hardly felt that I in fact sat through three hours. Still, I thought this could have been avoided had they not chosen to go with so many songs in the film. This of course by no means applies to \"Tere liye...... \" What a brilliant song played at a situation most suitable!'Veer-Zaara' celebrates love in its truest, purest and most unconditional form. A pity that Bollywood has ceased making films that depicts love in such a way. Nowadays it is too much about lust and physical pleasures received from having a partner. A salute for coming up with such a touching story!",

Shah Rukh continues to be unrelentingly embarrassing-hamming for all he is worth, and Preity Zinta looks old and haggard. *SPOILERS* The story is a mishmash of all the \"hit\" trademarks of a Yash Chopra film - the intro of the leading lady in white chiffon, her rain dance about her dreams, Shah Rukh winning the mom over; with all the stock characters: ancient grandma, strong mum n dad et al thrown in. The screenplay is implausible, hasty and the love story just doesn't build up to the grand saga it is supposed to be. The movie insults intelligence of the viewer, so cheesy in places - the court scene where everyone claps when shah rukh finished talking! Groan!On a positive note, the soundtrack is nice and Rani Mukherjee is good.",

Featuring Shahrukh Khan in a Romantic role, Priety Zinta as a bubbly wench and Rani Mukherji as the conscientious damsel.A weak plot. A screenplay steeped in uncommon drudgery and marked by mundane catch lines.Performances below par. Shahrukh is not at all impressive in what he does. This I say, because Shahrukh 's entire career is pivoted on similar roles , where he has done better.Preity Zinta looks pale and flabby. No charisma on her face. Her acting is BAD.Rani Mukherji,she has done justice to her role. She's not great but not all that Bad.The supporting cast is impressive on paper. Amitabh Bachchan, Anupam Kher,Divya Dutta, Hema Malini,Manoj Bajpai, Boman Irani, Kiron Kher....oh my God! It reminds me of \"The Longest Day\".In the movie however only a few of them perform. Hema Malini, to begin with is perhaps the widest chink in the entire cast. The director was wise enough to have made her character a South Indian woman married to a Punjabi, otherwise she would have found herself in the shoes of Katrina Kaif in an undubbed performance.Manoj Bajpai 's character is a character devoid of reasonableness and logic. Vindictive without reason and malignant without cause. He couldn't have done any better than he did in the movie to play this role.Kiron Kher redoes her type cast role of a concerned mother sans the usual jocular vibes.Amitabh Bachchan does a great job of playing a true Rural Punjabi Patriarch showcasing brilliant linguistic skills and body language. For me the best actor in the movie.Anupam Kher was also good as the cold and conniving lawyer who is also arrogant .Boman Sahab. He is a fine actor. I like him. The show stealer however was Aditya Chopra for giving us an extremely ordinary story, poor screenplay and top it all the shallow, amateurish poem (devoid of rhyme and meter) recited by Shahrukh in a most unconvincing manner at the end of the movie.All in all a movie which was made to celebrate the director's historic career , but which hardly leaves a good impression. P.S. a guy sitting in the front row wouldn't wake up when the show ended . I was afraid he had collapsed due to the incoherent motion picture he just saw , thankfully it was just a case of movie hall slumber.",

But believe it or not, this is such a heavenly experience to watch Veer-Zaara and I can bet you want to experience this love journey again and again and again and again.\nYash Chopra, all his work had been in the best categories but, Veer-Zaara is just another level. From the very start till the end, you don't wanna blink and miss any moment of this masterpiece. Veer-Zaara will own the heart of any individual who is or ever been in love, i.e. everyone, and that's the beauty of Yash Chopra's filmmaking, he knows how to connect with the audience make them love, laugh and cry. There is not a single thing in the movie which is not beautiful, story, screenplay, dialogues, music, performances, locations, whatever you see on screen is beautiful and at its best. Not many spoilers but yes it is a beautiful love story where they meet, get separated, meet again, get separated again, and then finally meets after 22 years out of unknown past situations of each other. There are special performances by Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini as well for, not for much of screen time, but yes, it had a great impact on the whole story, and the same goes for Anupam Kher as well. Pretty Zinta is as beautiful as the story is and did a perfect job in her character but Shah Rukh Khan, oh my god, this is some out of the world level of performance and the way he delivers the dialogues with is facial expressions and body language, that's not less than a godly thing. Yash Chopra and SRK are such a blessing to the Hindi Film Industry, and together they make perfect pair and let's not forget Rani Mukherjee doing a connecting role which is very important. And one more special thing that made it perfect is a never seen before collaborations in the music of the film, the music, and the songs are the soul of the movie that's gonna make you cry, cry, cry and happy smile in Love.The visual poem of love and believe, This is an anytime-anywhere watch for the Love story musical drama lovers and obviously a perfect gift for SRK and Yash Chopra fans.",

She certainly looks luminous and can proudly add 'Veer Zaara' to her resume. Divya Dutta is charming and leaves a mark in a smaller part. 4. Direction is alright.Cons: 1. Poor screenplay. Several plot holes. The plot is a fairy tale (witnessed numerous times in Bollywood) and is predictable (except for Zaara's whereabouts in the latter half) 2. The two title characters are one-dimensional people from fairy tales. In fact this is the case with most of the characters are one-dimensional. 3. Shahrukh's performance is nothing outstanding though he does reasonably okay. Amitabh Bachchan is annoying as he is in all his recent stuff. 4. Waste of talented actors like Manoj Bajpai, Hema Malini and Anupam Kher. Though Bajpai is excellent in his brief role, the rest fail to make an impression. 5. Terrible dialogues (especially those delivered by Kirron Kher and does Yash Chopra know anything about the Muslim religion?) 6. Chopra seems to take a lot from his earlier works (e.g. Dilwale Dulhania Lejayenge)To sum it up, it I initially watched it with very little expectation and it is somewhat enjoyable (in spite of its flaws) and a movie that I can watch with my family.",

            "content": "I do not had any high expectations from Veer Zaara. I know how Yash CHopra's movies are meant to be, larger than life, glossy, but devoid of soul (perhaps Silsila was exception). I wanted to watch Veer Zaara for two reasons. It had been a long time since I had seen a Hindi movie. Second, music was by Madan Mohan, and although it was not great music, just wanted to pay homage to one of my favourite MDs.SO here I go, driving 30 kms to Mississsauga/Oakville border, on a rainy-snowy late evening. The route was unknown to me, and all the road signs had been covered by snow. But still I took right turn at the right road, and landed in AMC theatres. I was bit late, but the movie started as soon as I took my seat, so did not miss anything.The movie is shot in Gulzar \"ishtyle\". Starting with the present, and than periods of flashback and return to present, and ultimately, the grand finale.The story is nothing new to talk about. It is an age old story of boy-meets-girls, falls in love, then the usual stuff \"Yeh Shaadi Nahin Ho Sakti\", then the chewed-to-death theme of \"ghar and khandaan ki izzat\", then the usual sacrifice and how high it is valued in Indian culture, then the usual gloom, then the \"O-Henry twist\" and then as it says in Gujarati, \"Khaadun, Pidhun Ne Raaj Karyun (And the prince and princess lived happily ever after).I am not very clear about Yash Chopra's obsession with sacrificing lovers, or Aditya Chopra's fixation with \"maa baap ki agyaa\" in marriage.Poor Amitabh had to give up Raakhi in \"Kabhi Kabhi\" as he could not think of going against \"maa baap ki asha and umeed\". Poor guy again had to get married to Jaya in Silsila just out of moral duty, and forget about Rekha. Even after brief extra-marital affair with Rekha, he had to give \"balidaan\" of his feelings, and has to get tied down with Jaya.So \"Veer Zaara\" is no different than \"Kabhi Kabhi\". It just takes a single heart attack to Boman Irani and few tears from Kiron Kher, to make Shahrukh change his mind and give up on his love and his feelings, and accept 22 years of imprisonment.Damn it!!!!!!!!!All directors of Bollywood should be given a lesson in respecting a young person feelings. All Bollywood characters (actually Story - Screenplay writers) should be made to repeat the sentence \"I will not kill my feelings\" million times, till they give up the whole \"drame-baazi\" of \"icchaaon ki qurbani\", and have the guts to run away from home and revolt against parents, just for the sake of their own feelings. It is 21st century, and it is so archaic to think about sacrifice. (Hey, isn't that what Raj Kapoor endorse in 1971 in Bobby?? Yeah, but seems Raj Kapoor does not know much about Indian \"values and culture\")Surprise, Surprise - Yash Chopra has only recently found out about women's lib and woman's empowerment. So no wonder, that it takes just a few words of wisdom from Preity Zinta to make Amitabh change his mind to build a girls school in some remote village of Punjaab. Cut and paste those dialogues on Rani Mukherjee, and now you have some jailer and Anupam Kher dropping down their weapons. Well well, so Mr. Yash Chopra, what are those woman's rights doing, when Preity Zinta is forced to marry against her will. Isn't the same thing a human rights violation? But if Preity Zinta starts talking about women's rights just before interval, how are we going to drag the movie for 3 hours?So again, we have Shahrukh doing the reenactment of his DDLJ role, traveling to Pakistan to get his love, only to return empty-handed. What else he can do? He is just a puppet in hands of Aditya Chopra (Story-Screenplay-Dialogues) who won't let him develop the guts of fighting against the society just for the protecting his feelings (One thing is for sure - Aditya is kind enough on us - poor audiences - as to not make Shahrukh a-la Sunny Deol in \"Gadar\" - fighting single handedly against Pakistan army - thanks a zillion for that). But yeah, but now Indo-Pak relations have improved, and hence we cannot depict Pakistanis as villains.And what is this directors fixation with rain? Shahrukh-Preity meet - it is raining, they depart - it is raining, they meet again - it is raining. So what is rain supposed to symbolize. That too, when you can clearly see the sunlight in background. Thank God, the camera man is not stupid enough to show us the sprinklers. Seems as if the characters are based in Cherrapunji rather than an arid Lahore.Technical snags - lots of - starting with the starting scene out of Shahrukh's cell, which is clearly an artist's impression of Lahore instead of real Lahore, \"Natraj\" pencils on Judge's dais, big downpours while sun is still shining, characters uttering the word \"cool\" in early 80s (presuming that present is 2004), the accused seating on bench and having the liberty of going to the exit of court, lawyer having the ability to meet the convict right in his cell and bringing food for the culprit. Never in the movie can you realize of figure out that 22 years have passed by. Everything still feels the same, the hairstyle, the clothes.But there is one thing for which Yash Chopra needs to be sincerely applauded. He does not fall into the trap of giving a contemporary feeling, with characters speaking \"cool\" and \"s***\" at end of every dialogues and eating McBurgers and drinking Coke. There are no Mercs-BMWs-foreign locales, no tulips (mustard or \"sarson\" has taken the place of tulips). No internet-e-mails.Performance wise - none of the roles require special acting abilities. Shahrukh Khan plays Shahrukh Khan, the egocentric self. He told in an interview in rediff \"I sleep walk through romantic roles\". One should praise his candour. Preity Zeinta has a bit of \"ameer baap ki eklauti bigdi beti\" role, which she plays without any glitch. Rani Mukherjee is wasted in an inconsequential role. The biggest and pleasant surprise is the special appearance of Bacchan and Hema Malini.So critics like me will continue to find faults with each and every movie produced by Chopras, public will praise and love them. Awards will be showered for best performance as side kick, or best performance as heroine's \"saheli\". Producers-distributors-theatre owners will make addition to their bank balance. And Yash Chopra will announce one more movie starring Shahrukh.........",

How come the servant lady has a thick punjabi accent and no one else does. -No way Manoj Vajpai character never touched preety zinta character after they got married. Because she was looking good in this movie. -How come Preety Zinta's family is so strict and conservative and SRK's family is not. Even though SRK's family is from a Village and those people are more conservative. (I'm sorry, I'm just sick of sooooo many unreal things even though I know its a movie.) -Its the mid 70s or something right? A little after the 71 war, we Pakistani and Indians both hated each other at that time. Yet the SRK's family is oh so nice to Preety Zinta. -----CONCLUSION: I'm not taking anyones side, but being a Pakistani, I know that this movie showed more negative side of Pakistan than of India. I agree that what they showed about Pakistan was pretty much all true. In fact, the reality would've been that SRK came to get Preety from India, and got killed by those emotional Lahoris in a few hours. But that would've ended the movie. All in all, it was a very bad movie. Again, I don't blame SRK for working in this movie. He is a very smart dude. He knows that he must make money doing the same sissy roles over and over again as long as he can. If he changes his role to anything else, there is a chance that our emotionally deviated viewers may reject him.

His acting prowess or lack of it is obvious as an older \"Veer\". The pairing of SRK and Preity Zinta is getting to be boring and mundane to say the least. The old timers like Yash Chopra must know better about acting and Casting but looks like he is prey to the SRK dragnet, like the rest of the Producers who cannot seem to conceive a movie without SRK and this Zinta girl in them. Few things that are poignant are the rustic Rural scenes with Amitab Bachchan and Hema Malini, the music reminiscent of the olden days and golden days (late Madan Mohan) and worthy performance by Rani Mukherjee. The Rural scenes is like a movie inside a movie and you hope that it was the other way around. Divya Dutta is good and Zinta has given her \"Generic\" performance. Suffice to say the movie is long, the Court proceedings are ridiculous and the story is contrived. This is probably the worst movie from a Banner like Chopra.

Now that I've finally taken that step, I have to say that my fear comes true: a visually beautiful movie (especially the scenes in Punjab), with music that is absolutely wonderful, but the final result is too much of a tearjerker anyway, and a way too long one to that. The love story is nice, sometimes even touchy, but nothing special when you think of it. The scenario... well, I've seen worse, much worse, but if a movie is supposed to absorb you entirely, then the illogical behavior of the protagonists, clearly with no other purpose but securing later events, doesn't benefit credibility at all. What I like, however, is the positive way Pakistan is portrayed, and that is undoubtedly the strongest point of the film. Another morale, related to emancipation of women, is sympathetic as well, although I have the impression that all these morales are a tad too much for one movie that is essentially about something completely different.The trouble with sentimental films like this one is that they often operate on the verge of bad taste. Sometimes that works excellently, and I have to admit that some of them have managed to evoke a tear or two with me as well. However, for sentimentality to work, it needs to be dosed carefully, because an overdose may cause it to stop working completely, and then the whole thing suddenly becomes ridiculous or even disgusting. And from that point of view, Veera-Zaara is really pushing it, sometimes even pushing it too far. There's nothing wrong with a tear here and there, but too many of them makes the whole thing irritating. Apart from the fact that this movie is obviously too long, this is the biggest minus.Rani Mukherjee is the saving grace of this movie. Although none of the characters is particularly credible, she manages best in portraying hers. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini bring in something great as well, but then, they always seem to be a nice pair. I have a problem with Preity: although she is obviously not bad, her character appears to be pale and colorless anyway. Frankly, I don't really understand what Shahrukh likes so much in her at all, especially, what makes her worth the effort of spending 22 years in prison, only to save her from the disgrace of having to admit that she had been in love with a fellow before she got married to another one. But okay, that's the script and nobody can blame Preity for performing it that way. Most issues I have with Shahrukh himself, who is overacting so mercilessly that sometimes I got the feeling of watching Salman Khan instead of Shahrukh. He turns his character into a complete Devdas, the difference only being that Devdas is basically a jerk who is completely in love with his own pain, and while this kind of acting may work very well for Devdas, it obviously doesn't for the much more positive character of Veer Pratap Singh.",

He can pull of easy more comfortable roles as they are not demanding by the film. But this film demanded an actor who can act beyond himself. Shah rukh failed to do that and failed this movie. He must attempt to better himself by playing less of the standard roles, I acknowledge they are giving him hits but thats a tribute to the style of film. Romance and Family films with a few stars are major hits no matter of the performance.

This movie is a saturation point of Yash Chopra's clich\u00e9s and Shah Rukh Khan's emotional lover role.The negatives: Movie seems to be made from bits and pieces of other Yash Chopra movies, esp. DDLJ (note falling in love while traveling, girl hallucinating about the boy after reaching home, boy showing up in her town, winning over mother, strict father who is soft at heart). Shah Rukh probably goes through these roles like a zombie now- he's done so many! If you want to even more of what you've seen him do over and over and over and over, this is the movie for you. Rani Mukherjee is neither powerful nor convincing in her role of a lawyer and has trouble voicing chaste Urdu. Preity Zinta looks lovely, and acts fairly well but nothing special. Lata Mangeshkar is ruining a legacy by continuing to sing in a tired and at times, off-chord and off-tune voice.Kiron Kher is getting typecast. Shah Rukh was typecast years back and seems to be doing just fine in terms of success. The Punjabi flavor, songs, clothing, dialogues are like every other movie from this production house.SRK and Preity's make up as older people is pathetic. The maker seems to think the world of it, though. He shows it off with special effects again and again. Shah Rukh seems to equate old with paralytic and insane and performs as such. One wonders if there were ever any problems between the two countries, esp. the way all the characters seem to weave in and out of India and Pakistan with no apparent restrictions. Visas, permissions and the like are not issues to be bothered with when making an oozing-with-emotion movie.The positives: **spoiler** Amitabh Bachchan's cameo is like a whiff of fresh air. The movie starts to bore you until he really gives it a boost of energy. He gives a much needed boost to an otherwise slow first half. Divya Dutta's performance as the Khan household's maid is commendable and lovable. The soundtrack by the late Madan Mohan, composed many years ago, is fantastic, even though the songs come too often and Lata's voice puts a spanner in the works.If you've watched other Yash Chopra or Karan Johar (or anyone of that breed) movies and haven't been satisfied with the melodrama and want more of it, watch Veer Zaara.

            "review_title": "Another Sweeping Tale of Romance From India",
            "content": "Veer-Zaara is a sweeping Bollywood epic, which is to say it is long, colorful and there are musical numbers in it. Those who watch Bollywood just for the pretty girls and the songs might be a bit disappointed by it - Preity Zinta is cute but there isn't enough of her, and the musical element also is sadly neglected, especially in the second half which is dominated by weakly-staged courtroom melodrama and overwrought lovers-reunited bilge. Yash Chopra has attempted something we've seen before in movies like Bombay: he's begun with what looks like the standard Bollywood boy-meets-girl form only to swerve into touchy socio-political territory, in this case the on-going unpleasantness between India and Pakistan (Veer is from India and Zaara from Pakistan, but their love transcends all borders, etc.,). Whereas Bombay was suffused with genuine anger, Veer-Zaara seems merely wistful. The story of the two lovers' sacrifices might be sufficient for a typical romance, but it proves a rather flimsy vessel for conveying a plea on behalf of Indian-Pakistani friendship.Shahrukh Kahn stars as Veer, a rescue pilot for the Indian Air Force and all-around cool guy. Veer's otherwise fulfilling life takes one of those cosmic Bollywood turns when, dangling from the bottom of a rescue chopper, he saves the life of Pakistani damsel Zaara (Preity Zinta), who has journeyed to India in hopes of depositing her beloved surrogate granny's ashes in a sacred river. Veer, like any good Indian cinema hero, is first put off by the heroine's willfulness, but he eventually takes a shine to her, and invites her to his native village where his adoptive parents (Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini) lavish attention on her. The usual tingly feelings begin passing through Veer and Zaara (not that you would know by the requisitely restrained performances) but alas the lovers are doomed to heartbreak. Zaara is betrothed to a greasy politician named Razaa (Manoj Bajpai); when Veer sweeps into Pakistan to steal Zaara away, Razaa brings his police influence to bear on Veer who is chucked into the slammer to molder for the next two decades or so. Salvation is offered only after much suffering by a young, plucky female lawyer named Saamiya (Rani Mukerji), who takes it upon herself to argue for Veer's release.One's ability to enjoy the film rests largely upon how much stomach one has for Shahrukh Khan, an actor whose capacity for smug self-admiration appears boundless. The best that can be said for Khan's work in Veer-Zaara is that he doesn't leave too much of a negative impression. He's more-than-adequate in the breezier first-half of the film, his portrayal of the heroic pilot never lapsing into swagger, but when the story moves into the prison passages, the youthful Veer having become a tottering, broken old man, Khan's frail mannerisms reek of shallow play-acting, the inadequacy of Steve McQueen as the same kind of humbled old coot in Papillon. Preity Zinta, as Zaara, lends the film exactly what is expected of her, a baby-faced radiance, but as with Khan, the more she has to act the more her limitations are revealed. Both actors seem most assured in the musical numbers: this is where Khan really comes to life as a performer, his exuberance becoming infectious, and Zinta too has the kind of physical charm, if not the great dancing talent, that makes for entertaining viewing. Most of the movie's high-points take place in the first half, and almost all involve Amitabh Bachchan, the venerable old-lion of Indian cinema. Bachchan plays Veer's surrogate father Chaudhary with a playfulness and grace that easily out-pace the work of the younger stars. This is one of those classic supporting turns that aging legends sometimes pull off, when they demonstrate how complete their command of technique has become. The movie's highlight, in historic terms at least, comes when Bachchan and Khan dance together, the past and present of Bollywood becoming intertwined for one giddy moment.The film's serious ambitions are never realized as thoroughly as its audience-pleasing ones. From the very start there's a nagging half-heartedness, a lack of the kind of frenzied passion that made Bombay such a memorable fusion of entertainment and social outrage. Too often there is a feeling that Yash Chopra is merely putting the cast through its paces; the sense of higher purpose Chopra seeks to engender never materializes. One grows impatient with the unfolding of the love-story, the rote passages of Veer and Zaara coming to recognize the hurt they've caused their families by their selfish succumbing to romantic urge (couldn't the lovers in a Bollywood movie just once say the hell with propriety?). A story as fundamentally bound up in convention as this one needs some unique spirit to lift it up, but outside of a rather superficial nobility, there's nothing about the film that really distinguishes it. It feels like a standard melodrama, a film of pre-determined movements. The themes are all rattled off like clockwork: loyalty to family; the sadness of socio-political conflict; the suffering wrought by romantic recklessness. Yes there are glints along the way, little crescendos of energy like we look for from Bollywood, but the overall impression left by Veer-Zaara is one of noble intentions unfulfilled.",

            "review_title": "When is Indian cinema going to mature?",
            "content": "Veer Zaara- the most awaited movie of the year- finally released to a packed theater here in NJ. The verdict- not even nearly as good as the collections it would have made in just one day.With the reins of direction in the veteran Yash Chopra's hands, one expects the cast to look their best, act their best and most of all the movie to be a wholesome entertainer. None of those qualities can be associated with the self proclaimed \"LOVE LEGEND\". Not to say that the movie did not have any positives, but they were far less than the negatives.Starting with the flaws, the script was extremely incoherent and un realistic, not to mention some apparent inconsistencies in the direction.To start with,a major question that is left for the viewer to answerer himself is how did Rani know about SRKs real name i.e. Veer? It had been a good 20 years and everyone knew him by his other name. So was Rani Psychic or did Bhagwan or Allah sent a commandment on her. If this question cant be answered, the logic given behind SRK's opening his stuttering mouth to reveal the most boring love story becomes meaningless( as if it was meaningful otherwise) and the story ends right in the beginning. There was no explanation given whatsoever and the viewer is left in a labyrinth to find his way back home.Next comes the unrealistic portrayal of the Lahori culture and the Muslim community. I being from Lahore and from a Muslim country have never seen people wearing the Iqbal cap and talking in the way shown. Neither have I seen them go to the darbars so often. Also I can never imagine a Muslim girl allowing any guy to lift her up and cross a bridge(specially a girl who has been brought up under so many restrictions, as shown in the movie), let alone run to India for whatever reason.The dialogs that should make you cry, either felt too clich\u00e9'd or extremely funny. Rani telling SRK that she knows how much he loves Zaara made me laugh out loud. When is Indian cinema going to mature? She knows him for 1 day and she knows how much he loves Zaara? Please stop the cheesiness. Again Rani giving a lecture on the 786 number, assigned to SRK, to the hawaldaar provided another amusement park ride. The reason given by SRK for telling Rani the story was another funny point. There are so many more but the limit on words restricts me.Coming to the looks and acting,SRK looked and acted his career worst. Priety looked very ordinary and her acting was just ordinary. Rani looked not only bad but also had the worst dialogs to deliver. I have never seen a 50 year old guy (which I am assuming SRK is shown to be ) shivering or behaving in the fashion he was in the movie. Another of his overacting proofs. This overrated actor cannot act for nuts.Last but not the least the positives: Finally we come across a message of peace and love for both the countries.Some scenes where the message was being delivered were quite effective. The song \"Aisa des hai mera\" was well executed.Divya Dutta's acting was undoubtedly the best of the cast. Amitabh and Hema provided the truly entertaining part of the movie.As for Yash Chopra, it is advised not to be impressed with his son, Aditya Chopra or his son's best friend Karan Johar's style of movie making. He should be the one driving them, not being driven by them because all they can offer is cheesiness and over-dramatic situations. Also stop making movies for SRK. Cast some actor who can make the movie stand on his shoulders, without relying on the other cast( as is always the case with SRK).",

Amitabh Bhachan and Hema Malini were great and were well suited for the role. The film shows a good mixture of both cultures of Pakistan and India. The songs are nice and catchy and fitted in well considering when they were produced. The storyline was different to the normal stories. Not a typical Indian movie about 2 lovers or a love triangle.

            "content": "Veer Zaara is a love story set in the context of the continuing enmity between India and Pakistan. This is the film's framing, but most of it is a love story that talks about the power of true love but the thing is, the basis of Veer and Zaara's love come across as just a fluctuation, they meet after two to three days and that's it, Veer is willing to give his life to her? They sacrifice too much for a relationship that's only starting to find its footing, in my opinion. The whole thing just come across as unrealistic, I don't believe real people would behave the way they did, there's one scene where Veer shows up during Zaara engagement party, I thought the dude has some world-class plan but he just shows up \" look at me, I crossed the Indian border and I come to take Zaara from her family, give me Zaara!!\" totally implausible. Why does everybody has to cry every now and then? If you could gather all the tears in the movie, you could start your own water bottling company, haha. So melodramatic when it doesn't need to be. Now there's one twist towards the end, I have to it's a good twist but quite cheap as it negates the whole thing that takes place. I don't know much about the indo-pak tension but it is address on numerous occasions in this film, every movie I've watched that tackled the same issue so far failed to do it maturely. They all go over-the-top and preachy with the whole thing, Veer's parents are open-minded and welcoming of Pakistanis but Zaara's parents are very conservative and close-minded. Now it means sense, in the film's context 'cause if both the parents have the same mindset then things would be much more difficult and the story will drag but realistically speaking, there's an big chance that both parents would oppose to the relationship. There's also social message about women empowerment through Rani's storyline but the film doesn't address well and sadly, it's just a background noise in the story. The songs are romantic and quite catchy, but also dramatic and overbearing especially the background score. But the film is visually astonishing thanks to the slick cinematography. The costumes, sets decorations are all colorful and magical. Can't say anything bad about the acting either, the cast performance is terrific. Overall, Veer Zaara is a classic love story with good cinematic touches.",

            "content": "INSTANT CLASSIC...those are the only words needed to describe Veer-Zaara. Yash Chopra promised a new love legend and boy did he deliver. This movie is totally Aditya Chopra's baby. I know Yash Chopra has directed it and I don't want to take anything away from his talents, he's one of the best directors in the world. But Aditya Chopra who wrote the story, dialog and screenplay deserves his due. How I wish he had directed Veer-Zaara. This is totally his baby.From the opening scene to the closing scene...you're in awe of this wonderful story of love and friendship. All the war movies released in the last few years claimed to be showing the friendship between India and Pakistan and yet when you watch them you realize they have nothing to do with friendship. Veer-Zaara is not a war film and yet it showcases the friendship from a humanity standpoint. What a great sub-plot.Now for the performances...Even though Shah Rukh Khan has been winning awards for SWADES. I think he did a better job of acting in Veer-Zaara and Main Hoon Na. SWADES has him playing the same character as always. Veer-Zaara and Main Hoon Na had the scope of showcasing something different and I think he should have won for one of those. His role is Veer-Zaara has him playing Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh; the role seems tailor made for Mr. SRK. He goes through even the most difficult scenes with ease, which shows how talented he really is.Preity Zinta, if there's one actress who gets better with each performance, its miss Zinta. She is just a sight and a treat to watch in this film. And trust me, long after the show is over, if there's one name you remember from the film its Zaara Hayaat Khan.Rani Mukherjee is another actress who everyone loves to watch on screen; with Veer-Zaara she proves that the size of the role doesn't matter it's how you portray the character that will have people remember the character. We'll always remember Saamiya Siddiqui.Since we're talking about characters, we can't go on without talking about Divya Dutta, she's simply amazing in this film. The role is made for her; no one else could have pulled of the character so well.There are lots of cameos in the film; I'll leave those to your imagination, just in case you haven't seen the film.There are so many things you can talk about when you speak of a film like Veer-Zaara, but the bottom line is its top quality. You won't find many films like this. In fact, I doubt that you can.On the whole, it's a wonderful family film and also the perfect date movie. So no matter who you are...IT'S WORTH THE MONEY...so watch it!",

A Muslim girl with a Hindu boy? Are you crazy? That is an IMPOSSIBLE as long as she is a true Muslim.

Muslims) apart. You can have the best music, best actors and the best directors/producers but if the plot of the whole story is based on lies or things impossible, it is just a waste of precious lifetime. I did NOT enjoy the movie at all. If the V.P.Singh would have simply honored his own promise made to the mother of the Muslim girl, the movie would have been more closer to the reality. I'd save you guys from the rest of my ranting. Just listen to the music, enjoy the emotional scenes, but for God's sake, don't give a damn about the story. There's no truth behind it and can never be. PERIOD.",

Its a brilliant piece of movie making and i m 23 now but i will be forcing my kids and grand kids to see this movie!!! Veer Zaara teaches us about love and loyalty and respect for elders!!! It teaches us that there is more to us humans then simply our jobs, money and international boundaries and their disputes! I just hope and pray to god that if there are really any real life Veer and Zaaras, may they shud be together as soon as possible!!! Love and mutual respect and pining for any two people is bigger then anything cos these are human values...... and i believe human values should be higher then any religion crap etc!!! Veer Zaara is a movie that i can watch again and again!! The cinematography may not be perfect but it has managed to capture the real sub-continent very well!!! The songs and especially vocals of Shri Shri Lata Mangeshkar jee are just divine and Gurdas Mann has made the track even more likable!!

The film stars Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukerji, Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Divya Dutta, Manoj Bajpayee, Boman Irani, Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher.Love blooms between an Indian pilot, Veer, and a Pakistani girl, Zaara. As Veer spends his years in a Pakistani prison, Zaara believes him to be dead and devotes her life to his village in India.I watched this film for the first time in 2022 and found this film cliched, predictable and stereotyped but considering the film was shot and released in 2004 will try to review the film keeping in mind that the types of film that were released during that era.The plot of the film is unique and execution is in typical Yash Chopra's style. The film has some typical Yash Chopra's feel such as long running of the film, fabulous music and the mesmerizing voice of the legend Lata ji apart from off-course Shah Rukh Khan. Yash Chopra has been remembered as king of comedy film and this film displays why he is called so.The screenplay of the film is evenly paced but gets slow in middle and younger generation might get disconnected from the film. The first half of the film is more romantic but slow and second half is little less romantic and a little fast, music and BGM of the film is very strong.Acting in the film is terrific and for me it was Preity Zinta who were the most impressive among all followed by Rani Mukerji and Shah Rukh Khan. Other stars were also impressive in their limited screen space but the fake Punjabi accent of Hema Malini irritates, in one of the scene she had addressed herself as South Indian and her dialogue delivery should've been kept normal.Climax of the film is good and the film ends on a happy note. Millennial and younger generations might feel disconnected from this film because of it's predictable and cliched approach but the viewers who were and still are a fan of Yash Chopra's work will surely like this film.",

Merit includes good cinematography, good locations, high production values and good performances of all the three lead actors. Technically above average with simple and subtle treatment keeping the required sensitivity of the subject in mind.. Thankfully, once again the indo-pak relations are dealt with finesse. As lot of dialogs are in Pakistani-Punjabi , it seems the makers largely kept north Indian audience in mind. The negative points are weak screenplay and dialogs, below average songs and music (apart from 1 or 2 songs rest all the songs are dull), a film with no surprises, no novelty but very predictable scenes. Simplicity at places slackens the pace as well as drama.. Courtroom scenes require hard hitting dialogs and not just melodrama. Not just that, a very ordinary climax and last but not the least disappointing role and performances (to the extent of overacting) of Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in special appearance. Yet Yash Chopra in his 21st directorial attempt does not disappoint (a nonetheless great achievement looking at track record of almost all of Indian directors) but is only far away from his own benchmark. It is worth a dekko just for him alone. Some of direction blunders- when advocate samia siddiqui (rani mukherji) knows that her client is falsely implicated of spying and his passport presented in the police records is a fake one, why can't she contact the passport office in India for the true identity of his client. That's not all, when the dead body of Capt. Veer pratap singh is not found among the victims of Bus accident then how come the army officials assumes that he is dead, rather than he is missing. To Top it, How come the Pakistan intelligence services be so ignorant that they don't even know that while they kept an Indian as a prisoner for spying, back home in India, his own home is inhabited by a Pakistani girl that too daughter of an important political figure of Pakistan.

Why is Pakistan suddenly becoming the flavour of the season. It looked more like Muslim Lucknow rather than Pakistan. No politician in Pakistan contesting from Lahore wears shirwani in his house for sure..in fact in the entire national assemblies of last 3-4 decades, you will hardly find any sherwani except the nawab's of bahawalpur and late Nasarullah Khan. No one in Lahore uses the Lakhnao Delhi style of adab for greetings. Nor does the ladies of the class shown wear jewels like Kiron Kher.

Not even any American romance has been able to move like this movie, a real tear jacker.A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYBODY! I think the actors and actresses were great with such fantastic display of emotions. The singing is great too. I think Bollwood is really developing fast I think this is one of their best. I wonder if there are people this days who can really devote themselves to love just like these two people did. I think this movie sends a message to people in love out there challenging them on how far they could go with there love.",

Having remained silent for the years of his imprisonment, he opens up to Saamiya and tells her the story behind his arrest: the love story between him and a Pakistani woman, Zaara (Preity Zinta).The plot of this romantic drama is gripping, moving, and mostly believable. It portrays Pakistan-India relations sensitively. The music is average and above, with some enjoyable choreography. This is a gorgeous movie, with both costumes and scenery that were breathtaking. Khan and Zinta have excellent chemistry and were entirely convincing. Mukerji played the uncertain but determined attorney well. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were cast as Khan's parents, with Kirron Kher as Zaara's mother; the three were, naturally, fantastic. The cast also includes Divya Dutta, Anupam Kher, Zohra Sehgal, and Manoj Bajpayee, all of whom gave solid performances. Overall, this is a wonderfully written and acted film, and I highly recommend it.",

            "review_title": "A monumental work by Yash Chopra, Bollywood's most monumental director",
            "content": "VEER-ZARA (2004)A monumental Indian film landmark Viewed at the Budapest Bollywood film week, October 6-12, 2016. Veer Zara is the story of the undying love of star crossed lovers, Indian air force officer Veer Pratap Singh, and Pakistani bride to be, Zaara Khan, separated for twenty years while he is in a Pakistani prison on a trumped up charge, -- and the relentless battle of a young Pakistani attorney to correct this injustice and restore him to freedom. The drama hinges on the fact that the Indian prisoner has been deprived of his identity and has remained silent all these years while being addressed only by a three digit number \"Prisoner 768\". The breakthrough leading to the unraveling of the mystery behind his silence comes when fledgling female attorney, Saamiya Siddiqi, (Rani) investigating the case, addresses him by his real name for the first time in twenty years. A bit far fetched as a basic premise but the story itself is so gripping and the performances of all players is so compelling that any narrative far-fetchedness is ultimately justified. (Try to remember, it's just a movie !)Director Yash Raj (who died at age 80 in 2012) was the master of richly staged romance and Veer Zara is possibly the pinnacle of his brilliance in both areas ~~ staging or mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, and heart rending romantic drama. In addition this film has three big Bollywood stars at the peak of their physical beauty and charm, (Sharukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukerji) as well as two older superstars, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini - in star supporting roles that are like a flashback to the Bollywood golden age. Their lengthy interlude section of the film, back in the hero's home village in Punjab, when SRK brings Zinta \"home for a day\" is almost a complete film by itself. In addition to all that, this picture is on a political level, practically a plea for the reunification of Pakistan and India.. The fact that a major character, the Pakistani defense attorney (Rani Mukerji, never more beautiful) is presented as such a highly sympathetic figure is already a major step in the direction of reconciliation with Pakistan. In general most Pakistanis are shown in a favorable light and it is personal circumstances that are to blame for the tragic separation, not the character of the country. Another most important plot point emphasizing the underlying cultural unity of both countries is the fact that an old lady born in Indian but having lived most of her life in Pakistan, wants, as her dying wish, to have her ashes scattered in the Indian waters of her original home town. Her deathbed wish conveyed to granddaughter Zara (Zinta) sets the entire story in motion and once Zara takes off with the ashes for India there is no turning back. Chopra's direction is unerring, one might even say inspired, as he creates. among other things, a visual and musical ode to the beauties and bounties of his own native Punjab. The actors themselves seem to be inspired by something beyond mere professional role playing -- a kind of quasi religious obligation to reach out to their soul brothers and blood brothers across the border. In short, this is a great motion picture attaining.epic levels of drama and significance. A major landmark of Hindi cinema.The structure of the film, as a series of flashbacks from a prison cell, then the Punjab interlude, and finally the courtroom drama and miraculous reunion of the lovers after a separation of 22 years, makes it into a three movement symphony with echoes of GWTW. And RANI is soooo beautiful! Everything comes together in this Epic Romance -- and epic is the word for it, starting with the cliff hanger helicopter scenes -- Rani vs her former mentor Anupam in court-- Rani visiting her fathers grave and pledging to carry on his incorruptible judicial work ~ at the beginning and almost at the end, but it actually ends at the border -- with Shahrukh and Preity going \"home\". The very complex time insertion within insertion structure comes out right In the bitter- sweet happy ending after three hours of agony and ecstasy. The director's son, Adita Chopra, wrote the intricate but arresting screenplay -- The actor who plays Zinta's betrothed and nemesis of SRK was Manoj Bajpayee, who would later star in Gangs of Wasseypur in 2012.",

            "content": "Yash Chopra's Veer-Zaara is a film about humanity, devotion, sacrifice, and the power of love. It is a visually stunning and emotionally touching picture about star-crossed lovers who meet once and are tied forever. Yash Chopra artistically combines realism with greatly unrestrained emotion and some overdone sentimentality. Although the love story itself, the separation and everything else is very typical, Chopra creates an entirely different film in the way it portrays the respect the lovers have for each other, the honour they pay to parents and elders, and their genuine willingness to sacrifice themselves for each other. It is a cross-border love story between an Indian and a Pakistani, yet their nationality is not what prevents them from being together. That's what really makes sense in this film. It flows very well through the stunning views of Indian and Pakistani fields and groves, and colourfully shows the bright sides of each country. The film does look a bit dated, but then it does not have a defined period of historical time, which makes it an all-time saga.The film also addresses women's empowerment through Rani Mukherjee's role of a Pakistani lawyer who tries to overcome society. There are many surprising and touching moments in the film. The love story is portrayed grandiosely, with larger-than-life orchestral music of heavy violins and piano. The movie soundtrack is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack in recent years, and the fact that it was actually composed many years ago contributes to the epic mood of the film. Shahrukh Khan and Preity Zinta are great choices for the film. They resuscitate their characters with restraint and dignity and have a credible chemistry despite not having much physical interaction. Khan is the main soul of the film and he is believable in everything his character goes through. Zinta is beautiful and compelling as the intelligent and headstrong Zaara, and looks great in traditional outfits. Rani Mukhejee makes a great impact with her relatively minor but pivotal role of the tenacious, level-headed Saammiya. She is natural and impressive and leaves the film as a winner.Veer-Zaara, though a completely entertaining epic romance, is not the greatest film you'll see and it often goes over-the-top in its emotions. It is far from being flawless and has its share of loopholes where script is concerned. Having said that, it just doesn't matter here. This film is far ahead of anything it can be blamed for. It is about the main values a person should cherish in life: humanity, respect and love, and it conveys this message very well. It is one of those films which become classics instantly, and I recommend it to anyone, whoever and wherever he is.",

            "content": "Yash Chopras last release as a director was Dil To Pagal Hain (97). But after watching his latest flick, one wishes that he should take complete retirement from direction. There are so many loopholes in the script and that too is written by his son Aditya Chopra who is very weak in writing right from Dilwale Dulhani a Le Jayenge, Mohabbatein till Veer Zaara.Some critics like Taran Adarsh are trying to give this waste of time product full marks by giving 4 and a half star and then one wishes that he should stop writing review and praising such films which are full of inaccuracy and he should take a seat back and start doing some other job.The film is inspired by DDLJ and Henna but again Yash and Aditya Chopra should think that they are not great storytellers like the great Showman Raj and Randhir Kapoor.Based on the love story of an Indian Air Force Squadron Leader and a Pakistani girl, The story begins with the sorrowful life of Sqdrn. Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) who is in imprisonment in the central Jail of Lahore for the last 22 years. Everybody has forgotten his real name and calls him by the name of Qaidi No. 786. One day a Pakistani lawyer Samiya Sidiqui who is a councilor with the National Human Rights Commission reaches the jail to take up the case of Veer Pratap Singh. Veer Pratap, who has not opened his mouth for the last 20 years, talks to her tracing his past existence. Zaara Hayad Khan (Preity Zinta) is a smart daughter of a strong politician of Pakistan Jahangir Hayat Khan. One day Zaara comes out of home on a journey to India without informing anybody to fulfill her grandmothers last wish. She had promised her grand mother that her last rites would be completed in India in a place of Sikh Pilgrimage called Tirthpur. On way to India, Preity meets with a bus accident and Veer rescues her as a part of his duty. After that, Veer accompanies the lonely Pakistani girl Zaara to complete the last rites of her grand mother and soon they become good friends. Now Veer brings her to his village to introduce her to his uncle Choudhury Sumer Pratap Singh (Amitabh Bachchan) and his wife Hema Malini. Here Choudhury Sumer Pratap Singh is impressed with Zaara as she proposes to open a school for the girls in the village. Before leaving the village Choudhury asks veer to propose Zaara. At the railway station, just when Veer is about to propose to Zaara, her would-be husband Raza Sirazi (Manoj Bajpai) appears on the scene. Soon Zaara returns to Pakistan and Veer returns to duty with the memory of Zaara. Zaara likes turns to love for Veer and just before her Nikah with Raza she discloses her love for Veer. Veer also reaches Pakistan but their union remains a dream. Everybody knows that the political career of Jahangir Hayat Khan (Boman Irani) depends on the marriage of Zaara and Raza. He is not ready to allow the marriage of Veer and Zaara. Because of Jahangir Khan's status Veer and Zaara surrender their love and Zaara agrees to her Nikah with Raza. The plot proceeds with Pakistani police arresting veer on allegations that he is Rajesh Rathode and works for RAW as an intelligence agent. But when Zaara hears about Veers death, she breaks Nikah with Raza and flies to Veers native village to fulfill the dream of Choudhury Sumer Singh. When the case reopens, Samiya Sidiqui is not able to arrange any strong proof to identify Veer. So she moves to India to find a person who can identify Veer Pratap Singh and finally she meets Zaara. It is only then that she is able to convince the judge that Qaidi no. 786 is the Ex - Indian Airforce Officer Veer Pratap Singh and wins against public prosecutor Zakir Ahmed (Anupam Kher). And what happens next leave it. You can guess it by yourself. I cannot recommend you such terrible movie and also not to waste your money on such nastiest film.There are so many loopholes and here are to name a few: How can one easily get a visa? How could Preity Zinta easily live in Pakistan with the fact that she is an Indian and no I.S.I. or any other government officials are coming investigating her and doing interrogation? The juniors cant see straight into the eyes of seniors like Barrister and in this film Rani Mukherjee easily wins the case.Yash Chopra even made fun of the Late Madan Mohan by mentioning his name in the film as a music director. It is a mammoth harm to the memory of the maestro. It seems unlikely that the music director could have drummed up the dull, colorless and unexciting Veer Zaara tracks.When Rani Mukerji knows her client has been falsely implicated for spying and the passport in the police records is false, why can't she contact the passport office in India for her client true identity?Besides, how can the pilot be assumed dead when no body has been identified? To top it all, how can the Pakistan intelligence services not be aware that the daughter of a leading Pakistani politician lives in his home in India? The film is set in Lahore (Pakistan) and Punjab (India). There are no mountains on the bus route that link the two. So how could Preity Zinta dangle from a ledge or Shah Rukh Khan supposedly die when the bus plunges into a ravine? So now you can see there are so many fault in this bad movie.Veer Zaara is the worst presentation from the Chopra camp. \u00bd Out of 5",

            "content": "Viewers who want to see intelligent thought-provoking films will not enjoy this one, on the other hand, Veer-Zaara is a visual feast for viewers who thrive on sensitive, romantic cinema. Even though I like watching well-made unconventional films, I would never say no to a romantic love saga. That also made by one of the country's most established filmmakers. So, is Veer-Zaara a love legend as it's termed to be? Does Veer-Zaara manage to hold the viewers attention throughout. Firstly, no! Veer-Zaara is not even close to being called a love legend. The reasons, which I will come to, later on in the review. But yes! Veer-Zaara can definitely hold a viewers attention, due to it's well-crafted screenplay and interesting twists in the storyline. The story, as most of you may already know, is about an Indian man, squadron leader Veer Pratap Singh who is a rescue pilot for the Indian Air Force. During one of his rescue missions he comes across a Pakistani girl Zaara Hayat Khan who comes to India to fulfill her grandmother's last wish.Initially their relationship begins on a sour note, but soon Veer and Zaara come closer, and before they realize it, they start to fall in love with each other. Veer decides to show Zaara his village and meet his uncle and aunt who raised him, since he was an orphan. Even his foster parents develop a liking for Zaara. All is going well, and Veer is about to express his love for Zaara, when Raza walks in, Zaara's fianc\u00e9 who has just landed from Lahore in search of Zaara. While in Lahore, Zaara cannot seem to forget Veer. So Zaara's maid Shabbo calls India to explain the situation to Veer. Veer gives up his job and goes to Lahore. He meets Zaara in the presence of her parents and prospective in-laws. However, the wedding between Zaara and Raza takes place, while Veer gets arrested on false charges of being an Indian spy. Years later, Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer comes to the rescue of Veer, who has been silent in jail for 22 years. Why has he been silent for so long? Where is Zaara? Saamiya takes it upon herself to find the truth about this man.Veer-Zaara starts off as any typical Bollywood love story with at least five songs in the first half. But the film gathers momentum as the proceedings unfold in front of us. The story has depth, the screenplay is gripping and never lets you down. Cinematography is par excellence, the scenic landscapes of Punjab have been shot beautifully. Art direction is authentic, background score is adequate. The heroines look lovely, typical Yash Chopra style. Veer-Zaara also suffers from some bad writing. The ending of the film was abrupt and unsatisfying. The last song which was incorporated into the courtroom looked weird and out-of-place. Even the songs, though melodious, act as speed breakers in the narrative. The sequence where Veer recites poetry in the climax was good, but did he have go on for so long. The best songs in the film are undoubtedly 'Kyun hawa', 'Do pal' and 'Main yahaan hoon'. The latter two in particular have been beautifully pictured and are mesmerizing.Shah Rukh Khan once again has proved why he is the undisputed King Khan of Bollywood. He has portrayed both shades of Veer's character with extreme ease. SRK doesn't ham much in this film, he exudes romance and is the perfect cast for Veer. Hard to imagine Veer-Zaara without SRK. Preity Zinta enacts the part of Zaara adequately. Her role doesn't demand histrionics. She looks good throughout the film and her chemistry with SRK seams to be improving with every film. Rani Mukherjee has tremendously improved as an actress over the years. She is the scene-stealer in Veer-Zaara. Essaying the role of Saamiya Siddiqui with complete confidence and it shows on-screen.Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini are fine in small but significant roles. Kiron Kher is good. Manoj Bajpai plays his part with complete conviction. Divya Dutta is excellent. Boman Irani doesn't get much scope. Anupam Kher is just about okay.Apart from a few omissions, Aditya Chopra has wonderfully written a sensitive love story. Even the dialogues are outstanding! But I wish they had tamed down the usage of Punjabi, which at places was hard to understand.Direction is A-Plus all the way. Yash Chopra is a fantastic story-teller. The sequences involving Indo-Pak relations have been handled sensitively. Veer-Zaara is definitely not a love legend. But it's undoubtedly one of the better love stories in recent times. The theme of the film may be a little old fashioned. But at least there aren't any ridiculous item numbers or girls popping up, scantily dressed every five seconds.If you enjoy romance or if your a die-hard SRK fan, then Veer-Zaara has a lot to offer. Otherwise stay away from this one. 8/10.",

            "content": "If someone described this film to me, I'd probably hate it. It's mushy, illogical, riddled with clich\u00e9s, has a dose of patriotic jingoism and has silly things thunder and lightning when someone does something dramatic. In a nutshell, it's everything that Hindi films are laughed at for. It undoes everything that films like Dil Chahta Hai, Lagaan, or even Kal Ho Naa Ho have done for Bollywood and brings it all back to square one.Unfortunately (because I wish I hated this film), the film does what it set out to do. It pulls shamelessly at the audience's emotions and ultimately evokes the desired effect. So yeah...it's a terrible movie which I couldn't help liking.Cinematography - It's Anil Mehta's worst effort ever. I was quite appalled - in fact I believe certain portions like the helicopter sequences were so bad that they couldn't possibly have been filmed by Anil Mehta. Probably some incompetent second unit. Bollywood has come a long way in cinematography with films like Khakee, Mission Kashmir, Asoka and even B movies like Qayamat - so Veer Zara's Manmohan Singh-like camera-work is unacceptable to me. Btw, to the uninitiated, Manmohan Singh is Yash Chopra's previous resident cinematographer. He was terrible. Sound - Good effort to use sync sound but I can't really critique it as the Dolby Digital cinema that I watched it in played the film in Dolby SR for some reason. Special effects - Some were pretty OK, but I think Chopra tried to cut some costs by not creating the effects at full film resolution - so the whole print changes colour and resolution whenever a composited effect is coming up. This cheapo SFX glitch was a hallmark of Bollywood films from 1996 (Indian/Hindustani starring Kamal Hassan) to around 2000). I thought that problem was over but thanks to Chopra who'd rather pay millions to SRK and AB and the rest of the overpaid 'stars' than provide good technical support, we have it again in a major Bollywood film. Music - I thought it was between OK and mediocre. Yeah yeah...i know its Madan Mohan. Do we have an obligation to revere anything by anyone who is old or dead? He's no A.R. Rahman or Ismail Darbar for sure.Acting - Acting was decent all round - though Zinta was highly unconvincing as a 50 something year old. SRK hammed here and there but got away with it. Rani was a pleasure to watch. While the film works on the emotional level very well, it's like saying that a porno works very well on the sexual level. I believe that if you want to make a melodrama, go all out and use technical and aesthetic devices as rhetorical elements creatively and eloquently to persuade an idea to the audience. It shouldn't be a half-baked effort. I'd advice Chopra to pick up some pointers from Sanjay Leela Bhansali. At the end of the day, the film is a third-rate effort that will inevitably work at the box office because of an infallible formula, star power and rigorous studio backed publicity. And did I say? - I kinda liked it",

            "content": "Yash Chopra has been one filmmaker who has told stories straight from his heart. He hasn't compromised for appreciation. Add to that, he's been a storyteller who has kept with the times and sometimes, he's gone ahead of times. Big and younger directors such as Subash Ghai, Sanjay Bhansali, Rajiv Rai and Ashutoush have not lived up to their names, and Yash Chopra has given non-stop hits since 1994. Whether it was having the leading man play a gangster in Deewar, or his bold take on extra-martial affairs in Silsila, or his most bold film Lamhe, about a love with a huge age difference and not to forget, Darr, where he gave more importance to the villain instead of the good guy - Chopra has succeeded in keeping up with the audience.Now why am I talking about Yash Chopra so much? Well, it's because when one hears the story of Veer Zaara and then when one watches it - they see a deeper tale than they read. Veer Zaara being a Indo-Pak love story sounds like a Henna or Gadar, yet it's not. It's Chopra's genius to develop a fresher theme having such a done-to-death plot.Veer Pratap Singh has been in a prison in Lahore for 22 years, his case is being re-opened, however. His lawyer is a young girl by the name of Samiya Siddique. To win Veer's case, she needs to know why Veer is in this prison. What is Veer's story? Who is Zaara? Why is Veer in jail? Will he ever be released? A handful of questions are answered in those 3 hours.Veer Zaara talks about 3 things.A man's pursuit for love going all boundaries and borders. - A man's identity - The relationship and similarities of 2 different nations that border each-other.Veer Zaara works and how! Veer Zaara is pure Indian soul. There's no peppy dance number, no crazy graphics, no special effects. I wrote above how Yash Chopra never compromises and Veer Zaara is a pure example. In the year where films like Dhoom and Murder became huge hits, Veer Zaara's success was the biggest.Even Veer Zaara's music sparks uniqueness. The music isn't by Jatin-Lalit, Shankar Mahadevan, or Pritam. The tunes are picked out from a collection made by the late Madhan Mohan. The music is soulful and magic to the ears. Every song is so wonderful with touch9ng lyrics by Javed Akhtar.The songs are picturised with sheer beauty. Especially Aisa Des Hai Mera. It was a delight to see Shah Rukh and Gurdas Mann shake a leg together in the song.The writing is crisp! It's nearly flawless. The film is a tad bit too long but the screenplay doesn't bore you. The dialogues are top-notch, they are applaud-worthy. Kudos to Aditiya Chopra.Veer Zaara is carried on the shoulders of Shah Rukh Khan. Playing a young man in his late 20's and then a man in his late 40's - SRK gives a bravo performances. His speech in the end is worth a standing ovation just for the expression and passion put in by Khan.After SRK, it's Rani Mukherjee who is a scene stealer. Rani looks the role, and masters it in her own brilliant way. Remarkable. Preity Zinta is good and does her part with ease.Of the supporting characters, it's Divya Dutta who takes the cake. She gives her best act. Kirron Kher is first-rate. Anupam Kher is, as usual, excellent. Boman Irani is okay.The small cameo made by Amitabh Bhachchan and Hema Malani puts a grand smile on your face. A master-stroke indeed.Veer Zaara belongs to Yash Chopra more than anyone else. The master storyteller adds another feather to his well-decorated hat. (Director's hat) He's handled the scenes of drama, emotions, romance just so poetically. No wonder he's the best filmmaker India will ever see.Overall, a high intensity filled romance that talks about more than just love's boundaries but also depicts that these boundaries of love are more similar than different.",

He is undoubtedly the King of Romance but we should not forget the backbone of this movie and the one who made Shahrukh the King of Romance. He was none other than The great late legend Mr. Yash Raj Chopra. Love poured in everything he did from film-making to his relation with his family, friends and film stars.Priety Zinta did justice with her character with intense emotions and amazingly fine acting. It was a really spectacular movie! The cinematography, music, songs, colors, acting and 'second to none' story were instrumental in its being.

Rani Mukharjee excelled in her portrayal of a real life Pakistani human rights activist. There is nothing much for Amitabh and Hema Malini to do and they have been credited with a \"special appearance\" tag.All in all, an ordinary SRK fair; what more can you expect from Yash Chopra who made DDLJ, DTPH and Darr.",

And everything comes beautifully in its perfect place due to the influence of the powerful man behind the camera, Yash Chopra. How can one man pull off such masterclass in storytelling that even though the concept and the story being so cliche feels so fresh and unique? You will always be missed sir.First off, SRK and Preity Zinta are just magnificent in the film. There is no second guessing there. The story of Veer Pratap Singh leaving his entire life behind to protect the honour of Zaara Hayaaat Khan is supposed to be an emotional rollercoaster and both of them don't miss a beat. I can't not believe that there is a man alive who can love Zaara more than Veer and it is all due to the performances of these two actors. Truly exceptional work by both of them. The rest of the cast also is simply great. Although most of the screentime is given to the leads, amitabh bachchan, hema malini, manoj bajpayee, rani mukerji, boman irani, all of them do a great job to support the love story perfectly.The music is also really good. An album so good it will make you wanna cry, dance, be happy and fill you with all emotions humanly possible.Idk about you guys but, this film is perfect for me.

How did Rani suddenly 'discover' Shah Rukh? A bit implausible!! There were other snags too that could have been given moreattention.... If only all our filmmakers would make a movie afterdoing proper research and pay attention to minute details we'dhave more flawless movies like Lagaan. Still coming from theYash Chopra banner it was a movie that did not give one aheadache. All the stars performed their role on the whole quite welland the overall package was quite neatly tied up.

A - she is a laywer, about to undertake her first case, obviously she will do her research, the court was told that when the bus crashed, a guy with the name of veer had a ticket, and then a guy agreed and said that there were 2 passports at the time..one with the fake name, one with the real. she must have found out alllll about it, someone who is about to take up a case of such high class would need to be prepared.Q - no one wears shirwani??? A - how many of you actually live in the houses??? you see them as they represent themselves elsewhere, what they wear at home is something you wouldn't know about and the same goes for the kiron kher, you don't know how the pakistani women are at home, unless you going around peeking.Q - we didn't have all that stuff 22 years ago??? A - who said it was based 22yrs ago??? they could have showed the year 2000 and then the year 2022, you wouldn't know because there is no mentioning of n e kinda dates in the film, yash je is very good with his costumes, and i am sure, a guy who first directed his first hit film in 1951 would know xactly how an actor should look, not us novice's, you guys don't know how much work and effort is put into a film and you think they would forget about details of such large quantity???Q - srk is pathetic??????? A - r u guyz feeling OK, the rest of the world isn't hypnotised you know, that only you few see him as pathetic and the rest see him as the baadshah, he hasn't made himself the baadshah, we have, we people who watch the films, but no doubt, looking at his films, and allll others, i couldn't really come up with a better romantic hero who performs well in his role and makes the film live.a film with music 10/10 and the movie itself 10/10. you really need to appreciate an excellent film when you see it instead of getting jealous that your girlfriend likes SRK more than you.Thanks yash je and co",

The theme is commendable, but I think that is probably the only thing worth mention. The low of Shah Rukh Khan's acting in this movie is worth contrasting with the high in Swades (released a few days later). Yash Chopra is only interested in making full use of every scene's potential to extract tears from the viewer or trying to justify the 'epic' adjective by adding signs of opulence and grandeur.

Veer falls for Zaara the moment he rescues her from a bus crash and eventually compels her to visit his family's village for the festival of Lodi.

First of all, for those who hate Shahrukh Khan and his kinda movies, they better stay away from the movie. It's a totally emotional movie. Movie is to be watched for its direction and not for its script. The story is quite predictable except few turns.Movie's strongest point is its music by Late Madan Mohan and its recreation by Sanjeev Kohli and Yash Chopra. Full marks to Yash Chopra for the music and LYRICS. If you see trailer 4 on the LAN, you would really feel that upto what extent this man recreated Madan Mohan's tunes. If you liked its songs, then you will like even more when you see the movie, because it's well known fact that Yash Chopra's music is much dependent on the situation and more likable after watching the movie. e.g. the kawali, which I didn't like when I heard it, but it fits the situation very well, especially the words.Movie clearly belongs to ShahRukh Khan and Preity Zinta. As per performance, ShahRukh Khan is good. He has done the same acting he has been doing since quite long time, but anyway that's what is needed for the movie. Preity Zinta too is well. Rani Mukherjee doesn't have much role as compared to Veer and Zaara, but good performance in role assigned to her like some of the courtroom scenes. Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Manoj Vajpayee, Kirron Kher, Boman Irani have done justice to their roles. Overall, worth watching at Hall if you like emotional movies. my rating:8/10",

I, being a huge fan of Yash Chopra was not only let down by the great director but also scratched my head getting out of the cinema and wanted my money refunded. It had all the clich\u00e9s possible in any movie and the dialogues were so over dramatic.. when are indians gonna learn how to bring reality to a movie and when are those so popular actors going to learn that acting is not equal to OVERACTING, specially that awful SRK. Priety was her typical self. Cute at times and at times just not able to carry the scenes. A great admirer of Rani, I still felt that her dialogues were poorly written. I really laughed my head off when she said that I know how much you loved her. I mean come on man .. grow up .. get out of those un realistic stupid over-dramatic scenes.

A really bug fan of Shahrukh Khan, and don't think there is a YashRaj Film I don't love. Plus the songs have really grown on me and was also really into the whole Pakistan-India background for the movie. Will try not to give any spoilers. The story is really refreshing and where there is a certain tendency to follow the DDLJ plot line, the different treatment is extremely refreshing. The movie may seem a tad bit predictable in the beginning but trust me for the largest part it is anything but. Shahrukh Khan further cements himself as the tear-jerker maestro, Preity has me in love with Zaara's character and Rani Mukherjee really shines as a lawyer looking for some justice. The movie never seems to lag, and where it doesn't have the flashiness of Yash Chopra's last work, Dil tu Pagal Hai, it has a lot more soul. Coming at a time where the norm has become the run of the mill skin flicks, this movie serves as a breath of fresh air. The dialogues can be cheesy at times, but there cheesy for a cause. For the large part though, they reach for the heart and leave a lasting impression. This is truly in my opinion Yash Chopra's best, in league with DDLJ, although set in a much more mature tone. A must see for those who just love the feeling that comes with the so called mush mush Indian flicks, and for anyone else that appreciates good theatre.",

Shahrukh Khan is first of all perfectly cast for the role of Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh and simply lives and breathes this character and fits perfectly. With his taking on of this role Shahrukh brings a true romantic hero presence to the screen.Preity Zinta is simply beautiful as Zaara Hayaat Khan and together Shahrukh and Preity share a lovely screen presence.In short I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It is simply not to be missed! 5 STARS! 10 OUT OF 10!",

            "content": "How then should I rate an Indian/Hindi/Tamil film now that filmmakers like Ashutosh Gowariker or Mani Ratnam have revealed that basic formulas don't need to be adhered to as religiously as before for great 'Bollywood' entertainment? Why am I rating Veer Zaara an 8? Certainly not because of it's relatively predictable (with perhaps 1 exception) plot. Definitely not due to the musical numbers (these are adequate but by no means as catchy as in either Gowariker's \"Lagaan\" or Advani's \"Kal Ho Naa Ho\" for example). Surprisingly, not simply because of the amazing Shah Rukh Khan who keeps reaching new pinnacles of performance with each passing role. Maybe it's partially because I appreciated a lot of the symbolism, not to mention significance, re the underlying messages of UNITY in the face of long-standing differences between two major nations and two major religions (in this case India & Pakistan and Sikhs and Muslims) that permeated the entire storyline. No I think that the reason I award a high 8 to this film, is because, even though I noticed its flaws, by the last 45 minutes, these didn't matter much as I was drawn in to the story to such an extent that I could not help but enjoy the film immensely. If you are not totally jaded, I predict that you'll also enjoy it immensely.P.S. FYI: I am not from India and have never visited there. I reviewed this from a new Original 2 DVD Set just released. Next on my list is the newly purchased Gowariker film \"Swades\" and I'll give my comment on that film in a week or two (soon as I have the time to watch it).",

And a very beautiful and surprising sort of secondary role by Rani Mukerji. This story is about Veer(Srk)an air force rescue chopper pilot who hails from India. One day he saves Zaara (Preity) a young Pakistani girl who has just got her marriage fixed from a bus wreck. Zaara was carrying her grandmother/nanny's ashes to be dumped in a holy river in India. That is where they meet and the love/interest sparks almost instantly in the next few days Veer accompanies Zaara to dump her nanny's ashes and Zaara accompanies Veer to his village's lodi festival. In this short time Veer and Zaara fall in love but are snatched back into reality when Zaara goes back to Pakistan and an arranged marriage that she doesn't want. As in most Indian movies the marriage is good for both Zaara's parents and the groom to be. Veer goes to Pakistan to bring Zaara back as his wife. He doesn't out of respect for Zaara's mother's Pelee for her family's need of this marriage. Veer is put in prison though when trying to return to India. He choses to live his life behind bars to ensure Zaria's happiness. The rest of the movie is about Mukerji (a lawyer trying to get Veer out of jail). The last 15 min. of the film are where Veer and Zaara are reunited after 20+ years apart, and contains some of the most powerful and moving lines and scenes I've seen in Bollywood history for a long time . Veer-Zaara is a Beautiful movie and a must see. 10/10",

The late Madan Mohan, it so seems, didn't leave much behind him to be used three decades after his death. More than sixty percent of the music is based on famous Punjabi folk tunes (Bhangra, Tappay, Mahiya and Lohri etc.) Javed Akhtar, the song writer is however given a free hand this time and the film starts with a Javed poem---it's a prelude in fact. Interestingly enough, the film also ends with a poem which is recited in a Pakistani court room by an Indian prisoner.Being a Lahorite myself, I was highly disappointed to see the way my city's culture was depicted in this mega budget production. For the benefit of the director let me say that Punjabi politicians don't wear 'shirvani' and 'topi'and they don't greet people in an 'Adaab-Urz' style. If the young writer (Aditya Chopra)was un aware of the fact that these cultural clich\u00e9s were direct descendants of the so called Muslim Social cinema of India, the veteran director (Yesh Chopra)could have guided him.

There are so many more meanings to this film than just love between boy and girl. There is different cultures, different religion, obligation to parents and understanding sacrifice.The dancing and the singing is the entertainment but if you can see past that (although you can enjoy it) and see the story (though not real) and take away from that story what humanity is, what cruelty is then maybe this world wouldn't be such a war orientated culture.",

From lead roles of Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta, to the guest roles of Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, every one ticked their boxes.And the best thing for me in the movie is the soundtrack- all my top 4 favourite Hindi songs come from this movie alone. Once who loves music can even watch this film for enjoying the 7 or 8 songs alone! Lyrics and music blend intricately with the visual beauty of the song sequences. Songs like Yeh Hum Aa Gaye, Tere Liye, Kyun Hawa, Aisa Des Hain Mera are of a different league.So, just go for it, enjoy the movie.",

However, I liked how they took a story that has been done many times before and in some way made it different.The story goes.... (SPOILERS) Veer (Khan) is a Punjabi army rescue officer, who lives to help save the lives of complete strangers. Zaara (Zinta) is a beautiful rich daughter of a Pakistani politician. When Zaara's Sikh nanny dies her last wish is for her ashes to be scattered in Kirtpur (A Sikh pilgrimage) in India. When an accident unites Veer and Zaara they become enthralled with each others countries and become fast friends. After spending a few days together Veer falls in love with Zaara but Zaara is engaged to a man in Pakistan. However, realizing her true love is Veer, Zaara tries to brake off the engagement. However, Veer cannot marry Zaara knowing the cultural differences are too great. From here the story takes a turn and Veer spends 22 years imprisoned by Zaara's finance, it is up to human rights lawyer (played wonderfully by Rani Mukerjee) to free Veer. In the process she wonders what has happened to Zaara?SRK has given his best performance of his career, after playing the action hero of MHN, and the dying cancer patient in KHNH, SRK is playing a simple Punjabi boy who through the course of the film is turned into an old feeble man. SRK did a good job showing the pain he felt, yet maintained a character who saw the good in all negative things.Zinta did an excellent job playing the lead heroine, she has definitely not looked as beautiful as she did in any other movie to date as she did in Veer Zaara. At first I was surprised to hear her take on the role of a traditional Pakistani girl. Zinta usually plays the westernized modern Indian girl. In this film however she did a great job.rani mukherjee did a good job although she wasn't really showcased until the last 30 minutes in the court room but she shows she can do a great job even if it is a supporting role. Manoj Bajpai did a good job as the mean fianc\u00e9 to Zaara. Divy Dutta did a good job as the comedic relief and Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini did a great job playing loving parents to a foster child Veer (sounds like Bagbhan). Veer Zaara is very different than your typical Bollywood movie because it manages to be a very tragic love story...yet maintaining a positive and happy feeling at the end. The story has been seen before, but Chopra's direction is very good. There is great attention to ancient buildings. I still think no Hindi film has done a good job picturing Punjab as well as Veer Zaara. The music at first seems not very",

I've listened to the songs before i've even heard of which movie it originated from and absolutely had goose-bumps watching the movie and hearing the songs which i had already considered my all-time favourites! I have never come across any other movie which had so many haunting melodies in one. The climax to the movie was totally unexpected which is different from so many of the mainstream 'Indian' movies where the ending is totally predictable. My one and only gripe with the movie is the deletion of the song 'Yeh Hum Aa Gaye Hain Kahan (Where Have We Come?)' which i consider to be the best song in the movie. Hats off to Javed Akhtar for the amazing lyrics. Which other movie had songs that you could listen to after hearing them a thousand times and still be absolutely bedazzled by them? Hats off to Shahrukh, Preity, and Rani. Was never a Shahrukh fan until this movie. Was never a Preity fan until this movie. Well done Yash and the gang!!!",

If ever the actors would read my humble letter (after veer Zaara for me nothing is impossible) remember the honey foot prints you leave in the souls of men and women, cannot be expressed by words. Shash Rukh Khan you are a very heartwarming actor. Sometimes when I look at your films I get the impression you are not acting but the film is you and you are the film....This email is from an ordinary lady who would like to say to you A great big Merci for Veer-Zaara. Thank you for a new tomorrow from my heart to yours. You have facial expressions that are beyond Compare. To the producer (Yash Chopra the Love Man) When you were born, heaven must of been missing an angel. Veer Zaara could not be imagined by any human being who is not sensitive.

They should have been better written. However, his speech at the end of the movie was nice.The songs except for a couple are not that interesting.

            "review_title": "What is wrong with Veer-Zaara?",
            "content": "This film is a terminal Indian view of Pakistan. The India we are shown in Veer Zaara is lush. It is the Punjabi countryside in all its verdant glory. We are shown vast fields and small villages where big-hearted philanthropists set up schools for the poor. It is an India of trees and tractors, at one with its agrarian roots and industrialist aspirations. Lahore, on the other hand, is a Kafkaesque funnyhouse packed with jails and the gaudy, ostentatious mansions of rich politicians. India is outdoors, Pakistan is indoors. In India, poor people sit atop trains and sing paeans of patriotic love for the motherland. In Pakistan, the poor either sweep the floor in jails or sweep the floor in mansions. In India the poor are citizens, in Pakistan they are servants. The India of Veer Zaara is vibrant and multicultural, where Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs mingle with ease and are in fact indistinguishable from one another. The Pakistan of Veer Zaara , on the other hand, is a rigidly monolithic country, crawling with rich politicians and their families, who greet each other by raising a cupped hand to their forehead in what is supposed to be the traditional adaab gesture of north Indian Muslims. Zaara's villainous fianc\u00e9, despite being a Punjabi politician, speaks the most highfalutin Urdu and wears exquisitely embroidered Nehru jackets. In other words, the Lahore of the film is really Hyderabad Deccan and its Punjabis are actually Mohajirs. Finally, India is brought to life by the voice of Lata Mangeshkar (Mother India?) while scenes from Pakistan are accompanied by stern instrumental renditions of the rather ominous Raag Bhairavi . So India is rural, outdoors and Gandhian, while Pakistan is elitist, indoors and\u0085 Versaceian ? Wait. That can't be right. Because India is, believe it or not, more than this equation allows, while Pakistan is less . The India of Veer Zaara is not just Gandhian, it is Nehruvian in its appeal; there are no Dalits or Harijans in this India. This India is miraculously free of BJP-style Hindu nationalists. It is secular, progressive, squeaky saffron clean. The country that lurks to its west, however, is garish and nightmarish. It is a country where all the men look like Liaqat Ali Khan and all the women look like Fatima Jinnah. It is populated by politicians and policemen, and has giant murals of Mohammed Ali Jinnah pinned to its walls. This is what I mean by a terminally Indian view of Pakistan. Mr Chopra, despite his good intentions, suffers from a Pakophobia that has plagued India since independence. He is evidence of the fact that for many Indians \u0096 indeed, for many educated, wealthy and creative Indians \u0096 the Pakistani clock stopped ticking in August 1947. India has lived for sixty years with a frozen image of Pakistan as a tragedy in India 's history, orchestrated by a group of elite, Urdu-speaking, Indian politicians. A modern Pakistani identity that is different from India's Muslim sub-identity is therefore inconceivable for the Indian mind. Hence the Nehru jackets and Liaquat Ali Khan clones. Even when Veer Zaara tries to be creative and imagines a Lahori shrine, it ends up with a replica of Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi. We have yet to identify the most serious and insidious of Veer Zaara 's indiscretions. Islam is used as a motif in Mr Chopra's film. But when it appears in the form of human beings, they are invariably women; all the Pakistani female characters of Veer Zaara cover their heads. Even Saamiya Siddique, the character modelled on Asma Jehangir, is shown to be guided by some higher religious cause. She wants to deliver justice, true, but only in the name of Allah.",

Veer has family in the village, and while most Indians show no affection for Pakistanis, his aunt and uncle are willing to take Zaara in for the night. It isn't long before Veer finds himself falling for her; however, Veer learns that Zaara is engaged to another man, Raza (Manoj Bajpai), a cruel and humorless Pakistani.

Veer-Zaara is subtitled in English (a few misspellings). Great for me (with hearing loss), perhaps distracting for non-readers.Indian cinema is melodramatic (but so is Victor Hugo), and probably seems corny to a jaded Manhattan sophisticate who can't feel simple joy without their therapist's approval.

A couple of scenes were brilliantly executed to evoke an entire Ganges of tears. One in particular needed no syrupy dialogues; I refer to the scene when Ms Mukherjee hands a locket or something to the aged Ms Zinta. That to me, was a crux of sorts and really, the point where the story gets the impetus to speed up. Indeed, at that moment when the locket changed hands, I welcomed a tight, warm numbness of emotion that welled up from my diaphragm onto my thorax. The tears dropped with a freedom they had been long denied and out of the strain of holding back came forth the will to let go...For once, I did not mind the frequent intervals of song-bursts, only because they easy on the ear and anthem-like at times. Pleasing cinematography with smooth transitions and thoughtful editing sustained high interest levels all through the show. And everyone was so good in their roles. Even Shahrukh Khan, who did his best to play the role of a man a few decades older. It must have been difficult for someone so hyper to portray a character who is completely the opposite. Mr Khan, it must be said, hammed it up towards the end which came as no surprise, but like my companion said towards the end of the movie, he is one of those actors who, \"given a cent, will act for a dollar\" Ha! :-D",

            "content": "a love legend by yash chopra let me correct this a love legend by yash raj films or a love legend by aditya chopra - remixed by yash choprai have watched most of yashji's films (silsila, lamhe, chandni, darr, dtph) and what i know of him as a film maker is good music, good theme and the way he brings both of these alive on screen. this time its good music and a good theme but you don't actually see traditional yash chopra directed movie. though it has some good scenes/songs which only yashji can deliver. but the overall movie to me seems more like ddlj remixed. like the backdrop/base of the story is different. otherwise the story/screenplay is aptly credited to aditya chopra. it has some visuals that have a typical yash chopra feel. sometimes it gives u a feeling that it is adi's (the typical punjabi & song-n-dance) touch in the first-half and yashji's (trademark directorial) touch in the second-half. the following are my views about the movie... (that may/maynot appeal to everyone) some spoilers ahead some of the memorable scenes: 1. song 'hum to bhai jaise hain' introduction of priety zinta.2. rani mukerji confronting the jailer akhilendra mishra (lagaan, sarfarosh) while leaving the prison. 3. introduction of manoj bajpai, till the song 'do pal' takes over.4. the way boman irani(on the bed) expresses his selfishness/helplessness when zaara agrees for nikaah. 5. the conversations between rani mukerji & anupam kher including the office and courtroom scenes. it would've been a better movie if... 1.the amitabh bachchan & hema malini track could have been stronger rather than just a song/dance cameo. 2. the visual effects (morphing old-young-old) could have been avoided and instead some unseen footage from the flashback used throughout the song 'tere liye' could have left a better impact. 3. the courtroom drama and the poetry part in the end could have been redone for a good narration drama-wise and also performance-wise.overall a feelgood movie - much popular with most of yash raj films' movies.don't miss trailer of another most awaited movie 'mangal pandey' (to be released by yash raj films). aamir khan looks gr8 and also the background score chanting of mangal mangal sounds gr8. it says coming june 2005. lets wait then...",

            "content": "Review:Oh my god, what a story, what a movie! Veer-Zaara is no doubt an epic love story - a love legend. While the strongest point of the movie is its story, everything else from direction to acting to music is superb. Shah Rukh Khan essays two contrasting roles (of an old prisoner and that of a young air force squadron leader) with utmost ease and almost to perfection. Strong performances by Rani Mukherjee, Priety Zinta and the rest of the cast also add to the beauty of the film. The screenplay is simply amazing and some dialogues are breathtaking. The director has done justice to the star studded cast in making what i would say is a masterpiece.Coming back to the strongest point - the story. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that it give the likes of Romeo and Juliet, Heer-Ranjha a run for their money (story-wise). What unconditional love, what sacrifice! (Spoiler - its not a tragedy!). This movie just makes you think about the story for hours after seeing it (I just saw it yesterday, so it could also be days, months...)There is also a social message of brotherhood for people of India and Pakistan.Summary:Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force, who risks his own life to save the lives of others. One day, on duty, he comes across a stranded Zaara... a girl from Pakistan. Zaara, a carefree, sprightly girl has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mother's dying wish. She meets with a bus accident leaving her stranded in a foreign land.Veer saves her life... and his life is never the same again...Twenty-two years later, Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer on her first case, finds herself face-to-face with an ageing Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years - and no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served. And thus starts her journey to unveil the truth... the story of Veer and his life...Why has Veer been silent for 22 years?Why is he in a jail in Pakistan?Where is Zaara?What happened to her? God has written the destinies of Veer and Zaara, such that they can never be joined together. Saamiya has come to change that... to join Veer and Zaara together... forever...Veer-Zaara is not an ordinary story - it's a Love Legend. Veer and Zaara's love legend. And how Saamiya becomes associated with their story. This is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation, deepens with sacrifice. Verdict: 9 out of 10. If u like love stories, you cannot afford to not see it!",

I'm thinking these fans haven't much previous experience with Yash Chopra or they would have known what they got in this movie is what Yash Chopra gives and what has made his same synonymous with success. The emotion was at high pitch, but that's nothing new. Those who want muted emotion don't usually go to Chopra movies. But I can recommend some other directors if they want that. Mr and Mrs Iyer was muted. And very effective. But how many theaters did it ever play in?I fully expect the movie to contend in most award categories and win a few. Maybe it won't sweep awards like DDLJ, but it will get a share.",

            "content": "One of the best works of god old Yash Chopra. I missed him for the last few years. Veer Zaara is not just about romance or love. It is the story of two lovers who are first of all amazing loving humans. Ideally put by Samia, \"Yeh khuda ke roop mein insaan hain yaan insaan ke roop mein khuda\". The film has not been appreciated by many coz nowadays people want to identify themselves with characters. I certainly cannot identify myself with Veer. But am I inspired by Veer or what!! Veer and Zaara are characters which inspire you. They make you want to be better people. And that is enough for me to love them and the film.It has been a long time since such soulful music has been made. Madan Mohan's music recreated by Sanjeev Kohli is magical. Javed Akhtar has worked wonders with the lyrics. Lata Mangeshkar is still the nightingale of India. I felt that 'Tere Liye' is the best situational song ever written. 'Do pal' is another classic.Some viewers say that it is too emotional. But then Indians are emotional people. Yeah I cried. I wept in the second half. there is one scene that just overwhelms you. Kudos to Preety and Yash for creating such a stunning sequence. The film has built a bridge between borders. India and Pakistan are no longer enemies in Bollywood. Thats the icing on the cake!Watch the film and if you do not carry a handkerchief like i do, make sure you have tissues...",

            "content": "Here comes the most awaited Hindi film of 2004 from Chopra clan who've been making the most romantic(hit) movies since last 5 decades who always ropes in the best of everything within the film industry and outside! This is a story abt Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh(Shah Rukh Khan) working as a rescue pilot for Indian Air force falling in love with Zaara Hayat Khan(Priety Zinta), a girl hailing from the most respectful political family in Pakistan who is on her brief visit to India. But their lives were not as simple as they thought to be, their destiny had something else planned for them. To reunite Veer Zara becomes the most important mission of lawyer/activist Saadiya Siddique(Rani Mukherji) whose morals are as strong as her willpower to face those in the world where some still believe in women suppression.The movie gradually glides you into lives of Veer Zaara surrounded by scenic landscapes and striking sets which form an integral part of the story. Add to this the brilliant acting of Shahrukh Khan,his sincere effort to break free of his typecast is visible. Rani Mukherji has again added one more memorable role into her kitty. Priety Zinta is same with her bubbly performance but with shades of improvement. Both the leading ladies look lovely(a la Yash Chopra style).Music of the movie by late Madan Mohan is worth a mention especially the highlight song of the movie 'Tere Liye' and 'Main Yahaan Hoon'. An induction of morphing technology is novel and very well handled. Hopefully the backdrop of movie(India/Pakistan) in current political scenario which is showing positive signs will help to move ahead.What if some of the scenes/song sequence remind you of any of Chopra's previous movies.What if there are some loopholes in the script(which otherwise is good) or what if the repetition of Hindustan/Pakistan words after a point gets irritating and so what if there are so many songs in first half which lengthens the movie. Definitely not a legend, but surely manages to hold you and mildly heart-rending almost till the last scene!",

His love and passion for romantic cinema is reflected wonderfully in Veer Zaara, a tale of selfless love and sacrifice transgressing culture, class and international boundaries. It is a poignant and deeply moving story, well scripted and brilliantly directed. From the loud and boisterous first half lavishly decorated with song and dance sequences to the tragic and sentimental second, the director weaves a carefully crafted thread through the entire movie, gripping the audience before driving them to tears towards the finish. It feels like a breath of fresh scented air among the usual mindless and tasteless products churned out of Bollywood.",

Preity's look seems tired, older and not So fresh, maybe something to do with all that extra Botox in her forehead. I was too distracted by the protruding eyebrows.\nNot to mention the insipid chemistry between Zinta and SRK.\nWhile not a great actor, they should have cast Aishwarya Rai as zaara, at least she'd have looked the part and has some chemistry with shahrukh. I read somewhere that the role was originally written for her but later replaced with Zinta due to Rai's ex boyfriend Salman's behavior on the sets of chalte chalte.\nOtherwise the movie is regular Yash raj fair and there's nothing new in there.

Does anyone know how I can find the words of this poem? It was so moving - begins - \" I, prisoner 786, look out the bars of my cell........\" I found the \"Lodi\" celebrations very colourful - but the festival is one I had not come across before and have been unable to find any further information on the internet. The story was very moving, and, although the India v Pakistan scenario has been tackled many times, I thought this had a freshness about it. Amitahb and Hema were brilliant together, they always seem to bring out the best in each other. If the film returns to a cinema near hand - I will go and watch it again, and will certainly add it to my growing collect of Hindi DVS when it is released.",

            "content": "\"Veer-Zaara\" was one of those Indian movies I see sporadically when I feel the \"desi\" urge. I write this review as a guy who is not a Bollywood buff. I think they are at times excessively melodramatic. Drama freaks like me want melodrama, deep love and all that stuff, but this can easily (and often does) go over the top and I hate when that happens.My view of \"Veer-Zaara\" is that a movie with a cast like this one had (Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee, plus Amitabh, Hema Malini) could have done better. These three actors are spectacular if they didn't speak a single word. Preity is drop-dead -- any dialogue she wants to utter is golden to me! Likewise, Rani as the Pakistani lawyer does a great job as well. Shah Rukh Khan is reputed to single-handedly make an otherwise drab movie a success, and I would not doubt that assertion.I appreciated the quaintly beautiful setting in Lahore, Pakistan and the rustic farmland of Punjab.A truly melodic song welcomed Zaara's fianc\u00e9 at their marriage at her house, a song that changed its meaning as Veer magically appeared and romanced Zaara even as she is to wed another man! How exquisite that the singers sat in those \"mandal\" kind of things separated by water from the pathways -- rich, rich stuff. I loved all the rainy scenes -- because it heightens the drama -- cool!Another favorite part for me was the Lodi (hey, Lodi, NJ!!) festival (in Punjab, was it?) where men declare their love for a girl in a tribal sort of way (which I wish we could *universally* adopt -- think of all the shy men this would benefit). And the girl could accept or reject on the spot.Alright, why did I say it could be a better movie? Its sheer length! Clocking in at over 3 hours, you truly need to wear a different movie-goer hat, a time-expanded one, to see it to the end. Also be prepared for a certain lack of subtlety. Let's say the movie maker wants to convey a surprise, a strong emotion or a bombshell. Why does it always have to be in the form of clashing cymbals or orchestra instruments going wild, like BANG!! This is jarring on the ears. There are better ways of doing it than hitting the audience over the head with a hammer.I really wish Indian film makers would try to condense the social and cultural richness of overly long movies by cutting unnecessary parts. This would make it more enjoyable for people like me (and save film rolls).",

            "content": "Once again, Shahrukh has put out an outstanding performance in the movie Veer-Zaara. He is the perfect actor for any romantic film, where there are such conflicts that would involve religious matters, family traditions etc. Shahruk is a gifted person who is only meant to love and be loved by others and thats whether he is rich in a movie or poor. Shahrukh played both roles of an ordinary loving man who loves his people and risks his own life to save others ( Squadron leader Veer Pratap S.) and also as a tormented prisoner who sacrificed 22 precious years of his life for Zaara so that she can live happily with her family. Shahrukhs performance seems to be more demanded that Rani and Prity though they have also put in efforts to make Veer-Zaara and excellent movie. Also thanks to Yash Chopra because the script of Veer-Zaara was not only amazing but also an inspiration. * Some day I hope I could perform like Shahrukh in movies as Rahul but i could never be of that standard because he is the god of acting and Baadshah of Bollywood*",

Others who have seen it but haven't felt touched by it should see it again when they are older or have experienced love, and maybe they will change their mind. There are some scenes (one song in particular in the beginning) that I think could have been omitted to cut down on the length of the film, but still I stand by my rating of 10/10 for this excellent movie with its wonderful soundtrack. It might be interesting for some to read up on the Indian-Pakistan history. Yash Chopra - Congratulations.",

I do know from the bottom of my heart that Veer-Zaara is an absolute masterpiece.\n\nThis film has everything. And everything comes beautifully in its perfect place due to the influence of the powerful man behind the camera, Yash Chopra. How can one man pull off such masterclass in storytelling that even though the concept and the story being so cliche feels so fresh and unique? You will always be missed sir.\n\nFirst off, SRK and Preity Zinta are just magnificent in the film. There is no second guessing there. the story of Veer Pratap Singh leaving his entire life behind to protect the honour of Zaara Hayaaat Khan is supposed to be an emotional rollercoaster and both of them don't miss a beat. I can't not believe that there is a man alive who can love Zaara more than Veer and it is all due to the performances of these two actors. truly exceptional work by both of them. the rest of the cast also is simply great. although most of the screentime is given to the leads, amitabh bachchan, hema malini, manoj bajpayee, rani mukerji, boman irani, all of them do a great job to support the love story perfectly.\n\nthe music is also really good. an album so good it will make you wanna cry, dance, be happy and fill you with all emotions humanly possible.\n\nidk about you guys but, this film is perfect for me. a story I will never forget and cry everytime I rewatch it.",

However, Rani Mukherjee as the law practitioner and defense lawyer fighting her first case against her own ideal is the heart of the film, and she does everything she can to be technical indore the court room and still anek space for some emotional heeft and melodrama that doesn't, for the first time, feel sappy.

            "content": "Veer Zaara is an epic love story set in the contemporary context of the continuing enmity between India and Pakistan. It stars three famous actors, Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukherjee, along with Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in supporting roles. The film begins with Veer in a jail cell in Lahore, known only as Prisoner 786. He has been in jail for 22 years and in the first half of the film we learn why. He fell in love with Zaara, a Pakistani woman, during a trip to India she made to immerse the ashes of her Sikh nanny. Veer followed Zaara back to Pakistan, but was arrested on a trumped-up charge of being a spy.\n\nThis is the film's framing, but most of it is a love story that talks about the power of true love. The songs are romantic and intense, showing the kind of love that overpowers the individual, almost like a haunting. It also shows the importance of thinking of community --here Punjabiness-- across national borders. The dialogue, the songs and the imagery are all invested in thinking about Punjabiness beyond the India-Pakistan boundary. As Saba Bhaumik writes, although war films are not very common in Bollywood, recent films especially during the Kargil War in 1999 tended to vilify Pakistan (Bhaumik, \"Politics of Indian War Films\"). Veer Zaara, along with Main Hoon Na, also released the same year, take a different path.\n\nThis is an epic romance similar to Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, which also shows a self-destructive love that overpowers the two lovers to such an extent that you wonder whether they can have a future. It is also similar to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, which also stars Shah Rukh Khan, and talks about the kind of love that is worth waiting for. DDLJ also has an idealized image of Punjab, but in that film, it is Baldev's nostalgia image of Punjab that actually leads him to make the wrong decision for his daughter, whereas here the image of a lush and fertile Punjab inspires the audience to think about the commonality between people on both side of the border.",

The story takes place in India and Pakistan, in the early 2000s. It's about a star-crossed love affair beetwen two opposite being. The movie tells the story of Zaara Hayaat Khan a Pakistani who comes to India to scatter the ashes of her childminder and Veer Pratap a pilot and officer in the Indian Air Force. One day Veer rescued Zaara and tooke her to her village where she met Veer's uncle and aunt who took care of the young lady. Veer found himself falling for Zaara. When she came back home, Zaara's family gave her hand in marriage to a verry importante but crual man, but she was already in love with Veer , she couldn't stop thinking about him so she decided to inform her parents about her feelings. Unfortunately they weren't able to understand her, with the help of her bestfriend, Zaara will see Veer, but it will end bad, Zaara get married and Veer winds up in jail. Zaara got divorced and went to Veer's village, she believed the love of her life was dead. After many years in jail Saamiya Siddiqui a young lawyer decided to take care of his case... The decors and costume set the viwers in a world full of magic, a colorfull and fasinating univer. The lightning game show to the viwers the intensity of the action: all the \"bad\" moments are almost dark  and the \"happy\" ones are lightnig. The colors and the musical aspect of the film and the fact that two opposite culture merge give to the viwers a desire to see more. The twist and emotion of the movie get the viewer swept away. In my opinion, i can't give any negative point, i love everythings from the begining to the very end. This Bollywood is a most see, one of the most beautiful romance movie i ever seen in my whole life!",

I'm going to be married in an arranged marriage, but I'm in love with someone else!\" The reason for its slightly lower score is the fact that it just goes way over the top with the teary melodrama, the preachy \"India should love Pakistan and vice-versa\" themes, and the heavy-handed \"women are equal\" themes.",

Great music! The plot is excellent and the writing was precise. Each actor brought their character to life in vivid detail. A fascinating film that uses a love story as a commentary on the relationship between India and Pakistan. Veer is an Indian prisoner in a Pakistani prison. However, a young female lawyer has decided to fight for his freedom and as she regularly visits him in his cell, he tells her the story of how he became a prisoner. It seems it all started because of his strange encounter with a Pakistani girl named Zaara twenty years before. The story is quite captivating and the characters engaging. The musical numbers are quite delightful and in a few instances quite inventive. It could be argued that the film is a bit on the predictable side but that's hardly a fault in the long run. Certainly worth a look. Veer-Zaara is so arresting, its scenes so full of beauty and colors, that the three hours go by almost too fast.  Though Chopra's film is emotionally extravagant even by the standards of India's epically unrestrained cinema, the star-crossed lovers bear the weighty metaphorical significance of their travails surprise. outstanding. loved it.",

            "content": "\"Veer-Zaara\" is an epic love story, one which transcends borders real and imagined, and the message that true, abiding love will eventually overcome all obstacles is powerfully presented here. The story begins in Lahore, Pakistan where an idealistic young female lawyer, Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherjee) seeks her late father's blessings (at his grave) as she prepares to take on her first human rights case, that involving the unjust long-term imprisonment of an Indian national, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan). Veer was accused over 20 years ago of being an Indian spy, Rathod, and was found guilty and imprisoned ever since.\n\nAs Saamiya eventually draws Veer out of his self-imposed silence, she learns about the love story that has inspired this silence - one which takes viewers via flashback to 22 years earlier. Viewers are introduced to a young Pakistani Muslim girl, Zaara (the ever gorgeous, dimpled Preity Zinta) , the only child of a wealthy and influential Pakistani politician, who agrees to take back the ashes of her Punjabi nanny, Bebe, back to Bebe's native Sikritpur in India. Although I did question the credibility of such an important man allowing his only precious daughter to make a solo journey across the border, well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief here.\n\nZaara does make the trip and along the way, the bus she's traveling on has an accident, and she is rescued by dashing Indian Air Force Pilot, Veer Pratap Singh (SRK). The pair hit it off immediately, and not only does Veer help Zaara fulfill her nanny's last wishes, but also persuades her to visit his native village for one day, so that they may experience the Lodi Festival together. At the village, Zaara meets Veer's uncle and aunt (whom he considers his parents), played by Bollywood icons, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini (who despite her years, always looks gorgeous and graceful). It is also here, that Veer realizes he has fallen deeply and irrevocably in love with Zaara. When he prepares to reveal his feelings to her as she is about to leave for Pakistan, Veer is introduced to Raza (Manoj Bajpai), Zaara's taciturn fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (chosen by her father to cement a political alliance with Raza's father). Veer is heartbroken but this does not stop him from revealing his love for Zaara, which leaves Zaara all confused.\n\nWell, back home in Pakistan, Zaara realizes that she too has fallen in love with Veer, and decides to elope with him. Veer goes to Pakistan to get her (after resigning his commission with the Air Force), but things go predictably awry and the pair are separated for more than 20 years. This is where Saamiya comes in , as she tries her best to prove that Veer was wrongfully imprisoned and to see justice meted out.\n\nThe songs are beautiful, and the cinematography conveys all the vibrant colors of the Indian countryside. The theme song is one that I fell in love with, and I plan on obtaining the soundtrack. Shah Rukh Khan plays his role flawlessly, there is no exaggeration here - and I particularly liked the final scene where Veer reads a heartrending poem he composed as he addresses the court. Preity Zinta is beautiful and delivers a credible performance as a woman torn between doing her duty to her family and listening to her heart, and the courage she displays in choosing her own destiny. This is one of the most beautiful love stories to come out of Bollywood in recent years, and I heartily recommend it.",

Her bus, which is traveling to India with her \"bebe's\" (a Punjabi word to denote mother or grandmother, but here used for Zaara's old governess) ashes. Before dying, \"Bebe\" (Zohra Sehgal) begs Zaara to fulfill her final wish - to take her ashes to India, to the holy Sikh city of Kiritpur, and scatter her ashes in the river there, among her ancestors. Zaara decides to carry out Bebe's dying wish.\n\nIn India, Zaara's bus gets into an accident, overturns, and she is saved by an Indian pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan). Zaara completes her Bebe's final rites with the help of Veer. He convinces Zaara to go back to his village with him, and spend one day together. Veer then takes Zaara on a tour of India's Punjab and they visit Veer's hometown during the Lodi festival. The two fall in love and Veer is just waiting for the right time to tell Zaara how he feels about her. But then it is revealed that Zaara is engaged to another man, Raza (Manoj Bajpai). During their last few moments together, Veer confesses his love, then watches sadly as Zaara boards the train that will take her back to Pakistan. Both believe that this is the end of the story, and the last time they will ever see each other.\n\nZaara eventually realizes that she loves Veer and cannot marry her fianc\u00e9; Veer, after being told over the phone by Zara's friend Shabbo, that how miserable Zara is without him, quits the Indian Air Force and goes to Pakistan to bring her back with him to India. Zaara's mother, however, begs him to leave Zaara. Zaara's father is a high-profile politician whose reputation will be ruined if news got out that his daughter is in love with a Hindu man. Veer respects this and decides to leave. But Zaara's fianc\u00e9, outraged by the shame Zaara has brought upon him, frames Veer and has him wrongly imprisoned for being an Indian spy.\n\n22 years later, Veer meets Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), who is an idealistic Pakistani lawyer, whose mission in life is to pave the path for women's empowerment. To dissuade a female lawyer from being successful, she has been given Veer's case, an impossible case to many. The man has been languishing in prison and has not spoken for the last 22 years.\n\nVeer tells Saamiya she can do anything for the case except mention, much less subpoena, Zaara's family. He's assigned the number 786 for his prisoner number. This convinces Saamiya that God has chosen Veer for some special purpose, and determined to exonerate him, and restore his name, identity and country.\n\nAfter a number of attempts which fail to prove Veer's innocence, Saamiya goes to Veer's village in India to gather evidence proving Veer is Veer and not Rajesh Rathore the spy. There, Saamiya finds Zaara has taken over in the village for Veer's parents. Saamiya convinces Zaara to go back to Pakistan with her and finally tell the truth about Veer's identity. The judge releases Veer from prison and apologizes on behalf of Pakistan. After Veer is finally released, he and Zaara return to India together, at last reunited.",

Like many other Bollywood productions, Veer-Zaara does veer (heh!) occasionally into melodrama, but these instances are forgiven in light of wonderful characters and a deep storyline that deals with India-Pakistan relations and even women's rights. Shahrukh Khan is at the top of his game as the dashing suitor Veer and Preity Zinta is her usual fetching self as Zaara (though she spends an awful lot of time on verge of or brimming over with tears). The real find though is Rani Mukherjee as an aspiring Pakistani lawyer, whose unflagging dedication to truth and justice is inspiring. Soundtrack nods: \"This is my land...\" (Zaara's journey to Veer's village), \"Two moments\" (Train station scene and the Mosque embrace).",

The movies feel like the cross of Spanish novelas and modern 50's musicals with advertisements, but somehow they work really well.  Maybe it's the unforgiving culture that they are laden with or maybe it's because it nice good clean entertainment.  I don't know.  This movie was nothing compared to Krrish but I enjoyed it anyway.  It's called an Epic Love Story, but I can't really see why...except for it's 3 hours long.  And in my book, anything over 3 hours is considered epic.  My vote: 6.",

Bollywood makes romantic films at a rate that would make Nora Ephron gush, but most of these films are trite entertainments that border on annoying. Such criticisms cannot be levelled at Veer-Zaara however, a film so tragic and romantic its the contemporary equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. Veer Pratap Singh, played by Shahrukh Khan, is a hero of such romantic idealism that the film would be unbelievable if not for the romantic hero identity that has come to be associated with SRK, and Preity Zinta builds on her chemistry with Khan from their earlier work together. Special mention must go to the score of the film, which used songs by Madan Mohan, a famed composer who had been dead for 29 years at the time the film was released. It gives the film a classic quality, and includes several compositions of haunting and exquisite beauty. Featuring a great supporting cast including Rani Mukherjee and surprise appearances by Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, Veer-Zaara is highly recommended.",

Preity Zinta seems to be so well suited to playing the spoilt child, and so was enjoyable as Zaara. Rani Mukherjee character was very underdeveloped, and I would never want her as my lawyer. She got him off not by great law skills, but by sheer coincidence. She deserves better roles then this, anyone who has seen Black would have to agree with this.",

However, it not only talks about love: it mentions and shows religious problems and political/cultural issues between Pakistan and India. Another never-ending topic that it shows is FEMINISM and GENDER EQUALITY. \r\nAs you can see: time, distance, barriers, intrigues, religion, and cultural disturbances were obstacles but not barriers to destroy true love. \r\nVeer was a man from India who languish in prison in Pakistan during more than 20 yrs for something he didn't even have to do with. However, he never forgot his only and truly love, Zaara (a girl from Pakistan, who\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Muslim). \r\nIn fact, Zaara's stupid ex-fiance planned all this thing of putting Veer in the jail because he was so pissed off and embarrased because Zaara didn't marry him instead, since she realized she was in love w/ Veer (and that stupid son of a gun was embarrassed due to the fact that he and some other people saw repulsive ''a Pakistan girl in love with Indian man'' and his honor and social position were in a spot... Zaara thought Veer was dead, lost or something but he wasn't! (sorry, I watched this movie in Hindi without any English, French or Spanish subtitles... so I interpreted as I could). \r\nSaamiya, Veer's lawyer has not only the mission of defending Veer and find missing Zaara: she has to shut other MEN's and male lawyer's mouths to show WOMEN EMPOWERMENT, and express the competence of women lawyers to vindicate the real power of truth, no matter if those assholes say \"this is a man's job!'' \r\nWhat a movie, what a touching movie. Two lovers who looked like granny and grandpa in their exterior, their souls looked at each other as if they were those great young and true lovers. \r\nAm I a chatterbox? watch this movie and tell me if I was right.",

However, a young female lawyer has decided to fight for his freedom and as she regularly visits him in his cell, he tells her the story of how he became a prisoner. It seems it all started because of his strange encounter with a Pakistani girl named Zaara twenty years before. The story is quite captivating and the characters engaging. The musical numbers are quite delightful and in a few instances quite inventive. It could be argued that the film is a bit on the predictable side but that's hardly a fault in the long run. Certainly worth a look.",

What 'Veer-Zaara' gives us is the heartfelt love-stories that Hollywood can no longer pull off and characters we genuinly care about, get to know well and root for. If you want a real love story, than look no further. If you want an epic musical, than 'Zaara' pulls out all the stops. It is quite simply a work of beauty.",
