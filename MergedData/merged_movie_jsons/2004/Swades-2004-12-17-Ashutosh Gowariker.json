            "content": "Ashutosh Gowariker, has really made this movie straight from the heart. It has none of the ridiculous clich\u00e9s one is typically used to seeing when one sees a story about an India returning home. He has captured something which perhaps no other Indian movie has - that love for ones country can be strong without making an excessively big deal about it.It is a long movie. But I think the rather leisurely pace of the movie is required because it gives enough time for the protagonist, Mohan Bhargava, to come to India (with his mineral water and caravan) and start to fall in love with its beauty as well as understand its incongruities which frustrate us all as well. I thought there were three moments in the movie that captured it all 1. The feeling he gets when he starts to land in India. All of us feel it. I do even today. It's called coming home. 2. The mineral water - that is a classic. In fact it is a character of its own throughout the movie and plays its own part! 2. The boy serving water at 25paise to the train passengers and Mohan Bhargava's reactionI am saddened that Indians both in India and around the world have not liked this movie. It will be remembered as an epic. 2.",

            "content": "30 minutes after I had viewed the film on Sat, I was not sure about how I felt about this film. 48 hours hence, I vividly remember most of the scenes and can lucidly state that is truly 'haunting'.Swades is not colorful; Shahrukh doesn't appear in a GAP or POLO SPORT; there are no introductory shots; there are no romantic scenes and no fields with yellow Tulip flowers; It may be a tad slow and lengthy; But Swades hits you where your heart hurts the most; patriotic and root feelings of an individual with good intentions overcoming societal obstacle. It's brilliant, heartfelt and touching. The 'We, People' film really makes us feel like it's our film. We see in the film what we see everyday, the places as they are. It's very much contemporary and it's our story.Compared to Veer-Zaara, it's light years ahead. Comparisons with Lagaan are bound to be there, but in some ways it's even better than Lagaan. Primarily, for the authenticity and real-life feel unlike Lagaan which was a finely crafted fairly-tale. Lagaan is all about emerging victorious and fighting against the odds. You enjoy it when you see it. Swades is about the conscience trauma of an Indian, urging him to comeback and do something for his country. It haunts you for long enough after the cinema has ended.There's a prejudice that the film is about bringing electricity to a small village. It's not. And the most poignant scene in the film, where we see a boy selling water for 25 paisa, hits you hard. Seeing the harsh reality and we'll find it difficult to suppress our tears. It's an answer to the generation of materialistic 'we', who never shy from proclaiming our great culture and tradition, but do nothing for our country.The asset of the film is Shahrukh Khan, looking ordinary and real but in an extra-ordinary performance. His most real since 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa' and his career's best. ARR music is soulful and original. The theme song 'Yeh Jo Des Hai Mera' haunts both in terms of its visuals and wordings.But above all, it's the good intention and the attention to detail, of director Ashutosh Gowarikar that makes wonders for this truly experimental and moving cinema.I can and will definitely view this movie once more, to celebrate it feel and spirit. I can't predict its box office outcome, as the masses love fantasies and escapist cinema. But it's definitely a treat for those who want to see moving and believable films on a large scale. Also if we don't embrace different cinema like this or even 'the torturous but different Musafir' for that matter, we'll continue to get more 'Sarson ka Saag', 'Karva Chauths', 'Maahi Ve' filled designer romance fables from the Chopra-Johar clan! Regardless of the box office outcome, take a bow Ashutosh, Shahrukh and ARR!",

            "content": "Mohan (Shah Rukh Khan) is a very successful engineer working for NASA in the States. His job is a very important one and he lives in a lovely apartment overlooking Washington, DC. But despite this, he's been plagued with dreams recently. He keeps thinking about his nanny that helped raise him and how guilty he feels because he left her back in India long ago. Now he's decided to head back to find her and bring her back with him to live in the States.His route turns out more complicated than he'd thought. While she had lived in a nice nursing home, some time ago, she left and she now apparently resides in a small village in remote northern India. So, Mohan travels there and soon finds her. But this is very early in the film...there are still about 2 1/2 hours to go! So what's next? See the film.This is a wonderful story, filled with some lovely acting, sweet writing and a lot of characters you can't help but like. I nearly scored this one a 10 and love the film's messages about working to make the world a better place versus working to make one small part of the world a better place. Well worth your time and among the best of SRK's films....which is saying quite a lot!By the way, imagine this American's surprise when it turned out quite a bit of this Indian film was filmed near where I grew up. Much of the film is set at Goddard Space Flight Center in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC. However, it's also confusing because often scenes switch between there and Cape Canaveral...which are about 900 miles apart! And, if you visit Goddard Space Flight Center, there is a decent Indian restaurant nearby...in case you're interested.",

            "review_title": "nothing short of a standing ovation ! A marvellous Indian cinematic experience ...",
            "content": "Action, Thrillers, Drama, Romance, Comedy, \"Crossovers\", \"Art Cinema\" & finally Bollywood cinema. Nothing comes closer to the feeling of watching a good cinema these days & ironic is the fact that seldom there is a genre created for \"Good Cinema\".Here comes Swades - Ashutosh Gowariker, post Lagaan,. with an optimism unparalleled with his vision & passion., always aiming at the roots oftraditional movie making. This time, he brings home one of the most humble yet convincing attempts in Indian cinema., with a script just short of a patriotic saga, characters reflecting India TODAY. Set in modern day India but taking a village backdrop, Swades is a film that tackles the issues that every educated upper class, specially the NRIs face today - a sense of belonging, Patriotism & having a realistic image of our country. Depicting through a NASA scientist (NRI) & taken the journey through the annals of an Indian village, a quest for finding his childhood nanny becomes an infinite journey that perhaps everyone of us go through metamorphically ...in finding an Indian amongst us.Mohan, (SRK) a successful NRI working in Nasa, realises the bitter truth of loneliness, often seen in today's growing spearation of Indians abroad. He wants to go home, nostalgic in search of his missing childhood & all he can remember last is, he is ashamed of losing contact with his nanny, who he holds with great reverence. (Parents die in an accident when he's young & his nanny has always taken good care of him). In a quest to find her & bring her back to US.,Mohan sets to Delhi in great pursuit & in the interim traces her residence in a distant UP town. What follows later is a series of interestingly woven characters that slowly builds upon a template for the fictional yet realistic characters of this village. The postmaster, a dhaba cook who dreams of opening a \"highway dhaba\" in US., the playful innocent kids., the beautiful urban educated girl (Gita)., now taking care of his nanny, who has given up everything to teach the children of the village & transform her ideals, the panchayat goons & rajas., the 'weather forecaster', the uneducated rest & of course, the wise nanny.The next few reels bring us close to humanitarian essentials, questioning the very existence of the Panchayat System in the village, debating the needs of an education System, need for working in unision., & the utter poverty, cultural (dis)beliefs of people. Whats so convincing in this script is how the songs are used as an instrinsic part of the storytelling. Never before I have seen a Hindi movie wherein if songs were removed the movie is annulled !! Yet another reason how visionary ar rahman can be when it comes to sharing the intellect of his directors, not to mention the first class lyrics by javed akhtar. Some of the background tracks are an absolute delight (the funky starting sequence, the funny dhoti scene, the slow moving boat scene, train scene are some of the elements which cannot be fathomed by any other music director in India (or perhaps in the world).100 minutes pass by & here comes the intermission. The audience stays in silence., no word comes from anybody, see each others faces & probably are asking themselves - \"Damn its been more than one & half hour & I just didn't realised it!!!\" -Just one more reason which convinces you, \"Good scripts never tell you how long they are ... coz you're IN it!\"Now., Mohan is trying to convince his nanny to come to US & its already getting late as his leave period is getting over. In the interim there's a subtle but very interesting chemistry between Mohan & Gita building up. Not to worry.., this is not those typical filmi kinda romances but shot in subtle nice sequences. Another note which can goto all the Directors, Music Video Directors - You don't need a woman to sport a bikini to look good.., neither you need Aishwairya Rai or Yana Gupta to champion the cause of an \"Item No\". The very meaning of beauty lies in our own traditional Saree & you will only realise when you see Gita's character & visuals in this movie. PERFECT.The Plot thickens & now we see the transformation is not only in the villager's to start believing in Mohan's ideals ., in supporting his ideas... but the audience which by now is beginning to be ashamed of .... what we always have taken into granted - Our Patriotism. For instance, the scene where Mohan goes to a local crowded train. Sees a boy selling water for 25p on the pavement & for the first time drinks water in India (Mohan keeps a stack of mineral water at his dispose) is is crafted brilliantly. (not to forget the background score again). There are more than one reasons why this movie is perhaps different from other \"patriotic\" movies., coz it doesn't try to TEACH you anything. The subtlety, the ironic truth & the bitter, realistic characters makes it all so very close to humanity - you don't need Shah Rukh Khan to tell you this. You will feel it shamelessly.Few more days stay & now Mohan is beginning to question the very reason why he has come here, he begins to realise that what is happening is not correct & its a shame that he has not done anything so far to make a transformation.Will Mohan finally take his nanny/Geeta to US? Does he make any attempt to make a transformation in the village? Well., whats the message the Director wants to convey ..These are somethings I want YOU to see & appreciate. The brilliant dialogues of \"India Vs US\" ., \"Parampara & culture .. \" is just an eye opener to all of us who only tend to take things into granted.,The performances - I don't quite agree with most people when they say SRK steals the show all the way., I feel Ashutosh steals the show given that he has produced, directed, written & done screenplay for this. Also go due credits to ar rahman, akhtar & all the characters in the film. Mohan's role is author backed & could have possibly been done by Amir, Ajay Devgan or even Anil Kapoor with equal if not a better flair.But yes, whats convincing is that Ashotosh ropes in SRK for this & gets ... what probably is the most honest, *natural* SRK performance ever. For the first time I've seen SRK making a successful attempt to be as convincing as Amir or Kamal Hassan & I would say for once., A star has become an ACTOR! Yes SRK is definitely different in this film & I'm glad !!! I hope he makes more such films to prove that he is definitely a better actor.Breaking quite a few clich\u00e9s of a \"run of the mill\" bollywood flick, this 3 hour tale raises a few embarrassing questions., which I'm sure every viewer will beg to ask in the transition ..Why are'nt such movies never made in India?How come Shah Rukh has acted so convincingly in a role contrast to his traditional romantic flick?Am I the only one questioning my patriotism right now ?? (well ... err let me see ...)We blame the Bollywood not knowing that we are a part of encouraging it's cinema ... we only crib about how bad movies are made & we make movies like K3G all time biggest hits. In a country where creativity is the last word in Bollywood, I salute the humblest & honest filmmaker of all - Mr Ashutosh Gowariker to have made this movie cutting all the clich\u00e9s'A GREAT FILM MAKER is born ... LETS CELEBRATE.",

The experiences that the protagonist goes through and the journey the audience takes with him is a must see for any connoisseur of classic Indian cinema.I would rate Swades as Ashutosh Gowarikar's best work. And definitely SRK's best performance till date. If I look back and see. The movie had a great story. Screenplay that was brilliant. Ashutosh's direction was perfect. And SRK definitely stood tall in a restrained yet poignant portrayal of Mohan Bhargava. His best performance till date, yet underrated. Kishori Ballal remains etched in your memory as Kaveri amma. Gayatri Joshi is perfectly cast. Sadly she didn't appear in any movie after Swades, atleast nothing notable. An untapped potential. All other actors leave a mark.Why did it underperform at BO? It came out in 2004. 3 years after the magnum opus Lagaan. There were bound to be comparisons. Both stories had the underlying love for motherland as theme. But were completely in stark contrast in their content.\nLagaan, set in British era, was more of a fight about the protagonist and his village's honor. It had a bad guy, his evil intentions and then protagonist and his ideals. A classic underdog story. David vs Goliath. And we love those stories for sure :)\nSwades on the other hand was more about an individual discovering his roots. His inner journey and conflicts. His choice of leaving a comfortable and cozy life to be with his people. It's a simple story minus the melodrama. But so effectively told that it just wins you over.\nI think it was the expectations that audience had from Swades that made it underperform.\nPlease do not miss this gem of a movie",

It could have been a tad shorter, crisper editing would have helped. BO-wise it is a risky movie - unapologetic in its depiction of poverty and almost childlike in its appeal to NRIs and India's middle class to acknowledge poverty and try to do something about it. Gowarikar's heart is in the right place - the shots with the family unable to pay land rents, and the waterboy were graceful and poignant. My hunch is that regardless of BO fate, this is an important movie and will be referred to for year to come.",

Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lamblasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and celebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.The maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope.",

A constant diet of guns, explosions and emotional violence certainly doesn't model well as a reflection of the nation, does it? It is refreshing to find a beautifully acted story of a man who feels the magnetic pull of the homeland and struggles with giving up all his hard-earned wealth and glory to commit himself to others--what a novel idea! Name a major recent film that suggests such a thing! Very real third-world problems are graphically delineated, but as in other Bollywood films, there is always time for song and dance, and it's fun to take a break.I do not claim greatness for this film, but I was highly entertained every minute and admired the craft it took to marry the music, images and story. We used to make films about heroes and creators and except for the recent Lincoln, they remain far and few. Swades reminds me a good deal of Frank Capra films from the 1930's, but with more color, and certainly a good deal more dance.",

Swades by far has touched me the most, as it not only combines that happy musical abandonment I have come to enjoy about India films, but this one reaches a new level. Swades manages to include the new aspects of India culture, becoming educated and proving abilities (NASA, no less), but superimposing how parts of India don't even have electricity yet.It makes me appreciate my lifestyle here in America, yet the culture and traditions that India possesses is something to be a bit wishful for. As the actor playing Mohan said in the movie, America does have its own culture--somehow it doesn't run as deep as what I viewed in the movie.Enlightening, edifying, and definitely educational. I look forward to sampling more thought-provoking films from India.",

Melody based tunes along the lines of Bombay or Dil Se.Cinematography: Could have been much better.The movie is all about its theme. And its highly reflective of the kind of person you are, or life you have led.

However, it has to be said that AR Rehman's background score especially during the scenes when Shahrukh Khan travels by train and boat is nothing short of brilliant.The movie also fell a little short in that it failed to address all the ideas about India that it raised.

Director Ashutosh G has succeeded in making me feeling completely rejuvenated. There are so many magical moments in the movie,to pin them down would be fruitless. It goes to show what conviction, effort and the power of imagination can accomplish when they all come together in such wonderful fashion. The movie has all my favorite elements- simple clean humor, realism, a blend of old and new values,some truly good old fashioned romance and idealism. I was swept away by the lyrical quality to the film. There were many scenes that stood out. The scene where Mohan and Gita meet for the first time was refreshing and witty.The scene where Mohan entertains the village-folk with the powers of his imagination when the movie projector breaks down....the train scene where Mohan witnesses the hardships faced by rural folk up close... It would be a travesty to think that anyone but SRK was born to play Mohan Bhargava. I've never been a SRK fan,given his penchant for safe roles and scripts.But this movie has changed all that for me. I have a new found respect for his talent. Maybe he will go back to playing inane lover boy roles in the future but for me, he will forever be NASA project manager turned rural crusader Mohan Bhargava. His honest,restrained and utterly convincing portrayal of a successful NRI works,and how! This movie reminded me of a lot of things I had forgotten or pushed into the back of my mind. Indian values.Ethics.The unadulterated and intoxicating joy of pure love.Respect for one's elders and nation. I rarely am moved by any recent Hindi movie. To my chagrin, I even got emotional at certain junctures of the film. I'm sure many of you felt the same way,especially those of us living outside the country. I understand that it's quite possible that's its impact is much more since I'm living abroad, but there's no taking away from the fact that this piece of cinema will be remembered and hailed as a classic work....even a few decades down the line. I salute the makers, crew and other technicians who created this movie. We need more cinema like this. It is relevant, entertaining and has a poignant message. Never, ever forget your roots. This movie made me feel proud to be an Indian and what we, as a people,stand for.",

I have not seen any movie by Shahrukh Khan after 96-97 (apart from Main Hoon Naa, which is another Decent Movie), but I must say only he could have played the role of Mohan in this movie. Just like the next-door guy, he wins everyone's hearts. Gayatri Joshi is simply breathtaking and enthralling and someone who looked simple yet beautiful in the movie (Waheeda Rahman is another one). Director Ashutosh, who started out with SRK in late 80s in the TV show Circus and also starred with him in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa, has once again proved that one does not need skin show and gore in a movie to excel. Some of the actors, he has repeated from Lagaan, namely the Postmaster, who is outstanding in his cameo. The guy from Gangaajal was great too.In the end, this movie will mean very much more to Indians settled outside of India, which may be one of the reasons, it didn't do that well like other commercial movies in India, besides winning laurels. A must see for everyone who liked decent movies. Music was simply beautiful. Too bad the BEST song \"Aahista Aahista\" was not even featured in the MOVIE. I think this is the only point missed by the director.There is not much room for Romance between SRK and Gayatri, however, all little moments are simply beautiful and do wonders. GO SEE IT if you haven't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

There are no corrupt politicians but rather heads of the village, with real issues and real ego; but still clearly human; the real people. There are no events for shock values but still the storyline is gripping. Perhaps it is not for teens and young people in twenties, who would rather be in a dream world idolizing a person with super powers. The movie is as realistic as any of my Desi colleagues I meet everyday at work here away from my Swades. Such a simple story but so well presented. After having to watch stupid Hindi TV soaps every evening where women are either screaming or slapping each other and less said about the male roles the better, it was a real nice change to spend yesterday evening watching this beautiful movie with the whole family. I really like movies that leave me in a happy state of mind. This was definitely the one; a rare one; a jewel.",

Since that day my love for this movie is out of bounds, and still going strong.Believe i am not a fan of Mr.Shahrukh Khan, but after this movie i really fell in love the way he enacted the play. I never missed the release of this movie and watched it the first day.The Aftermath ,9 years later, today, i have completed my medicine degree,this movie made me change my mind to stay with my home place, My beloved parents, friends and everyone in my village. I wanted to pursue my masters in US but i am now a changed mind with pursuing the degree in here in my home land , India.Thanks Mr. Ashutosh for creating this epic master piece. I would be grateful for the rest of my life for this movie you have crafted.The characters simply have life and they are close to hearts, be it Mohan \"NRI\" Bhargava or \"Gitli\" Geeta or the Post Man \"Nivaranji\" who admires the Email as something out of the world invention, the American dream pursuing \"MelaRam\". Every one is astounding in performance, that makes this movie a special one that you would never want to forget for the rest of your life.For all my NRI cousins and friends, do watch this movie and come back buddies, there is more to pursue in here. regards",

            "content": "With a name like swades, which seems a little contrived and dated, I didn't think I would like the movie. I may be wrong but maybe it was the name which scared audience away because they thought that they would be getting a boring and a very obvious lecture on nationalism. Also there is a general misconception that this movie is preachy. Now, I agree that maybe couple of scenes like 'bhai sahib kitabon ki izzat karna seekhiye' could have been avoided but I don't think that this movie tries to preach anything. Lecture on nationalism, I think not, so much so that in one scene the protagonist Mohan Bhargava tells the villagers in plain words that he doesn't believe that India is the greatest nation in the world, it has the potential of being the greatest nation but it is not. Lastly, people think that this movie tries to propagate that NRIs should leave their jobs and return to India. Although this movie is inspired by the story of Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi who returned to India to work on micro-hydel project in Bilgaon but I don't think this movie tries to do that.What this movie really does is that it shows a mirror to our generation of NRIs and IT consultants who are so caught up in this money making race that they have forgotten how to be a human and feel other's pain. Don't we belong to a generation who just doesn't care about anything else apart from how many cents I will save on Gas if I get this particular credit card? It takes a catastrophe like an earthquake or a tsunami to make us reach for our wallets and that too because it is in our face shown live on our cable TV these days. And then is it not the easiest thing to do; 'sending money'? If to tell you the truth is preachy then this movie is preachy and you can find one million reasons to avoid watching it. After all, who wants to face the truth? The much talked about train sequence is the climax of the movie and probably one of the best scenes that I have seen. Think about it, there is nothing out of the ordinary that is being shown on the screen. You see small kids selling water or shoe shine everyday on railway platforms or streets without giving any thought. And that is the point. The scene hits you really hard and for that moment you are face to face with the truth in all its ugliness. I still get goose bumps just by thinking about it and that's how powerful that scene is.Performance wise Shahrukh has excelled and is absolutely the opposite of what you see him in other movies, new girl Gayatri Joshi is good and has done her job well except for, well, the parting scene with Shahrukh in which she spoils everything that she has earned during the whole movie. Rest of the cast is competent and supports the movie well. Songs are unnecessary and could have been completely avoided which also would have shortened the movie to a desirable length.Direction wise, Ashutosh has what it takes to be a good director but what this movie suffers from is the inconsistency in the style. If you are making a movie with a realistic style, I won't expect a NASA Engineer to interrupt a village Ram Leela with a song of his own. And I agree that this sequence is preachy.It is sad that this movie wasn't commercially successful and Shahrukh was ignored for the National award but who else can be blamed for this but Shahrukh himself. Diligently and consistently he has destroyed his own image as a serious actor and now no matter how well he performs, nobody takes him seriously. I guess it will take him more movies like this and 'Paheli' to help him build a new image and shed the old one that is doing him more harm than good.Arguably a very good movie but without a doubt one of the most important movies of our times.",

Swades tackles tons of issues in those 3 and a half hours. More importantly, Swades does not bore and keeps the viewers interested in the going-ons (Most of the time). It seems like the viewer is with the protagonist during his journey.Mohan is a successful scientist working for NASA in America. He has completed the first phase of a big project he has been working on for NASA. However, there has been something bothering him the past few months. He feels he has abandoned his nanny back in India and wants to bring her back. From then starts Mohan's journey, or awakening one can call it...One viewing of Swades is not enough, in my opinion. The film is too poetic and full of symbolism. There are so many things to note in the movie. SRK's water bottle with him all the time. Him finally drinking water. The whole scene with the movie being screened. A lot of symbolism in the movie which some hard-hitting statements being made. the film tackles issues such as poverty, electricity, government regulations, traditions and various things affecting India. The scene when the villagers compare U.S. and India is surely to raise eye-brows.The film is a tad bit too long, and that is one of the few flaws in it. Honestly, I don't have any other problem with that.Music plays a great part in the movie. The songs come at the right time and are brilliant. Lyrics are amazing by Javed Akhter. Technical aspects are first rate! The dialouges are fresh and move you. The story, screenplay is excellent.Ashutoush Gowariker directs the movie with utter brilliance. It takes guts to make a movie like that and he deserves full marks for direction.The characters in the movie all act terrifically. Gayatri makes a good debut.Swades is carried on the shoulders of Shah Rukh Khan and he gives a performance that leaves you spellbound, speechless, just amazed! It's an act that only superb actors like SRK can pull off. Note the scene when the child is selling water by the train - Wow! His character change, his realization - a convincing act all the way.Overall, one has to give it up to 4 people. A.R Rahman, Ronnie Screwala, Shah Rukh Khan and of course, Ashutoush Gowariker.

Shah Rukh Khan stars as the young Indian scientist. The story deals with how this talented young man unexpectedly grows attached to his homeland, becomes concerned about the troubles of the village and also falls in love with a girl from his childhood days.While Lagaan from Gowariker was massive in scale and scope, Swades is markedly humble. However, the contrast ends there as there is little to choose between the two as both are thoroughly enjoyable, heart-warming and beautiful films.The tale unfolds slowly in Swades, and before the viewer is aware, he too is wrapped in the world of the villagers with hearts of gold \u2013 some ambitious and others proud. Shah Rukh Khan in one of his most remarkable performances delivers a restrained act as the Prodigal Son who is torn between his present perfect life and his roots and past.The music is beautiful and features multiple soothing numbers while boasting of a rich variety.

Science has been blended into a Bollywood movie in the most magnificent way I've ever seen! As an Engineer myself, it was refreshing to see a Bollywood movie explain Science to the masses in a brilliant way! Way to GOwarikar! There was a new face, Gayathri Joshi. Frankly, I was not too pleased with her looks or performance. When I think Gowarikar and I think village belle, the face that flashes in front of my eyes is of course that of Gauri in Lagaan! Albeit, this girl is modern and educated, there are many faces I could fathom, that could have added a greater Jamba boost to this role.Noticeable: Shahrukh has done a great job, which seems amplified after the clich\u00e9'd role and his signature performance in Veer Zaara, which left me wondering whether this guy had a future in my TV screen, but he does! SRK or this film will probably not have the impact that Aamir and Lagaan did, but this movie was a good follow-up by the director. The king Khan has done total justice to his role. AR Rahman has once again delivered when it comes to a Gowarikar movie. Except for the \"Baaba Kich Kich taa\" repeat in a song and the background music, the other songs were really well executed. \"Yeh Taara Woh Taara\" was particularly good and reminds us a little bit of \"Mitwaa\" from Lagaan. The dussera song was also good and reminds you of \"Raadha kyon na Jale\". Thank god, there was nothing in parallel to \"O paalan hare\".. looks like the director has taken feedback from Lagaan! I am not getting conclusive about a pattern in here, but Gowarikar in his first two movies has exploited the thrill value very well. The thrill that the audience gets out of the electric meter is great, but no where near when Kachara gets his wickets or Bhuvan hits the winning shot! That's the problem any director has to face by delivering a marvel in his first attempt! But this one has met expectations really well! Verdict: This movie is superb! Definitely worth seeing once! Having lived in a village for 4 days, I can tell that the sequences are so natural! The characters like the \"Bijili paati\", Kaaveri Amma, the weaver turned farmer, Dadaji, the cook who has done some good comedy, etc. are likely to stay in your mind several days after you have watched the movie. This is the beauty of Gowarikar's movies that attach so much significance to the so-called \"lesser important\" characters! How can you forget Kachara, Ismail or Guran from Lagaan? The movie is a little drawn out and a little bit on the preaching side, but you've gotta watch it for ARR, SRK and Ashutosh if not anyone else!",

Sure it is not glamorized but it delivers, excellent story telling skills.It is bound to touch your heart, and definitely relate able for the NRI's who think about going to India.The icing on the cake is not only the wonderful performances by the support cast, but the natural and non preachy characterizations of the entire cast.Shah rukh is likable, even with his usual and lovable antics, he is more serious, and clearly dominates the proceedings.Rahman's music is a big plus, with Yunhi Chala and Yeh Jo Des hai being the pick.

            "content": "I never had a liking for Shah Rukh Khan.REASONS :- 1. His movies have no substance & are total waste of time. 2. You even know what his next movie going to be like by just watching its first look. 3. He has a total of five facial expressions (I have personally counted them all in totality). 4. His voice is somewhat like a malnourished goat bleating for grass.5. He has an irritating dance step (SRK fans know of it). Those who haven't watched it haven't missed much- you will see it time & again in his upcoming releases & award shows. 6. He thinks his audience is stupid (which might be true) & buys whatever he sells (he is the best SALESMAN from India currently selling products ranging from Navratana tel to Tag Heuer watches, only Salman gives him a run for his money who himself has got the most pathetic blockbusters of all time added to his name).The fact is that its only his fans who make his movies work which is of course huge. Here is a approximate estimate of his fans:-(i)Indian Popuolation across the world which roughly makes 1/4th of the total world. 1/3rd of which are SRK fans(who haven't seen anything but SRK's movies) which makes roughly 1/12 th of the population of the world.(ii)Now he also has a huge fan following in gulf(he marketed well there) & some in South East Asia (he marketed well there too). The two of the fan-bases mentioned in this point will add up & make approximately 1/12th of the world's population as well, considering the Asian population.Adding (i) & (ii), we get that almost 1/6th of the world's population likes SRK, my ex-girlfriend included. Others who have seen the likes of Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Al Pachino, Dustin Hoffman, De Niro, Dicaprio etc differ from the general opinion.7. The most important of them all is my admiration for Aamir who has made bollywood movies worth watching. If SRK considers himself KING, then Aamir would probably be the ACE(but only in bollywood).There are many more reasons, which I may describe in my next review (only if I find any other of his movie worth reviewing).Stated briefly, I always have thought of him as a mediocre actor with DDLJ in his pool of movies.But this movie proves otherwise. Maybe now, I do believe that he possesses acting skills (Chak De!, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa are other two of his better roles). Still I would say he chooses his movies without putting his brain much.Btw, here's some trivia for SRK fans- he imitated(copied as it is) Dustin Hoffman from \"Rain Man\" for his role in MNIK & the story was inspired(again rather copied) from \"Forrest Gump\". Adding to the previous one, Chak De was inspired from \"Miracle\" & his inspiration for this role was Denzel Washington from \"Remember the Titans\". Even DDLJ & Bazigar were inspired from \"The Sure Thing\" & \"A Kiss Before Dying\". Not worth a mention but Mohabbatein also was a disgraceful adaptation of \"Dead Poets Society\". Boy, he sure does copy a lot.Enough of pep talk for SRK haters, now let's proceed with the review for the movie straight from the heart of Ashutosh Gowarikar. Kudos to the man for making such a brave movie. It was a risk which unfortunately didn't accomplish a any feat on the box office in India but this would possibly be the only movie(that I have seen) which captures the true feel of rural India. He has thrown light on almost every possible issue- Poverty, caste system, corruption, illiteracy, growing population - I mean everything. He's one of the few directors in India who puts a lot of research in his movies before direction.Concept:- The problems at the grass-root level are the ones which hamper a country's growth which is a simple one but the solution to them is rather complex. God, the movie is thought-provoking/inspiring. This is a real noble effort from the director & I admire him for giving us this MASTERPIECE- I don't really use this term for many movies.Shah Rukh is fabulous (I hate to say that but someday I will definitely find out from where did he copy this character) & is well complimented by Gayatri Joshi (where is she gone??? Does anyone know?? I want to see more of her). The chemistry between the two is amazing. All other characters are very realistic, script & screenplay is brilliant. The music from AR Rehman is plain but awesome. The movie has some favourite lines \"Apne hi paani mein pighal jana barf ka muqaddar hove hai\"-It's the destiny of the ice to melt in its own water. All in all this is one movie from SRK that justifies his stardom among all the crap he has offered us over the years.A must watch for SRK fans & SRK haters as well.This one touched my soul.",

This is the story of Mohan, a NRI, top scientist who works for NASA and who is feeling homesick. He is longing for his native India, so... he goes back on a trip. And he takes us along. That gives us an opportunity to visit India( or part of it);to appreciate the beautiful sceneries and to meet very charming and friendly villagers: The People! Mohan is played by the handsome Shah Rukh Khan, funny, witty and adorable as always.The rest of the cast is awesome. The songs are very catchy and well acted as often in Bollywood. Although they are in Hindi, they stay in you very easily. I am sure that this movie will appeal to all the NRIs who have left India, but also to all the viewers who enjoy Bollywood cinema.

But even fewer movies stay within the confines of this oft-repeated formula, and manage to get the formula right. Swades is one such film. The much-anticipated follow-up to Ashutosh Gowariker's award-sweeping success Lagaan, Swades is a more low-key, rustic affair. Starring the ubiquitous Shah Rukh Khan in what is arguably his most nuanced performance to date, Swades tells the simple story of a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) who embarks on a journey to India's heartland with the sole purpose of bringing back his effervescent nanny to the US. What starts out as a simple mission turns into an eye-opening exploration of the meaning of being an Indian. What separates Swades from other passionately patriotic films (i.e. Rang de Basanti) is its ability to avoid grandiose political statements. Instead, the film's charms are simple... the plight of a small village without basic electricity, a young boy selling water for pennies, a villager with two daughters and no reason to educate them. And who can forget SRK's impassioned speech at the town hall gathering, where he decries India's blind affection for its divisive culture? At the end of the film, you're left with an exhilarating feeling of hope - a hope that comes from making deceptively simple decisions. And the message is clear for every single Indian who once called the subcontinent his home. Go light your bulb!",

            "content": "It's a bane of any director who makes a really good movie early on in his career that each of his subsequent creations are fated to be compared with the famous one, and Ashutosh Gowariker did have a tough act to follow. But let's talk of Swades without the shadow of Lagaan looming over it. And boy does it impress! The first plus point of Swades is that Shah Rukh Khan acts. He actually appears happy here that he has managed to bag one rare movie where the director has made some use of his acting skills. There are just two-three short instances where he returns to his typical habit of making funny faces, and that's pretty tolerable. Otherwise he does a really good job of the role. I hope he gets a Filmfare for this, not for Veer Zaara.Gayatri Joshi is good too. Better than Gracy Singh. Sorry, we were not supposed to have comparisons. Her dialogue delivery is awkward at places, but otherwise a really nice job in a first movie. Of course having a strong role helped.The rest of the actors put up a very competent show too. The lady who plays Shah Rukh's nanny (who I later came to know is named Kishori Balal) keeps away from the typical melodrama seen so often in our movies. In fact there's very little 'filmi' in the movie. Things are very realistic, not exactly real-life, but closer to it. Gowariker makes full use of NASA and we probably have the first rocket-launch in a Hindi movie here. The children are not the obnoxious kind that we typically see in present-day Hindi movies. The village is very authentic. Compare it with Karan Johar's glossy Chandni Chowk in K3G. The situations and people's reactions in those situations are authentic. The songs gel in very nicely with the story and you enjoy them thoroughly. The title-song which is the last song in the movie could be a tear-jerker for NRIs, quite like Chitthi aayi hai from Naam in the 80s. The story (and for a rare occasion in recent Hindi movies we do have one here) is good. The movie has a proper flow, and I don't know if there's a technical term for it. So technically and screenplay-wise Swades is very good. One more point to Ashutosh Gowariker.But Swades is not perfect. Far from it actually. One obvious flaw is that the sermonizing gets to you after a point. The movie is close to three-and-a-half hours long and you feel it. And despite having its heart in the right place, the movie starts working against the message it is trying to convey if people get so bored that they start leaving the hall. In fact the songs are so good that at times you wish that a song would come by to relieve you of the rubbing in that the audience is being subjected to. And that is why I feel it's very difficult for this movie to be a big hit. But I would love to be proved wrong. It's the kind of movie that Gowariker couldn't have made with a big star in the lead or couldn't have sold to distributors if he didn't have Lagaan on his resume. There are some other issues like run-of-the-mill cinematography but I think they aren't really important here. What we have here is competent enough.On the whole I would say that the plus points far outweigh the negatives. It's no classic (and I consider Lagaan a classic) but probably the best Hindi movie that we've had this year. I say probably only because I am not in the mood to recall the names of other movies released this year. So please go and see the movie, and if possible in a hall. Movies like these should do well. Movies like these should be tax-free. Movies like these should be made more often.",

            "content": "We, The People It is safe to say, place your bet on it, Ashutosh Gowariker has forever exorcised the ghosts of his terrible 'Pehla Nasha', 'Izzat Ki Roti' and 'Baazi'. If anybody had any doubt that 'Lagaan' was simply the result of Aamir Khan's input, then all one has to do is go see 'Swades'- Gowariker's latest offering.As one Indian critic pointed out, 'Swades' is actually a sequel in spirit to 'Lagaan'. Both movies are distinctly about the indomitable spirit of the everyday Indian. And both films are about the triumph of that spirit.It would've taken a gargantuan effort, and nearly an impossible one, to live up to the success(critical and commercial) of 'Lagaan'. And Gowariker cleverly avoids just that. Here is a director who knows his strengths and uses them to his film's advantage. His attention to detail was evident in 'Lagaan', but with 'Swades' he reinforces it in a big way. Every frame of the film is a tribute to the camera whether it is the mineral-water sipping Khan, the wet sarees laid to dry-out, the crowded second-class compartment of a passenger train, triple-seat scooter-ride, a mystic sage atop a caravan or choppers flying in the sky with the NASA headquarters in the background. Gowariker's style of cinema harks back to the days of Bimal Roy. Plus, he possesses the finesse of David Lean.'Swades' takes a larger issue than 'Lagaan' and deals with it in the same simplistic manner that made the former so appealing. 'Lagaan' was about an Indian's conviction in himself and the manner in which his will spread contagiously through an entire village. It was a clever retelling of India's freedom struggle, albeit with cricket as a metaphor. 'Swades' is again about an Indian. This time around though, the Indian is free and not under the shackles of the English. But this Indian is far removed from the India left behind by 'Lagaan's Bhuvan! At the end of 'Lagaan', the voice-over mentioned that somewhere in the annals of our history, the story of Bhuvan was lost. In 'Swades', that Bhuvan is India- an India that has been forgotten and neglected by its own son.'Swades' then is about Mohan Bhargava(Shahrukh Khan), a project manager at NASA, working on a Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM) programme. Mohan decides to go to India and bring Kaveri amma(Kishori Ballal), who took care of him as a child, to the United States and more importantly to a life of comfort. Upon reaching India, he understands that Kaveri amma has made Charampur, a remote little village in Uttar Pradesh, as her home. Here she helps making the children of the village literate individuals with the aid of Geeta(Gayatri Joshi), a teacher and later Mohan's love interest. 'Swades' is a journey of Mohan's transformation from a detached Indian(there is a scene where he refers to his fellow-countrymen as 'you Indians'!), sipping on mineral-water and preferring to sleep in his comfy air-conditioned caravan than a rustic wooden cot, into an individual who is made painfully aware of his country's pathetic state of plight that is in stark contrast to his luxurious life. And we, as audiences- resident Indians or otherwise but equally detached, become a part of this conversion too. In fact, there is a very poignant moment in the film that takes place at a desolate railway-station that arouses such mixed emotions of pain, disgust, guilt and ultimately resolve that it is impossible to control your tears and not feel a block of ache tearing its way down your throat. It is then that you realize that the movie, with this scene, is no longer just cinema. It has transcended into something even greater and important. There won't be a moment like this in cinema for a long time, rest assured.'Swades' is a cleverly written(Gowariker, M.G. Sathya and K.P. Saxena) movie. What is essentially a preachy, documentary fodder has been packaged with grand aplomb into an entertaining film-script. Much of the film's success owes to its ingenuous characters- be it the US aspiring cook, the postman-cum-postmaster or the cute little kid. Shahrukh Khan pushes all the right buttons in a performance that is worthy of a standing ovation. Here is an actor who has immense talent but has lost himself in the m\u00eal\u00e9e of stupid, commercial Bollywood. 'Swades' gives him a role that he can not only chew into but live as well. Mohan Bhargava is not Shahrukh Khan, and thank God for that. Shahrukh Khan is Mohan Bhargava! Gayatri Joshi exudes confidence, in spite of being a newcomer and pitted opposite the King Khan in a movie directed by an Oscar entrant! But it is Kishori Ballal as Kaveri amma that endears the most. 'Swades' is also as much an achievement of Mahesh Aney. It is his cinematography that breathes India into the reels.Mind you, this is not a popcorn-flick. It requires patience and probably reflection too. But the rewards are very satisfying.Rating- ***** Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent",

            "content": "I'm beginning to learn that it's not unusual for Indian movies to approach and even surpass three hours in length. The surprising thing about \"Swades\" for me was that the story began in the United States, and then transitioned to the small Indian village of Charanpur by way of the principal character, Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), having a desire to reconnect with the nanny who raised him. Mohan has an awakening I guess one would say, as he observes the poverty in his travels through the countryside, and an unwillingness of most of it's citizens to challenge a caste system that keeps everyone within their own social class. I don't know if this was a bold statement for director Ashutosh Gowariker to make, especially in the way he contrasted the way of life in India with Mohan's description of life in the U.S. For all of it's own troubles, Mohan painted a picture of liberty and opportunity for one to follow his dreams in America, and tried to instill some of that kind of pride in being a citizen of a small community. There was repeated emphasis in the picture about self respect, independence and self reliance, probably none more effective than when the lovely school teacher Gita (Gayatri Joshi) declined a marriage proposal because of the devotion to her vocation. I must say, as a screen couple, Shah Rukh Khan and Gayatri Joshi are every bit as charismatic as Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". One of the intriguing things about the story is that you're never sure how the romance between the attractive couple will play out. When Gita longingly wishes for Mohan to turn around as he drives away to catch his plane back to the States, one can't help but feel a bit conflicted over their relationship.I look back upon the history of cinema in this country and think about the impact films have had on things like improving race relations, equality for women, and upward mobility for individuals born into unfortunate circumstances. \"Swades\" feels like a film that might do something similar for the Indian sub-continent, if it can successfully translate thought and ideas into action for ordinary citizens to challenge the status quo and stand up for themselves. The picture closes on just that kind of note, and one does get a sense that \"the tides have begun to change direction\".",

            "content": "I had the chance to watch this movie recently. Being an NRI myself, I think this movie made a lot of sense to me. Coming from Ashutosh whose pre-Lagaan record was not so great, I went into the cinema without any expectations. I wanted to be surprised. And I was! Watching SWADES was like watching a novel. The journey of one man and his emotions towards his nation. The director hits many chords with this movie - stuff we think we already know about, but are never really brave enough to watch in the eye. Being great followers of escapist movies in Bollywood, we tend to attach the success of a movie at the box office to it's quality. Not true. Mark my words that Swades will bag a lot of awards this time because of the way it was handled. Whoever called it a \"documentary\" or a \"moral science lesson\" is either too ignorant or just another escapist himself who does not want to show the world what India really is. Despite the fact that an Indian is a top notch project manager for NASA at the world's power capital Washington, his roots lie in a place where he has to buy water from a young boy for 25 paise. Could there be a better summary of India? Personally for me that scene at the railway station was the best. Shahrukh almost seems to hold back his tears while making sure his companion on the journey does not see him crying at the state of his country. We all talk big about India and say change CAN happen, but Mohan Bhargava actually went ahead and did his bit in bringing about that change. One of the best last scenes of a movie I have seen lately where he washes himself on the river banks....he is home.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Swades: We, the People",
            "content": "I'm been very much impressed by the films of Ashutosh Gowariker with his epics like Jodhaa Akbar and Lagaan, that it's a no brainer for me to continue seeking out his earlier films, especially so when they have been scored with music provided by A.R. Rahman. Swades: We, the People struck a common chord in some aspects of the story with Delhi-6, but only just, and I found it strangely compelling to dwell a little on some similarities between the two.Well for starters both had an NRI (Non-Resident Indian, or jokingly mocked as Non- Returning Indian) returning from the United States, only to find themselves in a small town/village/district where the ways of their lives are a little backward, and the protagonist has to find time to get used to the slower pace, and life without its luxuries, even what we deem as basic like electricity. Email? Internet? Unheard of, naturally. There's also some time in both narratives dedicated to the well known story of the three way tussle in Lord Ram, Sita and Ravana, though the one in Swades benefited from Rahman's wonderful music enveloping the stage play, in more complete terms than that in Delhi-6 (also scored by Rahman by the way).And when it's a blast to the past, some common themes that seem to find themselves a staple in a Gowariker film are the tackling of caste (Lagaan), as well as religion (Jodhaa Akbar), with the need to see the bigger picture and to overcome these issues and put aside differences for the greater good. Arranged marriages too have no place amongst women who are strong, independent and self-reliant, but I guess such tradition and customs are still quite commonplace and widely practiced, for movies from then until now still featuring such arrangements in the plot, as if to mirror some frowning of the deliberate, and sometimes forced practices of culture and tradition, just because.LIke how Abhishek's character echoed in Delhi-6, \"India works, the people make it work\", it's like a wake up call to the community as seen in Swades too, that while there are niggling issues like corruption and the reliance of social crutches in tradition or culture, things really work when everyone rolls their sleeves and get down to doing things. In Swades, everyone complains about the lack of electricity and the frequent disruption, but it takes one guy to wake them up and show them the way to progress. Aamir Khan took on such a role in Lagaan, and in Swades, Shah Rukh Khan plays that equivalent in Mohan Bhargav, a project manager in USA's NASA who journeys back to India in search of his foster mother Kaveriamma (Kishori Balal) because he's feeling guilty of abandoning her.Clocking in at just over 3 hours (which recent Gowariker film isn't?), it allows plenty of space for a number of themes to be explored. The narrative also took advantage of the run time to inject the staple romance and exploration of Mohan in his new environment, and the vast myriad of likable characters here also add to the film's endearing approach.Running central in the story is Mohan's tussle with his lady love Gita (Gayatri Joshi, in her debut and only role to date?) for his foster mother who's now also the only family of the latter and her brother Chikku (Smith Seth). Mohan wants to bring Kaveriamma back to the US to enjoy the last stage of her life amongst luxuries, while Gita wants her to stay in India. Both have their selfish reasons, and needless to say, falling in love just complicates matters. If affairs of the heart is not your cup of tea, then Mohan's one man crusade to fight for what's correct, and galvanizing support at the grassroots and community level, do make it a little moving as he sees what everyone doesn't, or choose not to, unless you go on the ground like he did.One of the more poignant scenes, which also provides the opportunity for Rahman's Yeh Tara Woh Tara theme song for Swades, takes place in a community outdoor screening. With the screen set up in the middle of the field, the upper caste folks get to sit on the right side, with benches too for VIPs, while the lower caste folks sit on the opposite side of the screen, and obviously the incorrect side, having to view the movie in its mirror image, separated and out of view from the higher caste. In one fell swoop, Mohan uses the downtime of electricity interruption to demolish the unhealthy practices through children, who are always colour/race/creed-blind, and through them, hopefully, educating the older generation on the spot, while bringing about reasonable change of mindsets amongst the new generation. This scene alone sticks, amongst many others thanks to Gowariker's strong story, and direction.At its basic level, with Hindi movies travelling the world for its global audience, the film seeks to call out to the NRIs to remember their roots, and to make that contribution back to their homeland, given that while there are problems that might have contributed to push factors, with the success, knowledge, capabilities and resources now ploughed back, they would effect some change no matter how small, and progress will always be made with that single small step in the right direction. The film isn't as heavy as it might seem, and that's the beauty of it, working itself on many levels. I've yet to be disappointed by a Gowariker film, and am going to continue seeking out even earlier films, while waiting with bated breath for his next.",

However, after watching it over 5-6 times, I realise that Swades is a great movie because it highlights the reality of what villagers in India face. Most films which flop often have no storyline but Swades actually has a storyline. The storyline focuses on Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) who returns to India in search of his childhood nanny and in the process remembers how much he loves his country.One thing that I actually think is good is that critics noticed how well Khan portrayed the title role of the film, more importantly Khan won an Oscar for his performance!",

The details depicted are also quite nice and touching, even for an Indian movie, which usually tend to be hyperbolic in their touching scenes. Like all Indian movies, there is always the two ever present ingredients of romance and also singing and dancing. The romance side is quite nice because it's quite a strong side conflict that rises in significance in the middle part of the movie, although this is very predictable. The singing and dancing parts are a bit overwhelming in length, that one of the songs can have up to seven minutes of duration. The songs didn't start up to about one third of the movie, yet they are grouped closely near the end. Shah Rukh Khan is for me one of the outstanding Indian actors which not only has starred in many titles, but has can also really act well. His use of all acting depiction such as the facial expressions, body gestures, composure and even voice intonation, is great in this movie. Gayatri Joshi can really hold the balance in acting with the famous Shah Rukh Khan, and she really can get the scenes to feel alive. Too bad that she couldn't really nail the emotional goodbye scene near the end.",

            "content": "What's the similarity between Sam Mendes, Farhan Akhtar and Ashutosh Gowariker; apart from the fact that they are all acclaimed filmmakers of the current generation? Apparently, there is none, except the fact that all three made a debut film that wooed critics and the masses alike. The films were all box-office successes; swept the awards they were nominated for and the trio faced the same expectations when they announced their next film. Add to this the fact that their second film was as different from the first as one could ever think of.Swades, much touted as Ashutosh Gowariker's second inning after Lagaan, holds on its own. In fact, in certain respects it is a much better film than the 2001 mega-success. True, it has its similarities with its predecessor, but its like a novelist using the same words in a different context and emerging with a totally different connotation to them.It is said that to bring out the effect of light, one needs to know darkness. This basic contrast is used as a backbone for Swades. What can be more apt to bring out the fact of rooted to reality than some one who as a profession aims for the sky? Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) is a Project Manager at NASA working on Global Precipitation Measurement \u0096 a technology that takes the guesswork away from forecasting rainfall. This is the beginning of the recurrent water motif that Gowariker has so masterfully utilized in his film. From the affinity of Mohan to mineral water (one bottle of which he gifts to a minstrel who he picks up on his caravan; to a child water vendor who acts as a catalyst in the protagonist's life; the singular channel of change in a village; the ultimate ablution in a water body where Mohan washes his soiled feet; to Geeta's (Gayatri Joshi) first question to Mohan regarding the five rivers of India, the source of life acts as refrain throughout the film. Other deftly applied symbolisms abound \u0096 especially remarkable is one where Gowariker, the director, removes a great class divide in a village \u0096 an erected movie screen \u0097 to bring to the fore what the film stands for \u0096 a coming together, a unison.The performances are also remarkable. Kishori Ballal as Kaveri Amma, the mother figure who brought up Mohan, is simply sublime. Gowariker should be applauded for eliciting touching performances from total non-actors \u0097 a despondent farmer who has all but given up hope of providing for his family; an aged woman whose only reaction to her first interaction with a lit bulb is simply uttering the word 'bijli', the instances are many. Gowariker's forte, apart from being a brilliant storyteller, has been his character sketches, a trait that is evident in his recent offering as well. The film brings to light Shahrukh Khan as never seen before \u0097 a clich\u00e9 that is actually applicable as far as his portrayal of Mohan Bhargava is concerned. Considered a demi-god, Khan sinks into his character albeit a trifle skeptically at the beginning of the movie, but then settles into it in the same manner he dips his feet in the murky water of the village reservoir. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the debutante Gayatri Joshi. While seeing her acting prim and proper, I could not but help wonder if her character was written with Nandita Das lurking somewhere at the back of the mind of the screenplay writer! Swades is as patriotic in flavor as any recent release, with a subtle difference. Except in two sequences, it makes its statement without resorting to any sort of jingoism. Look for the brilliant quirks in the film \u0096 the reaction of an eight-year old to a huge caravan in a village, a water pipe turning into a musical instrument, an inverted image of a temple as seen through the eyes of a child looking at it in an upside down manner \u0097 these are the small things that ultimately separate the wheat from the chaff and not a grandiose item number.",

            "content": "When most non-Indians think about Indian movies, they probably recall that episode of \"The Simpsons\" with the veiled dancing girls, stern looking guys in turbans and endless musical numbers. Well, that is one aspect of \"Bollywood\" but from Satyajit Ray onwards there have been many Indian films thoughtfully and sensitively probing the conditions and complexities found in the world's largest democracy. (Facets Rentals in Chicago would be a good place to start looking for the works of Mr. Ray and others.) In recent years there's been the issue of ever increasing Indian immigration, which I tend to favor. (Hey, they speak English, commit hardly any crimes and bring great food with them, what's not to like?) For a movie whose three hours-plus flow along effortlessly with the \"entertainment values\" one would expect (humor, gorgeous cinematography, music, dancing) but also starkly realistic depictions of crushing poverty that ought to make you cry if you're not from there and haven't seen it yourself, plus an unflinching look at the effects of the caste system, tribal prejudices, sexism, illiteracy and ineffective government infused with an aura of dogged optimism signaled by the Gandhi quote at the beginning, you would be well advised to have a look at \"Swades.\" Don't worry if you're the only Anglo in the cinema (as I was), these folks don't bite or anything!! :) Just a few quibbles: in the first part of the film set in America, the subtitles are somewhat hit and miss as the characters jump back and forth between Hindi and English. Once the Shah Rukh Khan character Mohan is back home, no problems. Also, with Mr. Khan pushing forty it's a bit of a stretch to buy him and the lovely Gayatri Joshi as contemporaries. Good news female fans, he takes his shirt off a lot! Bad news male fans, remember that in Indian cinema there's never anything close to a depiction of actual sex (except for the occasional rape scene e.g. the anomalous \"Bandit Queen\" which was so serious it didn't even have any musical numbers in it). Some may wonder why Mohan needs to torture himself on whether to live in America or India since we see him doing so much of his work by phone or with his laptop (outsourcing of \"knowledge work\" as well as industry could be a movie unto itself). Seemed odd that Mohan was the only character seen smoking. All those women don't hand-roll all those bidis just as a hobby....This is shorter than my usual reviews (doubtless a good thing) because my PC is slow as molasses at the moment and I think that poor guy in \"My Left Foot\" could have typed this faster than I'm able to do. I'd better stick with using the PC at work---on my own time, of course!!",

Most of the Indian movies are a bubble full of happiness and dreams that everyone wishes in their heart, but Swades is nothing compared to these. I am a big fan of Indian movies and Shah Rukh Khan. Before watching this movie, I heard comments from different Indian people about it. Some liked it a lot, but some said that go watch Veer-Zaraa; that's a better movie. I saw both of them. Veer-Zaraa (which I liked a lot) was a typical Bollywood movie, but SWADES was a reality. I believe it was India's voice to its own people.

            "content": "Why is it that Indian filmmakers seem to believe that every movie, regardless of subject matter, needs to be over three hours long? Is it simply a matter of \"more is better,\" or is there something ethnical or cultural going on here? For indeed, this phenomenon is not restricted to certain specialized genres as it is in American film-making (the sweeping epic, the historical drama, the Broadway-based musical etc.) but seems to extend to films of all types made in that country.Take \"Swades,\" a rather simple comedy/drama about a successful NASA satellite designer named Mohan who returns to his native country in search of his roots and past. He travels to a village where Kaveriamma, the woman who took care of him as a child, now resides. His intention is to take her back to the States with him, so that she can live out the remainder of her life in the lap of luxury and affluence. However, while he's there, he falls in love with a beautiful but feisty and independent young schoolteacher named Gita who wants Kaveriamma to remain where she is. A struggle develops between these two attractive young people who are obviously madly in love with one another but too prideful and pigheaded to realize or acknowledge it.What might have been a meaningful and profound little personal drama at, say, a reasonable 115 minutes, becomes something of an endurance contest at a turgid 186. The story simply isn't compelling enough to sustain our interest for this enormous a length of time. The film does have some pertinent things to say about the caste system, the role of women in society, the need for universal education, and the conflict between traditionalism and modernity in 21st Century India (\"swades\" actually means \"we, the people\") - and I'm sure that people in the home country may find these issues more compelling than some of us watching the film in an entirely different part of the world. Unfortunately, writer/director Ashutosh Gowariker seems too addicted to romantic clich\u00e9s for any of these themes to filter through and register much of an impact. He also employs the kind of corny reaction shots one rarely sees in American films anymore, as well as too-cutesy-by-half musical riffs to highlight the humorous moments so that the presumably unperceptive audience will know when to respond appropriately - like a laugh track in a sitcom or the traditional drum roll of the stand-up comic. One of the reasons why the movie is so long is that the narrative is frequently interrupted by those seemingly obligatory musical numbers without which no true blue Indian film can exist. Some of the these sequences are high-spirited and enjoyable, but I have no idea why every single filmmaker in that country feels compelled to use them in every single film.As the young lovers, Shahrukh Khan and Gayatri Joshi make a handsome, attractive couple, and Kishori Balal provides stability and warmth as the old woman who becomes the bone of contention between the two. And there would be no point in denying that \"Swades\" has moments of point and purpose as Mohan comes to realize the beauty and quality of the land and the people he has left behind. Now, if only a sensible editor could have trimmed the movie down to a more serviceable length, \"Swades\" might have been a film worth watching.",

            "content": "Swades is my idea of India Empowered. The movie creates a magic, which makes you believe, so what if only for a swift second, that you can help change the face of India too.In Swades, you don't see Sharukh Khan as Sharukh Khan, but as Mohan Bhargava, a feat difficult to achieve even by the most seasoned actors. Mohan comes back to take his now old governess Kaveri Amma to the US. Here he meets Gita (Gayatri Joshi) a Delhi-educated school teacher in the tiny village 200kms from Delhi. Not only does Mohan fall in love with the beautiful and graceful Gayatri Joshi, but also begins on his journey of knowing rural India.Mohan's moment of realization comes, when he sees the poor peasant so stuck in the Indian caste system, that he can barely feed his family. Traditionally a weaver, the advent of the power looms had left this man jobless, forcing him to take up agriculture on leased land. Shunned by the community who believes that a weaver cannot be anything but a weaver, he fails to irrigate his land, as he was provided with no water by the villagers. This leaves him in heavy debts and a state of misery and helplessness. Mohans journey home is the one of realization. The omnipresent NRI-symbol, the Bisleri bottle finally gives way to a glass of water in a earthen vessel for a meagre 25 paise being sold by a young child at the Ajite Railway station.Swades touches rampant problems of rural India, child marriage, caste-ism, lack of education. It also voices the concern about an increasing number of NRI's taking their old to the US to serve them, cook and clean at home. There is an other point the movie touched, which nobody before has ever dared to - Mohan begs to differ as the elders at a village gathering say that India is the greatest country in the world because we have 'values and ideals'. Mohan urges them to stop hiding behind a farce of big words and to see things the way they are. Mohan uses his skill to build a tiny hydro electric power project which brings light to his village. This is when the movie reaches its peak point. \"One man Mohan Bhargava - can make a difference. Can you?\" it asks, right in your face. And you wouldn't believe what you find yourself saying - yes I can! This is the magic of the movie I was speaking about.Mohan goes back to the USA against his own wishes. Memories of India, his village, his love haunt him. Mohans end decision is what I leave for you to watch in the movie....Sharukh Khan's performance as Mohan Bhargava is very believable. I suspect there's more to his character than merely the work of a skilled actor. His performance has soul in it. Some part of Sharukh Khan is a Mohan Bhargava, some part of him believes in the same idea of India Empowered.Gayatri Joshi's made a great debut in this movie. She is a beautiful and versatile actress. Finally we got to see a non-buxom Indian actress on screen which comes as a relief. When she ties Mohan's dhoti (traditional male garb) looking into his eyes unhesitatingly, there's a subtle message hidden speaking odes about female empowerment. There is this great chemistry between Sharukh and Gayatri, where she plays the dominant teacher, and he the meek student with a crush on her.The supporting roles were performed to perfection. And music by A.R. Rehman adds beauty to the movie. A.R. Rahman, I believe is the greatest music composer we have, his music works like magic.",

Thank GOD for people like Mr. Gowarikar who aren't afraid to \"think outside of the box.\" As a female movie-goer, I have been looking forward to watching this film since I first saw those trailers on SONY. You first see Mr. Khan on a train, then a bus, then a boat, then on the back of a scooter trying to get somewhere. I was so entralled that I just wanted to see the movie to find out just where on Earth was he trying to get to? I just HAD to go SEE it.This film shows you a very realistic and human approach to the conflicts going on inside of a person who is trapped and trying to find the difference between living one's life for oneself and the urge to make a difference in the lives of others, to be a beacon of guiding light. I loved it! I loved it more than Lagaan. Take that you no-nothing critics! I went to see the film with my sister who is visiting and it has been probably a good 4 years since the two of us have done anything together. Life is what happens when you're busy working! On our car ride back home we discussed the film as we usually do no matter who is with us. To get an idea of what someone else might have picked up on and others might have missed. Both of us loved the fact that he went back to NASA to finish up his work before going back to India. It shows Mohan's sincerity to both countries. If that part in the film had been cut-out, both of us would've been extremely angry with the director. That would've shown immense hypocrisy on the part of the film-maker because that would've meant that he doesn't care whether or not he leaves one country hanging just so that he can follow his new-found purpose & direction in life.You can never end one section of your life like that because people come to depend on you and you should respect them for it. If there is a sudden need for me to go do something, I'd never leave my employer hanging, even if it was for the people that I love because nobody deserves that. One should tie up all loose ends before starting something fresh and new. It is the responsible thing to to and this film makes the character even more realistic and true to being an NRI by doing so. Because we NRIs not only have a responsibility to the country that gave us birth; we also have a responsibility to the country that gave us support, recognition and shelter. Be it the US, UK, etc.",

SRK is the NRI engineer who is caught between a luxurious life in US and the calls of his motherland. The way this theme has been handled is quite commendable. There are no efforts to brush the trash under the carpet in the movie. The bleak realities in India are shown very openly , unlike many pseudo Bollywood movies that seek to hide and paint a very misleading picture of the truth.ARR's music adds to the glory and all the songs are quite good. The background score is very apt but sometimes gloomier than the situation warrants. The director Gowariker just excels . SRK acts very well , and is controlled in his expressions. The actress Joshi is quite OK and natural in her acting. The locales are quite beautiful and the village scenes are quite good. But some slight flaws still exist like the weaver who changes his profession to farming and is punished for that. The problem of man vs machine is quite old and somehow village economies have coped with that. This is a slight exaggeration. Are there villages where no one is aware of the internet? I heard that in every village in India you have mobiles now. But the reviewer may be wrong. SRK comes with his caravan and how does he get water for his caravan van and what about electricity and power for his super-sized vehicle ? Again Iam not an automobile expert and maybe Iam wrong.But brushing these slight defects aside , the movie comes out as a great creation of Bollywood. Personally it would have touched many NRIs hearts as they would have immediately identified with the theme of the movie. The pangs suffered by SRK seem so real when one is placed in a similar situation.To summarize a great movie worth a watch",

Bollywood fans criticize him for being over the top and hammy, and then stay away in droves when he gives the sort of beautifully nuanced, introspective, and quietly impassioned performance that he delivers in \"Swades\".\"Swades\" is the sort of film that Jean Renoir, perhaps the greatest filmmaker of all time, would make if he were alive and making Bollywood films. Ditto Satyajit Ray. It gives us village India as seen from the outside by a thoroughly Americanized ex-patriot, a young man who is at first scared to drink the water and condescending towards the \"little\" lives and foolish ambitions of the locals. Gradually, of course, he is drawn into their problems, and rediscovers his identity as an Indian. What is most graceful (and Renoir-like) about this film, is that we are allowed to laugh at both young Mohan and the unsophisticated villagers, even as we grow to know and love them. That kind of tenderness and humanity, something that transcends notions of political correctness and national identity, is very rare in movies from any country.I could have done without the love story--as I could also have done without the love triangle in \"Lagaan\". Love interest seems to be a requirement in Bollywood, though (as it used to be in Hollywood, which once put a woman in \"Moby Dick\"!), and I can live with it. \"Swades\" is such a quiet, introspective sort of film, and so realistic, that I also was a bit jarred when the musical numbers came bouncing in. On repeated viewings, however, the numbers serve the film well, and they are in themselves quite beautiful.\"Swades\" is a film to treasure, and I certainly hope that no one involved (especially SRK) regards it as a failure.",

But when I watched it in the cinema, I realised that one of the best things about it was that it had reality in it.Mohan Bhargav, a NASA engineer, returns to his homeland, India and goes in search for his governess, Kaveri Amma and finds her in a village where people do not have basic facilities, such as electricity on a regular. On requesting her to go with him to the USA, he is informed that she can't as she also helps one of his childhood friends, Geeta by looking after her house and her younger brother. He realises that Kaveri Amma, will not leave Geeta until she is married and settled and that the school that she is operating gets a full approval form the seniors in the village for a new plot of land to build it into a college. He then decides that he will do whatever he can to help and then take Kaveri Amma with him.Sha Rukh Khan, as Mohan Bhargav, is just brilliant as is Gayatri Joshi in her first film. The music by A.R. Rehman is also worth listening to as are some songs such as \"Yeh Tara Woh Tara,\" \"Yuhi Chala Chal Rahi\" a duet by Udit Narayan and Kailesh Kher, and \"Yeh Jo Desh Hai Tere\" and finally \"Saawariya.\" Directed by Ashtosh Gowariker, the movie depicts life in villages today and is very much patriotic.This is a movie that does not have the glitz and glamour, such as the dressing and jewellery that we see nowadays in almost every movie. Instead it shows reality which is rare to see in any movies these days.",

However, those who do will find this movie a manifestation of their own subconscious desire to do something for their country. The desire to make a difference.The set is beautiful.

In attempting to make a film close to his heart, Gowarikar did not wield the editing scissors effectively. This hurts the film. Shahrukh gives a heartfelt performance that's hurt by the interminable screenplay. Numerous secondary characters make an appearance but no one leaves an impact. The female lead is shrill and I never believed her romance with Shahrukh. Watchable but too pious and dull.Overall 5/10",

            "content": "I have never been so sad for a movie failing at BO as i am for Swades.But BO needs some mas-ala,fast pace and some dramatic moments, it may have lacked these things.But it have the \"soul\" which is not found in most of the movies.Swades is about self realization,about our roots,many cultural aspects: both positive and negative.But i loved Swades cause it was absolute realistic.Remember the scene in beginning when he says about Kaveri Amma that 'Mai Unko Bhul Gaya Tha'(I had forgotten her) this is among the finest moments.We realize that sometimes we forget people with whom we were once closely associated with, we get so much busy in our daily life that we tend to forget them.But sometime when we remember we like to speak to them, meet them, we miss them.It happens, we forget many of our childhood friends, few of our relatives,few of those with whom we were close.The scene when SRK goes to search Kaveri Amma and finds that she is not there and just when he is turning back the old lady says \"she is very lucky that someone came to take her,that day she came..today you,else who ask for old people\".Very true.Old people are very much ignored.SRK's entry in the village and the background music \"Aayo re...Aayo re\" one of the most beautiful music ever.The narrow old roads of village, people running after Srk van....surprised,stunned that who had entered our village in such a big van is damn realistic and gives \"an essence of our rural India\".SRK's entry in the house...wo aarti ki thaali lana and chandan and all gives an essence of our culture.In the night when SRK says sorry to Kaveri Amma: \"I didn't took care of you\" that lady who is like mother figure to him and he had not taken care of her in all these years and now he is realizing his fault.....absolutely touching.SRK's arguments with Gayatri Joshi at dinner about politics...\"Sab Ek Dusre Ki Taraf Ungli Uthate Hai\" (everyone keeps pointing fingers on one another). Ye Tara Wo Tara Song and the lyrics \"Bund Bund Milne Se Banta Ek Dhara Hai'.His discussion when he is asked to speak about America.....and his burst up on culture that how can we say that America culture is bad....we have our culture and we respect our culture...they have their too....and \"Jis Culture Aur Parampara,Sanskriti Pe Hum Garv Karte Hai Wahi Hume Ek Dusre Se Baate Rakhta Hai\"(the culture and tradition which we are proud of is keeping us divided) on the name of caste,religion etc then how come we should be proud of our culture.Actually the whole scene above was just amazing and deeply touching.Then the whole scene when Srk goes for \"paisa vasooli\" and his story was quite touching.The train scene: An NRI who never touches anything else than mineral water....looking after the plight of the boy he drinks that water, shows he was deeply sad in his heart to the plight of the country.And the way scene was handled and SRK's portrayal can't be put in words.The scene when SRK is leaving the village and Maya ram refuses to go with him and says \"Apne Aangan Ka Diya Giving Light To Neighbours House\"...i can just clap.And the song \"Ye Jo Desh Hai Tera\".....specially the lines \"Mitti Ki Jo Hai Khushbu,Tu Kaise Bhulayega...Tu Chahe Kahi Jaye...Tu Laut Ke Aayega\".... I have so much respect for this song.And in the climax when John says \"Mohan you could have gone places.\" And Mohan replies \"I am going places\" Well bringing electricity was just to show that every individual can do something for his country and society.....Mohan Bhargav comes....he was alone...then he united many people....and result was for their own benefit......for their literacy,electricity and all.What Mohan Bhargav gets??....nothing??.But its not....he gets something which is out of the world.....self realization...self respect....an honor.....not by others but in his own heart.....that he had done something good for his society and country.All bow to Ashutosh Gowarikar...from child marriage to illiteracy, from caste-ism to poverty, Swades covers all aspects and issues of rural India. Realization and self journey of ones own mind and a heartfelt message of changing our country for good was never delivered in as realistic manner as it was in Swades. Hats off to SRK as well for coming up with one of the finest performance of his career.Mohan Bhargav's journey from Space Shuttle to Boat....from the glittering lights of America to the lantern of India.....from the mind and money to his heart and soul......incredible....simply incredible.As the saying goes: \"The Greatest Journeys Are The Ones That Bring You Home\"",

            "content": "When the maker of Lagaan and a superstar like Shah Rukh Khan get together in a film, the expectations are obviously soaring high. Thankfully, Swades lives upto the expectations. Though, Swades is distant from the usual Hindi commercial cinema and might not be targeted towards the masses, it has a flair and an artistic touch to it that makes it a movie worth-seeing. The film, about an NRI Mohan Bhargav, who comes to India and discovers the pathetic conditions that prevail in his country, holds the viewer mesmerised till the end. AR Rehman's musical genius is once again epitomised in Swades. The tracks Yun hi chala (by the way, Makrand Deshpande looks cool!), Yeh tara woh tara, and the self-sung title track are melodious and appluadable.The film actually wins the hearts of the viewers because of the simplistic touch lent to it. There is something really honest about the way India has been portrayed in the film and Gowariker's choice of cast , as in Lagaan, was perfect as ever. Although the film cant be classified as an entertainer it is one of those rare films that comes straight from the director's heart and reaches till the very depth of the viewer's heart.In terms of acting, Swades marks a new achievement in SRK's career. Shah Rukh Khan sheds his Chopra-Johar image in Swades and sets the right tone for the film. He is unarguably the heart and soul of the film and speaks his dialogues with divine perfection. Gayatri Joshi is awesome as a newcomer. What is even more commendable about this damsel is that she never appears to be over-rawed by facing the greatest star of our times(SRK) and matches SRK's acting with equally good performance.Swades, though might not be successful at the box-office, certainly hits home the desired message with ease.",

But after seeing Swades I must give him positive credit for the well done work. Every little thing in he movie is well made in details. The movie is very simple with no Disumb Dismub or Glamorous Bollywood Flavers. The comedy and the emotional scenes does catch you, and when you get out of the cinema you will feel very happy and in a good mood, and think of the life and that we do have a nice and good life compare to many people who doesn't even have food on the table. Now lets talk a little about the much hyped actor Shahrukh Khan. Many movies has been well made for SK, where we have the old Bollywood recipe with Big Houses, Lots of money,Many songs with Glamorous Flavers, but still good acting by SK. Swades is a opposite of all those SK movies. SK has always been a good actor, but in this movie he shows his various skills, and everyone who sees this movie are gonna fall in love with SK's acting. SK is sure the best actor in India by the time, and is the only to lift the Throne after Big B. I wont tell the story of the movie, thats is you to see, but its a guaranteed beautiful movie that you cant stop loving. The only minus in the movie is the songs, they could have been better.",

            "content": "India in the new millennium is in a very unique position. Strategically placed on the map, Its a country that truly seems to bear certain implications upon the geopolitical situation in Asia, and maybe in the world. As a country, It has grown leaps and bounds over the last fifteen years... National pride is at an all-time high after successful Nuclear testing, a victorious war (Border skirmish to the western world), a rising economy, and a newfound friendship with the US, among other things... So much so, that our politicians started a campaign very aptly called 'India Shining' to remind our people of how well we are doing as a country. Swades tries to explore the truth behind the jingoism. The story is seen through the eyes of an ex-pat, Shah Rukh Khan in his best performance to date, a man of the world, intelligent and successful, who upon his return to India sees what's wrong with our country. We've sent a man to space, we've blasted nuclear bombs and we've even supplied the Internet where there are no toilets... but we've failed in providing basics like sanitation, basic education, especially for our girls, and electricity. 'India Shining' is a shield beneath which the truth of rural India is quite well hidden. After all, wouldn't everyone like to focus more on the fact that our culture is thousands of years old, we're one of the oldest civilizations on the planet... We're a thriving, successful democracy... Who cares about whether the guy who tills his land from morning to night and looks like he's seventy years old, when the truth is closer to forty, gets his food at the end of the day or not. In my opinion, that is the real India... And that is what Shah Rukh's character (Mohan Bhargava) sees when he comes to India. Ably assisted by Messrs Daya Shankar Pandey, Rajesh Vivek and the Gorgeous Gayatri Joshi, he goes about trying to bring a change in the lives of a little village... People who honestly believe that India is shining and are comfortable with the way things are for them. He teaches them to take matters in their own hands and work towards a better life for themselves. Maybe tells them to wake up and actually make it shine behind the publicity machine. Ashutosh Gowarikar gave us Lagaan, a great movie, hyped, Oscar material, etc. etc. In my opinion, Swades is his best work... and the best he'll ever do. It works on so many levels. Its about a man changing, Its about attitudes changing, its about people changing... moreover, its about finding a way to make India truly shine.",

Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lam blasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and cerebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.The maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope.",

I truly did. From the dialogue, to the realism and some very touching scenes (the woman uttering bijli, and the scene with the kid selling water)Even the subtle changes in the movie for example how Shah Rukh continually drinks mineral water until the scene on the train, or how Gita and Shah Rukh progressively get more tanned in the movie as their roles are outdoors in the second half.There was real character development. The minimal use of songs also helped add to the realistic feel for the movie, but I think this movie sang to me because we can all associate with it. I wanted to stress that while a lot of folks knock Indian Bollywood movies, there's nothing wrong with a good, musical about love.(We can, after all, associate with that type of movie too) And while most big budget movies are filmed abroad, with a huge cast, amazing wardrobes and flash and pomp, that does represent a lot of how we as Indians see life. It's through a kaleidoscope of color and through rose tinted glasses we see life. This movie captures that essence.Shah Rukh has never been better. None of the over acting that he does in most movies, and this time, his performance can be summed up with 'less is more.' Ms. Joshi also accomplished an outstanding job for a newcomer. She has all the youth and energy of someone trying to make a difference in the world.To all NRI's, really, you need to watch it. It's a harsh reality, something we all face that if we really feel India needs to change, maybe we need to do more than contribute a few dollars back to our homeland...To all others who aren't living abroad, it captures the heart and frustration that only we as 'Indians' can understand.",

            "content": "It seems that director Ashutosh Gowariker, who directed the wonderful Lagaan, has changed the landscape of hit Hindi movies by making meaningful, sensible and all around delightful movies to watch. Bollywood (if you haven't read my review of Dil Chata Hai or Lagaan) tends to follow a general pattern characterized as: plot always being completely inane and logic-less, two, awesomely stupid and confusing dance and song scenes, where generally girls pop out from nowhere, and finally random, crude and graphic beatings of people and/or excessive violence against women, of which the latter is sometimes 'justified' through morbid and chillingly grim societal mores.Anyway, what Swades has done is present us with is a story of understanding what one's true desires and feelings are rooted with \u0096 the motherland, and the people. Shah Rukh Khan plays a successful Indian who has lived in America for much of his life. His return to India brings all sorts of surprises, many of them rooted in sweet sentiments and beautiful personalities.It might be argued that Swades is a piece on patriotism, but I think that this is such a shallow perspective that it actually might infringe on what the director was trying to convey. Patriotism is defined as a \"pride for one's own country\" and this was not the case at all for the protagonist. In refraining from revealing plot segments ('spoilers') he is not attached to the land, but the relationships he had made and ones he will make.Swades is a fantastic film, but if you are new to Bollywood (as I was about a month ago) see Dil Chata Hai and Bride and Prejudice, to understand the mentality of film-making, and how this movie strives to differ from producing a three hour piece to dull out the mind and pass time.\"Mohan you could have gone places. (replies) I am going places.\" RATING: 9.9/10 (Because It's Bollywood, and thus inherently at a disadvantage, it gets higher scores \u0096 think of it like affirmative action for films)",

I personally that SLB is a very good director, but his statement does not makes sense to me. Anyways talking about Swades, one may like, don't like it, find it too preachy, too lengthy, too boring, may also find it not real or too realistic to digest, but it is one movie which no one can/should ignore.Every thing about this movie is near perfect. The sense of hope and disappointment, the humor and tragedy and humor in tragedy, the hopelessness that nothing can be done and the strength evolving from that very hopelessness, the love as a strength and the love as shackle, the characters as hackneyed and the characters as individuals, the characters without motive and characters becoming motive. This movie is the epitome of irony and contradictions in our society. A movie, which tells that get up from the slumber that, we are in for centuries. It is as much for the Resident Indians as it Non Resident Indians. This movie says by all means come home for love but also come home for honour. All the marks to the Directors, Cast and Crew. And a special mention for the maestro A R Rahman. Who ever said that he is not happening must see this movie wherein he comes with the bang. He does not give the regular popular music but it adds to the punch of the movie and hits you in your guts. Especially the title song, which ironically does not appear with credits. Performance wise after seeing the movie I don't think SRK can be replaced with Amir. He seems to belong wherever he is. Gyatri Joshi makes a appearance in a flop but will go a long long way, not like Gracy Singh who is no where now after giving three hits. Other cast comprising of Rajesh Vivek, Dayashankar Pandey and Nanny is played to perfection and the sense of humor is evolved from the situations and not with the dialogues. The chemistry of SRK and GJ is exceptional. All credits to the director again. The dialogues are simple yet so very profound. And the journey of Mohan Bhargav to the peasant to get the rent and on his return purchasing water for 25 paisa summarizes the movie. I think no one would have directed that sequence better than AG.Ultimately can be summarized from one of its own dialogue \"Apne pani main ghul jana barf ka muqqadder hota hai\". \"Its destiny of ice to dissolve in its own water.\" Hope people do get message.From me its 10/10if not more",

            "content": "\"You have to come to India and experience it. Then you will probably know what I am saying \", says Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a project manager for Global Precipitation Measurement in NASA to his associate. He knows the beauty which lies inside the culture of India and the importance of being an Indian. Swades: We the people, directed by Ashutosh Gowariker is all about developing a new outlook towards patriotism and also dealing with the relevant issue of brain drain. Shah Rukh Khan plays Mohan Bhargava; an Indian NASA scientist migrated to America as he finally manages to shed off his star persona, enacting a subtle but powerful performance, thanks to director's marvellous vision and excellent story-telling. The film starts with American-based Mohan feeling a deep regret over not being able to take care of his nanny (Kaveri amma), while she was old. He expresses his feelings to his associate Vinod (Rahul Vora) as in how Kaveri amma was next to his mother and how she took good care of him when he was a child. Filled with an urge to find Kaveri amma, Mohan takes a leave for a week from NASA and sets off to India only to find Kaveri amma in a village called as Charanpur. The fictitious village Charanpur (assumed to be 200 kms near Delhi) broadcasts an Indian rural life which is full of loving, caring and affectionate people but is simultaneously plagued with problems of illiteracy, caste system, child labour and child marriage. As India enjoys urban development, technological leaps, and the software boom, here villagers still struggle to accumulate basic needs such as education and electricity. In this small village of Charanpur, Mohan finds himself in a world that stands as the polar opposite to his American lifestyle. He tries to convince Kaveri amma to come with him to America much to the dismay of Geeta (Gayatri Joshi), who lives with Kaveri amma. Geeta is the hindrance in Mohan's task to bring his nanny with him to America. She is strong-willed, straight-forward and has immense love for India and its culture. She repeatedly retorts to Mohan's criticism of the government's inability to provide for its people by questioning his contribution to this society.The film starts deviating from this a bit as Mohan decides to channelize his energies in making Charanpur a better place to live as he sees the social evils, the village faces. He helps Geeta in persuading more children in the villages nearby to pursue education, thus gradually falling in love with her. Aided by a local postman Dayal Shrivastav and a local dhaba-owner Mela Ram, Mohan sets off on a mission to bring in more children in their local school. Mohan tries to enable greater access to education, especially for girls, and integration of the castes & appeals to the more liberal members of the village except the conservative council members. With time, Mohan becomes more of a diplomat and less of a dictator.Shah Rukh Khan is sincere, takes you through the gamut of the journey his character Mohan experiences, and even brings in shades to Mohan Bhargava's character. I could literally sense a lighting spark in Mohan's eyes to make his country, one of the best nations in the world. He criticizes the people, claiming that they are irresponsible and do absolutely nothing to make their country progress to pinnacle of glory and you can't help but agree to his diagnosis. One of the best climax scenes is the part where Mohan, with the help of his brilliant mind and his experience in the field of science, tries to generate electric power in Charanpur. The scene is shot so beautifully in the village showing how Mohan along with the villagers work day and night to introduce electricity in village starts to get lost in its own darkness.Sure, no one doubts the sincerity of the idea behind making Swades. Conceptually, it is totally noble. It is admirable how the director keeps the movie totally grounded and down-to-earth, not retreating to any commercial pressures. In spite of the movie being of 189 minutes long, the movie doesn't feel to be slow as the director keeps it extremely well paced. Swades is a sensitive story of good triumphing over the evil, only this time evil doesn't have a face but is rather equated with regressive ideology. Indeed Shah Rukh Khan's performance as Mohan Bhargava will go down as one of his best and the most genuine performances till date.",

            "content": "Very rarely do we get to see meaningful and thought provoking films in Bollywood. Swades comes out as a breath of fresh air to an industry that's been churning out ridiculous nonsense for decades. First things first, Swades is no Lagaan. In fact, in some instances it's way better than Lagaan.Swades's biggest plus point is it's script. The storyline is so real, touching and moving you hardly ever notice the length of the film. By the time the first half was over, I was eagerly looking forward to the second half of this cinematic brilliance.The main protagonist's journey from being a successful NRI working at NASA, to helping a village in UP generate electricity is well portrayed and captivating.All characters are simply brilliant, and they gel so well together. You have a school teacher who is a whiz at mathematics, a postman who is also a wrestler, a cook who dreams of opening a small restaurant on a freeway in America and many such characters who play small but significant roles in Swades.Swades has emotions aplenty, the scene where Mohan goes to collect rent from a tenant and finds out that he can't even afford one meal for his children is striking.The scene where you see a boy selling water for 25 paisa is so poignant. You wont be able to hold back your tears when you see the harsh reality. Comedy has been handled well in Swades. It's not loud or over the top in any way. The screenplay is gripping, holding the viewers rapt attention throughout. Cinematography is stunning, each and every shot is breath-taking. Background music was simply amazing. At times the background music was so expressive and striking, I actually got goose pimples. Dialogues are outstanding!The songs itself were melodious and went well in-sync with the theme of the film. They were also picturised well and didn't seem out of place.A star has definitely become an actor. Shahrukh Khan as Mohan Bhargava has delivered an extraordinary performance. He slides effortlessly into the character and emerges victorious. For once you don't see him sporting designer blouses, (thankfully) throughout the film he wears plain checked shirts and looks good in them too. SRK has finally silenced his critics. In my opinion this is his best performance too date. Gayatri Joshi has given a great performance. She has handled her role with immense maturity. For a moment you forget that this is her first film. Gayatri looks comfortable in front of the camera, her expressions and dialogue delivery is competent. Overall a great debut. Off the support cast, Kishori Balal played the part of the Kaveri amma well. Dayashanker Pandey and Rajesh Vivek were good. Ashutosh Gowariker proves once again that he's creative, talented and one of India's finest film-makers. Full credit goes to him for excellently writing and directing such a remarkable film.All in all Swades is truly a path-breaking film. It entertains as well as spreads an important message to all Indian's everywhere. Hindi cinema at it's best! 9/10.",

            "content": "Swades in my opinion is highly under-rated and yet the most patriotic movie attempted on silver screen. Perhaps over-expectations ended up working against it. Post-Lagaan Gowarikar and SRK was a sure-shot winning combo on box-office. Hats off to Gowarikar for using \"foster mother\" to juxtapose with Motherland. Surreal, extremely surreal - I seriously doubt if the audience had the sensibilities to comprehend the underlying message. Parallels can be drawn to Raj Kapoor who made similar attempts with Satyam Shivam Sundaram and Ram Teri Ganga Maili. Interestingly (and sadly) all the movie met with similar fate at box-office. And in truest sense Post- Swades Gowarikar should be honoured by the title of \"Showman\" which he rightfully deserves.SRK:: Brilliant would be an under-statement. Decades down the line it will be recalled as King Khan's best performance. Noteworthy is abstaining from his signature style hamming. Praiseworthy is his silent introspection on the return journey from a visit to a farmer. Kudos! Standing ovation deserved!Kishore Balal:: Spot on. Established face could have marred the effect and the new face works wonders.Gayatri Joshi:: Character on the similar lines of Gauri from Lagaan. Pity similar to Gracy Singh, she got lost in incognito. Gowarikar regular Rajesh Vivek didn't have enough meat in the character. Daya Shankar Pande left a mark as Mela Ram. Makrand Deshpande was wasted. Not attempting rain on the parade, but if more effort was put into addressing the following - it would have added sheen::* Short-circuit meeting of the lead-pair at library and attempting to him ward him off.* Makrand Deshpande's role and the song.* Use of caravan* The vacation deadline and negotiation* Heroic jump in the tank to salvage at the end. Rahman's music was as usual fantastic. Playing Devil's advocate, if Aamir Khan would have taken up this project - I am sure he would added tremendous value to the proceedings and taken to a different level altogether.Swades - definitely it won't make the Indians settled abroad to pack their bags and take the next flight back to India. But yes, it will linger in your heads for a while and make you ponder, perhaps that was the intention of the director.Next time when you watch \"Swades\" please bear in mind that the emotions depicted for \"nanny\" is your Motherland and lo behold, who knows it might be an eye-opener.",

            "content": "Many people, western and Indian, complain that Indian films don't offer anything different, that they aren't grown up enough, but when great films like swades get made and released they either lambasted or ignored. Swades is the kind of film which brings hope to bollywood. As someone who was an ardent supporter of bollywood i have found that since 2001 the quality of films have generally been poor, and my attention turned towards south India, where you get to see truly great films.As for the film, it has a novel storyline, which incidentally is based on a true story. Shah Rukh Khan gives a brilliant performance, he becomes his character and it is a welcome change from the screen persona that he has had in so many countless over-rated films. The background music to film adds a real dimension to the film, a lesser musician could have easily made the scenes melodramatic with a poor background score.What prevents Swades from being a truly magnificent film, and in my eyes prevents it from being as good as films like Kannathil Muthamittal and Lagaan, is that the film suffers from an average cinematography and from average editing. With all due respect to Mahesh Aney, he not in the same league as Anil Mehta or Ravi Chandran or Santosh Sivan, you never felt in awe of a scene. The editing I felt was poor, but I believe this was due to a script which turned out to be more than four hours long, and a great deal was done to cut the running time to something respectable but in doing so the importance of certain scenes got diluted, for example when Mohan goes to meet the farmer, his journey there is turned in to a montage for a song, and the impact of the final song in the film is diluted when the song is interrupted with other important scenes.Swades is a great film and also a great message, and it is a shame that certain reviewers didn't see that. Thankfully the Indian public eventually saw the film and got to see the message the director wanted convey.",

Gowariker, made \"Laggan,\" a fiction that disgraced the inhabitants of Kutch as henpecked and powerless imbeciles but in \"Swades,\" he has hit the rustic and ravaged rural scene as Satyajit Ray did in his Trilogy. The credit for this stark drama should go to Gowariker and Rahman. If the family that treats the guest as God serving them with the last grain of millet, the boy that quenches the native thirst of the NRI, the granny that can see bijli in one eye where the cataract of poverty has shut the other eye for ever, the familiar sound of the lost power while watching an outdoor movie, the haunting title song that should be the new anthem for the NRI, the innate beauty and message of the \"Tara Tara\" number, the haunting melody that comes out of the Shehnai--does't beckon an NRI nothing will. The new entrant Gayathri Joshi has done a commendable job but the pair lack romantic chemistry, however the dhoti cladding is subtle comedy that SRK is good at and he is good when he is subtle. Hritihk Roshan would probably have fared better in the movie. All said and done this is a great rendition by Gowariker that will become a Classic--if and ever the MTV generation will wake up to search for their \"Parampara.\"",

            "content": "Storyline (I thought the only way to appreciate this movie is to write the story although it could be a spoiler):Mohan Bhargav (Shah Rukh Khan) is the Project Manager for NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement Satellite project. Although his career is at a peak, he feels a hollow in him. Mohan reminisces on his childhood, after he lost his parents in an accident and the emptiness he felt in the life that he led. The memories of his childhood takeover him and he decides to get back to India to search for his childhood nanny Kaveriamma (Kishori Ballal).Mohan lands in Delhi and finds out that Kaveri is now in a village. He is busy finding a map of the area, when he chances a meeting with the pretty lady Gita (Gayatri Joshi). Mohan's search for Kaveri leads him to a small village Charanpur which is a little more advanced than the pre-independence Lagaan village. He then discovers that Gita is a relative of Kaveri. Mohan finds Gita irresistible.The rest of the movie is a drama of the village's problems, such as electricity, space for Gita's school, lack of connectivity on his cellphone and the internet. Mohan finds it weird to discover that the whole village had only one phone from which he could dial an international number. Like a typical foreign settler, he carries a supply of mineral water wherever he goes. In the meantime, Mohan invites Kaveri to migrate abroad with him but Gita persists that he wouldn't leave Kaveriamma. Kaveri sends Mohan to a nearby village where he finds that people are in deeper problems for water, and problems with caste differences.Disgusted by all of these, Mohan, against all odds tries to get the villagers out of the caste mould and convinces the villagers to send their children to school. He builds a mini hydroelectric power station from a nearby stream to solve the power problems of the village. In the meantime, Gita confesses her love towards him.Towards the end of the movie, it seems that the whole village loves him so much that they request him to stay on. But, Mohan insists on returning. As a last bet, Gita hands Mohan a gift, symbolic of Indian Culture and requests him to stay on. Although Mohan is back in the US, his heart is still in India and with his lady love Gita. With his heart and mind out at India, he quits his high-profile NASA job and returns to India.Comment: The story is a pure drama of an NRI's view towards the grassroots problems of Indian Villages. The protagonist is a sample of a highly educated engineer/scientist in a high profile job in the US and someone whose American citizenship was just approved. The rest of the Indian characters portray the life in a typical Indian village with problems of illiteracy and caste problems. Ashutosh Gowariker seems to have made a movie keeping the likes of the story's protagonist in view as the target audience.Ashutosh Gowariker has proved again that he can write the best scripts and he is the right guy to direct them.Although Shah Rukh Khan's acting skills have nowadays become more than predictable, his performance in Swades is definitely a welcome break and is much better than that of his recent flicks KHNH or MHN. The model turned actress Gayatri Joshi is simply amazing in the role of the graceful, principled role that she plays. Well, although her stunning looks in the Saree-clad role are captivating, her characterization in the story is such that one would feel like chasing for a girl like her. The rest of the roles seem to repeat from Lagaan. Music is not up to Rahman's standards, he could have done better. On the whole, watch out for Gayatri Joshi.Rating: 4/5",

            "content": "Mr. Gowarikar - I am now a true fan. I did not much like Lagaan because I was put off by the cricket fantasy component in the film, by the unreal premise. But with Swades Ashutosh Gowarikar has shown that he can make a mature movie on a burning topic, make it in an almost documentary style, yet keep the hearts and minds of the audience engaged. Swades shows the current ills in rural India (which BTW have changed little over the years) in a gentle - nudging us into realization - way. The main point is not that a little reservoir is built and electricity generated, but the fact that given the right catalyst, change can happen from within the confines of this rural society and at the local level. The story is simplistic at best but somehow resonates with young and old alike. The usual trappings are present but are very subdued, the ensemble of characters is so authentic I am convinced that he spent a fair amount of time in a village studying the social structure there.What I loved: The building of the tale - The slow acceptance of rural life by the NRI Mohan - sleeping in camper, then on a string bed (Khatiya), bathing in the camper, then at the well. The village caste and social hierarchy - most authentically portrayed by the open air cinema with the upper castes in front and the dalits (lower casts) behind the screen - subtle! The desire to better one's life abroad - MelaRam was amazing! The Village panchayat, the wrestling, the post office (and postmaster!), the Ramlila - these slices of village life were amazing.The portrayals - Mohan - could any one but SRK have done this role as well? I doubt it. With his glam sort of image in the usual fare, you expect certain things in his portrayals - but all I saw was the nerdy engineer Mohan. There was no evidence of the superstar persona - just the simple engineer type, perturbed by all he sees around him, unable to comprehend why things are the way they are, then in true engineer type problem solving way setting out to slowly change things. His breakdown on the rent collection trip ending in buying and drinking water at a small train station is the most intense and yet underplayed performance I have ever seen. I NEVER cry in films and I was looking for the Kleenex in these shots! Kudos to the award deciders, if they had given him an award for Veer Zaara over Swades I would never ever look at these awards for any validation of any kind. Gayatri Joshi as Geeta was good, a bit polished looking, but she was a Delhi educated girl so OK. She held her own in almost every scene and said much using her eyes and expressions. Kaveriamma - we need more mother types roles to go to her, I wanted her to be my Mom! Nivaranji, MelaRam, the entire gram panchayat, what an assemblage of authentic characters.The music - I have heard that this is ARR's personal favorite album. It shows - the road song is fabulous, Yeh Tara, Dekho naa, are divine. But the top award goes to Yeh jo des hai tera sung by the Maestro himself. This is some of the best music to come along after a long time and the previous stuff like this for me was - yes you guessed it - ARR and Dil se.The bad: The Sanwariya song is beautiful but could be chopped out to shorten the film, ditto for the Ramlila sequence. Some of the stuff was a bit preachy but then in Hindi cinema the obvious often needs to be stated.Overall this is among my all time favorite movies - I will be watching out for the next one from Mr. G. Above all, thank you for wringing such a career best performance out of SRK, we knew there was good stuff in him, just needed to see it again.",

A laudable effort, a brave attempt a honest film making as it treads the path of inspirational films about idealism which they don't make these days minus the jingoism and slogans,. A far cry from candyfloss romances a straight from the heart tale keeping subtlety and sensibilities intact. On the contrary approach is very fresh as no hangover of \"Lagaan\" is there. Performances are strong as thankfully melodrama is not there In fact, this year if one film that needs to be encouraged through a tax-free status than this is the one. But that's just about it On the other hand when looked at content, this film falls short of lot of things that are expected. Story telling, the soul of cinema is not interesting enough to hold the audience for three plus hours. The required drama, the conflict is absolutely missing. The narration that requires certain style is just not there. The characters are uni-dimensional, the interesting punches in dialogs are absent, the built up towards pre-climax and climax deserves a lot more. In fact, the treatment is kept far simple than is required.. Ashutosh Gowariker has become a bit self-indulgent filmmaker here. All songs are very mediocre and forcibly added. A film with good elements and about goodness does not necessary make a thoroughly good film but then that is an uphill task, a magic and does not click every time.",

Really made me think about being an NRI.Great songs, with A.R Rahman Music of course. The actress Gayatri Joshi played her part very well and she looks very beautiful. Definitely a new star. Shah Rukh Khan well is Shah Rukh Khan, one of the best actors of our times and he can play pretty much any part. As an Indian born in another country I felt myself agreeing with Sharukh's character at times, and this empathy led me to enjoy this movie thoroughly. Despite the odd gratuitous song (popcorn break for me) with rather over-the-top lyrics this movie covered a tremendous amount of ground, from dealing with one's identity to the delicate trade-off between material ambitions and spiritual fulfillment, as well as the importance and drawbacks to preserving an ancient culture. I feel these themes were handled deftly by the director, but don't expect a Lagaan - this movie shines for different reasons, however, I can expect stubborn fans of the \"traditional\" Indian movie formats to be a little put off. The film certainly has a more modern flair fused with traditional elements - which to me, was a refreshing change.Best film of the year. Watch it and it will make you think. $RK.we all love U",

            "content": "Swades revolves around an internal crossroads of Mohan Bhargava (played by Shah Ruhn Khan), who is a non-resident NASA scientist working in the United States. After feeling emotionally stagnant towards both his career and his personal life (or lack there of), Bhargava travels back to his home country of India to bond with his childhood nanny. He soon finds out that she has moved to a smaller village that has been forced out of a properly funded educational system and, above all things, electricity by a corrupt government. What starts out as a simple emotional vacation turns into an life alternating experience after he is unable to resist his impulse to answer the village's plea for help, become a proper role model for local children, and fall in love with a self reliant and progressive female teacher. Ultimately, Bhargava must chose between his duties at NASA in America and his newly surfacing prospective of what is important in life.This 2004 Indian film has been hailed as \"one of the most socially relevant commercial Hindi films to have emerged in the last decade\" by Times of India. It is directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, who helmed LAGAAN, which was the first Indian movie to be nominated for an Oscar award. Swades is written by Ashutosh Gowariker and K.P. Saxena.This 195 minute masterpiece is filled with wonderful music, laughter, social unrest, and love in a manner that never drags. There is a natural beat in which the conflicts and resolutions play out, and the pace never seems forced into a quick tie-up or dragged out by unnecessary melodrama. Heck, I have seen hour and a half films that have seemed longer than this one. The subtitle work is above average thanks to the addition of quick definitions of common Indian slang and terms that sometimes pop up in the dialog.

            "review_title": "Too naive to be taken seriously",
            "content": "I was actually looking forward to see this movie. And while I wasn't disappointed completely, Swades was far from an honest movie about roots, especially those of NRI's. It was, however, a massive improvement from the the naive portrayal of NRI in movies such as DilwaleDLJG. As an Urdu speaking South Asian immigrant who is now an American citizen, it seemed to me as if the creators of the movie had no/little touch with actual NRI's, their experiences, and their views on their mother country and patriotism. First of all, to me, the biggest gash was that Mohan had apparently become a US citizen just at the start of the movie, as the answering machine informed. Either I totally misunderstood that, or it was a huge mistake since I doubt one can work for NASA (govt org) without being a citizen. We gets no sense of how americanized Mohan is. Yes, we are told he has been there for 12 years (which means he should have been a citizen several years ago, since it takes about 7-8 years)...so he probably came to America during college or so--but he speaks Hindi regularly with his friends and knew SOOO many big words that I absolutely could not understand. ALMOST ALL south Asian immigrants I know who have been here for over a decade speak English with each other almost all the time (it's annoying, but they insist). They speak it at home with their families and with their friends. It might also have been better to show some short snippet of how Mohan's life was in America. From what we see is that he had nothing there but work at NASA and a friend. Is that it? Show us what he's missing in America so that we can understand his nostalgia for home. It would have been great, for example, to show that he can't speak Hindi very often in America and misses his language (that's how it is with me, anyways). Or how he misses desi informality and hospitality to western sang-froid. Or show how his mother county owes him (for childhood memories, for example), so he wants to return something to his roots. In Swades we feel as if Mohan just wants to make an altruistic sacrifice for the good of the country; return so he can fix things up in what he sees is a trash dump (and it is not all that bad; live anywhere and you will see that nature has a way of evening things out). And for over a decade he did not visit India before, despite having a manager's salary? He did not miss anything about it? But then he suddenly goes there and viola, absolutely no culture shock. I mean, yeah, there are his arguments on how India is lagging, etc, but I got no feeling that Mohan was somewhere different than where he had been for the past 12 years. I remember when I went back after some 7 years (I did not have a NASA engineer's salary!) I was so amazed at how warm the air was and how dusty, how everyone was shorter and browner than an everyday American Caucasian, and had a more delicate and humble expression; how everyone spoke the language openly that I only speak sometimes at home, how the people stare at you and at everything else openly like its their god-given right, how strangers can talk to each other with total ease, how easy it is to get into an argument, jumping over puddles, giving coins to beggars (without tears I might add, those glittering SRK trademarks!), not knowing the currency and the coins and counting and being ripped off by vendors most of the time (they could have at least put that in where Mohan was at the shop). Here as soon as Mohan came back he started chatting it up with a friend, stared at a pretty girl in that typical SRK-impolite-leering \"wow!\" way, and sang a song during a road trip (oh, and don't tell me that Mohan didn't have some girl in America. They all do. Specially men who are basically alone). The character's script and the actor both showed him to be totally at ease. So due to a lack of sincere emotion and charm, Swades needed a strong plot to make it enjoyable. A strong plot it has not. Message and patriotism aside, a movie needs to be good. Setting up a turbine was downright boring, and the director had to resort to exaggerating the suspense to add any interest (Will it work? Will it not work?! I mean, of course it'll work, but keep looking at the dial...oh no, it might not work...). Providing electricity to the village wasn't a good climax either because there was no conflict -- the villagers seemed quite happy without electricity (at one point its absence was even praised (fireworks), and at another point they made great fun without it (the star-song)). What I did like a lot was the symbolism of the water bottle. Mohan didn't drink water from his village and only from the bottle water lest his health is damaged from the bad water quality. But then we see what is probably the most touching scene in the whole movie, the child selling a glass of water for 25paisa, and Mohan drinks it with SRK's trademark teary-eyes. Swades' biggest flaws (also its foundations) are idealism and simplicity. It wants to be a 'message-movie' but that is not how life is. Believe it or not, an immigrant's relationship with their country of birth can be very complex--more complex, anyways, than 'leave everything, go back, and make it a better place'.",

            "content": "One of the most important spirit lifting and patriotic films of the last decade.It follow the John F. Kennedy's line \"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for the country\". Apart from working in a job, be it private or government, then going home to have a wife/husband, so to take forward the legacy, producing population and calling it as our babies, what are we doing for the country? Setting up institutions is not enough we must be doing something to make this a better place to live, I want to do something but before I begin, I need money so I must earn money good enough to be able to spare for a few outside my very own family. It brings the questions like should I be contributing to the huge population by producing one or should I adopt and fight for removing orphans and make my place a better place to live in.Who would agree to my thoughts in a society as hypocritical as ours is what I always ask myself, having said all about my thoughts, this is a movie that I always loved since the first time I saw it in Sangeet Theatre with a big group of my friends. It made a few of us say \"Bijli, Bijli\" at the climax, like Lagaan made us say \"Bhuvan, Bhuvan\". Ashutosh Gowariker had proved with this film, that films can be long enough if there is a real need for it, this was extremely long and it had to be long because there are so many issues within a country as diversified as us. The prime purpose that I love the film is it lifts by spirit and fills in the \"can do\" spirit that is vaguely missing. Now, the technical departments except for editing are sublime. A R Rahman, gave a score that stood even today as a great. One can never get bored of \"Yunhi Chala Chal\" or \"Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera\" and the whole of background score is just apt to the visuals. The writing and screenplay are meticulous, be it keeping off the glass when offered in the beginning and then taking a sip at the railway station and feeling the water for the first time, or be it the nuances of love between Geeta (Gayatri Joshi) and Mohan Bhargav (Shahrukh Khan). Performances are exemplary from each and specifically, Shahrukh Khan gave the most composed performance of his life, his emotions were natural, when I saw this in theatre, I was very apprehensive coz I do not like Shahrukh's choice of movies, but went for this solely because of Ashutosh and ARR. I was happy and in the process of the movie, I learnt that actually Shahrukh is a good actor who is spoilt by his choices of films. This is the only film that Gaytri Joshi was a part of, and she made Geet her own, by becoming the character. She is the epitome of a perfect Indian women who is traditionally progressive. She knows the traditions and she knows the purpose of her life too. Rare to find a strong willed woman like her. Also, Kishori Balal as Kaveriamma and the huge supporting cast did an excellent job. Ah, so proud to have seen this so many times and I love this movie each time I saw it. It's not flawless, no one simply agrees to hand over 100 men for work. You cannot produce electricity just like that, creating some basic apparatus. Yet, the energy behind it, the resolve, the spirt are what made this movie a great one. With nearly 3 and half hours running time, it makes us ask so many questions to ourselves. Finally, I am again asking myself the same question, am I born, to earn a job, marry, have kids, work for their school fees and education, pass on my assets to my kids and die. Or is there a bigger purpose to life, if so am I doing it? A 5/5 for this, no less than that ever to one of my favourite movies ever.",

For example, Shahrukh is traveling in crowded buses and second-class non-air-conditioned trains in India. In the US, he is riding in his spacious, luxury Jaguar with Cherry wood panels. However, all SRK feels in those cold leather seats is loneliness as he imagines seeing his love waving goodbye to him in the rear-view mirror. Thus, he can attain all the material wealth being a top-notch engineer working for NASA in the glitzy and glamorous US, but he can never be happy away from his homeland and loved ones. A.R. Rehman has composed outstanding music--I think one of the best of 2004. This movie has several, beautiful tear-jerking scenes.

The story is not as absorbing - it doesn't have the meat to last for 3 long hours - and even the narrative unfolds at a sluggish and lethargic pace. In fact, the narrative gets so boring and cumbersome after a point that you seriously wonder whether the editor had gone on a holiday or perhaps, he was so fascinated by the director's work that he didn't feel like trimming/deleting the unwanted portions.Gowariker's screenplay also does not have enough moments that would instantly catch the attention of the masses. For a majority of moviegoers,the film holds scant appeal. Gowariker's intentions of depicting the problems of rural India may be noble, but it's not too great an idea of entertainment, specifically for that viewer who is thirsting for entertainment and believes in sunshine/feel-good/escapist cinema. Besides, the length only acts as a deterrent.Even the much-hyped NASA sequences aren't something an ordinary viewer would be ecstatic to watch.To his credit, Gowariker has drawn fine performances from the cast. And a few sequences do have the masterly strokes of an efficient technician. But that's about it!A.R. Rahman's music may sound soothing when you hear it, but when viewed with the story, most of the songs are of the 'fast forward' variety. Clearly, there's not one track you carry home after the screening has concluded. In fact, it would be in the best interests of the film to delete a few songs in the second half, for that would perk up the goings-on to an extent. It would prove to be a good exercise in some damage control at least!Cinematography is excellent. The rural look has been captured beautifully. Dialogues are outstanding, but they tend to get into a sermonizing mode after a point.Shah Rukh Khan is extremely likable. He stands firm on his feet in dramatic sequences, confirming yet again that he's not merely a super-star, but a super actor as well. Gayatri Joshi makes a confident debut, though she can go easy on her expressions at times. Yet, considering that this happens to be her maiden big screen appearance as also the fact that she's paired with the country's biggest star, Gayatri manages to make her presence felt.The film has a number of characters, but if one were to choose those who displayed their skills effectively, it would be in this order: Kishori Ballal, Rajesh Vivek and Dayashanker Pandey. Makrand Deshpande gets one song and scene, that's all.Unfortunately, SWADES disappoints big time. The story of SWADES would've been ideal for a documentary, but for a feature film with a running time of 3 hour plus and starring the country's biggest star, it just doesn't work.Yes, SWADES has a few interesting moments. But a handful of deftly executed sequences aren't enough. It had to be one exciting joyride, with the 3 hour plus narrative grabbing your attention from the word 'Go'.The film may appeal to a handful of critics and await the 5-star ratings! and those who believe in this form of cinema, but for a majority of viewers, SWADES will be remembered as a good opportunity gone waste. To put it bluntly, SWADES is high on hype, low on substance and extremely low on entertainment. Ashutosh Gowariker has missed the bus this time!",

Although there were times when the screenplay could use visuals instead of words, I thought there were other times when the symbolism was brilliant (it worked and was relevant to the plot). Most Hollywood movies (yes, the good ones) have messages and are preachy, so why not an Indian movie? Ashutosh is a smart and gutsy filmmaker and Shahrukh should be commended for signing on. Great acting by the new actress and the villagers and Shahrukh is endearing. I would definitely watch this movie again, and recommend it to people who need a little reminding about the ideals and principles the Indian Independence movement was based on.",

Shah Rukh Khan is a pretty good actor and so is Gayatri Joshi, not to mention stunningly beautiful. The interaction between Mohan (Shah Rukh) and Gita (Gayatri) in many places is really charmingly done and mature such as the eye contact game when she is tying Shah Rukh's \"dhoti\".The music is also very good. The song \"Yuhin Chala Chal Rahi\" is an fusion of Indian classical, bollywood and western rhythm which really works. The lyrics of the songs are also meaningful.The only negative I would highlight is that the subtitles during the songs are a little overly poetic and \"olde English\" - like which detracts from the real lyrics of the song.Definitely recommend it!",

What follows next is the measure taken up by him to improve the electricity in the village. Swades is directed, scripted and story told by Ashutosh Gowarikar (Lagaan). Ashutosh has chosen the story which is completely different from his previous venture. The direction is impressive handling actually many sequences with perfection. One of my favourite scene is the sequence in train where Sharukh Khan tries to hold his emotions after buying water from akid in kullar for 25 paise. He is marvelous and has given his career best performance. The story of NRI coming back to his roots and doing something worthwhile is equally absorbing with amazing cinematography capturing the beautiful locales of Indian villages. Dialogues are inspiring. Music by the legend is A.R.Rahman is soul- riveting. Each and every song has some message to tell with beautiful lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. Coming to the performance , I couldn't have imagined anyone but Sharukh Khan playing Mohan Barghav. As I mentioned , the actor has given his career best and very well deserved performance. The complete change in his character from NRI who taunts at the weak Indian systems to a person who starts caring for the village and goes one step to implant the 24 hour electric supply is superbly handled. I loved his sequence in the train where he couldn't control his outburst after observing the struggle and poverty of the villagers. Gayatri Joshi is fine but Kishori Balal as Sharukh's nanny is splendid. Swades , overall , is an amazing movie with a very well-intentioned message to do something for the country.

Mkaes you spend at least one minute and stop thinking about self and focus on the society as a whole. Well done Ashutosh, great encore to Lagaan.",

He can pull of easy more comfortable roles as they are not demanding by the film. But this film demanded an actor who can act beyond himself. Shah rukh failed to do that and failed this movie. He must attempt to better himself by playing less of the standard roles, I acknowledge they are giving him hits but thats a tribute to the style of film. Romance and Family films with a few stars are major hits no matter of the performance. I can think of a few actors who would of done themselves credit Salman, Amir as well as some others and the newcomer Arshad Warsi can successfully portray themselves in any role.",

Being a NASA scientist coming over to India from the USA, the hero realized that certain things that he took for granted are a luxurious commodity .People in his village didn't even have the means to what we would call basic commodity. He recognized the need to do something about it and he does for the betterment of his village and its people. Its a movie with India in heart and spirit. It could be analyzed as a movie for all Indians staying abroad to give something back to your country, for you are its children.It surely brings out the patriot in you.",

            "content": "Swades is the story of Mohan Bhargava (played by Shahrukh Khan), a bright young Indian scientist at NASA. Though bright and cheerful, there is a palpable loneliness in his life in US -- he seems to be longing for some kind of family life. That longing combined with his guilt about leaving his nanny (Kaveri Amma, played by Kishori Ballal) in an old-age home takes him to village Charanpur in India-- he intends to take his nanny to US with him. The five weeks he spends in the village are life-changing. He hadn't probably been to rural India before, and now the contrast with US is even sharper. He mixes with the locals, makes friends with a dhaba-owner (Melaram, played by Dayashanker Pandey) and the local postman (played by Rajesh Vivek), and falls for a girl (Gita, played by Gayatri Joshi). In helping Gita get more students for her school, he challenges the strict caste based social structure though still remaining emotionally very uninvolved. One incident, one chance to see closely someone suffering from this -- in this case, a landless tenant unable to do cultivation due to his caste, changes him. He is no longer an outsider freely criticizing the social system. He now feels personally involved, disillusioned, frustrated, perhaps even a bit guilty for what he sees around him. His attempt to convince villagers that things can be better, that they can bring about the change, are futile. To prove his point, he undertakes to build a micro hydel dam and bring electricity to the village.His moment of truth comes when his project at NASA can no longer wait further for him. He has to go back, but that means leaving behind his friends, his beau, and the emotional bonding he has now developed with his surroundings. What does he do? Let me not attempt to win the producer's wrath by answering this question -- watch the movie instead to figure this out! Characters: Most of the screen time is spent on the Mohan Bhargava (MB)'s thoughts, and he is someone a lot of young Indian diaspora may identify themselves with. He is shown as very serious minded lonely workaholic in US; in India, he is a very extroverted, cheerful, while still working hard. This contrast is not well explained -- a bit of insight into his social life US would have helped. Is it the natural meddling attitude of us Indians that, though maybe considered polite in the West, brings out the extroverted in him in India? Gita can probably seen as a catalyst in MB's life -- an idealist, an example of opportunities she had forgone for her ideals, she by her own life, indirectly influences MB's turn-around. Her mathematical ability, thrown in as a bit of character nuance add humor and helps MB's initial attraction (guys like smart girls!) to her. On hearing MB works for NASA, asks him if he is an astronaut. This scene is a stroke of genius -- it gives way to her dreamy perception of space and astronauts. This curiosity promises to break the ice between them, but his negative answer almost lets her down, and she seems to retreat back into her shell and initial indifference for him. Some scenes don't seem to gel in with her strong-minded character, like her pleading MB against taking Kaveri Amma. Having it as the interval scene seems to be a failed attempt to add an element of suspense to what is otherwise not really a thriller. Later, when MB is testing the microhydel dam, she unfortunately gets treated like all Bollywood heroine characters -- getting an honorary seat next to their beau in spite of not visibly contributing, either intellectually or manually, to her beau's efforts. Kaveri Amma has a bit of humor thrown into her character, a bit of mystery (\"I know what I am doing\" when question by Gita on why she has sent MB to collect the rent), displaying a bit of child-like fascination with the power of technology though not quite well versed in it (such as when she explains a village panch what a satellite is), and a lot of typical doting maternal Bollywood fare. Melaram and the postman add in light moments, and have some very realistic traits -- they are attracted to the charm and curiosity of life abroad, and will go to unexpected lengths to make a foreign returned guest feel welcome. The other villages, in spite of their initial skepticism, criticism, and antagonism to MB's views, are no Amrish Puri like all evil villain characters who will hire goons etc to beat our poor hero up. They change, some more slowly than others, and the slowness is a reflection of what they lived all their life believing, rather than their big evil plans and conspiracy involving all the government officials. A refreshing change of plot, yes, but whether that this portrayal is more realistic in the land of Mulayam Singh and Laloo is questionable :) Conclusion:As the movie title (\"Swades - We, the people\") puts it, Swades is about building the nation. Its about the realization that we, as Indians, are the same, as beautifully put in \"Yeh tara, woh tara\" song's lyrics. Its about change, about challenging the de facto, our old mindset and looking for better alternatives.It is definitely a very sincere earnest attempt at portraying what is increasingly becoming a major issue for Indians abroad. It has been unfairly criticized for having a documentary like feel -- it actually connects us to a reality most of us in urban idea have long been disconnected from, and it makes us all question our roots and what we are doing, and for that alone, should be watched.",

Good story, very thought provoking and very realistic. Its about Mohan Bhargav (SRK) who works for NASA, and comes to India for a reason and realises how this country is effected by certain socio-political elements. what he does to correct them is the main story line. It was really interesting to see the director showing some scenes of Mohan as a NASA employee and all the GPM thing was quite a bit research. I mean from a bollywood movie this is more than expected. First of all credit should go to the director Ashutosh.G, when i saw his first movie Lagaan i thought he was a little lucky in making such a good movie and moreover he had a cricket match in the movie. But after watching Swades i now realise what kind of movie director he is, absolutely brilliant. SRK on the other hand... i would say 'the best' performance from him so far. Even though I am a great fan of SRK I never thought he could act so well. As Neha Dhupia once quoted \"only two things sell in India, SRK and Sex\". This movie will explain the first part of the quote. One more thing great about this movie is the background music. World knew about A.R.Rehman after he got an Oscar, but we in India know him since his Roja (first Rehman movie as music director) days. He is truly nothing less than a legend. The background music when chiku (character in movie) shows the house of kaveri amma to Mohan, something like 'aayooooo reeeee.....' gave me goose bumps. And the last but not least Gayatri joshi as Gita did quite a good job as well, i know she is not that famous of an actor as she is in modelling, considering the fact that this is her first movie she did well. Hope to see more of her in future.From me 9.5/10 for this movie. Some might say that this movie is a bit too long, but for such a great story line and such and excellent acting i think you won't realise the length of the movie.",

And it does nothing but reaffirm this superficial 'concern' for a fictional rural poor (not that there isn't such a category in reality, but this particular type in the movie is a work of fiction). Mohan's self realization is at the center here, not the 'simple' village folk who move in and out of his life as and when needed. There is not a shred of realism and people's accents, their costumes and their general disposition makes it seem that this particular village is a blend of UP, Bihar, Kerala all at once. And the methods for 'swades' brand of rural upliftment are highly innovative too-- dance sequences and technological utopianism. AR Rehman's music is, though, a high point of the movie, as are a couple of performances, mostly by the Lagaan cast. SRK does what he's best at-- shedding tears; and here he finds a willing companion--his old nanny. Some of the camera shots are 'inspired' by 'The Motorcycle Diaries', and incidentally, they're the best of the lot. In the end, the tagline 'We, the people' is a misnomer. Instead the movie turns out to be 'SRK, the saviour'.",

Even though Swades did not receive approval from Indian critics, this movie for me was one of the best things to come from Indian cinema.The story is quite simple and something which all of us NRIs relate to - being abroad, lonely for long and craving for that companionship and love which we all grew up with back in India. Childhood back in India was full of fun, with cousins, friends, neighbours, relatives and living abroad deprives you of all that. So I could relate this movie soo much to my circumstances, especially when the final song arrives, I thought it was time to pack my bags and head home for good. Sadly, life does not work this way. Still, this movie reminds me of all those golden days, long gone now and puts a smile on my face every time I watch it.Coming to the movie, it is full of sweet nothings and strong social messages. The film makes a strong case of people coming together as Humans and not to distinguish or discriminate! Such a simple message and it is shown in the most simplistic but very effective way in the movie. The love story between the lead characters was subtle but very sweet and effective. The songs, they elevate the movie onto a new level altogether! All the songs are masterpieces and no one other than A.R.Rahman could do full justice for this film. Just listen to \"Yeh jo desh hai tera\", it surely makes you feel nostalgic. \"Saawarya\" and \"Dekho Na\" are excellent love ballads, whereas \"Yuhi Chala\" and \"Yeh Tara\" provoke the sense of fun, enjoyment and unity! \"Aahista\" is one of the best lullabies ever composed and \"Pal pal hai bhari\" tells an episode from Ramayana in a convincing way.Swades is one of my favourite Bollywood movies and I still own a pristine collectors edition DVD of this film and watch it time to time, whenever I am feeling home-sick.",

That's what makes me like Hollywood movies and that's what this movie gets right.I cannot emphasise how important that is to me. No matter how good the story or the production values or the star cast, if the acting is crappy, I cannot tolerate the movie.

Perhaps the only glaring flaw is the unnecessary length of the film \u0096 I thought 2 songs could definitely have been omitted from the final picture. But having said that it is an opening to a wonderful new era in our films that we had all but given up on. The story of an NRI visiting India, mixing with the people who are the true representatives of rural India, his emotions, his silent observations and western outlooks, his experiences and ultimate dilemma. Shahrukh Khan has underplayed his character to near perfection and for a change he is presented as a human rather than a demi-God. There is no overacting, no unnecessary histrionics and the 'gyan' is also restricted to the minimum. One or two scenes like where the heroine is in conversation with her prospective in-laws could have perhaps been less pedantic and more toned down. But otherwise the Lagaan director is very visible in the Swades flick. It is not a groundbreaking film in its songs or choreography but it is one of the most sensible and down-to-earth films that you can hope for in Indian cinema. While we can hum and dance to the romances filmed by the Chopras and Johars it is very rare to see reality presented in such a positive and inspirational manner by a Bollywood director. Coming post Yuva it is heartening to know that influential people in India are thinking of our country as a possibility for real prosperity. The interest and effort put into this movie cannot be for profit alone. It is moving to see filmmakers moving beyond the usual song/dance sequences and slapstick comedy and delving into serious movie-making. You can't make a Swades if you are not touched by the India we live in today. And for that we need to make films like this successful, commercially viable. It is serious cinema because the subject is serious. Full marks to Ashutosh Gowriker for going beyond one's petty sense of self and looking at the larger picture and understanding just how small we really are on the face of the earth. Do go to the theatres and make this movie a hit so we can encourage these social thinkers. Like the director himself says \"It is not a call to only the NRIs to come back home, it is a call to resident Indians also to look at the India that is and give something back.\"",

            "content": "Swades review :Ashutosh Gowariker almost reached the Oscar stage with Lagaan (2001) and missed the ultimate honour by a whisker. Lagaan is undoubtedly one of the finest creations of Indian cinema and many books have already been written on it. Unfortunately, the towering success of Lagaan weighed large on his next Swades which was dismissed by then critics as a three and half hour long lecture on moral science. They had clearly missed the underlying pertinent theme that Gowariker wanted to highlight...A NASA officer (Shah Rukh Khan) travelling to an Indian village to meet his childhood nanny (Kishori Ballal) and then contributing to its upliftment might have sounded too simplistic on paper but the way Ashutosh treats his subject so tenderly makes Swades a slow burner which hits you only in its climax. Yup, this is like a premium scotch which should be relished with right amount of patience and respect and it will certainly give you a high at the end..Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) is outstanding as Mohan Bhargav and this is a role for which he will attain immortality. It is the best performance of his career and I cannot think of any other star who could've fit in here so seamlessly. Not even Aamir who was approached initally but declined the offer!!The best part of Swades is every character - even peripheral one like the local postman (Rajesh Vivek) amazed by this new concept of email - remains memorable. The pretty Gayatri Joshi, cast opposite SRK, is totally convincing as the strong willed Gita. Note her chemistry with SRK when she helps him wear a dhoti.Gowariker and AR Rahman combo works wonders again after Lagaan and all the songs sync in perfectly with the narrative. My personal favourite is \"Yuhi chala chal rahi\" picturised on SRK and Makrand Deshpande playing a fakir he meets enroute his village.The dialogues are also a winner. Debating on whether India is a \"Mahaan desh\", SRK states in one scene \"Main nahi manta hamara desh duniya ka sabse mahaan desh hai. Lekin yeh zaroor manta hoon ki hum mein kabliyat hai, taaqat hai, apne desh ko mahaan banane ki\". So very true!!In another scene, the film drives its point without a single dialogue. It is on the railway platform where SRK buys water from the poor boy and drinks it. Just see his expressions at that particular moment. It pretty much sums up the message the film wants to convey...Outstanding stuff, indeed!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

He falls in love with Gita, a school teacher, who stays with Kaveriamma. He realizes the importance of staying in India with her and after one trip decides to stay forever in India.Pros: A film that positively changes the mind of a person fallen victim to brain-drain, superb filming locations. I personally liked the caravan. The song \"Dekho na\" is superb. Kaveriamma is lovely and everyone associated with film has done great.Cons: SRK has really acted well except for one scene where he smokes cigarette and acts to have quit and again resumes.

But then I realized that the impression the first scene gave was spot on.Stereotyping scientists, scientists who work for NASA are not this dull they have great lives. NASA is a collaborative effort if you don't have great social skills you will not fit in, nobody does anything on their own.I am sorry but it is the directors DUTY to make the viewer sympathize or at least care for the protagonist as quickly as possible and starting with a \"I am so smart\" scene(which by the way was not at all cleverly executed, I would have had questions after his little speech because some of the points were cyclical) which is not fun and bland is no way to do this. If you are going to have a speech which is to sound \"smart\" from a guy in NASA you have to have some actual physics talk and some real precise science on what the plan is.

Then, just as the second half seemed to acquire momentum, a song would come along to slow things down. 2. The dialogue, which plumbed new depths of imbecility and obviousness in some scenes (whereas others were extremely well-written). 3. The fact that the film raises so many more questions than it resolves. Which is not necessarily a bad thing by itself but the issues were raised haphazardly and without structure.But, the movie has been made with obvious passion and sincerity by people who feel strongly about the problems facing India. The cast (including, surprise! Shahrukh) deliver good performances and the music is eminently hummable.

His genius here was to chose an A-list actor who would not only do justice to the central character, but also give the kind of exposure an important film like this commands. In my opinion Shah Rukh Khan delivers a career best performance in his role as 'Mohan'. You see SRK stripped of his usual Bollywood fare, and deliver a honest but charismatic performance that is truly trying to make a change in this world. Credit for this performance must not be taken away from the director, who helped extract those extra little nuances and depth from his lead actors.The messages in this movie do not instantly throw themselves at you, rather they are conveyed like subliminal images and in the form of body language. The cinematography is original and flows gracefully throughout, and it makes an impact in epic terms when you least expect it. Style is never sacrificed over substance, but nevertheless the film has so much style it goes unnoticed on a first viewing. Characters are given the opportunity to breath a personality which is rare in modern Indian cinema. Both the script and screenplay simply mesmerises.You take so much away with you in this movie that it's almost thought provoking.

The moments when Ramayana is displayed as religious symbol. The songs that captures the heart for every feeling throughout the movie. The decent affair between Gayatri and Mohan. The scientific application in building a hydro electric project for the village. The project built is displayed as easily understandable by laity. Well done.The film is out and out optimistic. It is set within the positive environment. The antagonist elements like indian caste orthodoxy and bigotry are loosely shown. It seems unreal but also acceptable in regards to the film theme. Had Shah rukh faced a village where negative elements were stronger he would have quit India returned to NASA forever. But Ashutosh Sir wanted to make a positive representation of Indian society so we see film as it is. Its theme of optimism is praiseworthy. Though reality is halted a slight bit, still, we can't neglect the issue that good people influences goodness in society. So optimism exists through them.For me the most comedy scene in the movie is actually very serious. It's when John asks Mohan about leaving NASA.

Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, this one faced scathing critical response during its theatrical release. Swades is arguably a beautiful movie considering the premise being simple and made by a director who believes in preaching to the masses.Swades was a magnificent film held together by a series of episodic allegories, vivid social commentary, strong characters, a poignant love story and a towering performance by Shah Rukh Khan who manages to show dimensions to his acting that only a director like Gowariker could have been able to extenuate and bring to the foreground.Swades has soul stirring music by A.R. Rahman with tunes of Yeh Jo Desh Hai Tera Swades Hai Mera, still fresh on the our minds. The Director has meticulously articulated social issues in rural outfits of our country which is deeply touching. Some say this movie is boring, so it would be wrong for me to argue as understanding a movie depends on an individual's interpretation.Swades was a step in the right direction for Indian cinema but the post the release it seemed as though it was a step that may have come too soon.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udc4dGoods :\n1.Deep Social Commentary\n2.King Khan's Exemplary Acting\n3.Beautiful Hidden Moral.\n.\n\ud83d\udc4e Bads :\n1.

Specially the Haridas scene, was brilliant. Scenes like this (and the one where boy sells water on the railway station) brings the best of the director and actors. And I know this is not just a movie, it reflects truth and that's why it makes the movie more commendable. I guess, living abroad makes me understand this movie better. I hope people (including me) don't just see this as another movie and do end up taking some inspiration from it. This is the kind of movie that our society needs to see.",

After watching the first 30 minutes, I could predict how the story was going to go. And, as expected there had to be a pretty woman (who looked very incongruous in a rural setting with her plucked eyebrows, boutique-style dresses) to keep the Hero interested. In spite of these flaws, this movie is definitely worth watching. The movie has several stereotypes, many of which are true (ignorant village leaders, caste-ism, etc), but others, like that of the dumb compliant villagers, are somewhat irritating. When Shah Rukh Khan wants build a dam, all the villagers stand around and help in an extra-ordinarily orderly manner. Indians are never this orderly ! I read some reviews calling this one of the best Indian movies ever...not true. Its a merely a good movie, not a great one.",

            "content": "He is the one who gave us the most astonishing and unique motion picture of the 21st century, made in Hindi mainstream cinema, till today. Lagaan came up as a fresh breath of oxygen and revived the silver screen with its sheer cinematic beauty. And now Ashutosh Gowariker is up again with Swades. And yes he beholds all promises. This intelligent and enlightening story is as unique and as fresh as Lagaan, evoking real ( n not Neo) patriotism. Its about NASA's project manager Mohan Bhargav, played by Shahrukh Khan, who's a NRI and his Bhaarat-Darshan.His journey into the heart of rural India, the unprivileged Bhaarat of shattered dreams and grieves,which makes him to walk on Bhuvan's footprints and to light the bulbs of new hopes. And the way he does that,.. makes every frame a gem here.Add on to this the perfect casting ( you find your granny in the voice of Fatimaa bee), some of the most beautiful music (including the background score) of his career so far, by the genius A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Javed Akhtar who pens immortal lines as 'Man Se Raavan Jo Nikale, Raam Usi Ke Man Me Hai', 'Yun To Saare Sukh Hai Barse, Par Door Tu Hai Apne Ghar Se' and 'Ye Tara Wo Tara... ' in which stars are used again as a metaphor to denote individuals among the masses, the charming face of Gayatri Joshi and stellar display of his histrionics by Shahrukh Khan which signals that the superstar has actually become an actor. Technically too, the movie is very sound and a quality product. The only disappointment,though,is the picturization of the song Pal Pal Hai Bhaari,which has been childishly choreographed by Saroj Khan. Nevertheless, Swades is as important for Shahrukh as Lagaan was for Amir.It gives him the much needed diversity and an opportunity to break the myth that he can't do any better.His visual presence has got the intensity of a fusion reaction, here. Put aside all his earlier films and watch Swades.It has given him a new horizon. The way in which it's different from Lagaan is that Lagaan was a feel-good film and gave us pour entertainment whereas Swades points out at what's going wrong. Off course, there is at it's best optimism to sweeten the pain but due to this difference,regular audience may find it preachy, though this movie will count among the best Hindi movies on rural background with the likes of Lagaan, Do Bigha Jameen, Mother India, Naya Daur, Teesari Kasam etc. Its a world heritage for its literary style in which it addresses the dilemma of the youth of the most of the third world countries and showcases the noblest idea of what best a man can do to his land. The story unfolds in a very subtle and simple manner yet we feel a current being flowing under the skin. Gowariker uses very basic methodology for his screenplay, yet there is no dearth of similes, hidden meanings and charismatic use of metaphors on the celluloid. For example, observe that how poetically the commodity 'water' is used in the narration. Mohan carries his packaged water bottles with him and bathes in his caravan for the first half. Then we see vast waters again where he sits in a boat while his lady love is thinking about him dancing around the village lake. Then in one of the magical scenes of all time, on his return journey, his mind being bombarded with thoughts questioning his own existence and that of a land which he once called his country, he actually drinks regular water from a 'kulhad' watching perplexedly at the child selling it (did you say.. \"my eyes had water in them,too\"?)! Now, imagine how mahatma Gandhi was thrown of that train in Africa that made him realizes a thing or two about himself and his whole life.. Bingo! They are parallel! All thanks to the book 'Bapu Kuti' by Rajnee Bakhshi whose, in fact, real life instances have made for the actual inspiration behind this motion picture. Moving ahead with water though, then we see Mohan having an 'indianised' bath inside Geeta's house, later Mohan generates Hydroelectricity for the village folks, and in the process, he has to dive in that collector-pond, fight some dead plant root with both hands and emerge out wet! Then there is this shot where he soaks his feet in the lake, offers water to the dying daadaji and ultimately for the last shot, again uses water to get rid of the mud. You see a graph in it? This was him splashing back into his roots! Mohan got drenched in the Indian flavor layer by layer. These parallels which can be found here are endless as they were in Lagaan,and this brilliance in the screenplay, calls for a comparison of Gowariker with filmmakers of the Golden-Era like Raj Kapoor, Satyajit Ray, Gurudutt, Vhi Shantaram and Mehboob. He simply doesn't belong to our times as he is someone who can think big, original, Indian and make films which can be as good as those of the old times and even Hollywood (yes.. amazingly, he doesn't fell short on any technical aspect of film making either! Rather, he is superb at it..)!! Swades, though it might not work at the Box-Office ('Business' can be the term for a film but here, we have a piece of art!) is a successful film because those for whom this movie was meant have got it's message. It's is a film on India, by an Indian and for an intelligent Indian but it will cater to all who care for the actual meaning and the philosophy behind a very commonly used word-'patriotism'!!",

I only curse myself why didn't I watch it sooner, probably because I didn't have the maturity at that age to understand this kind of cinema. This movie hits where it hurts. An absolute brilliant cinematic experience. No one else could have portrayed the character the way SRK did. Just fabulous, this kind of acting is why SRK is aptly called King of bollywood.

It is a story of a descent N.R.I guy named mohan bhargav well settled in u.s. who comes to India in order to settle his pending family affairs. It is from here that he starts feeling for nation and realizes what he is going to lose by leaving the nation. The slow and effective treatment to the movie could only be given by ashutosh gowarikar and believe me its really a courageous attempt from honest heart. the story has its own romantic side with both characters gayatri joshi and shahrukh playing perfect couple, especially the chemistry they share with their body language makes it a rare bollywood flick in today's date with classy romantic touch to it.The important thing about the movie is that it regularly provides you with punches that makes it a wonderful pleasure to watch. To name a few of the moments in the movie, do watch shahrukh's reaction when geeta (character name of gayatri joshi) refuses to marry a guy with conservative values of 18th century; how srk reacts towards ill treatment of villagers against lower caste people, how he feels apologetic to her granny because of his ignorance towards her over the years. The movie rightly depicts how we Indians turn our faces from our duties and are somehow part of this corrupt world and are not brave enough to admit shortcomings of our nation and still think we being well ahead of other nations because of our so-called value system and how we defend our actions as a part of our value system. The movie has its heart at the right place with scenes of young guy selling water to passengers commuting by train for mere quarter of a rupee , romantic track\"Dekho Na\" b\\w gayatri joshi and srk really well shot, how people and geeta feel when srk leaves India really being the scenes to watch out for in movie ; especially last track which rightly summarizes the movie's motive.my rating 9/10",

But Swades is simple and straight to the point while being optimistic at the same time. The images of the boy selling water and looking for 75 paise change as the train moves ahead will stay in our minds for some time to come.Unlike Lagaan where the songs helped take the narrative ahead, here in Swades the songs tend to slow down the narrative. The first half is a bit of a downer but the second half is what really makes the movie so good.The maturity of the director is amply illustrated when the protagonist completes his project at NASA and returns to India, coz in just another Hindi movie, he would have abandoned his passion and stayed with the villagers and tried to become a hero.For me definitely the movie of the year 2004 !",

Debutant Gayathri Joshi has a bright future ahead. With this movie, Ashuthosh joins the class of directors like Mani Ratnam and Rajkumar Santhoshi. Swades will certainly get some awards at the National level (A R Rahman's music is a sure bet) and will surely be India's Oscar nomination next year.But it is heart-breaking to see such a nice movie heading for a failure at the Box Office.

It is a brilliant original piece of work no doubt but those words do not do justice to the feelings that Swades conjured in me as I watched it.Comparing it with Lagaan is - for the lack of a better phrase - like comparing apples to oranges. Swades is one of the most passionately and practically patriotic viewing experiences of my life. It is the patriotism that some of us feel and the rest of us should.I do not remember hearing a single musical composition, dialogue or seeing a visual that talked about desh-bhakti or bharat. In fact, I do not remember seeing the Indian flag even once. But since watching a little gem of a movie called Dhoop, I have not seen a film that is more intrinsically Indian in its emotional content.In Swades the villain is the enemy within and not a country, organisation or group of people. The enemy is us. And the ability to influence and hence destroy that this enemy possesses is far greater than what the aforementioned entities could ever hope to have.I remember reading somebody's comment here that there is no brand name clothing, no grand entries, no sermons on country and duty, no breathtaking visuals - because villages don't have any breathtaking visuals. They are at times congested and claustrophobic and at best minimal and clean.The most brilliant directors of our time break through with that uniquely brilliant film that is not a Hollywood rip-off and that actually has a prepared and detailed screenplay. Varma with Shiva, Ratnam with Roja, Bhansali with Khamoshi, Santoshi with Ghayal, Kukunoor with Hydrebad Blues, Farhan Akhtar with Dil Chahta Hai and Gowariker with Lagaan. And just like all of them have proved with their subsequent efforts that they are here to change the direction of cinema and are not just one-film flukes, Gowariker has proved with Swades that he is truly our filmmaker and one of our finest. 10/10.",

So he decides to go to India and meet her. Her name is Kaveri Amma. After going to India, he inquires her address, and finds that she lives in a small village. So he embarks on that journey. In the village of Charanpur she lives, after going to that village and meeting her, he decides to stay a few days there and take her back with him.

But he also discovers the problems faced by the villagers, the frequent power cuts, the caste divisions, the poor conditions of people, children working for food, and these problems shake him mentally. Instead of willing to help people in the village, he goes away to US, for his work needs him. But in US he cannot stop thinking of India, the thoughts of India haunt him day and night, until he decides to quit his fabulously luxurious life and come to his country , to this small village and help the people there, and live there.Artists performance, Shahrukh Khan gives one of his best performances ever.

His acting gets elevated due in part by superior direction by Gowarikar and excellent acting from the supporting cast! SRK- Gayatri chemistry is subtle yet mesmerizing! Kishori Ballal is top notch!Great job Ashutosh Gowarikar!",

And after watching almost 460 non-Indian International movies (Yes, I have watched those much Non-Indian movies.Right from Sir Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' to Benigni's 'Life Is Beautiful' to Spielberg's 'Munich'.I keep a record of every movie I watch) and some important Hindi movies, I give my opinion : 'Swades' is not only Gowarikar's Best but also the Most Optimistic and Practical Indian movie ever made. This movie is undoubtedly spreading Light in the hearts of many Indians and also many non-Indians too.This movie is present in 'My Top Ten Bollywood Movies of All Time' along with Kamal Haasan's 'Hey Ram(2000)- India's Official Entry to the Oscars for the Year 2000-2001', Farhan Akhtar's 'Dil Chahta Hai(2001)', Bhansali's 'Black(2004), Kukunoor's 'Dor(2006)', Nair's 'Monsoon Wedding(2001)'- (even though it officially Canadian) and still other four movies. I liked Shaharukh's Performance in this movie as much I liked it in 'Hey Ram'.Even though he may not be a Denzel Washington or a Tom Hanks or Robert De Niro still he did do a great Job.",

After watching for 1 hour i realized the movie runtime was 3hours 15 minutes and i didn't find it lagging in any way. King khan's acting was like master class and the story of the movie was wonderful. There is no intro or mass scenes just a simple movie that has a message to all.The music also has equal importance in the movie, in conveying the emotions of the characters. Although i didn't like all the songs, but it was well placed through out the movie. And romantic scenes had a good chemistry throughout. Kaveri amma, Mohan, Gita and all other characters will be on our minds even after the movie.",

But I loved it. I have never been into a Bollywood movie (or tried), nor have I ever really watched a full length (3hr+) Indian film but this one made me happy. This is one of the greats, where I come in, not knowing a thing about the movie. Not reading the Synopsis and I am blown away. At first the subtitles were annoying, because I could hear the characters talking, speaking English, and the subtitles said the wrong thing. It was funny and silly at first but then just unprofessional of Netflix. At first I thought (knowing nothing of the movie, even the year it came out) \"Ohh now, what have I gotten myself into.\" because the main character is sitting on a couch telling his best friend about why he is sad. And from the camera angle, and the score, and the background music, it can be conceived/predicted=\"Ohh no, he is going to tell us a flashback\" and then once that thought spawned in my head I was bracing for impact, waiting for the movie to change to childhood flashbacks. Then, to my surprise, the next seen. We have our main character and a friend singing. Dancing in the most Clich\u00e9 Indian way. Making me so happy I turned the movie on. I don't know the director nor the actor but I do know that they stroke...striked?...struck gold with this movie. I have never lived in poverty-ridden-India and I doubt I ever will, but I feel as though I have experienced the culture of this to Charanpur. Not only that, but the characters were so... simply complex that I felt as thought these characters really do live in this village, also, I know everything to know in the movie about these characters.Their struggles as a town with the cast system and working into diplomacy and how our main character affects them really, made me laugh at the progress of these people.Also, the epic dance numbers. Usually when I say epic, I would mean multiple people all doing the dances, but no. With this, one person was dancing and singing, but the story being told through song, or the moral that the main character has learned and now we have learned displayed through the song, filled me with joy. Just as our main character falls deep in love with this Indian village, we do as well. Thank you India, for long-ass movies; surprisingly good:SilverRating: 8/10",

Also this happens to be the first Indian film to be actually shot inside the NASA research center at the Launch Pad 39A of the Kennedy Space Center of NASA in Florida. To add to the authenticity of his film, Gowariker actually shot a scene in the NASA space center rather than on a Filmcity Set. Shahrukh works on a rainfall monitoring satellite known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in the film, which is lifted into an orbit aboard a Space Shuttle. (GPM is an actual NASA mission, currently scheduled to launch in 2007). However this techno-savvy movie is not a sci-fi attempt by Gowariker but a sensible thought-provoking film about an intelligent Indian who leaves his country for a better life abroad but later rediscovers his roots and turns back.",

This is absolutely wrong message. A laymen will like it because he will get one more scientist burning his nights for his benefit in his Mother India but the argument is flawed 1. Scientists are a citizen of the world, they are the torchbearers of a generation.Politicizing them on the basis of country is like politicizing elections on the basis of religion 2. Indian scientific community is in the trap of bureaucracy. a person who wants to make some real contribution to science and concentrate solely on his work rather than politics will never come back and should not come back to India (especially if he is in one of the worlds greatest institution like NASA). 3. The direction is lackluster, no grip, no anticipation, everyone knows this loser will come back to India from the very first scene of the movie ( it is obvious he doesn't have a life in the states, here in his village people gave him some attention, and he is so desperate to get it that he leaves everything. Not to mention the girl probably the only one he ever and will ever touch )and still it , drags on and on for unthinkable point of time. 4. This is a cheap, no, pardon me, a cruel attempt to play with the emotions of naive people. not to mention the pain it causes the Indian scientific diaspora and their family members who are actually making a real contribution to science abroad. 5. The emotions of Shah Rukh are not as good under the direction of Asitosh Gowariker, as it were under Bhansali, he can not even touch his performance that he gave in DevdasPleas people apply some reason and logic instead of emotion to judge an idea.

The recent editorial columns in the dailies allover India have inspired him and that reflects in his creation from the top to bottom. The theme of \"Brain -Drain\" is a very significant one for the generation of India today, but sadly it didn't appeal to many Indians. Most of the people I have come across have either labelled it a documentary or rather boring. The fact that Shahrukh starred in it had its own downfalls right from the days of Post production. People had come to see the Shahrukh they are used to seeing off late (K3G, Main Hoon Na). What everyone has failed to realise is that he is an actor and thats what made him a star. So lets acknowledge the decent performance he has given inspite of knowing the fact that its not one of his regular romantic affairs. The ones who have liked the movie should stand up and support the movie in whatever way its possible. A lot of guys I have actually studied with and who are now either in US or any other country have appreciated it,more than the ones I have here in India. Okie so we can sum it up by saying that half the purpose is served. But what is even more important is the other half realising it that something should be done about the country when we know we can. Talking about the movie, I believe the soundtrack, locations, performances were in proper sync with each other. It should have been a cult movie but instead its a topic people would like to discuss in their dining tables and then forget it as soon as they hit the sack. People in India need to change and change for the better.\"TAB TAK MAIN NAHIN MANTA, MERA DESH DUNIYA KA SABSE MAHAAN DESH HAIN.\" (Till then I would deny to believe that my country is the best country in the world)- M.

Since it was a fantasy, clich\u00e9d dialog and cardboard characters were not a problem. In fact, quite the opposite since they provided comic relief when needed. Swades tries to be a quasi-serious movie and completely fails because no effort has been made to have serious dialog and fully fleshed out characters. (In contrast, see Shwaas for real situations, fully fleshed out characters and normal conversation.) Instead, we have quasi-seriousness imposed on a Bollywood fantasy background which is jarring to say the least. Oddly enough, Shah Rukh Khan delivers a reasonably good, understated performance. The new actress, Gayathri Joshi's nonverbal performance is top notch. Unfortunately, she's all dolled up (well coiffed and manicured at that) and nowhere to go since she's supposed to be living in a poor village which makes her look ludicrous. No attempt was made to make her less glamorous. Instead, we have someone who looks like Queen Elizabeth living in a slum. Finally, while Lagaan had a good screenplay, there's no story here and no payoff in the end. While the cinematography is excellent and the village backdrop authentic, it all amounts to a wasted effort. In summary, Gowarikar has lowered our expectations which is a very good thing for him and hopefully for us as well.",

Director Ashutosh Gowariker has done a tremendous job.Swades deals with real issues and tries to bring a conclusion to them through a beautiful coming of age tale of the main character Mohan (Sharu Khan). TRUE - It doesn't have the Bollywood formula. And people expected that - but its a slow story that needs to unwind and does unwind well to help you get to know the characters and relate. Its simply a tale about India. Its beauty. Its mystery. Its people.Like the first reviewer Sabsinha say \"Thank god for Swades.\" I am in strong agreement. It was only sooner or later that something this ground breaking would find its self a leader in new wave of films coming up for air. This film is simply stunning.Asif Kapadia's \"The Warrior\" is beautifully directed like this film.

            "content": "By far, Swades is one of the most emotionally overwhelming experiences I have had while watching a film. And I include all of Hollywood when I say that.Swades comes home to me as a very real depiction of life. It would be a fool's errand to fixate the film onto patriotism, for it is so much more. The film portrays all the truths of human life through multiple socio-economic strata.Swades' direction hits that perfect sweet spot, with Gowariker being at the top of his game. Every Camera Angle, every Camera Movement, and even the staging has been done in a way that makes sense to the story. Frequently, we find ourselves in a situation where we are trying to evaluate the reasons why certain directorial decisions were made, but in vain, since there was no intent on detailing. This is where Swades breaks all expectations. Ashutosh's ambitious vision for the project was nailed by the skillset he possesses.And that brings me to directing Shahrukh Khan. By far, after My Name is Khan(2010), this is SRK's best performance for me. Known widely for a slightly over the top portrayal of his characters, SRK makes an archetypical exception in Swades. The subtleties and nuances on the actor's part contribute astronomically to Gowriker's vision of Visual Storytelling. Without an actor like him, it would be hard for a director to convey the story visually, and would have to resort to dialogue exposition. That adds another point to the beauty of Swades which separates it out from its Bollywood contemporaries. Ashutosh trusts you as an audience, and hardly does any spoon-feeding of information.The cinematography, editing, and other aspects are right on point, none drawing the attention away from the story's main objective. I don't know if the use of Anamorphic Lenses was a creative call or just a norm for Bollywood at that point, but it made sense nonetheless. The distortion around the edges added a texture to the visuals which went hand in hand with the story. 35mm adds its own character with the grains and organic colors of rural India.The Music, of course, needs no validation from me. This film represents AR Rahman at the peak of his game as well, which carries forth to his pieces in Jodhaa Akbar(2008), Gowariker's next project. Just 1 or 2 times I felt like the music was being stretched just a bit, but a)That is the director's call, and b) It can really be forgiven thanks to the cinematography and the performances by the actors.Another unique thing I love about Ashutosh Gowariker is that the story practically never halts when music is playing in his films, something that is abhorrently present in peer Bollywood films. This I find to be more or less true with Lagaan(2001), Swades(2004) as well as Jodhaa Akbar(2008), 3 of the veteran director's gems.On a story level, the richness of Swades shows the fervency of the writers to create a sense of reality, displaying how Rural India really is. However, it would be a mistake to say that this is the only theme in Swades. It is a highly character driven film, and does absolute justice at the end when the external conflicts of the character have been resolved, yet he must face the internalised issues. There is a whirlwind of emotions, from Light Hearted comedy, to enthralling visual moments inducing tears. Every character has been crafted till it was fully discovered.I recommend this film to each and every person reading this review. Might end up being one of the 3 most overwhelming emotional journeys of your life.Hope this helps :)",

Even the songs \"Yeh Tara Woh Tara\" and \"Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera\" are thoughtful and are excellent songs with very deep meanings. There are few scenes in a movie that would affect someone as much as the scene wherein SRK talks about the things wrong with India. You should not miss this movie. Gayatri Joshi does a good job for a newcomer. Her costumes are very well designed and a very good character role essayed beautifully. The village setting is very realistic and the scene when SRK goes to collect rent from the tenant of Gayatri Joshi.In short an amazing and a realistic movie worth watching.",

I watched this movie in 2004 at theater with handful of people as 90% hall was empty.Even though its Shahrukh khan movie it was flop movie at that time. It is not necessary always that flop movie is not good movie.in this Shahrukh plays very simple role of NASA scientist which is against his lover boy image. He looks very mature & he underplayed his role. Gayatri joshi, the heroine of the movie matches him well as she performed brilliantly.These is only movie in her career. But the main aim of the movie is country needs more skillful people who can contribute to their own country instead of working in other countries. All characters in the movie played their role brilliantly, The music of the movie is very good because of AR Rahman. I love this movie for two people, first is Shahrukh Khan & Second is director Ashutosh Gowarikar. These is their best work. Watch these movie For these two.",

The intentions and the message of this film were direct and great. I identified with the lead character 'Mohan', many a time during the film. This film had a 'Soul' running parallel to the narrative... and that is what appealed the most to me. The songs (unlike in most Hindi films), actually added to the narrative.. even though the lyrics were a tad bit 'Over the top' at times.. and so were some of the dialogue. Shah Rukh khans performance was amazing... With the heroine, I guess the director tried a 'Gracey Singh' with her (Making her speak more with her facial expressions rather than dialogue.. like in his previous film 'Lagaan').. but failed at doing that. Not only did her expressions look 'Contrived' but also 'pretentious' Many parts of the plot were not established strongly enough.. like Gita fell in love with Mohan.. a bit too suddenly, and the transition from hate to love was not accentuated. Also, it was not established well enough weather Mohan returned to India for 'Love' or for his country. Gitas character kept contradicting itself.. it seemed to me that the initial script did not make it to the final edit. Many links seemed lost. Overall I enjoyed the film thoroughly, and would recommend it to anyone. Ashutosh seems to have proved himself yet again, as being one of the finest... if not THE finest directors in India.",

I really like most of Indian songs, but do they have to be so many in one movie? and do the tracks have to be played full duration each?the project he makes to provide electricity for the village is just wacky and unrealistic (a ridiculously small turbine having its kinetic energy driven from a very shallow and weak stream of water !!!) ... I live in Iraq where the electricity blackouts are much like that depicted in this movie and I know the size of a turbine needed to light a village and the amount of water needed to turn that turbine. all I'm saying is that Indians always have to make the main character a hero in every aspect of life: unifying the people's word, providing green energy that he created out of thin air, convincing people to enroll their children in school saving their children from illiteracy and preventing the elders from turning the school's building into a council... etc. I'm not saying that I don't love such deeds, they're what every human being dream to have or do for his people, it's just that achieving them all together and this simple is so unrealistic, people died trying to save others from racism, ethnic and sectarian violence; governments and scientists spend millions of dollars and hundreds of days just to harness green energy hardly enough to light a small area. this kinda unrealism is not an interesting thing to watch especially when it's in almost every bollywood movie. the only thing I liked in the movie are the village people and their daily life, that was the only realistic thing worth watching.and last but not least, the end of the movie: leaving America and returning home !!! I'm not saying that people don't do such things, but I have to say that it was so stupid of him to leave a very good job that he's very good at, in the best country in the world and go to live in a \"village\" in India, are you kidding me! who does that unless he's retarded or something.I like India and Indian people, I like their songs and their culture, but I don't wanna watch stupid hero-fairy tale romance movies anymore.",

            "content": "As I was watching this movie yesterday night in the theatre I started to feel ashamed of myself being an Indian. This shame was not the result of the hard reality shown in the movie, but it was because of the way the critics in India wrote this movie off on the very first day of its release. I certainly did not expect this from Taran Adarsh and Co. For once they should look beyond the box office collections as the criteria for a good movie. One the other hand I also realise that people living in a country like India see at this reality in their every day life and wouldn't want to spend three hour refreshing their wounds. But here is the question! Can you go away from this reality by watching a romantic flick like Veer-Zaara (no criticism of the movie, it was brilliant), when you know that you have to go back to face the same situations. I think when Mohan tells villagers on dashera night that they have come to love the situations and that's why they don't want to do anything about it holds right for the Indian moviegoers and critics.Well better get at the movie, what can I say. Everything was just perfect. I feel comparing it with Lagaan is unjust as both belongs to different movie genre. While, Lagaan was about the triumph of the human spirit, Swades is all about us, WE, THE PEOPLE. Personally I feel Swades stands a better chance of winning an Oscar than Lagaan. Indian Government should send this movie as the official entry from India this year. Ashutosh has done wonders directing and writing this movie, so have done every individual involved in making of this movie.Only one criticism of this movie though, why Mohan had to go back to India in the end. I would have preferred the ending if he had stayed at America. I also felt that Ashutosh should have showed a bit of positive attitude towards the people who are working abroad and helping Indian government in building huge foreign currency reserves. After all it was because of Mohan's hard-earned money in America that helped him in building the electricity generator in the village.Leaving above criticism the movie is a gem coming out of Bollywood. Acting is first rate, it was so refreshing to see Shahrukh playing such a role and that's right to say that with this movie a Star became an Actor. Music by AR Rahman is brilliant, although some of the songs did hampered the pace of the movie. Background score was the life of the movie in my opinion. In the end all the commemoration to Ashutosh who dared to make such a movie. I think he truly deserves the ovation public gave when movie finished yesterday at the theatre.A must see. 9/10",

It's the soul of the movie. Acting is done phenomenally by not just SRK but also by the supporting cast. I personally do not like a lot of SRK movies but this would top the list.

The lines \"why give light to the neighbour's house\" might have been said in a funny manner .. but honestly it touches you. SRK has given an amazing performance, he has not played the \"larger then life SRK\" but this time has played in his character. He is a very good actor no doubt .. but i have never been a very big fan of him as he was never the versatile actor. In Swades he proves that he can act if given something besides lover boy masala roles. No matter what the box office response to this will be , those who have the mind to think, will know this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is not really for the masses, but i suggest all the NRI's watch it. I am a NRI and honest to GOD, this might make some of you laugh but me at the age of 16 before this movie came out had decided to go back to India and do somethin for the nation. India is booming and we should go empower that boom. Remember this is the story of ONE village in India and this is not what the country is exactly like . The country has been progressing at a very fast rate and is surely going to be a power in the next decade. This movie has just made my decision stronger to go back after completing education. Gayatri Joshi is the best newcomer this year, without a skin show she impresses. She is simply sexy, she is beautiful and is an amazing actress. Her sexiness lies in her attitude, expression and body language. All in all Swades is one of the best movies made in a long time but it is nothing like any other Bollywood movie. This One DESERVES AN Oscar! Ashutosh Gowariker is a great story teller and making movies from his heart will for sure drive him to the Oscar as it is Oscar quality after all.Rating : 9.5/10",

            "content": "Thank god for swades. Its been ever so often that as Indians we have lamb-lasted the mushy, one track nonsensical movies that were being churned out by bollywood and yearned for something slightly honest and cerebral. And now it seems that the moment has arrived. Swades has finally reached the next level of Indian movie-making with the help of ashutosh, srk and rahman where the execution, the concept and the treatment of the film is at least (i can safely assume) close to world standards. There is no point comparing lagaan (the directors 1st movie) to this movie as his earlier venture was purely fiction with no semblance of realism in it. However this movie has so many ingredients of being a pathbreaker for Indian cinema that its almost scary. The feelings and expectations of an nri set aside, it tells the story of middle and upper class India losing touch with the harsh realities of the sufferings of the less fortunate ones all around us (and the fact that we can do very little to change the ongoing scenario is even more glaring and painful). Besides this the movie also deals with the desires and priorities of humans inspite of the trials and tribulations of daily living.This movie is dedicated to all Indian.A worth watching Movie by Ashutosh Gowariker.Leaves a impression on mind after you have seen the movie.Though there are technical faults in the storyline yet those can be left aside on the backdrop of a heart-touching theme. A theme for the people who are leaving their countries / states in search of a better life without realising the fact that they can create a better living environment at home itself. An insight on the problems of India whose underdeveloped part is somehow or other responsible for itself for the underdevelopment. The social jinx in the rural India which should have been broken long before are now hampering the progress of the villages.The movie is another Gem after Lagaan in the collection of Ashutosh and Indian Cinema as a whole.Great Job by Shahrukh. Exquisite appearance by Gayatri. Grand Show by Ashutosh.The maturity of the script, the actors and the score makes it a journey of epic proportions without it looking epic at all. The normalcy of the movie is something which might (and hopefully will) change the way cinema is seen and made in India in the future. One can only hope. $RK is great.",

            "content": "Ashutosh Gowariker\u0085\u0085..the man who gave us LAGAAN \u0096 an Oscar-nominated movie! As such, SWADES is a highly expected movie being Gowariker's next film after Lagaan. And for me, this time\u0085\u0085it was even better than Lagaan. That's because Swades hits you right where it matters most \u0096 at your heart ! So, Swades tells the story from Mohan Bhargav's (Shah Rukh Khan) perspective. Mohan is an Indian by birth and he also did his schooling in India. But went to the US for higher studies and eventually ends up as a scientist with NASA. He's working on a hi-tech NASA project called Global precipitation Management, but there's something else that's haunting his mind for months\u0085\u0085..his nanny, Kaveri Amma who took care of him like a mother all those years when he was in India. After his parents' death, Mohan came back to USA, but then he realizes that he's ignored Kaveri Amma. He dreads at the thought of what condition she would be in India\u0085\u0085maybe languishing at some old-age home. That's when Mohan decides to come back to India (his Swades) to look for Kaveri Amma and bring her back with him to the US. Thus begins Mohan Bhargav's journey of self-realization\u0085\u0085 Mohan reaches Delhi and tracks Kaveri Amma to a remote village called Charanpur in north India. There, Mohan encounters all sorts of problems that he hasn't seen\u0085\u0085electricity shortage, caste-distinction, child marriage, illiteracy and so on. Mohan is of the belief that India is never going to change because people here just don't want to change. Like any other NRI, he just wants to finish off his work quickly (take Kaveri Amma back) and return to the US. But gradually, he gets involved in the village and its people. He changes\u0085\u0085many incidents (particularly one) makes him realize something very deeply. For that\u0085..go watch the film and see Mohan's journey of self-realization yourself. And I bet\u0085\u0085.you'll be moved by it ! Swades is a patriotic film on a very different level. It never, for once, resorts to jingoism and putting down other countries. Swades has a very simple message \u0096 if all of us decide to do something for our country (however small it may be), it'll certainly make a difference. And of course, the film has truly moving scenes and poignant moments. Also, the performances are exemplary \u0096 Gita, the school teacher and Mohan's love interest played by the immensely beautiful Gayatri Joshi. She makes a fantastic debut. Kishori Balal gives her all into Kaveri Amma and makes her a truly affectionate character. Dayashankar Pandey (who played Goli in Lagaan) and Rajesh Vivek(who played Guran in Lagaan) are amazing as Mela Ram and Nivaran the Postmaster respectively. But the film belongs to Shahrukh Khan \u0096 the actor's finest performance to date. After a long time in his career, the superstar finally gets into the skin of a character. And thoroughly convinces us that this is Mohan Bhargav and not Shah Rukh. Whether it's the sorrow in his eyes or the passion, Shah Rukh's body language and expressions convey it all. Absolutely brilliant performance ! Swades also has another big asset in A.R Rahman's music and Javed Akhtar's thought-provoking lyrics . All the songs of the movie are excellent to hear and they've been aptly used in the film. The background score, also by Rahman is one of the best ever in Hindi cinema. Mahesh Aney's camera-work gives a very real look to the film and so do Oscar-winner Bhanu Athaiya's costumes. Gowariker (story) and K.P Saxena (dialogues) who had also co-written Lagaan are in full form here as well.But ultimately, kudos to Ashutosh Gowariker for guiding his team of actors, technicians and the musical team to give us something as splendid as Swades. Gowariker gives all Indians a very important message with Swades. And this shouldn't be missed\u0085\u0085it's one of those rare Hindi film masterpieces hardly seen in today's sleaze-flick times !",

If your answer is 'yes', then 'Swades' is not for you.'Swades' is a self exploring journey of Mohan Bhargava(Shahrukh Khan) who is a smart & successful project manager in Nasa's Space Kennedy Centre who after a span of solitude years feels the urge to meet his nanny Kaveriamma and convince her to spend the rest of her life in more pleasures & comforts with him, she has been a motherly figure to him and many. Search of Kaveriamma lands him in a small village of Charanpur in India where she lives with Gita(Gayatri Joshi), a school teacher by profession and choice. Mohan is in a total contrast situation from where he came and his short stay extends when he comes across many vital unsolvable realities of that village, which help to form a ladder to his inner evolution. And of course Gita's simplistic & idealistic personality helps in develop a loving bond between the two.He takes on himself to provide the basic need of Electricity(generate) thru Water and even tries to open the innocent/ ignorant eyes of many to the unknown and known facets of the world. Mohan's every move, every word gets him closer to the rest and himself . Mohan is capable enough of taking any sound decision at this juncture of his life, so does he fall prey to a comfortable lavish lifestyle layering it in the name of career progression and loosing his real identity or does he want to go beyond the norms and return to his roots and make his life more worthwhile?The soulful music and the intertwining of songs in the script keeps you absorbed through out. The movie at no point goes overboard in conveying the thoughts of the director(Ashutosh Gowariker),his penchant for detailing and apt characters placement are worth experiencing. I forgot to mention SRK, this is what you'll feel too cos here Mohan Bhargava is at forte which says a lot about the actor himself and even the director who has the capability to extract effective performances from one and all.The only downside maybe the duration of the movie, but the sincerity of the movie will gently glide you all the way. 'Swades' will be remembered for several firsts(or in a long time) to its credit: * The title of the film. * The promo pictures of the film very different which doesn't emphasise the hero, but the people. * First Indian Cinema to be shot in Nasa. * Subtle romantic moments between the lead actor & actress. * Debut of a senior veteran director Lekh Tandon. * A main-stream cinema not following a rigid path of 'entertaining' cinema.Someone correctly said 'It is difficult to be simple', but its not at all difficult to watch and muse over this simple piece of work!",

The film's message of the power of individual action to effect change was inspiring and left a lasting impression on me.The acting was top-notch, with Shah Rukh Khan delivering a standout performance as Mohan. The chemistry between him and the talented Gayatri Joshi was also a highlight of the film. The cinematography was stunning, capturing the stunning landscapes and diverse cultures of India.Overall, \"Swades\" was a beautifully crafted film that left a deep impact on me. It was a powerful reminder of the importance of community and the positive impact one person can have on those around them. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an uplifting and thought-provoking movie experience.",

A modern setting, depicting the brain drain in India, the film addresses issues like electricity, education and poverty.It looks at all these things in a very interesting story.

'Swades' is not exactly a drama, neither it's a romance.it is a theme, I'd say, not story. It's about what we the people are, what we do and what we should do instead of what we do.The execution you must go to the cinema and experience for yourself .Shahrukh Khan performs his career best in all respect .No overacting this time in any scene of the movie this time (No shaking while crying). All credits to the director off course.I think only Ashutosh has the caliber to pull out best from Him up till now. The female lead character can be a dream role for any actress and Gayatri Joshi live it very strongly in her debut.she is so pretty ,simple& talented. Technically screenplay is good, though there are some possibilities of improvement,specially NASA shot, but the movie keeps the hold. The location, the costumes are not bad. Music of Swades is truly the best last year.A.R.Rahman's background score is involving, blended and great as usual touches your heart easily. In songs I liked 'Yeh Tara', 'Suno Jara' and 'Swades Theme' very much. Direction is a brilliant effort Ahutosh Gowariker Clearly shows his philosophy & its quite sensible .I like the way title begin , that theme on instrument will do good. amazing tune it is. one Blopper in the movie was In the phase 2 of GPM, , NASA is supposed to launch a satellite. But guess what they launch instead? A space craft!Even though making a main line movie out of a theme is just not easy and Ashutosh Gowarikar has a done great job.Some reviewer comparing this movie to Lagaan.Why does one want same kind of movies from the director each time? I mean I can't really differentiate Karan Johar and gangs' movies from one another. Honest! We regard movie maestros like Satyajit Ray, guru Dutt, Basu Bhattacharya because they made movies for the sake of art, the medium of silver screen and for their own satisfaction. That's why they are great and their movies are all time excellent!I say 'Swades' is a great movie. A movie that belongs to me. & will be with me through my life time. we Hesitate to act because whole vision might not be archived is the thinking that only hinders our progress what a comment by Mahatma Gandhi. & the movie live it up. HeartLy Thaks to Ashutosh Gowariker! for his whole different brilliant attempt .Shubham Nigam Satyam ,Chennai",

            "content": "I had been desperate to watch this movie since the time I read the synopsis; that was about 3 months ago. So it certainly deserves a place amidst other ramblings.Firstly, Swades had a lot of mixed reactions though most of the reviews were from a point of view of wholesome entertainment value, which is definitely not its sole intention. So no wonder most reviews were critical.Swades is a different movie; maybe it has come a bit early on the bollywood scene. Indians, with their characteristic tendency to underestimate themselves, cannot appreciate trends that go against their self-critical under-confident minds. Most of them find it hard to believe that the protagonist actually returns to India leaving a plum-NASA job. Of course, I don't claim that it is realistic. But realism is not the sole intention of art forms. Idealism is, at least it can be.SRK gives a decent performance though his usual flirtatious self is visible in the movie. But, it can be overlooked. He gives a convincing face to Mohan Bhargava. And Gayatri Joshi(Gita), I think, has been discovered a bit late. She should have been offered roles earlier. The character Geeta which she portrays is strong, idealistic and yet, intensely feminine. Its a breath of fresh air to see that feminism doesn't necessarily mean shouting your guts out against a \"male-dominated\" society. She makes her point firmly, and decently. No existing actress I know would have suited the role.And there's a lot of Kannada influence in the movie. The names seem so Kannada like. Even Kaveriamma's character is portrayed by a well-established Kannada actress. So this review deserves its place in the blog all the more.Music is also captivating. A R Rahman makes even the Shehanai sound really sweet in Yeh jo des hai tera. The lyrics of the song struck a chord in my heart. And the song on Ram is written by Akhtar and composed by Rahman. Go, secular India, go!! Swades is definitely worth a watch.",

But this tour brought about a change in his life both mentally and metamorphically. Though the narrative gets slower in some portion the movie should be applauded for conveying a message to the society. The movie successfully depicts so called \" brain drainage\". The most praiseworthy thing for this movie is that it's a movie different genre altogether. Shah Rukh was just awesome. His expressions were not exaggerated like his other movies. He gave up all his mannerisms and wonderfully delineated Mohan. But Gayatri Joshi has to work on her expressions. Though she looks gorgeous.Music by A.R. Rehman is a treat for your ears.

But this film truly utilizes his potential to the fullest. He was close enough in Chak De for his best performance but truly Swades was at another level. The number of instances that give you goosebumps and wets your eyes are too many. I truly hope King Khan to do more roles like this that explores his true capabilities though u personally think this will stay his best. Ashutosh will be remembered for creating this movie. Rahman's music was again at its best - for someone who has a lot of fascinating works to his credit - I can't possibly pin his as his best but definitely one of his best - rising the patriotism in you each time you hear the music. The BGM again was outstanding. I have watched it many times and I still don't fail to get a goosebump watching it's many thought provoking sequences. Gayatri was a perfect fit and all the villagers gave their best performances. I personally rate Lagaan one notch below Swades for its intensity, performances and feel factors though both will be at a perfect 10 rating by me. Deep and original portrayal of India's villages, culture and traditions",

The person who really stole the show was Gayatri Joshi who you would never think was her debut role. Shah Rukh naturally played himself, although performance wise i thought he did an outstanding job in Veer-Zaara. This film explores culture, values, and tradition which are the main elements of India. I wasn't a big fan of Veer Zaara. I think Yash Chopra is overrated.

            "content": "Early on we find Mohan addressing the press in NASA about cities his initiative would have an impact on. He goes about, \" San Francisco, Latin Mexico, New Delhi...\" , dispassionately. Delhi doesn't resonate ethnic familiarity. It's another piece of geography. A mere statistic. He's as Indian as a Mira Nair movie. The very mention of India in a press conference- after returning from a trip there - towards the film's closure, unsettles him. It's no mere \"another\" country anymore. It's his; he its. It's the pin that made contact with his carefully cultivated American bubble. Swades is book-ended by these two press conferences. It's the story of a man's search for his mother, that ends in his motherland. It traces an individual's metamorphosis from being a condescending first world citizen to someone crushed by the stench of third world reality, which was easier to digest as editorial observations over English breakfast.Where do I start? Do I talk about the audacity of the role reversal employed, where the leading lady is chivalrously let to tie dhoti to an almost emasculated hero; who's regarded as a deity of fluffy romance in the country's heartlands. Or do I talk about the spectacle, simple thoughts are translated into on screen like the \"Yeh Tara, Woh Tara\" song sequence. Just a few nimble limb movements here, a few facial sparkles there. A song with stars as metaphors under a night sky sprinkled with glittering stars, rendered by a nimbus star in an ominous form. It's as transcendental as poetry gets on the big screen.Neither the obscene budgets nor the more obscene promotions(hawking) of these days were there to flex, but he was nonchalantly wearing his superstardom like a good perfume. His charm was organic, not labored. If Khan's the film's face and heart, Rahman's music is the pulse and soul. Rarely do we get a musical score that follows the story like a solicitous shadow, never once intending to precede or side step for attention. It grows with the protagonist; melting with him; simmering with him; hoping with him and hurting with him. It fashions the western finesse to the eastern sensibilities of the film's milieu. Swades is a fine example of what happens in a legitimate marriage between the song and dance trope and narrative dexterity.And a special mention, actually a very special mention to Gayatri Joshi. The deadpan way in which she competes with SRK's calculator, her implosive consent to his boisterous overtures, her outbursts of child ego while being possessive of Kaveriamma or the dollops of grace she adds to the chiffon saris. She brings so much dignity to Geeta, doing more to the role than it does to her. Not often do we get an actress who makes us feel guilty in a wet dream.Mohan's starting to scratch beyond the surface of paper patriotism, when Kaveriamma sends him to collect rent arrears from a farmer. To him it's just an expedition, another rustic journey to a rudimentary hamlet . But she knows more. She knows it would make him go off the deep end on a journey of self discovery. On his way there he travels on a boat, standing with a glint of amusement in his eyes, distant from the other modest passengers. He doesn't disrespect them. He just doesn't belong.He meets the farmer, through him meets with every ugly truth inundating a nation- poverty, casteism, apathy - he only knew of at an ethnicity and number-of-rivers basis till now.He came to India with first world problems like guilt from not being able to stay in touch with his foster mother. His project in NASA addressing the issue of global water scarcity that hitherto swelled his chest slowly fades away to in-prominence as he gazes skywards, from the ground reality of a third world peasant's backyard. A young boy sprinting helter skelter, to sell water for 25 paise adds further salt to his wounded soul. On his way back, he returns a different man on the same boat. He's humbled by the guilt of ignorance about a country he claimed to be a part of; humbled by the knowledge that the \"humble\" lives led in its heartlands was in fact euphemism to the collective sufferings. Legs folded, he's seated among the other modest beings on the boat. The distance between them had crumbled. In fact it now feels like a crime. \"They\" becomes \"we\", as he becomes Indian.",

The director has made sincere efforts to create a sense of consideration for one's country. The attention to detail in every aspect, the reality in every shot and the constraint in dramatic persuasiveness is excellent.While we can hum and dance to the romances filmed by the Chopras and Johars it is very rare to see reality presented in such a positive and inspirational manner by a Bollywood director.",

It has a very good story-line focusing on great issues regarding third-world countries in terms of economic statues and how people attempt at solving it to the issues of immigrants' return and their duties towards their homeland and the people who belong to the the same culture. However, it's so romantic and light in addressing such serious topics! Like he wasn't touched till he were to collect money for Gita, while it's known how poverty is so hard to hide in India! Also the ending is very romantic and, in my own opinion , so unrealistic, and doesn't show any details except for the vibes of\" happily ever after\". This movie could have been a master piece and really had lots of potential but i guess an Indian movie can't be all realistic after all!",

When Kaveriamma decides to send Mohan to another village to collect rent..Mohan feels/cries a lot for that guy...fine...but why didn't he feel same when he met a person in similar state (more or less) in charanpur itself?? this person is the one who argues that he is lower caste person hardly making money to feed one time meal for his family & hence doesn't wish to send his children to school....so why doesn't Mohan feel for this guy....coz his focus is on child gathering for School or coz he didn't enter this persons house & had a lunch with them ?? Despite all these minute errors the film creates a positive aura & a message which definitely will touch all.All characters more or less have put in great efforts.Kudos to Ashtosh for being the Manoj Kumar of this era.We sure hope there will be more gripping & soul feeding films from him soon.P.S: Lagaan also had one factual error though....In that period there were no sixes...only fours in cricket books...So actually the match was lost !!",

Gayatri has done really well given her first movie.I gave it a 8 though the concept is awesome n superb presentation though lacked a bit of impact.

Shahrukh takes a break from his usual no-brainer movies to try and make an impact on the viewer and proves he has not lost his agility to the so called masala films.Beautiful music scoring by the Mozart-of-Madras Rehman makes the viewing experience even more fulfilling, especially \"yeh jo des\".

These are the true and meaningful stories for movies. And also did any one else like the brand new actress in leading role in Swades. I've got to say she is beautiful, she's got a nice figure and this was the perfect way to start her career in the film industry.

I doubt if the version I had seen is director's cut or the final one because the movie seems as though the director sat on editing table and that he loved each scene so much that he just couldn't touch it. To my surprise, it is Shahrukh who disappointed with his acting until he reaches the village. From then on, it's a roller coaster ride. There are a few punch dialogs which I liked : 1) Jai Ram Jee Ki which in English means: May Lord Rama be victorious, which is a form of greeting people in India. 2) Wrestler Postman says to Mohan Bhargav: Let us do some wresting 3) Mohan Bhargav to MelaRam: Even your travel to America is difficult. 4) Mohan Bhargav to village people when attender gives weather forecast after seeing sky : I also do the same job in NASA.Gayatri Joshi is good, in fact almost all the characters did well. The child character and the old lady at old age home should have emoted well. Everything's well up to the climax portion. Climax doesn't look different either on content or emotional quotient. It doesn't look like climax, may be the song in the climax diluted the effect, may be.Music is excellent. Background score(especially in titles), songs are very good to ears. The best of the movie is Mohan stay in village This part is great.I think the script should have been revised again to make it look appealing. May be the next 2nd draft would have been better. It would have been great if the movie's time is less and it's narration crisp to have a better reach. Though the movie did not do well on commercial front, movie lovers with a taste for difference will love this one.PS: This movie is not selected for official Oscar entry from India.

This movie tells us that leaders are not the ones that should be doing everything for us, we should also do something for ourselves.

Swades isn't just a movie, it's a complete journey that you take along with it. The realisation of roots is the most important thing today when everybody is busy becoming useless wannabes in our country especially. The movie traverses you through the highs and lows Shah Rukh faces while his stay in that remote village and how he finds his unconscious roots is a commendable job that the director has filmed. According to me, it was more like a metaphor where a man comes to realise himself and his roots by browsing his natural inclinations. Overall, this movie can never be replicated in any form and should remain pure as it has been till now. Kudos to the makers and those sane and sensible viewers who have fetched some most interesting things out of this movie.",

Ashutosh Gowarikar executed the direction and screenplay with a good blend of songs and emotions. AR Rahman cannot be compared to any of the present generation music directors and I would give him a bow for his music and background score in this movie. He asserted that he is a legend of Indian cinema music. Gayathri Joshi showed natural expressions and really simple&beautiful in this movie. Some great scenes like kid selling water cups, haridas who is mocked by the society on regard of his caste, old woman expressing grief for no one caring about them in the ashram etc are overwhelming. Over all it's purely Indian and fresh movie.",

Sounds modulation can be added in this part.if we analyzed overall story of Swedes movie ,then the name of movie is not ta tally fit according to the story because mostly scenes are not concerned with the main subject.Finally i rated this with 5 stars.",

It gave me a \"this one was made for me\" feeling and I didn't feel like watching any other movie for several weeks ! I doubt if any other movie will take its place in my heart for a long time to come.The movie is NOT TOO LONG, by any means. The subject matter is heavy, so the length is quite justifiable. In fact, if you get the original DVD set with both the DVD's, you'd be surprised to see how many scenes have been deleted, including the song \"Aahista, Aahista\". The length of the movie is just right, and they could have retained many of the deleted scenes including that song, in my humble opinion. If you still think the movie is too long, think of it this way - it is an EXCELLENT TV serial, ultra-compressed to ~3 hours for the big screen. Everything in the movie looks so real, there is nothing that is unbelievable.AR Rahman is at his best. The more I listen to the songs and the background score, the more I realize how brilliant it is. Shahrukh - well, there is no Shahrukh in this movie - only Mohan Bhargava. I doubt if any other contemporary actor would have done better.I can go on and on. Email me if you want to discuss this movie. I would love to talk about it.How about a sequel (Swades II), that shows Mohan Bhargava really succeeding back home in his endeavor ?",

In the process he, a man who has seen technology at its forefront at NASA, comes face to face with the ground level problems in rural India.The acting is marvellous. You get to see Shah Rukh Khan in a different role, and his facial expressions in the film are fantastic. Gayatri Joshi is unbelievable for a beginner. The rest of the supporting cast, be it the nanny, the postman, the man who wants to go to America or the children. One and all are perfect in their roles.But the best acclaim definitely goes to Ashutosh Gowariker. The man is the only one in Bollywood to actually pay attention to details in his films. The NASA bits are actually filmed there, the NASA details and projects are correct, no American speaks Hindi, and every bit about the rural India realistic. The film is based on real issues, and is very thoughtful, contrary to most Bollywood films that hit the market today. And it tackles them in a thorough way.This film is a real gem in Bollywood, and so is Ashutosh Gowariker. There is hope for Bollywood as long as there are people like him around with the courage to make films like he does, not purely for entertainment, but as a thoughtful work of art...",

SRK has finally silenced his critics! two thumbs up!Gayatri Joshi is gorgeous and holds her ground as an actor. the dhoti sequence is the most romantic one i have seen in years! (did someone smirk?)people!!!!!!!! there are gorgeous women who are city bred working with NGO's in villages who do dress up and put on lipstick. Rama! why doesthis role have to be played if only you look like Smita Patil or Deepti naval. yes! the characters are clich\u00e9's...so? we have them everywhere (take a look around). though Abdul Kalam hair cuts i have not seen around. (Ashutosh, how could you???) story predictable? i do not think so. it was well researched and fairly well executed.the look? Hmmm, Bhanu Athiya does a good job. the clothes look authentically Indian (though they do not subscribe to a set region) but then remember that this is a pan-India mainstream film!!!!!?!on a recent visit to interior Karnataka and Tamilnadu most of the younger women/girls were in Salwar Kameezes...huh? did i think i was in Punjab? Puhleez! same comment for the village. it did not bother me at all. the Maharashtra's straight horned cows could have been avoided. story/screenplay/style: i liked the whole NRI(return of brain-drain)having call of the motherland bit. and then loved the way Ashutosh calls him Mohan. ah ha! there was a Mohan (the bald one!)a few decades ago who came back from across the seas and went on a journey into Indian hinterland met landless laborer and the poor and a changeover happened! do you guys remember that Mohan?screenplay:hmmm...bit too long. the Dusshera Bhajan is wonderful music but sitting on hard cinema seats suddenly made me remember that my ass hurts,Ashutosh lost his audience big time here. he did loose a lot of them right in the beginning when too much English happened at NASA. style of film making: you know what, i liked the slow pace a lot. i liked the fact it was not overtly dramatic. does cinema have to be dramatic always? though i thought electricity sequence was dramatic, the 25 paisa water was. the journey was. the fact he gives up his us citizenship. grow up people! the formula is dead! camera work: Mahesh Aney approaches the frame wonderfully. liked the framing. (no usaffir!!!!!!!!!) straight and simple. the lighting lacked! too ainstream. was he playing safe? Hmmm...was it the directors call? was the producer playing safe? Hmmm...this needed to be addressed.Hahn! then comes the music. Rahman, you are god! really! the songs are stunning!'Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera' will haunt people for a long time. but his triumph was in the background arrangement. it was wonderful. understated. beautiful. now i must tell you what i really liked. ha ha ha after a long time i liked the whole socialist approach. the kind of films which were made earlier. 'Naya Daur' do you remember that one? this kind of cinema died years ago. Mr. Gowariker you are a brave man, take a bow! i remembered the cinema from Russia/Cuba/Yugoslavia/etc. thank you for not giving me heaving bosoms,cleavage and g-strings, mustard fields and chiffon Saree's and item numbers. the 'Yeh Tara' song was awesome! beautiful. loved the choreography. completely natural. ah! i really wish the film is a hit(more like this will get made then). people, do go out and see it. will it win an Oscar? Hmmm..no. but then when was it the last word on film-making? p.s. there is an item number: SRK bathes twice. bare-chested. i am told the women in the audience...Hmmm...that is another story! :)",

The storyline is not the usual boy meets girl and they can't be together; it is about an NRI (Non Resident Indian) who goes back home on vacation in search of his elderly nanny/governess. He returns home with a condescending attitude towards the \"backwardness\" of Indian society, but a stay in a small rural village changes his attitude from one of disdain to one of determination.Shahrukh Khan has never given a better performance. Unlike some of his other movies where his acting constantly reminds you that he is, indeed, Shahrukh Khan (which was probably the point), in this one he blends in seamlessly with the other characters. All the characters are three dimensional and deep, and each of them has a heartbreaking story to tell.The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a 10/10 is the obligatory \"Yes I'm in love\" song sequences. Yes, I understand that they are quintessential to Bollywood movies, but this is the only complaint I have about Swades. Otherwise, it is a beautiful film, stripped of glitz and glamour, that tells a profound and meaningful story.",

Sequence at the railway station was really touchy and when Shahruk went to take rent from old man.Songs were just amazing.A.R Rahman music is excellent.And NASA shooting didn't take viewer attention from main focus of the story.Ashutosh once again proved that he is master director.Shahrukh pulled out a memorable performance and proved that he is the best actor now.Lets finger crossed for Swades for Oscars Swades...Oscar is waiting for you..BEST OF LUCK.",

I'd read, a leading director who commented on him, that he comes in a package with best designers, director, music, best locations on shoot etc. etc, I strongly recommend him to watch this movie, and would like to know what he could say to this. It was good and a big change to see SRK dancing with children. Star SRK has transformed into character, good!!!. AG has carried simplicity in every angle of the film.Another good thing is the casting, Ashutosh deserve a big applause for this, all faces were apt for the character.

It shows how much the ordinary upper and middle class can do, but fail to do. There is a feeling of helplessness about it.

Within a reasonable amount of cinematic license that Ashutosh Gowarikar seems to have adopted to make things more evident to the viewer (*potential spoiler* like making a hydel power station with limited expertise, and showing electricity crackling through the wires when it actually starts working), the movie is fabulous. The recent trend of Indians searching for greener pastures abroad, due to the higher conversion rate of hard currency has left a substantial void in the country in terms of the availability of talented people to spearhead the country in all potential vistas of development, due to which the country's progress has been hampered and there are people here who still live in the feudal ages, with the caste system working against them, and landlords squeezing every single paisa out of them, while they have to undergo life without the most basic of amenities.While I can rant and rave about how strongly I feel about such issues, the gravity of the same can hit you harder if you can view it on the visual medium, and this is exactly what has been done in the movie.Despite the fact that world is supposed to be shrinking, and being global citizens is the Harte thing now, there is no place like home!The movie is made in such a way as to provoke the viewer to embrace the ideals that the current generation is allegedly lacking. The one thing that makes this movie unique is the fact that it is down-to-earth in terms of the message it puts across, and what it tries to convey is nothing that every single ordinary Indian cannot do, if he/she makes up his/her mind to do it.Home is paradise waiting to be discovered.",

It is different from the usual Hindi film package, but is a must-watch for all who love meaningful cinema. The movie depicts the story of an NRI Mohan Bhargav played by the biggest star of Bollywood, Shahrukh Khan. The factors that make the film a must-watch are the top notch Direction by Ashutosh Gowariker, Music composed by Academy Award winner A.R Rahman, and above all, excellent performance by its lead actor Shahrukh Khan. The lead actress Gayatri Joshi is a very good actress and its sad that she had not been seen anywhere after this movie. The performances by all other actors are good, but, the movie belongs to none other than Shahrukh Khan. He does not dance or swing around trees, but delivers a performance that remains within everyone for a long long time. He proves yet again why he is called the King Khan and why he is always rated as the best and above all other superstars in Hindi Cinema. After watching the film, one can never forget the scene where Mohan Bhargav notices a small boy selling water for living. Just notice the way how he carefully looks at the boy with tears in his eyes. Or in that scene where he hears the story of a poor man who lives in a neighboring village, Shahrukh shines in all the scenes. He brings to life Mohan Bhargav performing the role with utmost sincerity. Overall this movie is a must watch for all those who love meaningful cinema.",

This film is surely gonna stir up a sea of emotions in the NRI Indian diaspora abroad. It will definitely appeal to people who have at some point in their lives left their motherland/home in search of a better life elsewhere. The film has all the ingredients that make it a commercial success as well. In short, this movie offers something somewhere for every Indian who has grown disillusioned of the ways/system of their own country. India deserved a film such as this for a long long time and finally, we have a piece of cinema which boasts of patriotism in an unconventional manner. Jai Hind!",

SRK has done a great job as Mohan may this is 1 of the most memorable role of his lifetime,everybody gives him good support in the movie,songs too are very good especially the title song by A.R.Rahman.Aushotosh also has done a great job,this is very very good.I give 10/10 stars to this movie this is movie of the lifetime",

But it's slightly too conventional and over-plodding at three hours and an extra thirty minutes which needs just too much of the patience, which I don't think Bollywood has to reward the film with cherished box office numbers. \"Lagaan\", despite being way more long, was a more terrific and original film. It's trimming too is slightly problematic. But to feel that an Indian director has made such an important story is winsome and great, and that makes \"Swades\" worth the price of your ticket. It's not perfect, but it'll be generous to say that it's not far from it either.",

I also feel extremely attracted towards lead actress Gayathri Joshi. Shahrukh Khan gives another great performance.
