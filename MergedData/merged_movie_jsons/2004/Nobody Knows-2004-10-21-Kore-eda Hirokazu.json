            "content": "\"Nobody Knows\" is painful to watch. It's a story you won't shake off, depicting the most defenseless of humans -- four young children, the oldest only twelve -- trapped in growing poverty and abandonment. It's a process-narrative of devolution that makes you feel helpless and angry and sad. It's saved from mawkishness by the natural energy of the children playing the roles of the four kids. And if it survives, its not because of its treatment of a social issue so much as for its evocation of the precise details of childhood.There are two main subjects here. One is criminal neglect: the story is loosely based on events that happened in Tokyo in 1988. The other is the private, often secret, lives of children. Koreeda began as a documentary filmmaker and this seems to have given him exceptional skill in working with people and capturing their natural reactions. The winning, tragic children in \"Nobody Knows,\" four half-siblings with different fathers and the same childish, selfish mother, never seem to be acting and often no doubt aren't. Nonetheless the subtlety of expression in the delicate, mobile, beautiful face of the older boy, young Y\u00fbya Yagira, was such that it won him the Best Actor award at Cannes last year.Also important is Koreeda's gift for detail, his meditative examinations of fingernails, feet, a toy piano, video games, pieces of paper, objects strewn around a room, the hundreds of little soft drink bottles that are everywhere in Japan, plants, dirt, all the small things children see because they're closer to the ground. And the things they accept because they're defenseless and innocent, but also incredibly adaptable.Akira, who's only ten and whose voice changed during year spent making the movie, is in charge. As their mother's absences become lengthier and the children finally seem to be abandoned for good, money runs out. Akira is captain of a sinking ship, a somber duty, but he and his little sisters and brother keep finding time to laugh and play.Koreeda's a passionately serious filmmaker: the two better known of his earlier fiction films deal with death and loss and here he considers as a given the worst of human carelessness and indifference both by society and the individual. \"Maborosi\" (1995) was a homage to Ozu but without Ozu's sense of social connectedness; it begins with an isolated couple in the city and chronicles a young widow's second marriage in the country through a slow pastiche of observed daily scenes where event and even dialogue are minimal concerns. The content of \"Maborosi\" is too thin, but the images and color are exquisite and the sequences of natural, unrehearsed-looking scenes achieve an impressively rich, beautiful, zen-like calm. \"After Life\" (1998) uses actual recollections of older people talking to the camera to build up a fantasy about dead souls held temporarily in a bureaucratic pre-Heaven limbo being asked to choose a single favorite memory to take with them into eternity: the effect is perplexing, thought-provoking, charming, and with great economy of means, cinematic.\"Nobody Knows\" isn't as brilliant or resolved as \"After Life\" or as exquisitely visual as \"Maborosi,\" but for all its rambling excessive length it delivers a quantity of undigested patient misery and joy that will evoke such noble antecedents from the classic world of cinematic humanism as Cl\u00e9ment's \"Forbidden Games,\" De Sica's \"Bicycle Thief,\" and the homeless father and son living on garbage in Kurosawa's Do-des-ka-den.What's new here though is a sense of the encompassing otherness of big modern cities and the stoicism and resiliency of childhood (and perhaps also of the Japanese personality). Keiko, the childish, weak, spoiled mother (played effectively -- we instantly hate her -- by You, who's some sort of pop star in Japan), sneaks three of her four children into the new apartment and tells them they can't go out, can't show themselves even on the balcony. (In the real event, this was largely because they were illegitimate and had no papers, but here the explanation is that their noise may get them evicted.) Only Akira can leave, and she won't let him or the others go to school. They're prisoners of their urban anonymity and of an impersonal contemporary society.As in Andrew Berkin's \"Cement Garden,\" the children also pretend everything's okay to escape the cruelty of the social welfare system. We watch agonizingly -- and many writers say the movie's somewhat too long; it does feel thus especially during the first hour -- but this time Koreeda's world is more direct and specific than before and there's plenty of talk. The children chatter among themselves. Eventually they go out and mix a bit by day with other children. Akira even talks to himself; he has to, because there's no adult coaching him so he must impersonate an elder adviser.Whatever its roughness and excess, \"Nobody Knows\" is intense and powerful film-making. Koreeda has put his whole heart and soul into this movie and with it achieves an experience you can't shrug off. Nor will you forget the kids, especially the beautiful boy, Y\u00fbya Yagira, who may be growing inch by inch into a star even as we speak.",

            "content": "\"Children can not choose their parents\" This was what came into my mind after I saw this movie.This movie is based on actual incident happened in 1988. It was much more miserable than the movie. A woman was living with a man. She thought he had filed the marriage notification. When their son was born, the man said he had filed the birth notification. One day he left her to live with another woman. When the boy reached the primary school age, she knew neither the marriage notification nor the birth notification were filed. Facing this situation, she decided to hide her children from the society. (According to another source, the mother told the police that she thought the birth notification of a bastard child would not be accepted.)She had met several men and had 5 children, two boys and three girls, who were not registered and hidden from other people. When the second boy died of sick, she hid the corps in the closet. While she works in a department store, the eldest son took care of three sisters. When the eldest son was 14, she went out to live with her new man, who was 16 years older than her. She gave the eldest son her address. When the children were protected by the police half a year later, a girl was dead, and the two were debilitated, as they were confined in a room and poorly fed. The girls were 3 and 2 y/o and still used diapers, but they were changed only once every day. It is reported that the eldest boy blamed himself for not being able to take good care of his sisters, instead of blaming his mother...Compared to the real story, the movie is less miserable. In the movie, even the little boy and girl look normal and pretty, but in the real story they were very poorly developed. But it was still more than enough to surprise me. What a mother! In a conversation with the eldest boy, she says \"May I not become happy?\" She acts on this thought, without thinking of the same right about her children. Her childish lisping talk describes her immaturity. And of course, men were more guilty. Sadly, children can not choose their parents.Every child acted amazingly well, very natural. Particularly, the eyes of the eldest boy, Akira, are very impressive. The eyes tell many things from their miserable life.",

            "content": "Acclaimed movie Dare mo shiranai (Nobody Knows, 2004) and related featurettes on the DVD from my Tokyo acquisition earlier this year, easily proved to be well worthy of my prolonged attention.Though slow-moving and long (almost 2.5 hours), one never gets bored watching four kids (in the movie of the age of 4, 6, 10 and 12 years) trying to survive on their own. Kids are kawaii (cute) and their performances touching, while bringing to life a bittersweet story of abandoned children. Trying to avoid attention from authorities and subsequent institutionalisation or imposed guardianship, inevitably leading to their separation, they are concealing the fact from their landlords and neighbours, continuing to live alone and thus staying together, sadly, with an almost unsurprisingly tragic outcome. Indeed a powerful story, based on real events. Unfortunately, as found on the free on-line encyclopedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobody_Knows_(2004_film), actual events, taking place in 1988 in Tokyo's Toshima-ku (ward), thoroughly described in \"The affair of the four abandoned children of Sugamo\" depiction of the incident, have been even far more gruesome. Well deserved rating 9 out of 10.",

            "review_title": "Getting into the child's mind",
            "content": "Spoilers Like 99.99% (or some such number) of the audience, I am no child psychologist (or any sort of psychologist, for that matter), but it just occurs to me that we won't fully appreciate Nobody Knows unless we cleanse ourselves of our adult mentality and try to get into the child's mind. We do get some help, with the POV shots at low levels, as the kids do spend a lot of time on the floor in the apartment which is both their home and their prison. Let me back up a little. A still relatively young mother, whose mental capacity is probably not that much more than that of a child, had four children with four different men. Renting an apartment together with her oldest, 12-year-old son, the only one of the four that she can reveal to the world at large, she smuggles the other three into this new 'home'. Leaving her children with no schooling at all, she goes away for weeks to pursue her own life, leaving Akira (Yagira Yuya) to look after his siblings. Her absence soon becomes perpetual, as the children can barely survive on the money she sends very occasionally.Such then, is the 'story', if it can be called one. But then, it is a true story, and what we see is close to being a documentary. Director Hirokazu explains clearly with the opening credit, however, that while the events are true, the characters of the children are created for the film. By helping us get into the world of these children, Director Hirokazu makes the film less gloomy than the actual events, at least during the first half of it.The two little ones are too young to worry about survival or truly comprehend sorrow. Shigeru (Kimura Hiei) is a little guy with insuppressible spirit and insatiable curiosity. Yuki (Shimuzu Momoko) is the most adorable little girl there is. In their child's world, they quietly accept being barely at the fringe of survival, such as having to wash in public fountains when water supply at the apartment has been cut off. What is most heartbreaking is watching Akiru's younger (slightly) sister Kyoko (Kitaura Ayu). While the little kids are 'smuggled' into the apartment in the luggage, Kyoko travels by herself in a train, to be met by Akiru at night. The first thing she asks her brother is the location of the washing machine, because washing is apparently the family duty assigned to her and she is worried that if the washing machine in out on the balcony, she will not be able to discharge her responsibility without being spotted by neighbors. Duty-conscious and extremely good-natured, her dispositions are almost angelic. But she also has all the dreams of a pre-adolescent girl. She tries on her mother's nail polish and, idling at the small toy piano, dreams of the day when she will have her own piano. And yet, at the very first family (that is, the four kids') financial trouble, she contributes all the money she's been saving for that very purpose.It's 14-year-old Yagira Yuya, playing 12-year-old Akira, that won the best actors award at Cannes, beating strong contenders in Hong Kong's 2046 and Korea's Old Boy. Akira is a pre-adolescent boy growing towards adolescence under the enormous burden of looking after the family in a continuously deteriorating financial situation. He hides a lot within himself as he toughs his way through vicissitudes, but the child in him is not totally lost. He lets go at one point, allowing himself to be indulged in video games and baseball. His tantalizing adolescent yearning is brought out in an unusual friendship with rebellious rich schoolgirl Saki (Kan Hanae) who later becomes part of the 'family'. The final trail is a tragic incident for which he must be blaming himself on his temporary absence. Such is the range of emotions that Yuya had to handle, and his Cannes award is well deserved.The film starts not without light, happy moments, particularly as seen through the child's eye in the audience. As the situation gets from bad to worse, Director Hirokazu does not drag us through wails and screams, as a lesser one would. He doesn't even give that much dialogue. Through the two hours of the film he simply bleeds our hearts with images of these children whom we have come to really care for, and goes on to bleed them some more.",

            "content": "In Tokyo, the reckless single mother Keiko (You) moves to a small apartment with her twelve years old son Akira Fukushima (Y\u00fbya Yagira) and hidden in the luggage, his siblings Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura), Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu). The children have different fathers and do not have schooling, but they have a happy life with their mother. When Keiko finds a new boyfriend, she leaves the children alone, giving some money to Akira and assigning him to take care of his siblings. When the money finishes, Akira manages to find means to survive with the youngsters without power supply, gas or water at home, and with the landlord asking for the rental.\"Dare mo Shiranai\" is a sensitive movie based on a true and very sad story. The performances of the children are amazing, highlighting the look of Y\u00fbya Yagira, and the drama is developed in a slow, but suitable pace. The direction is effective and the music score is absolutely adequate to the film. However, living in Rio de Janeiro, where we see homeless children begging on the streets everywhere, the terrible situation of Akira and his siblings does not impress the way it certainly does in First World countries. The abandoned children of the film have an apartment to live and food to eat, what does not happen in Third World countries, where famine children live on the streets in a sadder and unacceptable reality. The open conclusion is a little disappointing, since it does not bring any message of hope or lack of hope to the poor children. It seems that life goes on only. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Ningu\u00e9m Pode Saber\" (\"Nobody Can Know\")",

            "content": "Today I went to the pre-screening of \"Nobody Knows,\" a stunningly brilliant film by director Hirokazu Koreeda who also directed the philosophical \"After Life.\" What if I were a 12 years old boy and left alone to take care of two younger sisters and one younger brother in a big city like Tokyo, and I have to hide them in the apartment so nobody knows about them? That's what I have been thinking when I was watching this film and how the film gets my sympathy for these children. It allows me to experience the ordeal through these children's eyes and the transcending performance by Yuya Yagira, who is the youngest actor ever won the best actor award in the history of Cannes Film Festival.Director Koreeda allows the camera to take the time to shoot and he never rushes from one scene to the next. He let me observe, let me feel, let me be as close to these children as I possibly can, until I can no longer take it and until I am drowned by the frustration and sadness. I become as helpless as those children, because I simply can not resist the urge to help them. That makes me cry. Through out the film, Koreeda masterfully positioned his lenses to ordinary objects around these children, such as simply a finger, a hand, a stain, a foot, or four empty glasses. But through these zoomed in images, I have no trouble to \"see\" and \"feel\" what's going on in the whole picture. And it tells the story in a more profound fashion and more personal way, a story you will never forget, along with those images, sometimes, even the music.The 12 years old boy is played by Yuya Yagira, who has a haircut like the Japanese animation character. Yagira's outstanding performance is original and remarkable, and simply unforgettable. Through him, you see a premature 12 years old boy who is acting as an adult to take care the other kids, meanwhile, he is still a 12 years old kid, who will just like other kids around his age. That's make this movie can be so hard to watch sometimes, because no matter how hard your heart is, it will be softened by watching his struggle to survive. It's hard to leave this movie with dry eyes.There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best film I have seen this year.",

            "content": "There are very few films I have seen that had the power to affect me as deeply as Nobody Knows. As highly as I recommend it, I must also forewarn, that this film has power, some very serious power. To call Hirokazu Koreeda's Nobody Knows anything less than a masterpiece would be an insult to the story it tells. The craftsmanship we witness here, from the masterful direction to the outstanding performances that the children were able to commit to, are all something of incredible proportions.Nobody Knows, which is a true story, tells of four siblings, ages 5-12, from different fathers, who live in a small apartment in Tokyo. At first, they live in the apartment with their childish Mother who is hardly ever home. With the exception of the oldest, Akira, the mother snuck the children in to keep the rent lower and prohibits them from ever leaving the apartment, even the veranda, for fear of them being seen. The children do not go to school. As they look after each other, all they do is patiently and affectionately wait for their mother to come home.As the story progresses, the children wake up one morning to some money on the kitchen table with a note from their mother saying that she'll be home in a month. As Akira steps up and takes charge of the apartment, the bills, and his siblings, the children still hold hope that mother will be home soon. And then, Nobody Knows hits you like a truck and goes right through you. Complete Abandonment. The smiles diminish and the childish affection for a mother that will never return is gone. Gone to play mother to another family, it is now entirely up to Akira, with money running out.Koreeda's direction of the children is exceptional, as if the film was shot entirely candid. The camera-work is sincere, as if we were one of the children stuck in that apartment. There are no gimmicks here, no slide of hand, or post-production miracles. Nobody Knows is raw, and thrives in Koreeda's ability to capture the distinct personalities of all four siblings, their hopes, and those secretive moments where Koreeda directs the children not for the stories sake, but for the sake of the children being children.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Nobody Knows is the performances of the four children. All four children, who conjured phenomenal performances, were played by Japanese youths with no film backgrounds. After you see the film, it is likely that Koreeda preferred it this way, tapping into the honesty and energy that such youth had to offer. Their performances are so sincere and beautiful that on several occasions the tears will start to fall, the goose bumps will rise, and your heart will undoubtedly cry out to rescue these children, to grab them in your arms and set them free.Without giving too much away, one of the most touching scenes to me, is on Yuki's birthday, the only thing she wants is to be able to go outside for a walk with her big brother Akira. So when the night comes, she puts on her little bear slippers, an ear to ear smile on her face, and with her hand in her brothers hand, they set her heart free for if not only a night.Nobody Knows is a film that I will never let go of. This film impacted me so much and I found it so absolutely remarkable, that it hasn't left my mind since it's viewing. I almost feel that recommending this film just isn't enough, and all I can say is that I hope everyone gets the chance to enjoy this film for all that it is worth. As sure as it is to invoke emotion, it is as sure to please as a piece of cinema.",

            "content": "\"Nobody Knows\", directed by Hirozaku Koreeda, is a compelling film that will grab the viewer's attention from the start. The film, based on a real incident in Japan is one of the saddest accounts in memory about children's abuse by uncaring parents.If you haven't seen the movie, maybe you would like to stop reading.When we first meet this family, Keiko, the mother, and Akira, are seen bringing their things to the tiny apartment they have rented. Little by little we see two young children emerge from two huge suitcases, at the risk of suffocating, and another one that is waiting at a train station. This mother and the four children seem to be happy being together. Since the lease is for only two persons, the other kids must be quiet, as they don't want to bring undue attention from the landlord and his wife, who also live in the complex.We realize Keiko's love for her children comes second to her life as a woman of loose morals; she may be a prostitute, although it's left to the viewer's imagination what she does after she leaves the apartment. Akira, being the oldest, is in charge of the other three. It becomes clear these four children are the product of different fathers. Yet, all four function as though they have the same set of parents.Keiko, who appears to be just another kid, thinks nothing in leaving these four to fend for themselves, while she is going out of town with her present beau. Keiko is the epitome of cruelty. How can a mother even dream of abandoning these young kids and expect Akira to assume full responsibility for the situation?Akira, is a study of maturity beyond belief. Only in that type of society, someone like this boy can exist. Akira is seen in his daily routine going to the store and cook for the siblings and the mother, while she's still around. Akira realizes he has a responsibility, as he never resorts to stealing, even when he becomes friendly with some bad kids from his area. Akira realizes he is the head of the household and must protect those that have been placed under his care, something the real mother has neglected to do.The film is a document about children's abuse and cruelty. Mr. Koreeda has been blessed with a cast that do miracles for him. Yuya Yagira, does an incredible job as Akira. All the children appear to be non professionals, but under the guidance of the director, they make us believe they are the abandoned children living alone and eking out a living for themselves.",

            "content": "'Dare mo shiranai' (NOBODY KNOWS) is a gleaming little film by writer/director Hirokazu Koreeda that offers a version of a true story so simply and eloquently that by the end of the film the audience is powerfully moved - without gimmicks, without imitation emotional devices, without major stars. It just simply works. Though the film is long at 2 1/2 hours the journey is well worth it and indeed the prolonged length seems necessary to convey the plight of these touching children's plight.The film opens (during the titles) on public transportation where a youthful mother Keiko (the pop star You) and her young son Akira (Y\u00fbya Yagira) sit guarding an ugly pink suitcase and other bags. Keira and Keiko have rented a poor little apartment promising the landlord that Keiko will make no noise. Once inside their new home the ugly bags are open and two additional children emerge and a trip to the bus station adds yet a third child! Thus, 'unknown' to the landlord, the apartment contains a family of five! Soon Keiko leaves on a trip to 'make money', leaving some cash with Akira who is placed in charge of his brother and sisters. Of course, Keiko doesn't return except for one brief visit months later, and leaving the children to fend for themselves.Akira manages to make friends outside, gaining food and money for good deeds and good will, keeping his little 'family' afloat. Gradually Akira realizes that Keiko will never return and through his friendship with a young girl still manages to eek out an existence: the manner in which he keeps his family happy is food for the soul! But despite his constant good intentions to maintain a life for his family, one of his sisters dies and he and his girl friend bury her where she can 'watch the airplanes'. And life goes on. There is no ending depicted, just continuum.With the subtlest technique Koreeda creates a story so real that it pulsates. The child actors (especially Y\u00fbya Yagira) are so natural and fine that they grab our hearts tenaciously. The only music in this film is a few notes form a toy piano and quiet harp music that enhances the feeling of isolation of the children. This is a film of rare beauty, one that could have been edited a bit, but even that criticism is overshadowed by the impact of Hirokazu Koreeda's overall achievement. Very Highly Recommended.

            "content": "A woman by the name of Keiko moves into an apartment with her son, Akira, smuggling in her other three, younger children so the landlord doesn't know of their existence. Some weeks go by, and the mother meets a man. She goes off with him and doesn't return for many months, leaving twelve-year-old Akira in charge of the household. He struggles to care for his family, barely scraping by with what little money his mother left. Somehow, he manages to do it with no serious ramifications. Keiko eventually returns, but it's not for long, and young Akira is forced once again to take up the mantle and look after his siblings; though this time it will be a much more difficult and lengthy process, with far more devastating results.Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Nobody Knows' is a powerful, poignant drama based on the infamous Sugamo child abandonment case of 1988. The film is quietly affecting, telling the simple story of how Akira is forced to act like an adult to his siblings, trying to keep them safe and sound while being but a child himself: a Sisyphean task if ever there was one. Koreeda's screenplay is free of unnecessary sentiment or pretention; it is direct and unflinching, exploring many themes, the importance of parenthood being but one.Koreeda's story is honest and emotionally charged, with minimal dialogue and layered characterization that is full of vivid believability and depth. The audience cares deeply for Akira and his siblings, as well as understanding- if not liking- Keiko and how she could leave her family for so long. It is masterful, understated screenwriting that will really hit home. Koreeda's best films explore humanity and connection, how everybody needs somebody sometime (to paraphrase the Dean Martin song). 'Nobody Knows' does too; to great effect.It is worth mentioning that- in addition to writing and directing- Koreeda also acts as his own editor, so the tone and pacing is consistent from page to screen. The film moves at its' own pace, which is reserved but steady; ever-forging onwards towards the dramatic conclusion like a soldier in the snow. Also of note is Yutaka Yamazaki's restrained and naturalistic cinematography. His work is subtle and assured, resulting in images captured both with clarity and an artistic sense of space and composition. Yamazaki and Koreeda have worked together numerous times, with their collaborations usually resulting in striking, visually inventive films that one remembers long after seeing them. 'Nobody Knows' is another notch on their proverbial shared belt.An old showbusiness adage goes \"you should never work with children or animals,\" which is proven to be complete poppycock when one witnesses the efforts of the remarkable cast in 'Nobody Knows.' Y\u00fbya Yagira stars as Akira, delivering a captivating, masterful performance of integrity, profundity and subtle emotional perspicuity. Yagira is a brilliant performer, who can transmit emotions and say much- near incomparable in intensity and eloquence- with his physicality and through his silence. He was only thirteen when the film was shot and Yagira shows more intelligence and depth than most actors four times his age. He is a remarkably intuitive and natural actor who is fascinating to watch; and the power of his performance will have you frequently in tears while watching 'Nobody Knows.'His siblings are played wonderfully by Ayu Kitaura, Hiei Kimura and Momoko Shimizu, with Shimizu particularly impressing as the youngest child Yuki. Yukiko Ehara- better known as You- plays the mother, Keiko, and is perfect for the character. You doesn't play her as totally selfish, more as a young woman whose life raising children alone isn't what she wanted, and is desperate for things to change. She brings to the character much depth and charm; despite being slightly incorrigible. Rounding out the main cast is Hanae Kan, who plays a school-girl Akira befriends. She makes for a welcome addition to the film, and delivers a strong performance to boot.Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Nobody Knows' is a sad, quiet film about abandonment that will move any with heart strings left to tug. Featuring powerful performances from the cast- especially the young Y\u00fbya Yagira- and striking cinematography from Yutaka Yamazaki; the film is not easily forgotten. Poignant, profound and powerful, 'Nobody Knows' is unaffected, uncompromising and unforgettable cinema.",

            "content": "This film is beautiful in its simplicity...it is at times sweet, warm, funny and always heartbreaking...it is essentially about four children surviving on their own after their mother leaves them in search of her own happiness....The show seemingly lacks any action or any exciting moments, but i was totally absorbed during the two plus hours of the film...this is largely because of the superb performances of the adorable children, who were all really natural and likable. You just feel for them and wonder at the callousness of their mother and respective fathers. The dialogue is simple yet meaningful and through the day-to-day unraveling of the plot, one sees the contrast between the courage, maturity and innocence of children, and the selfishness and childishness of adults. The realist, documentary style of filming allows viewers to see things from the eye of the children...a great film that will make u feel rather depressed at the end of it...not for those who do not like slowly-paced films with not much action.",

            "content": "Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Dare Mo Shiranai' tells the heartbreaking story of four abandoned young siblings who struggle to survive in an apartment. The apartment was restricted to two people (where no little children were allowed). It is known that Akira and his mother were the only tenants thus the three other children are living in secret (and are not allowed to leave the apartment or make any noise in case the neighbours got suspicious). While Akira is the only one allowed to leave the apartment, he is forbidden to go to school. After their self-centred mother's long term departure due to her 'work', 12-year-old Akira, the eldest one, serves as a parent striving to provide food for his brother and sisters but he too is only a child and how will he, in a world run by adults, support his siblings? The director tells this unique story in a very heartfelt, sensitive way. 'Dare Mo Shiranai' is based on a true event (which was far more harrowing) but I can see that he might have been inspired by movies like 'Hotaru No Haka' and perhaps William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies'. With the minimal use of music, special effects the film has an unpolished look which makes the characters' sense of isolation and despair all the more authentic to the viewer. The whimsical background score is cleverly used and it brings a poetic feel. The child actors are excellent. It is Y\u00fbya Yagira who confidently carries the film but each one of these kids deliver very natural performances. It's hard to tell whether they were acting. Moreover because the film is sort of shot in documentary format it is easy to forget that one is watching a film. I wonder how the director got the kids to act so restrained. 'Dare Mo Shiranai' is a beautiful film that depicts the importance of a responsible adult figure in children's lives but it also demonstrates that children too are strong even though inexperienced. Yet, no matter what, the importance of a significant nurturing adult is crucial for a child's development.",

            "review_title": "A film of deep compassion",
            "content": "Hirokazu Kore'eda's Nobody Knows is a film of deep compassion about four young children abandoned by their mother in a small apartment in Tokyo. Based on a real incident in 1988, the film was written, directed, produced, and edited by Kore'eda whose earlier films, Maborosi and After Life were introspective meditations on life and death. Though his latest film is primarily a coming-of-age film about the transformation of a pre-adolescent boy, no film I've seen in recent memory has filled me with as much sadness for the failure of modern society to provide a coherent set of values for people. While there have been other films about the alienation of big city life, particularly by Tsai Ming-ling (The River, What Time Is it There?) they tend to be cold and impersonal and convey an emotional deadness. Such is not the case here where the children's natural vivacity and warmth make their closeness to each other more real, and ultimately all the more heartbreaking.The center of the film is 12-year old Akira who must care for his brothers and sisters when his mother leaves the home. Akira is remarkably portrayed by Yuya Yagira who was named Best Actor for his performance at Cannes in 2004. His strong and compassionate eyes reveal a depth of understanding, rare in an actor that young. Supporting him is his sister ten-year old Kyoko (Kitaura Ayu), seven-year old Shigeru (Kimura Hiei), and four-year old Yuki (Shimizu Momoko), all from different fathers. The children's birth was never registered and they do not attend school. They are the ultimate city dwellers, anonymous and alone.As the film opens, the mother Keiko (Japanese television performer You) moves into a new apartment with Akira. Fearing eviction because of too much noise, the other children are packed in suitcases so the landlord does not find out they are living in the apartment. Since they are all from different fathers and do not attend school, the world does not even know that they exist. Keiko tells the children that they must adhere to strict rules: no loud talking and no going outside the apartment even to the balcony. As the children settle in, one day Akira finds a note from his mother together with some money telling him that she is going away for a while and asks him to look after the family.Using all natural lighting the film explores the details of the children's ups and downs living by themselves inside a cramped apartment for months. Much of the dialogue is improvised and we are not even aware of the children acting, just living moment by moment. Akira has to buy the groceries, handle the finances, and do all the things that an adult should be doing. \"He is the only adult in that family,\" says Kore'eda. \"The mother is much more immature than he is. But he's the adult only because that role has been forced onto him.\" The only time he is shown being a child is when he plays video games or baseball and has some adventures with some other boys in the neighborhood, but it is fleeting.At first playful, then gradually becoming passive and withdrawn, we watch in dismay as the conditions of their lives gradually deteriorate. The lights and water are turned off because of failure to pay the bills and the children have to wash in public fountains and light their rooms by candle. Though normally this would be very depressing, the children convey such feelings of joy, especially when they are finally let out to run around the park that our feelings of hopelessness are temporarily uplifted. Kore'eda said, \"children are incredibly resilient, to just label these children's six months alone together as pathetic or tragic, you wouldn't get any closer to understanding either the children or what they experienced.\" Yet there is sadness, and the more difficult life becomes the more we hope that the children will be rescued, though we know that Akira has said that he would not report the situation to any authority for fear of breaking up the family. Nobody Knows has a running time of two hours and twenty-one minutes and requires patience, yet it's total effect is stunning. In the final sequence, the city of Tokyo is shown in silence as if to underscore the emotional disconnection of the modern city where people live in close proximity but nobody knows and nobody cares.",

            "content": "Keiko is a single mother living with her four children (all from different fathers) in a cramped apartment she's recently rented in a middle class section of Tokyo. Fearful that they will be thrown out onto the streets if the neighbors or landlord discover the existence of the kids, she makes the three youngest ones stay indoors and out of sight while the oldest, 12-year-old Akira, is allowed to venture out to run errands and enjoy at least some semblance of a normal life. None of the children attend school. Despite his youth, Akira, in many ways, has been forced to assume the role of parent, providing for the other children while Keiko stays away for months at a time, ostensibly earning money working (though we are inclined to speculate that there may be a far more nefarious truth behind the absences that is never fully revealed to us).Based on a true story, \"Nobody Knows\" is more of an observational study on human behavior than a full-fledged narrative; it is a film that uses the minutiae of everyday life, rather than heavy-handed plot points, to generate its drama. As virtual prisoners in their own apartment, the children survive as best they can without adult supervision or guidance. Indeed, in its own quiet way, the film serves as an allegory of a much larger issue, a stinging indictment against a society that too often abandons and neglects its children to pursue its own selfish interests - most often to devastating and disastrous results both for the youngsters themselves and for the society as a whole.Beautifully written and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda, this is a heartrending film filled with moments of quiet perceptions and unforgettable images. The actors portraying the children are all truly amazing - wholly natural, unaffected and believable in front of the camera. Yuya Yagira, as young Akira, is basically called on here to carry the film and he does so in a way that leaves one awestruck and breathless. His is an exquisitely internalized performance, serious and stoic on the outside, yet with a sly mischievousness that peeks through from time to time to remind us that Akira is really just a kid at heart, forced to grow up much too fast and assume the mantle of adult responsibility that the actual \"adults\" around him have been all too eager to abandon. What's so heartbreaking about this film is watching these sweet (but never cloying) children being deprived of all the true essentials of a happy childhood - freedom, fresh air, open space, education, even food and electricity, not to mention the all-important feeling of security and belonging that comes with the love and guidance of a fully engaged parent. Yet, although they yearn for all these things, the children seem to accept their plight with a sort of uncomplaining fatalism combined with a love of one another and a resourcefulness and spirit of survival that is both astonishing and inspiring.Nothing about \"Nobody Knows\" is ever obvious or underlined, not its message and certainly not its emotions. These seep into the film gradually and unobtrusively so as not to disturb the near-documentary nature of the movie. We feel almost as if we are eavesdropping on the children, as if we were the very neighbors from whom they are trying so desperately to hide. There's no point in denying that the movie requires patience from the viewer, for it achieves its power subtly and slowly, through an artfully arranged accumulation of activities and details. Yet, this is precisely what draws us into the world of the film and makes us, finally, not mere observers but rather empathetic participants with the characters.It takes time to get to where it's going, but \"Nobody Knows\" will leave an indelible mark on your heart.",

            "content": "Dare mo shiranai (2004) (Nobody Knows) is an extraordinary film, written, produced, and directed by Hirokazu Koreeda.The basic plot outline is relatively straightforward--four children are left alone for months in an apartment by their mother.However, the actual film is far more complex. The three younger children aren't allowed out of the apartment. (The landlord will rent only to the mother and her older son, who is twelve. The other children have to be smuggled into the apartment, and are forced to remain inside so no one will know they're there.) To add to their problems, the children are also chronically short of money.The burden of survival is placed on the shoulders of Akira, a pre-adolescent young man of extraordinary good will and intelligence. He has to do all the things a parent would do-- maintain the apartment, purchase and prepare food, pay the bills, etc. Naturally, a normal life is impossible for any of the children, but by sheer determination they muddle through somehow as the months pass and their mother doesn't return.No one is overtly cruel to the children, and some people actively help them. However, as the title implies, nobody knows the true situation the children face, and, in fact, nobody tries very hard to find out.Y\u00fbya Yagira as the older brother Akira is exceptional. All the children are superb actors. The mother, played by an actor named You, is outstanding as a woman who is still young and attractive, and in many ways is less mature than her son. She wishes the children no harm--she just doesn't understand why she can't live as a free and happy single woman. Caring for four young children just doesn't fit her life style.There's an interesting contrast between the mother in this film and the mother in a French film (Viper in the Fist) I recently reviewed. The mother in Viper in the Fist is a horrible parent because she tries to control and mold every aspect of her children's lives. In Nobody Knows, the mother is equally horrible, but for just the opposite reason--she controls and molds nothing. In a U.S. movie, the children would meet all the challenges, and cope collectively with each new problem. In life, things don't always work out in this neat and uplifting fashion. The story is heartwarming in its way, but remember that the film wasn't made by the Disney studios.",

Often we neglect these little details; often we neglect the unfortunate people around us.Once in a while we have a world disaster, we all jumped in, we all gave our helping hands, we all praised greatly how much help we gave on TV. Comparing and contrast the figures of aids given with other countries, even. Little things, little unfortunate things happened around us, everyday, everywhere, they are all nicely tucked under our lavish mat and those story never told, those needed aid never arrived. Because they have no news value or because helping a few people doesn't gain enough prestige? Nobody knows, as the title suggest, We never aware of these problems, by our own choice or not.

            "content": "No doubt there are others I haven't heard of, but for me Dare mo shiranai forms the latest entry in a trilogy of Japanese films based on true incidents involving abusive parents: Oshima's 1969 Shonen (Boy), Nomura's 1978 Kichiku (The Demon) are the others. Shonen I saw long ago and isn't available. Kichiku I watched barely two weeks ago. Nomura's camera tends to accuse, while Oshima's, if I recall, just watches, miming cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Kore-eda, like Oshima, tends -- I mean this literally not pejoratively -- to voyeurism.Knowing the story too well already from difficult-to-dodge early reviews and distributor publicity, I couldn't help seeing as ironic the early scenes in which the children's mother Keiko is still a factor. Her voice an almost cute nasal whisper, something like that of a child boisterously ignoring a cold (compare the whisper-singing actress in Swallowtail Butterfly and Picnic or I don't know which Karie Kahimi cut (but my favorites are all on Larmes de Crocodile)), she comes across as a really great mother. The family may be on the outs, sneaking, two or three gone fetal inside suitcases, into a one-child apartment, but it's a family of five, not four victims and a demon. The \"unpacking\" of the children looks clever, magical. It's fairytale stuff. So is the chatter, the family life, those first nights especially, in the new apartment. Keiko's one of them and their mother in charge of them, all at once. They may complain but they clearly admire something in her, and obey her to the letter. They've learned from her a self-reliance that so astounds throughout the film, that its slow breakdown is that much more shattering. Not just their compliance, but the skill with which they do without her during her increasingly long absences testify to what she's done for and with them. How many children you know could survive this well for this long in these circumstances?Or is what I'm seeing just the actress You's skill with the nonprofessional child actors? I think probably it's both, You and Keiko, and that Kore-eda knew and used this.There's going to be too much written here about this film (and on the IMDb message board look for some really knowledgeable comments by YukoK that make my top of the head rambling near worthless by comparison). I try never to repeat or preempt others' contributions, but wondered how many would register Keiko's mother-skills.Kore-eda doesn't shy from deconstructing the closest thing he has here to a protagonist, eldest son Akira. After Keiko's whisper-voice goes slowly sinister and collapses finally into written notes, we watch his will and integrity falter even as he attracts the sympathy of the shop girl and cast-out Saki. I don't think there's a deliberately sentimental shot in the entire film. The achingly symbolic garden that mimics Akira's decline and the nighttime trek to the burial site may come closest, but both are forgivable and may have been unavoidable. If you haven't already seen Nobody Knows, prepare yourself for a fine ten-minute cry.See my comment at Distance (2001) for a snippet of Kore-eda apologetic in person.",

Nobody knows why those children have to confront a wicked thing which they doesn't deserve; this wicked thing was already part of their lives when they were born. Even so, since the first minute, the film irradiates optimism: before their mother abandon them, the family seems a poor family but so happy in spite of; even the difficulties that the siblings have to go on, it seems that they will survive (it is as if there is not enough wickedness to hinder the passing of life). The movie is strongly reinforced by the actors' performances (really striking and outstanding), it is as if a hidden camera was filming their lives without they noticing it.

            "content": "This is a pretty amazing film. It is the story of four children who are ultimately abandoned by their mother soon after the fatherless family moves into an new apartment.Nobody Knows does a deft job at portraying child abuse and abandonment. The mother clearly loves her children and also, clearly is incapable of taking care of them. She is more of a child herself then her own children. And this is what works so well in this film, it's subtlety. Nothing is forced on the viewer.The mother disappears twice, the second time for good. In both instances, she says that she will be back and places the burdens of maintaining the family on her 12 year old son, Akira. Akira manages as well as he can keeping the family together. According to the bizarre rules set out by the mother, no child is allowed to go to school outside the apartment. After she leaves, Akira manages to adhere the family to these rules and manage the finances until the situation slowly unravels in the parent-less environment.As a parental figure, Akira does he best until his own needs overwhelm him. He wants to go to school, have friends, play baseball and even develop crushes on girls. All these aspects of growing up are represented, and all of them are shown in Akira's world as unfulfilled desires. He develops some friends who quickly abandon him, since his child dominated household is \"messy and stinky\" as they put it, he gets to realize his love for baseball only when a playground team needs an extra. In each instance, Akira must return home to take care of his brothers and sisters who are slowly venturing away from the \"rules\" themselves.As Akira runs out of money, the electricity and other utilities get shut off. Somewhat inexplicably, only once is the rent asked for by a landlord seemingly clueless that a cluttered apartment filled with unsupervised kids is not unusual.By showing Akiras strength, the film illustrates how heroic even a child as young as 12 can be. It also shows how tragic a situation can end up when children are abandoned and left to take care of themselves.Highly recommended.",

More than others he loves the static shot, where action often takes place outside the frame; movement in and out of the frame of reference is common while the camera does not move. That's why his movies are sometimes perceived as slow and unevolving.The same with storytelling: a significant part of the story takes place outside the story on screen. And even in a scene the whole scene is never completely obvious: We often have to fill in the details. The effect requires much attention from the viewer, but can also be very interesting or downright shocking.All his movies also seem to restrict the space where the movie plays out. Repetitive shots in Dare mo shiranai / Nobody Knows of the shopping street, the stairs, the home, etc. seem to strengthen this notion, in order to tell how restricted the world is for the children portrayed. This is further enhanced by the element of time: Time becomes less important throughout the movie as the mother's visits become less and less predictable (the use of the seasons contradicts this in a way).In communication between actors much emphasis is laid on non-verbal communication, which is superbly done here. (In Distance this went even so far that the story was almost completely told in this way).Conclusion: Dare mo shiranai/ Nobody Knows is a rewarding movie, but for patient viewers only.",

            "content": "A semi-fictionalized adaption of a true incident where a single mother abandons four children to live by themselves seems the material of exploitation or empty moralizing. But Kore-eda proves himself one of the finest film makers in the world today with this straight up masterpiece - a gorgeous, searingly intelligent, beautifully made film.One of the great strengths of this film is that he never takes the easy way out and judges the adults or tries to score easy points about an atomized, uncaring society. The mother is portrayed as child like herself, narcissistic, but more deluded than evil, she somehow convinces herself that her 12 year old son is capable of looking after the family. The adults are just regular people, going about their lives without feeling the need to ask awkward questions about the dirty looking children who turn up sometimes at playgrounds or wander around parks. The only people who suspect these children are abandoned are teenagers working in local shops, who are cowed into not taking the initiative, instead just offering little acts of kindness to the kids, accepting at face value the lies given to them.This is perhaps the most successful film ever made which gives a genuine child's eyed view of the world. The acting by the child actors is simply astonishing - completely naturalistic. The way in which these fundamentally nice kids try their best to deal with the situation they are landed in, but which inevitably falls apart is deeply moving and entirely convincing. The film is long, but is entirely engrossing, and enlightened with moments of real beauty and grace. The scene where the older boy and a lonely girl he meets bring his dead sister to the airport, where he always said he would show here the airplanes landing is quite stunning. To avoid sentimentality or exploitation in scenes like this requires a film maker with deep humanity, as well as immense technical skill. The film is not the easiest of viewing, but after seeing this film, you will never forget it. Absolutely essential.",

It was so intense that I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie, and not \"real-life.\" I was emotionally drained at the end of this movie, and I'm not ashamed to say this film left me in tears.There are so many incredible things to say about this film. At times, you forgot these were just kids, and then the director reminded you that they were. And then you remembered once again that they should have been outside playing and laughing, rather than hanging on and trying to just survive. One of my favorite scenes is when Akira decides to let his 3 siblings out of the house for the first time, and you see their joy just running around laughing and screaming.The little girl who played Yuki was irresistible and adorable. I think they handled her passing as tastefully as they could.This film will long stay with me. An absolute masterpiece.",

            "content": "Somewhere in the middle of this picture, I reconciled myself with the idea that I didn't need to anticipate any evolution on the plot since I was convinced that I was living a true experience! A story that can be shown in less than half an hour unfolds into a series of extraordinary cinema moments. Koreeda has zoomed with incredible detail into the child condition, so much that anyone can relate and recall childhood memories of his/her own even if they don't resemble at all with the film's story. *SPOILER* Until the very end I expected a certain catharsis, something that never came. I was also left questioning: what is the role of the schoolgirl that joins the kids at the last stages of the film and what makes her mingle? Isn't she old enough to asses the problem and spread the word somewhere? But perhaps these problems are part of the film's strength and not weakness. The schoolgirl is an indicator that the four kids in question are not an isolated incident. She is the helpless society that just follows along. She is a victim of neglect as well despite her better standards of living. Neglect goes beyond social status. Her bonding with the four kids maybe keeps her silent as she becomes part of them. But even if she has communicated the problem to others, is there anyone who cares? Even if things get resolved at the end, even if the authorities intervene, and even if there is a slim possibility that these children have a better future, Koreeda insists that the problem remains. The film is not about answers but about questions. About contemporary urban realities and that's were the focus is on.Favorite scene: Akira taking out his little sister and showing her the trains that pass by. Wonderfully observant camera, superb acting, very good musical theme that is repeated throughout and great use of sounds. Poetic cinema that triggers the heart and the mind. 9/10",

            "content": "Kore-eda's newest feature continues in the same vein as his other unhurried and placid works. His characters are caught in a state of flux, between transitionary moments, exemplified perfectly in his serene and incredibly original film, \"After Life.\" Other reviewers have frequently mentioned that film as a note of comparison, but really \"Nobody Knows\" hearkens back further in the director's career to his sublime and visually intoxicating \"Maboroshi,\" about a widow coping with the sudden death of her spouse. Kore-eda is in his comfort zone here, capturing moments of transcendental beauty in the quotidian. What makes Kore-eda such a gifted artist behind the lens, and one of the more important active filmmakers, is his ability to linger on such moments \u0096 a stain of nail polish on a hardwood floor or a static shot of a playground in the rain \u0096 while making such snapshots appear fleeting. Different shot after shot appears briefly, he lets us soak it in, and then it's gone. Perhaps no other director working today can capture the natural beauty around us, and transfigure that sublimity so effortlessly in single flashes.Of course, like some other reviewers on this site have mentioned, nearly two and a half hours of hot flashes is tiring and demands something else to alleviate it from monotony. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson on \"Paradise Lost,\" no one would wish this thing ran any longer. It's all good to tell a story visually, and nothing wrong for a film to run long if it can sustain it, but each \"moment\" captures the same feelings over and over again \u0096 i.e. loneliness, longing, and despair, or what is essentially the struggle to overcome desperation. With a story of such linear decline, then, there is little else besides all the same emotions washing over us until one is totally subsumed in bleak numbness. When there is a break, like a baseball game, the result is more absurd Beat Takeshi irony than serene Kore-eda sobriety. While each shot might be different here, since we know the plot can only really head in one direction, Kore-eda's latest then suffers from too long a running time to sustain the unchanging essence of his film. The repetitive tone and tempo might be the point, sure, but is rather pointless when the ideas are all the same.This chief fault keeps this film from becoming a mark on the director's canon, but \"Nobody Knows\" is still filled with those pretty important ideas. As some critics have pointed out, the film is mitigated by a sense of anger that this was in fact a real-life event, but Kore-eda's treatment is what distinguishes his piece from an enraged social tract like, say, Paul Greengrass's \"Bloody Sunday.\" Despite this sense of anger (Kore-eda has said in interviews that his parents were largely absent in his youth as well) the film is nearly absent of sentimentality (nearly, except for the ending). A Japanese obsession with cuteness still remains, but the film is thankfully more realistic in portraying emotions; the kids look at their misfortunes with a level eye, and the protagonist Akira snaps at his siblings from frustration on a couple occasions. This might be a good spot to mention the excellent job by Yuya Yagira, who's bravura and remarkably detailed physical performance (really extraordinary for his age) here might mean he's Japan's coming of Haley Joel. His real variety in emotion is a welcome contrast, as such sweet monochromatism is too often a problem concerning films that deal with children in bleak circumstances (Isao Takahata's consistently, cloyingly sweet lead characters in \"Grave of the Fireflies\" come quickly to mind).Kore-eda's insistence that his characters remain pure and unsullied is another reason why this film on innocence betrayed is made more poignant. He illustrates this loss with images, but through what is not shown as well. Despite the fact that the family owns a television but not once watches it, for example. He concedes video games to Akira and his friends, but Kore-eda's emphasis is clearly on the organicism of youth and the desire that all kids deep down would rather engage in painting or botany than watch the boob tube. It's the adults in this world who are selfish, and yet through their negligence are only too willing to shuffle off these kids to that same self-importance. But nobody knows, or nobody will know, or nobody wants to know; to do so would be to stick out one's neck for someone and stop smothering the pet dog. Undoubtedly a bit unfair, but effectively presented nonetheless.In other words, this isn't some art-house Ken Loach social tract; Kore-eda makes sure his ideas are all right there, but he doesn't pretentiously spell them out. The audience needs to work, even if the length of the film ensures that they'll be putting in some unnecessary overtime.",

            "content": "I went to the cinema to watch Daremo Shiranai,and have just returned from my second viewing only days later.And frankly, I would gladly go a third time.The storyline is fairly simple: four half-siblings are gradually abandoned by their mother in a flat in Tokyo -they are pretty much left to fend for themselves in a world that is oblivious of their existence.The plot strikingly reminded me of Virginia Andrews' Flowers in the Attic,though as far as my rusty memory of that book goes,I thought the movie drew out in a more silent manner,what with its considerable length,unfortunately seems to make it 'too slow'(i.e. boring)for many.Daremo perhaps may not enjoy the commercial success of its contemporaries(both my attendances saw not more than five spectators in a large cinema-hall,the only one playing the movie amongst dozens of modern cinema-complexes strewn around town),but its creation clearly constitutes a labour of love by director Hirokazu Koreeda,a love which,as of any great artist,he does not compromise.Keiko,mother of four children from different relationships,wins her children's trust through her winsome manner,while depriving them of a normal life of school and friends.Their imprisonment in the flat is compensated with bribes in the form of gifts after an especially long absence,and promises,particularly for the elder two,of a better future(she is currently 'in love' with a rich man who will provide a life of luxury for them all).But both Akira,twelve,and his half sister Kyoko, ten,cannot help doubting if they can rely on her.They want more than anything to trust her,but how can they when she leaves them and disappears for weeks on end,only to spring up again in as sprightly a manner as if she were returning from a day at work. Akira,being the eldest,was the only one allowed to 'be seen'(he is her 'only son' as far as the landlord's awareness)and therefore the only one allowed outside the flat,being entrusted by Keiko with buying the groceries and preparing meals.Kyoko,in charge of the laundering, must sneak outside into the balcony to run the washing machine.The two youngest,Shigeru of about six and Yuki,four,are instructed not to make much noise so as not to attract the landlord's attention.Weeks,and eventually months go by without any sign of their mother. Money gradually wanes,water and electricity are shut off due to non-payment,and the children slowly outwear their clothes.The decline in their living conditions is slow but steady,yet through it all we witness the beauty they manage to create in a progressively decaying environment.The room is saturated with junk,overshadowed only by Yuki's crayon drawings(her only pastime).When their home seems to reach a point of being almost uninhabitable,Akira pulls out his siblings' shoes from the closet,and with a smile full of anticipation the four of them step out together for the first time into the sunlight,enjoying the sense of freedom,mirthful as any child skipping to the park on a Sunday morning.And they bring back a part of that glorious outside to their flat in the form of seeds,which they plant in their balcony in empty pot-noodle containers.They effectively manage to create beauty in their own little world of abandonment,not only in the form of plants but also through the warmth of their spirits. During the length of the movie the children speak more through looks than through words.Words often fail a child,and Koreda shows us the fruitless attempts of Akira and Kyoko trying to express their frustration or getting through to their mother with words,as she circumvents their precarious protests with the unfairness of fluent verbal diplomacy,but not once looking at them and allowing the guilt to reach her.The children,after all,are not unaware of a sense of abandonment by their mother,and in the case of Akira and Kyoko the feeling becomes more confounding as they try to come to terms with it.Kyoko's whisper 'she smells of alcohol' as she passes by her brother, as if seeking reassurance,but mostly her wistful expression,tells of her broken desire to believe in her mother's love.Her timid smile as her mother takes on the adventure of painting her daughter's nails, though only managing to slop the nail-polish untidily over her nails and onto parts of her fingertips in her current state of inebriation, is a heartbreaking moment that speaks of Kyoko's longing to believe that her mother does care.That confused smile brought me back to Francie in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as she tried to make sense of her father's drunkenness and broken promises,...\"if a man spent all his time trying to be like that,then no matter what else he did...it would be all right, wouldn't it?\".Later on Kyoko drops the nail-polish bottle in a realization that that moment meant nothing more than just another of her mother's whims.So mostly Koreeda allows his camera to simply focus on the natural expression of the children, through looks and gestures,rather than try to pry from their lips emotions which they don't know how to translate into words.Even Akira's friendship with an older schoolgirl,Saki,who is relatively well-off but equally isolated from society,was founded on a simple and silent mutual acceptance of each other's existence rather than by meaningful dialogue.Saki becomes a part of their lives and they a part of hers,and her unhesitant and straightforward act of earning some money for them by going to a 'karaoke' with a man is a testimony of the deep value of friendship. There are many beautifully poignant scenes in this movie,witnessed silently by Koreeda's unimposing camera,picking up little details of the children's innocent expression of life.As a friend of mine says, real life situations often don't lend themselves to pat solutions,and this movie doesn't intend to devise one.The last scene of four children walking away from the camera,to goodness knows what future,is charged with a mixed feeling of forlorn uncertainty and sorrow,but also with love,acceptance and optimism,all that's left when there are no pat solutions -and the will to make a garden out of the discards of their torn lives.After all,did the children ever have a different spirit?",

            "content": "Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda's 'Nobody Knows' is a contemporary drama involving a mothers struggle to cope with life with her children.The mother, Keiko, has little money and crams everyone into the tiny apartment. Akira (Yua Yagira) is the oldest child of about 12 years old, who is the only visible child to the outside world. He runs all the errands and keeps his three younger siblings fed whilst his mother works. The three children never leave the apartment, none of them go to school.Keiko spends less and less time at home, often leaving for long stretches and leaving money behind for the children to fend for themselves. Completely self-absorbed, Keiko is obsessed with her own happiness and clings to her fading youth. Eventually, she disappears completely, to live with another man.Kept in the dark for so long, Akira has no choice but to continue to act as the father, his slightly younger sister Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) becomes the mother-figure for the youngsters Yuki (Momoko Shimizu) and Shigeru (Hiei Kimura). Apparently each child is fathered by a different man, and none have any responsibility for any of the children. The children can't even go to the authorities because they will all be split up. Its a heartbreaking situation to watch these abandoned children try and hold things together as a family, in an adult world they are ill suited to cope with, however hard they try. The tragedy is of a society which doesn't want to know, and allowed it to happen.Yagira gives a remarkable performance, a conduit for his siblings to the outside world, observing and processing everything around him in the hope that they can all survive. He wants to live life like any other child, not just to survive. He meets other children, who live the life he should be living, and desperately wants to be a part of this enticing world. Not all is as appears, when he befriends a girl of a similar age who is being bullied and spends little time at home. Hers is another story which Japanese society doesn't talk about.Koreeda doesn't just explore the children's dilemma, in a wider context we look at parenting (or lack of) and the attitudes of Japanese society towards the young. We see children wasting their lives, unloved and undetected, whether parented or not. Of course, Akira and his siblings' situation is the worst kind of abandonment where there is little hope. 'Nobody Knows' is an absorbing and moving film, a heartbreaking study of children in an adult world which remains with you long after the film is over.",

It's difficult to contain the emotions while watching this film, but the story is told with such dignity and simplicity that it helps. We also see scenes of curiosity and play, perhaps signaling that the most pure parts of childhood can't be completely subverted, and there was somehow the glimmer of an uplifting spirit to the kids sticking together, despite the film's immense sadness.I love how restrained the direction was from Kore-eda and the acting from the two eldest kids (Yuya Yagira and Ayu Kitaura). With earnest or downcast eyes and no soundtrack in the background, director and actors allow the viewer to fill in the outrage and pain, whereas in a lesser film we'd see overly weepy faces or hear weepy music. When a song is used late in the film, it's all the more powerful as a result, like a release.Kore-eda also wisely refrains from judging people, even the mother (who is very well played by You), and there is such thoughtful humanism in his approach. Throughout the film we also see beautiful cinematography in everything from big city shots to small little details, like raindrops hitting the pavement. It's a beautiful world and one with amazing technology, but nobody seems to know or care about these kinds of cruelties to innocent children. It's a film that reminds you of this in the sweetest, most heart-rending way possible, and it certainly made me swallow hard.",

But I nearly fell asleep several times through the movie because the way of its storytelling (if you can call it that because it pretty much leads nowhere) is unbelievably slow. The movie starts of with the family moving into a new flat, at that point its just the single mom with the oldest son Akira who introduces herself to the landlord while the younger kids are smuggled in the flat in suitcases and oldest sister Kyoko arrives by train. You never quite get to know how things came to become like this... the kids are hidden and like the title says nobody knows about their existence because except for Akira who becomes kind of the caring father for the family no kid is allowed to leave the flat. From here on the movie just deals with their everyday routine... the mother, a prostitute as I expect, is absent more and more until she disappears and just sends cash by mail. She is depicted as a loving yet kind of childlike mother who can't take the responsibility.The fathers are all different guys who are introduced shortly as non caring slackers but I never understood why these kids all don't go to school with their mother telling them they can't because they don't have fathers. A lot is left pretty wide open and I guess the mother is supposed to have some mental defect, otherwise the whole thing is pretty unbelievable. When she meets a man and disappears Akira finally becomes the father part of the family trying to cope with feeding the kids and taking care of the flat while finding some friends and trying to live a normal kids live which obviously fails in the less than normal surrounding. Bills don't get paid, the kids lose electricity and then water and try to get by getting water from a playground fountain and doing laundry there. Later in the movie they leave their flat but it seems like nobody cares if they do and honestly the viewer cares less too because the movie is so slow with so little dialog and some scenes stretched to a seemingly endless level. The characters sure are interesting, especially Akira and the sweet little Yuki amidst that mess she couldn't choose. It looks like Akira wants to keep the kids together because he fears they could be separated to several child homes if someone finds out.But thats about all you know... the daily routine is getting more desperate, the state of the flat and the kids clothes is deteriorating and finally Yuki gets ill. What makes it hard to get into the movie beside the extremely slow pacing is that the kids are not depicted as a loving family but rather like just trying to get by. The barely talk and seem separate so their fun time strolls as well as Yukis dramatic burial (sure, you get a piece of drama too) seem distant and right then the movie ends. Mother keeps sending cash by mail, everything just goes on. I pretty much felt left down after watching this boring movie with an end like this. Seeing the 8point votes I really wonder if we watched the same movie because since the cinematography was rather average and the music close to non existing there is not much that makes me want to give more than 4points to this one.

Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad or boring, far from it. It is actually an enjoyable movie, however it just wasn't all that spectacular.You should note that this movie trots ahead at a fairly plain pace, without anything overly excitingly happening throughout the entire course of the movie. The story, as you might already know, is about a group of four children being left alone to fend for themselves in a small apartment in Japan, as their mother leaves them to \"go to work\" and doesn't come back; simply abandoning her children.What makes the movie work is the purity and perfection in the acting performances put on by the four children in the lead roles. They really impressed me, and it was worth watching the movie for. The story itself become a secondary aspect to me, as it wasn't all that interesting. And at points the director, Hirokazu Koreeda, simply skips over some of the topics without delving too far into exploring them, and that made certain parts of the movie come off as rushed and not given the proper attention or screen time.The characters in the movie were nicely detailed, and again nicely portrayed by the children hired to play these roles. It is characters that you immediately form a sort of bond and sympathy for, and you actually do ride along with them on their individual victories, triumphs and failures.\"Nobody Knows\" is a nice movie, but personally I didn't get the hype around it, as I have seen far better movies. Oh, and a fair warning, note that the movie is rather long, at 140 minutes, or at least it seems long and to go on for a very long time because of the speed the movie progresses at.",

Director Hirokazu Koreeda (who is also the film's writer and producer) delivers a tale about the next generation of lost children hiding in plain sight in the big city. There are actually five children: four preteens and a careless party-girl mother. The latter refuses (or is unable) to grow up, periodically abandons her brood, and appears bent on reversing Japan's declining birth rate all by herself (each kid has a different father). Koreeda seems to have closely studied the behavior of children, and this film really shows it! The opening scenes are especially well done. Acting is first rate all round with the Director constantly demonstrating his mastery of the difficult art of directing children. Use of sound to capture scenes not shown on camera is especially interesting. The movie could use some trimming, as it has a tendency to decelerate when adding to character traits. To say that IFC Films / MGM Home Entertainment lacks quality control for translations/subtitles would be a vast understatement! DVD formatting prevents subtitles from being turned on until the movie has started! (By hitting the Title Menu button on your remote.) This means, of course, that you have to restart the film to see the expository information that opens the film. Dialog subtitles can be somewhat removed from actual line readings; some dialog is not subtitled; most signs are not subtitled; handwriting is not subtitled; and opening/closing credits are not translated including the full title of the film! Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color) is on the blurry side (a common problem with blow ups to 35 mm). Exterior scenes can be under lit especially at night. Set decoration, sound field, and score are OK. Highly recommended. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",

The oldest child, Akira, was more mature at age twelve than his goofy mother.I found many scenes that could have lasted but a few seconds went on for what seemed like minutes. For example, there are several scenes of Akira running that just go on and on. The movie could have easily been trimmed by an hour. If the goal of drawing things out was to have the audience suffer along with the kids, then the movie was successful on that count. The effect on me was to lose patience and have the potentially powerful emotional content squeezed out. By sheer force of will I resisted hitting the fast forward button.It was up to the young actor Y\u00fbra Yagira to carry the movie, and he did an admirable job. I imagine it was the director's skill in being able to get Yagira to express emotion through facial expression and body movement. It was interesting to see Yagira physically mature throughout the film and that was cleverly reflected in his character's development. Yagira was a child at the beginning, but was turning into a young man by the end.The predictability of the story also works against the slow pacing. If you turn four kids loose in a small apartment for the better part of a year with a money supply that has run out, then the result is pretty much inevitable. But any doubt about a conclusion that might have helped keep my attention was removed by a beginning scene that has Akira on a train looking disheveled and wearing a dirty T-shirt with holes in it.I get that this movie makes a comment on the depressing fact that the impersonality of large cities can allow this kind of situation to go unnoticed, or ignored, for so long. But some scenes stretch belief. Surely when the landlord came in and saw what was happening, she would have taken action. One of Akira's reasons for not going to the police or social services was that he was afraid the family would be split up, but I did not sense great closeness among the kids (each had a different father). Losing a sister was certainly not a step in maintaining family cohesion.The score often seemed inappropriate, invoking ironic humor when melancholy was called for.I was impressed with director Koreeda's \"Still Walking,\" but I failed to connect with this movie.",

While the former is an animation (by Hayao Miyazaki's studio nonetheless), it is an effective tearjerker. The impact of Nobody Knows is the casual eye the camera takes to document the degeneration of a family of children. Unlike Grave, Nobody does not have an anti-war agenda to preach the human tragedy with an orchestra score. It's about the real time Japan that nobody knows, and the last glance the movie throws at the spectator is a dagger retitling the movie Nobody Cares. Like \"Ponette,\" the movie is told from the unpatronizing perspective of the children, and the film follows minute details which thread the challenge it is for them to simply live.",

            "content": "Few directors can create settings as developed or as ponderous as Hirokazu Koreeda's, and his touch seems perfectly suited for NOBODY KNOWS, a film that shows the world through the perspective of 5 kids left to fend for themselves when there is no one else to turn to. Koreeda's work seems to catch everything vital to the story and gets each detail just right. Based on a true story and acted by mostly non-professionals, the picture has an uncommonly natural perspective of a situation that seems terrifying but is absolutely, unquestionably true.It is deeply unnerving to see the ways in which the parents of the 4 central characters rationalize the neglect that has shaped their lives, and it is downright horrific to see the ways in which the mother manipulates the children. A child herself, the mother knows how to see life from a child's perspective. This allows her to control the children by giving presents and rewards most kids fantasize about while completely denying them everything a responsible parent would give their children. (One such instance is how the oldest girl is encouraged to save up to buy a piano while she is denied the \"luxury\" of going to school.) The kids are made to feel like they must always tip-toe through life; they are everybody's burden and should feel fortunate that anyone is looking out for them at all.The film is a heartbreaking tale of child neglect, but it is elevated to also be a story about finding your own way despite the odds. Giving the film a bit of depth, there are undertones that hint at the story being a social commentary on the price of living in Japan, though that theme is comfortably left far beneath the surface. I do not think I have ever seen a film that captured the wondrous viewpoint of the world through a child's eyes as well as this does, and that the story kept digging deeper and further past the premise kept surprising me. If you think you know where this one's going, you probably don't.The performances are uniformly excellent, including the award-winning work of Y\u00fbya Yagira as the eldest boy. Undeniably affecting, his performance anchors the film and shapes the story's effortless, natural heart. **** out of **** -By the way, this is smartly being marketed as a horror film, but I assure you it is more a domestic drama that just happens to wind up in a very dark place (i.e. if you walk in expecting RINGU, you'll be disappointed).This also struck me as being a much more approachable film than either Koreeda film I've seen before (MABOROSI and AFTER LIFE), so even if you have seen his past works and thought they were not your cup of tea, I would definitely still recommend this one.",

The movie moves at a very slow pace. It crawls along over 141 minutes. I defiantly yawned a few times in this one. But the journey really is worth it. While you're in the theater you wish that they would have edited more, but after it's over you agree that it all had to be there to create the feeling of the film. Although the pace is slow, it's perfectly spaced moving steadily forward.Koreeda is a fabulous director. He practices a lot of restraint, letting the kids tell the story, not the words or the camera. He takes his time unfolding his movie, making sure each small detail has been dealt with. The gradually pace in which the movie becomes tragic is something most directors wouldn't dare do. Seeing every day in the life of four children as their lives slowly fall apart is daring, it's much easier to just jump down the road a little and cover it with some dialogue. Koreeda never takes the easier road, it's incredible.I think that some of the most difficult movie making involves children. When you put children in the leading roles of films you run a huge risk. It's not just the risk of finding a good child actor which is incredibly hard to find, but it's equally as difficult to write for children. Screenwriters have a hard time saying things the way children would. Nobody Knows succeeds all around. The acting here is so good that it has one numerous awards, including the coveted Cannes Best Actor awards to its young star. But the great acting doesn't end here. Each of the four children is equally capable actors, which actually says more about the director than the actors. This thoroughly impressed me. This is a rare case where you see life strictly though the eyes of children successfully.",

I gave this film 7 out of 10 for the photography, music and acting, but I found it extremely irritating so I might downgrade it to a 6.I really don't understand why the utility companies weren't sending debt collectors round to recover what they were owed. And I couldn't believe the namby-pamby \"landlord\" with her dog, who just seemed to accept that she wouldn't be paid any rent for the flat. And how many people came into contact with these scruffy street urchins and didn't do anything to inform the authorities that they weren't in school; that their mother wasn't around; and that they looked like they needed help! I'm completely exasperated by the baseball teacher who didn't ask why Akira wasn't at school (what exactly *was* Akira's answer when asked what grade he was in?) and by Saki, the schoolgirl, who seemed to find them fascinating and amusing despite them being on the breadline and as scruffy as spit. Didn't her parents wonder where she'd got to when she spent her time with Akira and company instead of at school? And when she and Akira took Yuki's body to the airport to bury, didn't her parents want to know where she'd gone overnight? And surely even a child of twelve knows to call for an ambulance when his sister has an accident?Oh - and I thought it would never end! In the end, it didn't end in any satisfactory way at all. If this is an example of Japan's level of social responsibility, then I'm both astonished and disappointed that a civilised society can exclude four helpless children in this way.That's it - I'm reducing my vote to a 6.",

Just the other night the image of the landlady with the cat in her arms standing in the doorway of the chaotic apartment the kids were living in and then just walking away came into my mind. Thinking of a pet store I visited in Japan that had gourmet treats and designer \"clothes\", and a special salon for their haircuts. Are pets treated better than children? I wonder if Kore-eda was also making a critique of the young women who have been raised to be \"kawaii\"(cute) and child-like, and used to having their parents do and buy things for them. The result, like the mother in this film, is a mother who is unable to mature into a grown woman, and who feels incomplete without a man. She also put her own needs over her children's, which is extremely repugnant to most people, but imagine in Japanese society, where the concept of \"gaman\" has been so admired, how loathed and despised this mother would have been. Interesting to read the actual events as well. I wonder if the film had presented the mother as having been lied to and abandoned with a small baby by her first partner would that have changed the audience perception of her culpability? I felt she was a victim as well--even w/out knowing any details, I just felt no one who had a happy upbringing would abandon their children like that.I also felt the kids were too good to be true at the beginning, not imagining that kids would be able to live so tidily and manage all the adult affairs with no one to guide them. However, perhaps that was an effective way to show the decline as time went on.Now I am still left with the lingering feeling...what happened to them? Part of the problem was that the solution meant they would be separated from each other. What happens to these kids in Japan? Where family and koseki is so important, how do they get along in society? Anyway, an excellent film--the child actors were amazing.",

From that moment on the oldest son (a 12 years old kid) will have to take care of his brothers and bring them up. So, I've previously said that human being's capacity to take wrong decisions is limitless, but what about children's capacity to survive even in the worst environment? Their survival instinct is way much bigger than any of us could believe. That's exactly what \"Nobody knows\" is about, and the terrible thing about it all is that it's based on a real story.The tone of the movie is rather realistic, and the rhythm is pretty slow (it will test the patience of those who like movies that are more lively). Maybe it's too much contemplative, but that's something usual in the Asian cinema. The only inconvenient about \"Nobody knows\" is its excessive length: I don't think a story like that needs 2 hours and a half to be told.*My rate: 8/10",

Y\u00fbya Yagira playing the inspiring role of the oldest sibling, Akira Fukushima, he watches over his three younger siblings, after their mother's departure.Akira and his family recently move to a new apartment in a new city, living with their single mother, Keiko. The landlords are only aware of two people living in the apartment while there is really five. Keiko introduced Akira, and Akira only to the landlords while the three other siblings were transported to the apartment by being compacted in suitcases. Thus the reason the children are forced to stay in the apartment at all times, besides Akira of course, who must run errands to the grocery store and such for the basic needs of the family while Keiko is at work.One day, the children wake up to no mother in the apartment, only a note telling she will be gone for a long time. Keiko left money for Akira to take care of his younger siblings until his mother comes back from where ever she is. Akira finally reaches the conclusion his mother is never coming back, so he has to accommodate the money he is given since he is not of a legal age to get a job of his own. This true masterpiece of a movie, has fantastic acting, realistic settings, and lovable characters. When things only end up getting worse and worse for the children, you can't help but feel the deepest remorse for Akira's struggle to keep his family fed.I would recommend this movie to anyone with a heart for astounding film. Although depressing, and deeply moving, I think everyone who has seen this would agree it is worth seeing. 8.4/10",

I wanted the kids to be openly sad at what was happening to them, but only because I can. Grief is a luxury, in a way, as are emotions, and these kids are so destitute they have neither. That, to me, is the most chilling and heartbreaking aspect of Nobody Knows.Basically it goes like this: woman who has no business having kids has four, and for some reason can only say she has one when she rents an apartment, the others have to hide from the outside world. But they've done this before and know the drill. It's messed up, but it's a system. The mother takes off several times for days and weeks at a time, then completely. The kids (the 12-year old boy really) have to figure it out, but they're kids. The boy begs money from various men that knew their mother, and buys food from a convenience store. Soon he stops paying bills and the power, water and gas are turned off. The rules disintegrate as they do. Then the youngest girl dies in an accident while the 12-year old daydreams about playing baseball in a league with a helpful coach - god the tiniest details are incredible.They don't sit around feeling sorry for themselves, nor do they make the right decisions.

The film is a totally unsentimental portrayal of a mother's abandoning her children in an apartment to fend for themselves while she moves elsewhere with her lover. The film's narrative is grim, yet in reality it was much worse.While Kore-eda's Maborosi is a gentle meditative film with many sweeping shots of natural beauty, Nobody Knows is largely confined to the claustrophobic confines of a small Tokyo apartment that the children have been instructed by the mother to keep to. As usual, Kore-eda lets the visuals do the talking. His style is very observational, the camera capturing many seemingly mundane details, perhaps reflecting his start in film with documentaries.Kore-eda doesn't artificially build up the drama by, for example, the use of manipulative devices like music to portray the increasingly dire situation of the children. He trusts the audience to take note of the film's narrative, and to understand themselves that these children are in desperate need of help. The escalating measures taken by the children, and the increasing squalor said it all. The naturalistic performances by the children in the film were excellent and Yagira Yuya, then 14, won best actor award at Cannes 2004. As I wrote about Maborosi, this film rewards the patient viewer but could well be boring for the casual movie-goer.",

Then one day, she vanishes for good and the children are left to fend for themselves. This harrowing film, based on a true 1988 Tokyo case, is made without a trace of sentimentality, and observes, in clear-eyed manner, the effects of abandonment and the coping mechanisms of children. What struck me was how the children continue to love their callous parent. I found it shocking that a mother could be devoid of any shred of maternal instinct, and that these children go unnoticed in such a developed, well organized, and affluent society.

There's an eldest 12 year old boy, a second eldest 11 year old sister, a second boy (8 years old), and the baby of the family is a five year old girl. Now, Narnia is also a tale of four young siblings having to do without their parents for a long time, also consisting of an older brother sister couple and a younger brother sister couple. But whereas in the Narnia tale, adversity brings out the best in the children, and they all get along wonderfully, here we see the real life version.There's strife, jealousy, mistrust, fighting, indifference, conflict, despair and rebelliousness by the youngest versus the oldest. In short, happy campers they're not. It's a confirmation of the \"Lord of the Flies\" supposition: Children, left to their own devices, will deteriorate quickly to a state of primitiveness, the law of the jungle, rather than \"toughing it out\" and nobly show themselves from their best side. (Which is incidentally, one of the reasons Kid Nations seemed so fake and probably was).Some of the Japanese comments here express irritation that the real life story wasn't followed to the letter, because that was even more gruesome and sensational. But they missed the essence of the film, which is that in these modern times children can easily be abandoned, sneaking past everyone's radar and everything else for a prolonged period of time before anyone really notices. You don't need murder, or acceptance of murder to make that point.The acting is superb, and for that matter, the directing as well. The oldest boy has the most difficult acting to do, and he is also the best actor. The atmosphere is really wistful, understated and longing, and the foreign viewer gets the idea that this film, despite it's bleak content, gives a good glimpse of Japanese daily life. It's always refreshing to watch a non-Hollywood film with tat unpredictability, not crammed from beginning to end with elevator music, so that the actual dialog is hardly comprehensible.Seen through the eyes of a non-Japanese I didn't get all the irritating ideosyncratic irregularities and the annoying whatevers that have seemed to have bugged some Japanese viewers.

Like many of his viewers my first exposure to his body of work was his film After Life that touched my heart because of its humanistic quality. After viewing that gem, I watched Maboroshi and Distance both of which I enjoyed as well. Generally dark colored, I enjoy Kore-eda's films because of their general simplicity, the character driven stories, and their almost documentary quality that is not surprising because first became known as a documentary filmmaker. When I heard that his latest film, Nobody Knows was receiving critical acclaim not only in his native Japan but in Western countries as well, I was quite please and looked forward to viewing the film myself.After moving into their new apartment, Akira and his mother Keiko are quick to open two special suitcases. They do not contain precious family heirlooms, but two of Keiko's younger children: Shigeru and Yuki. After fetching another sister, Kyoko, at a station, Akira returns home and the family enjoys a boisterous meal. Keiko, whose voice sounds like a she has been sucking up a bit too much helium and quite a few cigarettes, tells the younger of her three children, since the landlord does not know of their presence, that they must remain as quiet as possible and that they must remain inside the apartment. Akira, being the eldest, is responsible for the well being of the family. Keiko, who seems to be a bar hostess, is rarely home so Akira is responsible for the preparation of meals while Kyoko takes care of the laundry. To keep this \"well-oiled\" machine running Keiko does not allow her children to attend school. What learning they seem to have seems to come from their own personal endeavors.Although their family life is quite abnormal, the four children do not resent their mother. However, trouble begins after Keiko becomes involved with yet another boyfriend. Akira, Kyoko, Shigeru, and Yuki, while sharing the same mother, are the products of four different fathers. One morning, Keiko leaves a note stating that she will be gone for a few days. A few days becomes a month, but because the children are accustomed to looking after their own persons and because Keiko left a bit of money, they manage. Keiko eventually returns, but only stays for a day and promises that she will be back by Christmas. However, when Christmas comes there is no sign of Keiko.Like Kore-eda's other films, the charm of Nobody Knows rests on the shoulders of its characters. Akira, although only twelve years old, does his best to look after his family while he searches for friendship with other boys and a special girl named Saki. Kyoko, the somber older daughter, desires to go to school and learn how to play the piano. A good portion of the films scant background music consists of Kyoko playing a few melancholy notes on a toy piano. Shigeru, the most energetic of the four children, is a source of brightness in an otherwise dark time. Yuki, a little six-year-old-girl, bears the torch of hope that their mother will soon return.Based on true events, Nobody Knows is a wonderful film created by Japan's leading humanist director.",

Unusually for a polemical screed, it nags at us through our hearts, by focusing on the most innocent members of modern society.The set up is particularly manipulative, even though inspired by a true story, of positing a child mother who is at least borderline developmentally disabled or some paranoid mental illness and does not seem old enough to have had an oldest child of 12, let alone that no one noticed she then had three others following. Exposition is only fleetingly provided later on as to how their isolation and then abandonment happened, perhaps to emphasize the children's perspective and perhaps because some of the explanations may be more lost on non-Japanese audiences who have no idea about Japanese laws, compounded by lack of translation of signs and other communication that could provide more context for how this gross example of child neglect could have happened, though the main credits are tellingly translated.Agit-prop aside, the film is most effective at slowly showing us how children can manage to live on their own as they re-create family structure, with time indicated by the passing of the seasons through a window and the children's only very gradually increasing haggard appearance and grown-out clothes, even as we anticipate that tragedy could happen at any moment. Most touching are the moments when they just want to be kids, from playing video games to baseball to eating candy.It is somewhat reassuring that some of the other children who are at first attracted to their Peter Pan-like freedom from authority, end up repelled by the lack of structure that results, though the true situation was more callous.We have seen glimpses before of self-reliant children taking on grown-up responsibilities, such as in \"Rabbit-Proof Fence\" or \"The Wire,\" but those are in societal extremis, not the quotidian of daily middle-class life.The look of the film is beautiful, even as it slowly breaks your heart, but it's mostly like an extended episode of \"Judging Amy\" before the social worker finally shows up.",

It's a very engrossing piece that doesn't shy away from the reality of life. This film contains genuine moments of frustration for the central characters and for the audience too. It's an examination of what happens when a Japanese mother, who was never ready to be a mother, abandons her four children.Keiko (Yukiko Ehara, who goes by the stage name of You) is the mother. Sounding like a child herself and acting like one, Keiko still clings desperately to her youth and more importantly that feeling of never having to grow up. As a parent she is carefree, never raising her voice or striking her children. She doesn't take anything too seriously except for meeting new men, whom she likes to attach to and be pampered by. Being with the men helps her to forget about the 4 mouths to feed that are waiting at home. As she continues to meet new men she begins to spend more time with them taking increasing longer trips far away from her new apartment and her children. But she always leaves them money to survive on and forcing her eldest son, Akira (Y\u00fbya Yagira), to become the new parent of the home even though he is only 12.Akira is the really interesting character to watch because he is at a point in his life where he is being burdened with not only the responsibility for his three younger siblings but also growing up himself. For the most part he is a very, very responsible young man that would make any level-headed parent proud beyond words. But there's only so much of that responsibility that he can fulfill before his own childish ways catch up with him.When Keiko leaves for her latest trip she just doesn't return. The money that she leaves behind lasts for a while but like the hope of her return, it soon dwindles away and the harsh reality begins to settle in. These kids are alone.I found that this film reminded me a little of Bin-jip (3-Iron) the Korean offering from director Ki-Duk Kim; mainly in terms of examining a life of poverty. The children in Koreeda's film become resourceful as they lose electricity, then water. But what they go through as the situation continues on is just heartbreaking to watch.Koreeda let's his camera do most of the talking in the piece. The lens captures the slow passage of time with an equal lingering eye. There is not much to do during the hours of the day to stimulate the young minds that have been left to their own devices. They tend to plants that they grow out of used noodle containers, since they don't have a garden. They peruse the streets checking vending machines for loose change to supplement their lack of income. They even befriend some of the other locals in the area who give them a helping hand as best as they can, depending on the day of the week. Therein lies the beauty of the piece, that these kids are able to survive as long as they do is a marvel and it keeps the viewer engaged; interested to find out how it's all going to end.Now, the ending of the film doesn't give you a really great sense of closure and this time it doesn't feel like a cheap shot to be vague and artistic on the director's behalf. Before the film started, you didn't know these characters or their plight. Then as you watch you are introduced to them and you are invited into the world. By the end, it's like the viewer has reluctantly gotten off this train and is watching it take off for another unknown destination. It's a deliberate choice to keep your mind working on the notion of the film and it is successful because who doesn't want everything to be alright for these kids? For me, personally, it angered me to think that there could be a mother so careless that she would put herself before her children in such a selfish fashion.It's accepted that once you have a child you have to stop living for yourself and that your life should be about your offspring, if you're lucky enough to have them. There are times when the kids need help, desperately and the authorities should have been called in order to give them something that resembles a normal family life. But these children only want each other, they've gotten the help of the authorities in the past, Akira reflects at one point in the film to a new friend, but the outcome was a nightmare. The kids need each other more than they need their mother because it is the connection with siblings that gives each of them the support that any person deserves from family. Each child has a different father not in the picture at all and their one mother whose attendance is spotty at best.Is it any wonder why they don't want to call the authorities even when things become really bleak?",

However, as more truth was revealed, Koreeda then sensed that the mother may have been sweeter than what the media described her to be, and that there must have been many sweet moments in that family. Otherwise, the eldest son would have been meaner to his sisters and would have abandoned them long ago. This thought was the great motivation Koreeda had since then, he writes in a note for the movie pamphlet.Indeed, the film features ordinary sweet people causing tragic incidents. And that fact makes the movie so close to your real life. Even though there are no obvious cruelty in any of the scenes, and even though there is great hope at the end, it gives you a slight chill and makes you wonder if you're doing the right things in your own humble life.",

Some call this film \"slow\", but only settles the appropriate mood for the story's sake. This is not a fast paced movie, but the time in it goes very fast (the shooting lasted one whole year, and you can notice that in the characters).

The eldest son, 12 year old Akira is forced into a heartbreaking and impossible role of being a parent to his young siblings aged 10, 7, and 4. None of the children attend school since they are not registered. Also, the mom and Akira are supposed to be the only tenants of the apartment. The other children have to hide from the visible quarters of the apartment building. Akira regularly goes out shopping for food and returns home to cook...and then the money left by the mom starts running out.This film's greatest strength is that it does not just focus on the plight of these children. It would be easy to focus on all the hardships these children face and to demonize the mother. Instead, the film is stunning portrait of adolescence and it's many heartbreaks, triumphs, hopes, and its inevitable conclusion. We learn a lot about these kids and the way they view the world...and then we realize what these children are facing and this is where i break down.The acting of the entire cast is superb. Akira played by Yuya Yugira is so natural and the way he expresses himself thru his eyes is astonishing. He deservedly received the best actor award @ last years Cannes (and he's only 12!!). This was the first movie i saw that Hirokazu Kore-eda directed and i'm impressed. His minimal documentary like approach added a sense of poignancy...and honestly its the best way to tell the story.Any director that gets me to such an emotional state as i was and have been even after a week of watching this film gets the highest praise in my book.One of the best films of 2005.

            "content": "The title: Nobody knows. Four kids in Japan between the ages of about five and twelve are left behind by their mother to fend for themselves. But there are rules their mother set for them before her departure. No going outside of the apartment except for Akira, the oldest kid, the one left in charge. No loud noises. And no going to school. This sets the story. The kids must cook, clean, take care of themselves until she comes back. The mother does send them money. And when it runs out before that Akira has to contact the different fathers of all the kids for help. But who knows how long this will go on and when their mother will return.It's a sad story. But its hopeful and filled with the idea of possibility. If we are patient, if we work together, and take each step slowly, one after another, we can make it. That is how these kids approach their predicament. It is the brighter side of The Lord of the Flies which we see her. Pictures of the most mundane things fill the frame. The kids all work together to wash dishes, do laundry, study math, buy groceries and play games. The often expressionless faces and minimal dialogue of Akira and the oldest sister (almost everyone in the film) add to the quiet desperation and yet accepted responsibility the kids deal with. Shige, the youngest boy, has no more than maybe eight lines (rough estimate) of lines in the film, is playful and smiles a lot, and seems more or less ignorant of the situation. Because, after all, their mother is working in Osaka, at least this is what she says early on. When their mother doesn't return after a few months for Christmas Akira asks a neighbor to forge a note to each of the kids from their mother and gives this to all his sibling along with some remaining as a present.Secrecy is key. No one can know all these kids live in an apartment by themselves. A task as simple as shopping for groceries suddenly turns into a covert mission planned from the underground, and being revealed could lead to catastrophe. The things kids are normally inclined to do, run in grass, scream, shout, stomp their feet, cry, play on swings, throw balls, are not a luxury afforded to these kids who must never be discovered, must stay quiet at all times. And this is because the hardworking mother, who at the start of the film seems to care greatly for her kids (aside from when she puts the three younger kids in suitcases when moving them into their new apartment), speaks sincerely, helps Akira in math and chores and tucks them all in at night, and she does gets sympathy from her kids who believe she will makes things right for them.The mother lets Akira know her new boyfriend might just be the guy who will take care of her and her kids. When Akira asks if this man knows about her kids, the mother says not yet. About then we can understand why one mother could have four kids all from different men. And so the cycle continues and history repeats itself and left behind to suffer from the lack of ones responsibility are the kids.There is not much dialogue in the film, but the little that is there is realistic. The night before the mother leaves Akira and her go to a restaurant. This is where Akira says to her she is selfish. She responds with how much she is doing for the kids, how everything she does is for the kids. And how true it is, that kids often can see much more clearly than adults whose lives can often be tainted with life's obligations. All the roles are very believable.And with the film, Nobody Knows, stands another testament to the unique voices and quality film-making in existence in the world today. Its shot on washed out, almost dull, 16mm film, though it often looks digital, probably because of the DivX version I watched. The shots often stretch out a few seconds after a character has left the frame, giving a kind of slowness and uneasiness. Most shots of the outside are so far out that all we see is tiny figures in a large canvas dominated by streets and buildings and handing ads and signs with more scattered figures around. The lighting is also very minimal looking if not completely natural and often times what we see on screen are dark muted colors further adding to the uneasiness and emotional blur in the film. A very inspiring, calm film, worth seeing for anyone interested in quality film-making.",

            "content": "Regardless of the high ratings and many awards, Nobody Knows is not a very good or well-made film. In fact its something of a mess. There are a number of basic flaws that make make this watered-down and tepid filming of horrifying real-life events a missed opportunity for great cinema.The real story broke in Japan in 1988. Tt differed from the movie in some crucial aspects. There were five children to begin with and when the youngest died, while the mother was around, she stuffed the dead child in a cupboard where she stayed for over a year. A second daughter was killed months after the mother left. She died not die in an accident as depicted in the movie. The eldest son's friends killed her in a rage because she ate something they wanted to eat. Her body was buried with the help of the friends. The mother turned herself into the authorities two weeks after the story broke in the Japanese and international media and caused a sensation. Why were these crucial plot elements missing from the film? Nobody Knows!!! The writer-director spent 15 years tinkering with the script. I think he killed it in the process. The cinematography was really poor. In the first half, the neighborhood looks respectably middle-class, in the second half a slum. The visual continuity and transition is just not there. I never got a feel of the building or the apartment which was so crucial to the impact of the story. An unnecessary love interest is inserted in the last hour, but the director doesn't even know what to do with that and adds a bit about enjokosai (underage dates) without bothering to elaborate. What a mess it became in the second half. The first half was boring but at least it was coherent. And the film is over two and a quarter hours long which adds to the tedium.The only positive element I saw was that the child actors gave fairly decent performances. But, I'd suggest watching My Life As a Dog instead of wasting time with this mess.",

So be warned, in watching this you may wish that more was edited out. However, one could argue that the strength of the film is the attention to details. The favorite candy of a little girl... The weeds growing between the cracks and on the balcony... The flirtations between a boy and a girl... The brush with shoplifting to make friends... it is vignettes such as these that make the film so true to life.In terms of similar story line you may be interested in a 1988 Japanese anime, \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (aka \"Hotaru no haka\") about a brother and sister abandoned after the fire-bombings of Tokyo in WWII.If you are looking for an interesting film by this director that is more likely to make you think, rent \"Afterlife\" (aka \"Wandafuru raifu\").",

But I have just a question to ask: Why was the story watered down? No offense meant. The film is really good, but I think that if the whole story had been told it would have added more power to the film (and maybe new questions would have been raised).Beware! Only for those that have already seen the film.Here is the story (as told in http://www.shisso.org/archives/000645.html): \"If you are interested in the real story that happened back in 1988: First, there were originally five children, two boys and three girls. One of the boys died from some illness; but because none of the five children officially existed (she had not reported the births of any of them, thus none of them went to school), she simply wrapped the body up in some plastic sheets with some deodorizer and hid it in a closet.When she left her children to live with her new lover, the oldest boy was 14, and he had three younger sisters, aged 7, 3 and 2.The older boy took to bringing over two friends (\"A\" and \"B\" in the report) he'd made, but these kids were a lot nastier than the ones depicted in the film. Ultimately, one of them (B) became angry at the youngest girl for eating some food he'd brought over, and beat her up, ultimately killing her.The oldest son and friend (A) packed the body up and took it to some mountains nearby, and buried it in a shallow grave. This was in April 1988.In July of that year the landlord finally realized that the apartment seemed to be occupied only by children, and called the police, who found the two remaining girls badly undernourished. Searching the apartment, they discovered the corpse that the mother had hidden.The story was covered very heavily by the mass media; and the mother, seeing this on the news, wondered if it was all about her children, and turned herself in to the police.There's more, but that's the essence of it. The eldest boy did come off pretty well overall, taking care of his sisters etc, until the end, when things got pretty grim, money was scarce, and the story assumed a \"Lord of the Flies\" kind of aspect. He was not in the room when his sister died, but he knew what his friend was capable of.\"The film portrays the children in an idealized manner. The real story seems to have been much more ambiguous - it wasn't just angelic children fighting against want, surrounded by an indifferent world. The film (like many others) sings a song of praise for the innocence of children. But things, as the story above shows, were more complicated. Maybe the main reason why Hirokazu Koreeda has refrained from telling the whole story is that the actors of the real story, that happened in 1988, are now around 30 and have, of course, a right to privacy.",

But in this Japanese film, based on a true story in this vein, the mother is hardly chavvish, merely selfishly, indeed criminally, childish; while her children attempt to soldier on without her with (what seems to this foreign viewer) a very Japanese decorum almost unimaginable at home. The result of this is that the story resembles, if anything, the 1980s BBC nuclear war drama 'Threads' as, cooped up in their own private prison, the children eke out what life they can from means that will never be replenished; and Yuya Yagira, as the child who takes on the most responsibility, is utterly superb. The film makes no attempt to hide the incipience of tragedy, and when it comes, it provides a grotesque inverse image of the movie's beginning. While the film's final scene has a haunting, ambiguous beauty. But it has also to be said, that this is a very slow film, quite literally, a long time is spent in which not a lot happens, and that which does has a grim predictability. In some ways, this film is the opposite of melodrama, and hard viewing. But the magic in the children's' faces makes it worthwhile.",

The characters are pretty shallow, despite the great acting and close-up shots. A movie this reminded me a lot of is King Of the Hill, a fantastically made movie about a boy left to fend for himself as his parents have to leave. There's adventure, a coming-of-age character arc, a plot with strong overtones. Very strongly written characters in addition to the good cast. Obviously they're not identical films, but I would recommend King Of The Hill tenfold over this. I'm a hugely into Asian cinema, but other than good camera-work, there's very little to this film.",

I started fidgeting around the 90 minutes mark with about 45 minutes left to go. It's just that I felt the film got into a bit of a rut by repeatedly showing the day to day lives of the kids when their day to day activities were in themselves repetitive.

I think due to the house rental condition, Keiko, the mother, must hide her other three younger children. It's kinda unimaginable how she hided Shigeru and Yuki inside luggage. So at this point, the movie shows how the other three children play \"hide and seek\". They must ensure that nobody knows they lived there. In other words, they isolated themselves from outside world, means no school, no play outside and most of all no friends! Keiko is single-parent, which mean sole-breadwinner. Therefore, she did not take care of her children, more concern to her work and her new lover! So, Akira as the eldest son, take care of his siblings and the house by himself. Everything goes pretty well, until one day, Keiko left all her children with some money and note to Akira to take care of his siblings. The story starts heart-wrenching at this part, how small children try to cope with their life, without any parents to be depended on. Moreover, they were isolated from outside world for sometimes, so it's a very hard struggle for them. Towards the end, the struggling was getting out of hand, Yuki was so sick and died. What makes me cry is, Akira and his friend, Saki, brought her body to Haneda airport, to bury her there, as her last wish is to see aeroplane. This is the good movie to watch, it shows us how innocent children dealt with \"unexpected\" situation in their life, that probably they never dare to imagine. I give this movie 8/10.",

            "content": "The film begins with a strange sort of rehousing. Heavy suitcases are brought into the new apartment and when the movers are gone litlle children jump out of these suitcases. A little later we learn that the explanation for this strange behaviour is that the mother has got this new apartment pretending that she has only one child.Apart from this opening the mother continues to behave strangely. She doesn't seem very mature and acts more like the sister of her own children than their mother. It dawns on us that this family is dysfunctional in various ways. All children are from different (and now abstentee) fathers, they are not registered in the civil registry and are not going to school. As already said, apart from the oldest one, they don't live officialy in the apartment. Summarizing, officialy the children don't exist.Given all this, it hardly surprises anymore that at a given moment the mother disappears (new boyfriend) and never comes back. The only surprise to me was learning (after the film) that this movie was based on a real casus.When the family is dysfunctional the oldest child often gets a responsibility far beyond his age. This is also the theme of films such as \"Winter's bone\" (2010, Debra Granik), \"Lore\" (2012, Cate Shortland), \"The cement garden\" (1993, Andrew Birkin) and \"Our mother's house\" (1967, Jack Clayton) (I did see the first two of them but not the others).\"Nobody knows\" is no exception, 12 year old Akira (Yuya Yagira) becoming both the mother and the father of the family. The exception is the monotony of the film, despite the apparent spectacular theme. Koreeda has resisted the temptation to put in various crisis, and rightly so. As a result, the emphasis is more on the slow decay within the apartment. This is however a very different decay than in for example \"Repulsion\" (1965, Roman Polanski). In \"Repulsion\" the decay is due to the main character, in \"Nobody knows\" it is in spite of the main character. We all see that Akira does his utmost, but the responsibility simply is more than he can bear with his 12 years of age. The monotony is also somehow logical for a household in which only one person is allowed to go outside.Ultimately the slow decade turns into a heartbreaking ending. Obviously the mother is the bad girl of this movie, but there are other parties that could (must?) have had some suspicion, but chose to turn a blind eye instead. Think about the father whom Akira asked for money, the landlord, the owner of the grocery shop next door and the utilities who cut off the water and electricity supply.Hirokazu Koreeda is without any doubt the most prominent Japanese directors of these days. I discoverd and liked his poetic films \"Maboroshi\" (1995) and \"After life\" (1998) very much. After that his films became somewhat more realistic. A nice comparison with \"Nobody knows\" is \"Shoplifters\" (2018). Both films are about families that are not mainstream, but I would not dare to call the family in \"Shoplifters\" dysfunctional.",

It's an utterly heartbreaking story of abandonment and survival but at the same time, it's a beautifully constructed piece of filmmaking. The performances were incredible and the cinematography was exquisite. There's not a lot of dialogue but the camera is used masterfully as it captures their slow descent into absolute poverty. Their utilities are gradually switched off and whether they eat or not depends entirely on the amount of loose change they manage find.It's been a while since I've genuinely been blown away by a movie but it certainly makes me feel thankful I was brought up surrounded by a loving and caring family. Not every child is blessed with such a thing.",

Or AMC, American Movie Channel, which re-runs John Wayne films so often (yes, even in the year 2009), I am starting to think his estate owns stock in that channel.The story here was based on truth, which I was not aware of when I watched this. The five children are left to their own devices, abandoned by a young woman, who is divorced and feels overwhelmed. She spontaneously decides to go off with another man, into a different town.The children are very believable, and try their best to survive in a tiny apartment, even resorting to growing seeds, as their electric and water supply is turned off. The actor portraying the eldest, Akira, is very good and sympathetic in the role, he worries about feeding the younger children, how to shoplift from the grocery store, and retrieve water for them when the supply is cut off at home.He brings one friend from school to stay with him, an older girl who first views the unkempt apartment with disdain, but then befriends, and even helps Akira.Good programming IFC!

The acting by the four child protagonists is superb, utterly convincing, with nothing overdone and the viewer left to feel and express all the wrenching emotions for which the characters themselves have little time or energy. Also shown plainly, though I'm sure it will be ignored by almost all viewers, is that the worst of the difficulties in survival experienced by these young people and their devastating consequences, are the results not of their lack knowledge, ingenuity or rationality, but of the cruel and arbitrary restrictions placed upon them because of their age. How different would have been the course of events if only these four had had access to the educational, economic, social and even medical services otherwise available to everyone, and not been reduced to the status of fugitives for the \"crime\" of living on their own!",

I had difficulties accepting that a child as young as the lead character can take care of his even younger brother and sisters for so long. It works fairly as a social commentary on today's world but it was not enough to hold my attention for the duration of the film. It didn't help the film that the director has chosen a very passive way of filming. The camera is static and almost neutral and it may help convey a message but it didn't help me identified with these children.Bottom line: This is an OK film.

Why would anyone want to watch a group of kids suffering for 2 hours, because that pretty much sums up the whole movie. Honestly, you have to be sort of sick in the head to actually watch this film and think, \"Wow, I'm so touched. I just watched these kids live incredibly miserable lives... I really enjoyed it. What a great movie.\" That right there basically sums up the only reason why someone would like this movie, because unlike other sad movies, this movie does not contain values to be learned or at least enjoyable scenes.So to sum it all up, I would only recommend this movie to those who enjoy watching others suffer. I, for one, don't enjoy watching others suffer, and so I give this movie a 1 out of 10.",

This is not a criticism though- it's nice to see Japan shown in a realistic manner for a change.Unfortunately, like most films made in the 21st century, Nobody Knows is at least half an hour too long.

The mother (an actress known as \"You\" fwiw) is absent and abandoning, seemingly a child herself in giddy ignorance. Her role is to provide gifts and little else.I don't think it was the director's intention, but the notion of fairytales and children cut free from their parents came to my mind at times. More likely, the director wanted to underscore that with a little nourishment, all children can grow like the plants on the veranda, and yet their lives are precarious. But this kind of misery is easy to look past, through or over. Hence the title \"Nobody Knows\" ....and yet some do.Scenes involving the corner store clerks stood out for me. Two instances where people perhaps closer to the margins of society were more keenly aware of those well excluded from those margins. A little beneficence was welcomed.The film itself lacks some adult supervision, growing a bit more like a weed in different directions at times, and mostly rides upon the excellent work of the then young actor Yuya Yagira. This was his debut, and checking up on him now he has been acting ever since.Much is asked of him on camera, and off. As an actor, I believe he received tremendous support, much less than the character he portrayed.",

            "content": "Kore-Eda's 2004 film 'Nobody Knows' follows the life of four children who are left alone in a small Tokyo apartment after their mother abandons them.Yuya Yagira plays the eldest Akira who moves into the apartment with his mother (You), to the landlord's knowledge, as the only child. After moving in, the three other children are smuggled in suitcases and after dark. The youngest three are asked never to leave the apartment or be seen by anyone, giving Akira the sole responsibility of providing for them. From the first scenes of them moving in we get a sense that the mother is unstable and immature with her childish tones and playful manner. After leaving money for the children she sets off and is never seen again throughout the film. What follows is a gentle and slow story of what happens to the children after their mother has left. As they run out of money and the gas, water and electricity are cut off, they are slowly forced to rely on the goodwill of others (a local schoolgirl, the employees of a nearby convenience store) to get by. The natural lighting and the use of hand-held camera give this film a sense of realism, as one if following the children themselves. Wordless scenes of sleeping, general ennui and the children playing highlight the boredom brought on by their confinement amongst the slowly building filth. The film was shot over a period of approximately a year letting the viewer to experience the full four seasons of Japan and follow the children throughout the biting cold of winter, the joy of spring and the cherry blossoms (the first moment in the film where all four children lave the apartment to play in the open), the frustratingly humid and hot summer and the wet 'rainy season'. As mentioned by others before, this process narrative doesn't follow a usual story development and is more a meditation on the roles of adults and children in society. Are children always the immature ones? Are adults the ones who know best all the time? The only drawback of the film is its length but those that are drawn into this world will be curious to see what happens and stick with it until the end. The long wordless scenes and intermittent music add to the trance-like atmosphere of the film. I haven't seen Kore-Eda's earlier work but this is a great place to start, I'm keen to see more.

It has great lyric moments combined with very lovely light ones.I was surprised that the director and the script did not use such a hard story to make the viewer sob, or make the viewer mourn for the children. That is, the movie doesn't want you to do that, as this would be predictable, but to focus on the story and give it some sort of sad hyper-realist lyricism. Thus, the viewer witnesses the children's hopes, hunger, despair, acceptance, survival, union and happiness, despite everything.Although the story of the material misery of the children is explicitly told, what catches the viewer's eye is the emotional positive outcome that that misery brings to these kids, or, better said, how these kids made that possible. One of the things that shows this clearly, is the part related to the secret garden that the kids start to grow in their balcony, and the enthusiasm and effort that they put into it.Sometimes you feel so immersed in the life of the siblings, that you feel as if you were there, enduring the heat, the bad odors, the hunger, the playfulness, and their problems. That is so because the director creates a very intimate connection with the viewer, something really special.The children actors are unbelievable, especially the leading young actor, Yuya Yagira, who delights us with a moving mature strong performance. You don't feel that they are actors performing, but real children abandoned and filmed. That says a lot about the art director, too.I did not like the title in English, which doesn't convey well what the movie tells. Nobody Cares would have been a more accurate one.",

In this day and age when teenagers throw tantrums at their parents over petty issues, this film will make you feel lucky that you even have a parent or a guardian who looks after you and cares about you.The film is also aptly titled as despite the inconceivable situations that these kids have been through, you never know what the future holds for them but you definitely hope things somehow get better.",

            "content": "Kore-eda Hirokazu's fourth film \"Nobody Knows\" is a film I have a lot of nostalgia for, probably clouding my judgement on its actual quality to some extent. First watching it in Newcastle in 2005, I was intrigued by the film's premise and documentarian director at a time when my overall knowledge of Japanese cinema didn't stretch much beyond \"Rashomon\", \"Akira\" and \"Ringu\".Keiko (YOU) moves into a new apartment building with her only son Akira (Yuya Yagira). That's what their new landlords believe, anyway. Moving in with two suitcases, they are opened - once the landlords are out of sight - to reveal Akira's two younger half-siblings, Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu). But it doesn't end there. Akira is sent to the train station to meet Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura), his other sister, completing a family of five in a small apartment.Having four children fathered by four different men, Keiko lacks a little commitment and responsibility. Soon she disappears off, telling Akira she has found another man, much to Akira's disbelieving amusement. As such, she soon disappears for an extended period, leaving Akira in charge with money for rent, bills and food. Here and there, she returns, bringing with her presents. But elders Akira and Kyoko know it will be short lived. Soon, her visits become less frequent; money being sent in envelopes in the post, until full abandonment is realised.Akira, a twelve year-old, soon wants rid of his responsibility, trying to escape the apartment as much as possible, finding friends and inviting them round to play computer games, as well as playing for a local baseball team. But he is still drawn to his younger siblings, though with money now non-existent, with little for food, rent and bills. As such, the inevitable happens to the youngest and most vulnerable.From the scenario it is possible to identify many possible flaws in the story. The lack of action from the landlord on the rent not being paid; and one of their apartments increasingly becoming a festering hovel must have been noticeable. The children's reaction themselves also may perhaps be difficult to fully accept for some, carrying on in their stride, not looking to adults for real action to save them from starvation.But \"Nobody Knows\" is based on the real case of \"The West Sugamo 4 Abandoned children Incident\", where four unregistered children fathered by different men were abandoned by their mother as she left for a new lover. Over a period of six months, the eldest son was left in charge of his three younger siblings, resulting in the death of his younger sister; then buried close to his father's old place of work. As such, the unrealistic elements make the situation even more shocking at how an event would be allowed to happen so naturally.The film was fifteen years in the making for Kore-eda, and over the decade-and-a-half later on its release, the social phenomenon on unnamed children without homes was in decline; and so the 2004 setting may not be up with the times, granddad. But this was something that still very much happened, and the ignorance of all involved is explored here by Kore-eda.Not just to the specific situation in question, \"Nobody Knows\" looks at society ignoring children in general. The four dads have all abandoned their children before their mother, and Akira's pestering his mother's former lovers for a few quid - both of who claim to not be Yuki's father - shows a lack responsibility and an attitude of looking out for one's self; as well as black humour of their denial of parentage, but willingness to let the children suffer silently. Convenience store workers also help out: forging their mother's handwriting for New Year's presents and handing out leftover sushi (interchange between soundtrack vocalist Takako Tate and always-in-the-film Ryo Kase), but is a simple \"give a man a fish...\" solution, delaying the inevitable.The addition of fifth \"abandoned child\" Saki (Hanae Kan) explores not just physical abandonment, but emotional: her parents not having a clue as to what is going on in her life, taking up enjo kosai, singing karaoke with paying men. In the Tokyo of \"Nobody Knows\", adults do not know, or choose to ignore, these children. While some adults may raise the question to Akira of contacting the authorities, he quickly shoots them down as to the mess it will create once they get involved. With the real case seeing all four children not registered as living humans, here Kore-eda highlights the ease with which people can slip through the authorities' net; easily lost and uncared for. This lack of legality perhaps explains the mother's abandonment, almost believing herself that the children did not exist.The children's reaction is simply to carry on. They know no better themselves, the situation becoming the norm, living in ignorance, sticking to the strict and strange rules forced upon them. Telling anyone is simply not allowed. Kyoko still clings to her mother's clothes in the hope she'll one day return, despite the obvious cruelty. It followed that in the actual case the eldest was initially blamed for the death, natural that he would deflect his mother's cruelty and neglect on his younger siblings, resulting in death. If anything, the mother had at least trained her children well.Kore-eda stated he was intrigued by the eldest son and why he chose to stick with his younger siblings, despite being at an age where all boys want to do is play with friends. \"Nobody Knows\" is his \"embrace\" of the boy as to the conflict and struggle that he went through at such a young age. Initially blamed for the incident as a fourteen year-old boy, he felt responsible, despite being someone abandoned himself by both of his parents, yet choosing to remain responsible himself.The fictional Akira wants to be a typical twelve year-old boy, leaving his responsibilities, making friends and playing baseball. But, in sticking to his responsibilities and ingrained rules, he refuses to steal when pressured to by his friends, losing them in the process, now just a poor boy from a poor family. He refuses to go against his mother's rules, despite her breaking every rule herself.In reality, this allowing others into their lives saw the start of the ending for the four siblings. Shown here with Akira's friends pushing Shigeru away as a nuisance when they come round to play computer games; the two sisters only able to sit and stare at them. The demise culminating in the death of the youngest, the boy regularly visited the make-shift grave he made for her; a clear sense of guilt and responsibility - his ignorance at the reality of it all.Kore-eda said with \"Nobody Knows\" he wanted to paint a vision of Tokyo from the children's limited view. The film ends with the surviving children carrying on, walking into the future, accepting of their fate. Whether it's the children at the centre of the event, or the adults on the periphery choosing to ignore them, when dealing with society's underclass, nobody knows the reality of what is going on.I was completing my MA in Sociology and Social Research when first watching the film.",

If you are rich enough to afford to rent this film on DVD, be prepared to be shell-shocked by these children who cannot even afford a Popsicle.It is a difficult decision to begin this wonderful film, mainly because it will affect you tremendously. You must have the courage to observe these children, you must have the 2 1/2 hours to watch, and do nothing else. Do not eat when you watch this; believe me, you will feel guilty.The story begins as grainy camera shots, showing natural depth and stark (although at times fantasy like) reality. 12 year old Akira is introduced to his neighbors and promises to refrain from making much noise. Moving trucks arrive with 2 large suitcases, which Akira strokes, alluding to the very first scene with him on a train in tattered clothes and long dirty hair. The contrast between the spirit in his eyes is mind shattering. It seems that in the first scene his eyes have been wiped blank and solemn, while his eyes still sparkle with somewhat child-like curiosity and wonder during the first scenes, chronologically.As they unpack, two other children are set free. They are excited, enraptured in fantasy that their mother has cast through her childish whims. Akira walks to the train station where he meets his 10 year old sister, and thus begin their downward spiraling lives. It is painful to watch as Akira cleans his house, unpacks, shops for groceries, cooks full fledged feasts for a family of 5, manages money, and then studies. None of the children are allowed to go to school, but to see these children so devoted to the very education they are not allowed makes you appreciate what you have. The reoccurring thought that this child who is forced to be an adult, is only 12 years old. The thought becomes harder to swallow as Akira becomes increasingly resilient in ways that I, personally, could never think of becoming.His mother returns drunk, but with presents and promises of a better life, now that she is in love (again). She defends herself, averts blame or guilt in a most child-like manner. She leaves money (which Akira deposits first thing) and a letter explaining she will be gone. She comes back once, for one day, and leaves again, most likely forever. She forgets to send money, the children are left months and months by themselves without electricity, water, or rent. Luckily they are not evicted within the time frame we are allowed to observe.Akira keeps a journal and counts his money, glues receipts to keep track of finances. He mutters to himself \"gas, electricity bills, water,..\" etc.. the responsibilities that most adults don't have to face. He has to budget, keep his family happy. He waits to buy Christmas cake for his family, waiting until the brink of midnight when the cakes are discounted to buy them, and thus he walks home alone in the dark night. Almost every day they must go to the park to wash clothes, to get buckets of water, and traverse back to their increasingly dirty apartment.It is grim what these children have been reduced to. They cannot report their situation, for fear of being separated. But fortunately, an overarching motif of hope transcends brutal reality. Through long shots of neglected items, through the sheer happiness of finally being able to explore the outdoors together and collecting seeds, through the pictures drawn by ever-shrinking crayons, and through the discovery of a coin in a telephone booth, the film retains optimism while simultaneously reeling head into poverty.Overall, this is an important film. You must, i repeat, MUST see this movie. You will be changed for the better. The acting/improv is flawless, the children are as real as real gets. The mood is precise, everything about this movie is perfection. If you're not afraid of retrospection, introspection, sadness (the effects of viewing this movie), please see it.",

            "review_title": "Tough Children to Survive Domestic Mishaps",
            "content": "It was 14 years ago when I first saw this. More than a decade went by, knowing the main actor (the big brother in the movie, Yuya Yagira) winning the best actor award at Cannes at 14, watching director Hirokazu Koreeda's other work such as \"I wish\", \"Our little sister\", \"Like father, like son\", and recently \"Shoplifters\", it is time to revisit his earlier work and see how his themes evolves. And there are lots of recurring themes. Like his other work, this bittersweet movie exposes the dark side of the modern Japan society. What is more appalling is that the movie is based on an even more tragic event happened in 1988. Four children aged 3 to 14, malnourished, were found abandoned in their apartment in Nishi Sugamo in Tokyo. In the previous autumn, the mom met a new man. Leaving 50,000 yen behind, she asked the oldest son to take care of his siblings and disappeared. With different fathers, the kids were not even registered and did not go to school. The children have been living in the tiny apartment alone for nine months without anyone knowing their existence.Yet the movie shows very strongly that kids are tough and there is hope. As in the director's other movies, children are the center of attention and the portrayal of their mundane everyday life just steals the show, especially the elder brother, grade six student Akira (Yuya Yagira). He is great in showing the responsibility he shoulders without any complaint. He just silently endures and never questions his selfish mom (YOU) who left a note one day and disappeared. Yet when an emergency happens, he knows where to call and when he finds he gets nowhere, he just bangs on the phone and throws his mom's clothes away the floor. Great directing and expression of emotion. \nThe other kids are also very good, except the younger brother Shigeru (Hiei Kimura) should be made thinner after months of starvation. The youngest sister Yuki (Momoko Shimizu) was so cute but when she was sweating and feeling hungry in the power off apartment dripping in sweat, one cannot help but feel sorry for them. My heart really sank at a scene when Shigeru's chewing woke Akira who asked what his brother was eating. Shigeru murmured an answer as he turned over to try to sleep. It hurts more to see him turning his back. Written by the director, nobody knows has a very strong script. Knowing his mother is not coming back for a while, all Akira does and thinks are practical solutions. He asks help to make New Year gift money packs to his brothers and sisters and continues to shop and feed them. He himself is still a kid, he likes to play and has his dream too. On the practical side, he goes to Pachinko to make friends and hope to get some food from them. On the dream side, he plays baseball for an absent student. Lots of issues are revealed: selfish parents, lack of child care support, stigma against single parent family etc. In addition, school bully deters some kids and even parents from sending children to schools. But the kids are strong and practical. They have their own ways to survive. They never complain and always hope that one day their mom will come back with gifts. Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) even stays in the aroma of her mom by hiding in the closet. Even after a tragedy Akira had his own way of dealing with it. Just too much for a young kid who did not even go to middle school! Adults who abuse children's trusts and hope make me so angry.I like how the director presents the passage of time by showing the grown hair, the change of seasons, the wildly grown plants in the balcony, the shoes to flip flops, the sweats on the kids' faces, their dirty and worn out clothes and their hungry and weary faces; yet even amid all these setbacks, the children venture out of the apartment to clean themselves and have fun. \nThe plants sprung out from the ditch is just like themselves although they ask \"Are they abandoned? How sad!\" Abandoned kids feeling sorry for abandoned plants and take them home to treasure - a similar representation we would later see in \"Shoplifters.\" In the end four kids walk in the sun, as if they belong to the same family - a similar theme in \"Our little sister\" where the core siblings take in an extra sister. Although their birth parents are selfish, some adults are caring, such as one of mom's former boyfriends and the convenient store clerk. Very sad to hear that in the real incident an extra sister was killed by the friends of the elder brother. It is more tragic than the movie. Sometimes reality is more horrible and and I believe the director wants to show the resilience of children and his hope for the future. Great movie though a little heavy. Highly recommended.",

Have a look at the ratings, awards and comments, and you'll see that this is probably a movie you shouldn't miss. So why only 7 stars from me? Because of it's length. The movie seems to be trying to resist starting to move. I am not talking about the slow pace of the scenes - anything else would not have done the story justice - but that in the beginning, there are too many of them. Sixty minutes of exposition is not art anymore, it's just too much.I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that this is probably the most touching movie you will see (or have seen) in your entire life. And that's why it hurts me even the more when I think about how many people gave up on it during it's first hour, missing out on everything it has to offer later on. I feel like the first 60 minutes could have been boiled down to about 20, taking nothing away from the feel of the movie, but making it more viewable. If it got a director's cut, it should be considerably shorter in its earlier parts.If the 7 stars I gave it were distributed along the time-line of the movie, it would have gotten 5 or 6 of them in its second half. So don't take my rating for a reason not to watch the movie. Take my comment as an insurance that even if you feel the urge to stop watching, don't. If you are into movies with any more soul and emotion than Rambo, you owe it to yourself to watch this.It's a wonderful work of art which just doesn't live up to its potential, because it is 40 minutes too long.",

Although there are some obvious cultural differences, the plight of these abandoned children could have and does happen every where. Cinematically subtle, you see the decline of the children physically and emotionally. In the beginning the neglect is hardly noticeable. The children are happy, clean, and well fed. The seem to have an abundance of books and toys. One barely notices that they cannot attend school, play outside or learn the piano. The mother is satisfied when she returns, after the month trial run, that the children survived. Physically they look fine, nothing that toys and a haircut can't fix. She was never really connected to the emotional needs of the children. They were more playmates. The older two were in more of a parental role to her anyway, cooking, cleaning etc. I thought the acting and direction was so natural. The children change as the reality sets in that they are alone. Depression affects their habits and hygiene. They cling to the familiar and each other. I kept thinking, \"Where are the adults that save them?\" What about the shop keeper? Where were the other, outsider girls parents? Do I know some kids who need help like these? No happy ending, but lots to think about. I'd love anyone to comment.",

How hard is living for those 4 souls, with no parents and support at all. The younger boy living enclosed in room had made our freedom busted. Later when researched I found the poor victim is the younger boy. How could this happen in a city like Tokyo. (1987 though).

I found the plot of this film is quite similar to the Japanese Animation film, The Grave Of Fireflies (1988), which I happened to watch several moths after I had watched Nobody Knows. Definitely the motives of these two films are different. While the director of Nobody Knows was inspired by the true story of abandoned children in Tokyo in 1988, The Grave Of Fireflies is based on the autobiographical novel of an author who experienced the World War II as a young boy in Japan. Nevertheless, the way these two films move audiences' hearts is almost the same in the sense that the leads in both films are all innocent children who are exposed to a tough situation without any proper protection. If you have already watched either one of these two films, I'd like to recommend the other. Because your heart would be moved the same as when you watched the other. Despite the similarity between these two films, none would diminish the level of touching impression of the other. It is just the same manner that the audience who already knows much about King Lear would still receive the fresh, strong and touching impression from the Kurosawa's Ran. Of course, in case of Nobody knows and The Grave Of Fireflies, none is the adaptation of the other. (*)",

After seeing this film I thought I could never be fully immersed in a normal fiction film. I felt like I had watched a documentary but then I remembered that this wasn't a documentary but a fiction based on real events. This is a film that makes you forget you're watching a film. And this is not the case with a lot of films these days for me. The soundtrack is subtle and moving. I'm bothered by the fact that I could have just missed this film and not seen it. I found it on IMDb. Who knows how many other good films are out there that I just missed because there wasn't a big budget promotion for them.",

This is a heartbreakingly realistic film about a group of children abandoned by their mother and fending for themselves. Kore-Eda, the director, imagined that their lives couldn't have been all tragedy or something would have happened and their plight would have been revealed. This movie is an attempt to show the beauty of childhood against the stark reality of parental neglect. The acting by the children is superb. The 12 year old lead won 'best actor' at Cannes. There are so many beautiful directorial touches and so much left to the viewer to interpret that the viewer becomes intimately involved in understanding the motivations of all the characters. I almost feel as if I were a silent participant in the events. The film was based on a true story in Japan, which was much much worse than the events in the film.",

            "content": "Based on real events, Hirokazu Koreeda's fourth feature film recounts a year in the life of four siblings abandoned by their mother in a tiny Tokyo apartment. What starts as a light-hearted story about a lower-class Japanese family soon turns into a nightmare. Filmed mostly in just one room, Nobody Knows pulls you straight into the story, leaving you with an absolute claustrophobic and uncomfortable feel. Despite the horror that lies within this, Koreeda manages to find a perfect balance between the tragedy of the kids' abandonment and their daily, almost normal lives, including playing games and meeting friends. The most interesting part about this film is seeing the kids mature and, tragically, go to rack. Like a social study the film explores how the siblings adapt to their situation, how they try to survive with almost no cash in their pockets, and how they get along in this tragic situation. As a viewer, you feel like a helpless bystander, shocked, yet also amazed by the boys' and girls' strong mind and will to get by. Despite being rather slow-paced, this is Koreeda's most intense film and probably one of the best Japanese films ever made.",

            "content": "Nobody knows opens to a subway ride to the outskirts of Tokia, it is late at night, the car is almost empty, we perceive a young boy who is holding on to something, a suitcase it seems, and he is glancing at the reflections of a female person whose features are unclear and faint. Nobody knows who he is, nobody knows who that person is. We don't know and we don't notice, or rather, don't understand why the young boy's finger gently caresses the suitcase. We do not understand why his clothes are spoiled and worn down, and we don't understand the sadness in his his eyes. We don't know. Nobody knows.The film cuts back roughly one year and attempts to tell the tale of this young Akira, his siblings, his mother, their apartment, their few friends, their neighbors, their stores, their hopes and dreams. In the end we know, and this knowledge leaves us with a sadness that has not been offered any venue to address larger political, sociological or psychological issues in order to heal our souls. We find nobody to blame, not even the mother, not the neighbors, and certainly not the children who simply are this movie.Our sadness does not go away after viewing this film, it stays with us, we cannot shake it off. We are not enraged, although what we perceive is outrageous, we are utterly helpless, although, while we see the events unfold we fantasize about helping these kids. When later in the film a lonely teenager befriends our little flock, we desperately want her to be the magical helper we have come to appreciate in more conventional films. But there is no magical helper in Nobody Knows, for this is no conventional film.Prepare yourself for a long and arduous journey with little plot or action to keep you entertained. There is no trickery or speculative suspense to keep our attention going. But make no mistake, you will not be able to leave your observation post, your attention is evoked by a silent and beautifully simple tale that weaves its sadness from scenes and encounters many of which are lighthearted and poetic in nature. Nobody Knows is not at all a gloomy film, it is not a difficult film, it is not, strictly speaking, an intellectual film, for a child can view and fully experience it very much the way its protagonists experience their story. And perhaps a child knows more than we do about what is happening in this year, in these more than two hours. But at the end of our odyssey we come painfully close to their knowledge.",

            "content": "Nobody Knows tells a story of how four children, abandoned by their mother and never officially recognized by authority, struggle to survive on themselves in modern-day affluent Japan. This interesting premise, coupled with the film's wide critical acclaim on both IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, compelled me into renting the DVD. As the credit rolls, all I was left with were disappointed expectations. Here is why.Character development is what we look for in realist films. With Bicycle Thieves, we feel for the father's desperate struggle to feed his family. With Lilya 4-ever, we feel for Lilya's innocence and pain in being exploited of her dream of a better life. Nobody Knows does a mediocre job, at best, in developing characters that gain interest and sympathy from the audience. Even when the film's primary subjects are children -- the people we always care most about, I did not feel too much of the sadness and worry one is bound to have witnessing a group of children go through hardships and struggle. I did not know what to feel about the brother character; is he supposed to be a caring and courageous brother, or a normal kid who succumbs to peer pressure and just wants to have fun? The mother character is supposed to be a grossly negligent, irresponsible, immature, and loathsome person; yet I could hardly feel anything against her. In other words Nobody Knows's characters are forgettable at best, even when the young actors' performances are absolutely wonderful -- you just wish the script develops the characters in such a way that we can feel more for them.The film's highly realist depiction of the children's day-to-day life also makes it rather uneventful and dull; many scenes just drag on without anything really happening. A 140-minute runtime is probably over the top -- compared to Bicycle Thieves, a film with similar themes that delivers within just 90 minutes. For cinematography and camera-work, I felt perhaps they should focus more on the cramped and messy conditions of the apartment rather than on outdoor shots.In brief, what Nobody Knows delivers is a sad and poignant story about children's vulnerability and the loss of innocence. It gives the viewer powerful emotional impacts as well as perspectives into a human experience. However, what the film does not deliver is compelling character development and gripping storytelling -- something I consider to be of essential importance in making a movie great and memorable. My rating of Nobody Knows: 7 stars out of 10.",

A 141 minute long movie that is 141 minutes too long. Organizing your sock draw would be more entertaining and worthwhile. The acting of the children was commendable, but I never felt emotionally invested with them. The mother in this movie had the most potential for development but in line with the entire movie she wasn't developed either. Boredom should not be confused with simplicity and beauty, sometimes it is just boredom. If you sit through the entire movie, you will at least get a chuckle out of the English translation of the song sung at the end. It will leave you asking the question. Huh?",

            "content": "Nobody Knows is a film about abandoned children living on the hem of life, eking out a living for themselves with a kind of quietude and stoicism. Refreshingly, Kore-eda eschews melodrama and instead paints an invariably tragic subject with some lightheartedness and innocence, producing an intimate portrait of abandonment through the eyes of these children who still regard the world around them with wild-eyed wonder, blissful ignorance and curiosity.As the film progresses, the children sink into a state of despair and destitution, slowly but surely coming to terms with the implications of their abandonment. Their descent is gradual, and not without moments of laughter, however evanescent they may be. Violence in Nobody Knows isn't composed of exceptional, explosive events, but of the everyday, the mundane, quietly chipping away at the lives of the children left to fend for themselves. It is in the decay of a home once neat, clean and well-serviced into nothing but a heap of grime and clutter; their confinement to a claustrophobic apartment for the better part of a year; the children's inability to spell their own names; the cruel realisation that the Christmas gift wasn't from mum after all.The film can feel extremely drawn out and in a sense, it succeeds in conveying the sense of ennui, the tyranny of having too much time but little to do with it. It was a creative decision that I could get behind until it felt overdone and started to lose me a little.It is overall, a great film and an unconventional take on such a heavy subject matter.",

            "review_title": "A jewel of the Japanese cinema.",
            "content": "I highly recommend this film because the mentality of the characters is fascinating and it gives a great view about the Japanese culture and way of thinking. In addition, the director is excellent at using his resources to create the world of the film and maneuver the emotions of his audience. I had never watched this film before, but I am a huge fan of the oriental cinema and the movie appealed me. That is why I rented it on first place. Throughout the movie I focused on the technical details and I was impressed by the strange shots the director uses like medium shots from waist-down, extreme close-ups on the children's feet, a plant, a little doll, and it is not because they are specially important in the story, but they fill the film with a huge emotional charge because they immerse you into the lives of the kids. The story is based on a real one. An alcoholic mother leaves his kids in a small apartment to run away with her boyfriend and makes them promise they will never go out of there, except for Akira, the oldest kid, who she leaves in charge of the others and gives him money and the promise she will be back for Christmas. Even after being abandoned, the kids do not show any sign of hate against their mother. They do not focus in the tragedy, but in the solution. They remake their life and try to make it richer and happier by playing in the park, teaching each other how to write and raising plants in noodle cups for the fun of it. Just being kids, they find their way out of misery and stay alive. This film also made me think how different it would have been if the characters had been American or European. And I came to the conclusion that it would have been totally different, as the occidental kids rarely show this coldness to problems or to sadness. They are much more spontaneous, expressive and dependent of the adults. But in a society like the Japanese where people are taught to hide their feelings and rely on themselves, it was natural for them to act like that. This may not be the most emotionally healthy way to live, nevertheless, that is what makes a country cold, small and overpopulated one of the greatest of the world. Japan has survived invasions, atomic bombs and decadences and still manages to be creative and continue growing. To us it may seem a tragedy, but to them is a challenge that will make them better. The director uses the cinematography to lead our emotions mostly with color and with shots. The filters used are green most of the time and red details are added here and there like sparks of hope everywhere. However, the most brilliant treats were the shots. The extreme close ups in the children's hands are also a neat detail, you learn to recognize each character by their hands and they become even more expressive than the words or the facial expressions. These details I find them very satisfying as a viewer, because it bonds us to the little world of the kids and we end up knowing their little apartment as well as they do. On the other hand, when the characters are outside their apartment the director uses eye level shots from behind bushes, fences, or places the camera in the middle of the crowd so the characters blend in with the rest of the city. In the beginning of the film, in this kind of shots, it is hard to distinguish the characters from the rest of the people, but as the movie advances, we easily recognize them in the same shot because of their ragged clothes and bare feet. I guess that accentuates their gradual alienation and shows how they are different from the rest of the people around them. This makes our feelings empathic with the kids' ones. The film is a sweet and sour piece. We feel bad for the way kids have to live, they have to beg for food in the shops and get water from the nearby park. But in the end we know they are going to be okay, they have each other and that is all that matters. That is everything to them.",
