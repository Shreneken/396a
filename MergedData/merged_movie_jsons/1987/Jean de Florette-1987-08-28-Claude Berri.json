            "content": "I'm not quite sure what the appeal is to this movie, but it's definitely there. I've watched this several times in the past 15 years and always got involved with it....and it's companion piece, \"Manon of the Spring.\" If given a choice, I prefer the latter movie, only perhaps because this is a frustrating story, seeing a good man get ruined simply for greed. Both stories are well-done.This tragic tale of two greedy people driving a nice man and his family off their land is not just frustrating but sad, especially since their is no happy ending, with the man dying while trying to salvage his property. The second film is years later when the daughter, now grown up, gets revenge.Gerald Depardieu is the nice guy here, the one we all root for while Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil are the greedy jerks. These three are famous French actors who always give their audiences good performances.A big plus in this film is the very nice cinematography, which is why I bought this when it first came out on DVD. If the story depresses you at all, go right into the sequel immediately for a more satisfying ending to the whole tale. Both movies were made in 1987.In a nutshell, this is good storytelling.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this movie and was worried the sequel, Manon of the Spring would be a letdown--so often, sequels just can't compare to the originals. However, I say watch this movie so you can really enjoy just how wonderful the sequel is! So my advice is to see this film and then rush out and see the follow-up film.Considering that this film is from a script by the great Marcel Pagnol (who was responsible for many of the best French films), it's not at all surprising that this is a wonderful film. It's a sad and despicable story about greed. A man (Yves Montand) concocts a scheme to ruin an innocent man (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) and his family in order to force them off the land. It's even worse because the man and his family are so decent and deserve better. However, despite this being morally wrong, this plan was created because Montand wanted this land to remain in his family and be passed on to his descendants. Nice scheme, huh? The acting, writing, cinematography and pacing are superb--so good that I was EAGER to find the sequel. So, watch this movie and understand it only gets better in part 2!",

            "content": "Marcel Pagnol was rightly admitted into the Acadamie Francaise, just about the highest honor a French writer can receive.  No less a major force than Orson Welles described Pagnol's own movie 'La Femme du Boulanger' (The Baker's Wife) as the greatest movie ever made.  For someone with a limited canvas - Provence, its small hamlets, the port of Marseilles, and the people who lived there - he sure extracted the maximum mileage.  Jean de Florette and its sequel Manon des Source has now arguably become the highest profile of all Pagnol's work eclipsing even the great trilogy 'Marius', 'Cesar' and 'Fanny' featuring the great Raimu, and his two autobiographical works My Father's Glory and My Mother's Castle.  It is very gratifying for someone with a healthy streak of cynicism in their makeup to read such glowing tributes to this movie.  If French cinema NEEDED an ambassador, which it doesn't, then these two titles - shot back to back as Montand's wife, Simone Signoret, lay dying - could not be bettered.  To add any superlatives to those already posted here would be superfluous so just let me say that Montand is at the top of his game and that is saying something. Superb entertainment with terrific ensemble playing.  An all-time great. 11/10",

            "content": "In the French countryside, the farmer Cesar Soubeyran (Yves Montand) welcomes his grandson Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) in his property that intends to plant carnation in the land, but they need a spring of water to cultivate the flowers. Cesar decides to buy the land of his lazy neighbor Martial that has a spring; however, they argue and fight and Cesar accidentally kills him. The nephew Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu) that is a townsman and former fiscal inherits the real estate and moves with his wife Aimee (Elisabeth Depardieu) and his daughter Manon (Ernestine Mazurowna) with intention of living in the farm, cropping and raise rabbits based on readings. Cesar and Ugolin block and seal the spring with cement and Cesar asks Ugolin to get closer to Jean to sabotage his work. Jean, who is called Jean de Florette by the locals, slowly spends all his savings and inheritance and sacrifices his family to get water in a distant spring while the hypocrite Ugolin jeopardizes his efforts pretending to be his friend. \"Jean de Florette\" is a heartbreaking epic of greediness and cruelty. I bought this VHS many years ago and only today I have watched this masterpiece of the French cinema (I have no words to tell how much I regret this). The impressive saga of Jean Cadoret a.k.a. Jean de Florette is engaging and supported by a magnificent story and awesome performances, highlighting Daniel Auteuil, Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu. The characters are very well developed and Daniel Auteuil is impressive in the role of the contradictory character Ugolin. The scene when he tells to his grandfather that he is not crying but his eyes, is fantastic. Jean de Florette somehow recalled me the unforgettable Jean Valjean of \"The Miserables\", and his saga shows how unfair and cruel a human being can be. Tomorrow I will see the sequel \"Manon des Sources\". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Jean de Florette\"",

Character development is excellent, pretty much all of it is plausible, nothing really grates, except to see a good man suffer.Jean is good, an erudite - but he cannot understand nor smell a conspiracy - as this makes no real sense to someone with his principles. And when is all said and done - what matters most once you are heading to the pearly gates (should you be so lucky) the amount of wealth you've amassed or how you lived ? How do you hope to be remembered ?As cunning and sly as Soubeyrand is - I guess he never figured it out....A cruel, stunning classic, with impeccable french nuances. A must-see.J.M.",

            "content": "When Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) returns from his military service between the two world wars he has a dream of growing carnations \u0096 a scheme that his uncle Cesar/Le Papey (Yves Montard) quickly understands. However they soon realise that they need a great deal more water, a problem that can be solved by a spring that has long been forgotten in a neighbour's field. The neighbour dies and it is left to a hunchbacked tax collector Jean (Gerard Depardieu), who also has a dream to live as a farmer. As their dreams are not compatible, Ugolin and Cesar block up the spring and plot to rid themselves of their unwanted neighbour.Director Claude Berri shows great skill in bringing the classic Marcel Pagnol novel to the big screen and does it without losing any of the integrity of the source material, making a masterpiece of cinema in the process. Having seen it for the first time some years ago as part of French class at school, it has not disappointed on repeated viewings.The acting from all the cast is impeccable, especially the three leads, Yves Montard, Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil, whose names are not among the most famous in the history of French cinema for nothing. Casting Elisabeth Depardieu (at the time the wife of Gerard) in the role of Jean's wife adds something to the realism and Ernestine Mazurowna acquits herself admirably in her only film role to date as Jean's daughter.The film acts as a beautifully observed study in human nature and morality. What I love about the book is that unlike the majority of fiction that labels actions in black or white, all through both parts of this drama there are shades of grey. Despicable though the actions of Papet are, he is working for the benefit of Ugolin rather than himself. Also, though most of the villagers appear to suspect that Papet and Ugolin have blocked up the spring, none seem willing to do anything about it and they just watch Jean on his way to his inevitable destruction, so the whole blame can not be left at the doorstep of the Soubeyrans. It is interesting how different the characters of the three leads are. Simple-minded Ugolin gradually loses patience and is corrupted by the far more intelligent and hard-hearted Papet into following his greed. Jean remains steadfast despite all the setbacks he faces, remaining good and ever optimistic despite his increasing troubles.The decision to use Giuseppe Verdi's 'The Force of Destiny' as the title music is entirely apt, though makes more sense after the viewing of 'Manon des Sources.' The cinematography is also superb, making a stunning backdrop to the film and capturing the mood of the story perfectly. Though it is debatable as to whether or not this film or the sequel is superior, I prefer to think of them as two halves of a whole rather than two separate entities. Manon des Sources is pretty much required viewing for anyone who wants to get a fuller appreciation of 'Jean de Florette.' Cinema at its best.",

And Gerard Depardieu was never better. Great to see an aging Yves Montand at his very best, too, as the evil, scheming Cesar. Stick with it - through its many twists and turns. On the surface, it is a gentle movie, at a gentle pace, but it bubbles with an underlying tension that never quits - through to the end of Part 2 (Manon Of The Spring). When I first saw this film, I couldn't wait for Manon Of The Spring to come out, to find out how the story finally ended. It's that good. You will be enraptured, get involved with the characters, and care about them intensely to the very end. This film - and its Part 2 - are so far above the quality of the average American film these days it's not funny. This is the kind of film Hollywood should be putting out. It speaks volumes about the human tendency toward pettiness, cruelty and jealousy - and the terrible consequences of this kind of behavior. A tragedy almost on a Shakespearean level (certainly Shakespeare would have been proud to have written it) - this is one of the greatest movies ever made. The ending - which comes with the next movie - will absolutely devastate and haunt you. About the subtitles (this movie is in French) - you have got to put up with that because otherwise you will miss out on an exceptional experience you will never forget.",

Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil are also outstanding as the scheming Soubeyrans. The acting is not Jean De Florette's only good asset. This is an example of a film where everything works. The story is beautifully paced and evocative, the script is witty and very cinematic, the cinematography shimmers, the scenery is breathtaking, the music is lively yet again very understated and the direction does wonderfully in capturing the pace of the seasons changing and Provence's unique atmosphere.

            "review_title": "Sub standard sub-titles",
            "content": "The French pulled out all the stops when they made this film even involving the French Ministry of Culture and the Centre National de la Cin\u00e9matographie but it is marred by just one thing and that is the subtitling. When translating from one language to a second it is imperative that the translator is a native speaker of the second language. It is soon apparent that that was not the case here. Why oh why did they not devote the care and attention they gave to the original to the foreign language version? Nevertheless cinematography wins through and this is a joy to watch.Firstly, those sub-titles; these include several obscure English words such as genuflect, midden and farrier. Subtitles are literally gone in a flash so they must be sharp, to the point and in everyday language; one does not have time to ponder over them in the cinema, they became an irritant and are off putting. Even when watching a recording at home it is too distracting to have to keep on resorting to a dictionary. Having got that off my chest, let's turn to the film itself.The story is based on a novel \"L'eau des Collines\" by Marcel Pagnol, itself an expansion of an earlier novel filmed and directed by Pagnol as \"Manon des Sources\" in 1952. Pagnol was a member of the French Acad\u00e9mie and achieved fame with his Marseillaise film trilogy \"C\u00e9sar\", \"Marius\" and \"Fanny\" made in the early 30s. After Pagnol's death in 1976 \"Manon des Sources\" was remade with the original title at the same time as \"Jean de Florette\"(1986) so forming a sequel. The film is set in a small sleepy village, little more than a hamlet, in Provence near the town of Aubagne (Pagnol's birthplace) some dozen or so miles to the east of Marseilles in the 1920s. Much of Pagnol's writing is set in his beloved Provence of which he is a true and passionate observer. The film, made almost 10 years after his death, is the French nation's tribute to him; it presents an idyllic view of life in the sparsely populated rocky hilly region, falling not far short of a masterpiece. One sees all the features of a village run by old men playing p\u00e9tanque or just sitting around doing nothing and saying very little. Yves Montand is excellent as C\u00e9sar aka \"Le Papet\", one of the village patriarchs. Aged but unmarried he lives with his nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), a very withdrawn and ugly youth in his twenties with not much to say for himself. They are the sole survivors of the Soubeyran family who once dominated the region. C\u00e9sar treats him as the son that was never his. Ugolin finds that the soil around their farm is ideal for growing carnations but as the area is arid they need water for irrigation. They are aware of a long forgotten spring on an adjoining farm, so plot to acquire the land by deception from some townspeople who have recently acquired it. Gerald D\u00e9pardieu plays the part of the hunchbacked owner of the land and is the son of a former local beauty Florette who caught many a young man's eye not least that of C\u00e9sar. The Soubeyrans are content to bide their time as the years go by, seeming to help their new neighbours become farmers but all the time finding ways of undermining them.The film proceeds at a leisurely pace creating the true atmosphere of this sleepy community and with the breathtaking cinematography coupled with the fine acting it all adds up to a very rare cinematic experience. So much of what C\u00e9sar has to say or is thinking is seen in expression on his face; a slight twitch here, a raising of an eyebrow, a nod, they say it all: truly a masterly performance reflecting the leisurely way of life. Daniel Auteil also gives a fantastic performance as the seldom-speaking nephew.C\u00e9sar is evil and wicked beyond belief and will stoop to anything to get his way, yet he has the most pleasant of disarming smiles and an ever-present twinkle in his eyes. Usually well mannered, his Achilles heel is his temper and when he loses it the consequences are disastrous. Somehow one is drawn to him and sympathises with him. The hunchbacked Jean comes across as the unwanted intruder from the town and one does not feel for him in the way that the story demands. It's all part of the craft of film-making.Quite a few reviewers have praised the background music taken from Verdi's \"The Force of Destiny\". I was so enthralled by the film that I was not aware of any background music until I read these comments, but opera stops for me after Carmen. This exemplary film is in the great tradition of French cinema, which it should be as Marcel Pagnol was himself a great film maker and the founder in 1936 of the journal \"Les Cahiers du Film\". I have given this film only nine marks out of a possible ten on account of the defects I have referred to in the subtitling. One essential quality I expect a film to possess to deserve ten marks is that I must be able to enjoy viewing it time and time again, and \"Jean de Florette\" certainly passes that test.",

Although this film is sublime, I think it would be a wise choice to see the following film, Manon des Sources, as it gives the whole story through both the films. The film really goes to show how far some people will go to get what they want, whether it's le papet trying to secure a legacy for his family's name, or Jean de Florette trying to get his amazing ideas on farming to work. Everything comes together so well in this film-the score, the storyline and the performances, something modern movie makers should take note of.",

However he and his uncle Cesar Soubeyran (Yves Montard) don't have sufficient water on their land to feed a profitable crop. When they find an unused spring on a neighbour's land they block in and plan to buy the land. When the land is inherited by Jean (Depardieu) and his family, Galinette and Cesar plan his downfall so they can later buy his land and use his spring for their crops.This is a beautifully filmed movie - almost a tourist film for the France countryside. However the plot is not so picturesque, but rather deals with the conflicting human qualities of hope and greed, enthusiasm and envy. Jean represents the spirit of hope, a city worker who comes to the farm with new plans for breeding rabbits, growing vegetables etc., all to the scorn of the locals who believe his mad schemes will never work. Cesar represents the greed of the film, he drives the plan to frustrate Jean to the point that he'll leave and sell his land for cheap. The main character is Galinette, and it is him that we're meant to follow. He starts with the gentle dream of building up his land and growing his flowers but during the course of the film he is changed by the envy of Jean and the greed added to by Cesar. While Jean is the study of a man driven by hope who fights frustration and despair throughout, Galinette gives into greed to achieve his dream. It isn't reading too much into it to see Cesar as the devil driving Galinette while Jean is watched over by Manon (Mazurowna) his angel daughter.The performances are good with Auteuil (Galinette) good as the man torn by his desires. Depardieu and Montard (Cesar) are good as the flip sides of humanity. Mazurowna is good as Manon, she doesn't have too much to do but is good considering her age. The three male leads are the key and don't disappoint - they are all totally believable in their roles as devils, angels and mankind placed in the bodies of French farmers.This film is powerful as it gradually shows us how greed corrupts and perhaps how hope is not a quality appreciated by all - especially where envy exists. It is difficult to stomach because we're meant to like Galinette from the start but the ease with which he changes it alarming, but all the more frightening by the way it could easily happen to anyone in their life.The film is not complete as it is \"part one\" with the sequel \"Manon des Sources\" providing the conclusion. On it's own the conclusions it leaves you with are perhaps realistic but quite bleak none the less. This is an interesting, beautifully shot study of human nature in all it's horror.",

            "content": "\"Jean de Florette\" owes its success to Pagnol's particularly intelligent story, which, taken verbatim from his novel, Claude Berry and Gerard Brach translated into images.A good story must have a plot, a compelling conflict, and characters that we care about who change as a result of their experiences. This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all these points. The viewer is kept in suspense, continuously questioning the outcome of the story, which moves forward from crisis point to crisis point. We can see that a large part of the scriptwriter's role is to ask questions, and then provide the right answers at the right time. These answers can be partial, ambiguous, even contradictory, in order to reinforce the viewer's suspense and questioning.The first question posed in \"Jean de Florette\" concerns the success of Ugolin and C\u00e9sar in their \"carnation project.\" Will they succeed in getting the critical water necessary for the cultivation of these flowers? This question interests us because these two characters have been introduced as somewhat likable, worthy of our support, although, following Pique-Bouffigue's demise, we may have second thoughts about their integrity.A second question rises with the arrival of Jean Cadoret. Will his project of raising rabbits, a project directly in conflict with Ugolin's, succeed? Although we may have considered at first Jean as an intruder who comes and upsets Ugolin's plan, we also realize that the dice are loaded in Ugolin's favor, and our sympathy slowly shifts toward Jean. But we still keep a somewhat favorable image of Ugolin and \"le Papet,\" still hoping for positive answers to these first two questions.Pagnol now determines that the progress of the drama toward its conclusion, that is to say the answers to these two questions, will depend on subjective, internal factors, such as the personalities or the stubbornness of the characters, and not on external or providential circumstances.Thus, the new questions now being posed are about the nature of the characters. Can Ugolin carry out his duplicitous game to its conclusion? Will he make a mistake and be discovered, or will he be overcome by a sense of guilt and help Jean by revealing the presence of the spring at \"les Romarins?\" The viewer hopes that in the end Ugolin will give in to his positive instincts. As for C\u00e9sar, the spectator knows that \"le Papet,\" in spite of all the difficulties arising along the way, will never abandon Ugolin's project. Yet the viewer has detected something peculiar concerning C\u00e9sar 's reaction when Florette's departure from the village is mentioned. We therefore suspect that somehow Florette's past relationship with C\u00e9sar could bring about a positive change in his behavior. Independently, Jean's character will also dominate the outcome of the story. We wonder if his enthusiasm, boundless optimism, and his erudition will somehow contribute to his failure. Jean's scientific approach to his project is itself a sort of revenge against Nature that made him \"un bossu,\" - a hunchback, and therefore he will never abandon it.As the film progresses, our attention narrowly focuses on the principal characters and their evolution. We are not distracted by outside events. At the same time, we are torn between the two conflicting wishes for the success of two conflicting projects. This is the originality of \"Jean de Florette\" and what distinguishes this story from the usual, vulgar Manichaean novels or films.The themes are the city versus the country, modern versus traditional, and good versus bad.Jean, returning to the country to cultivate the \"othentic,\" is an idealist, more or less in the Jean-Jacques Rousseau's tradition. His knowledge has all been acquired in books. He speaks in the idiom of the bureaucrat that he was. He constantly quotes statistics to guide his project and to convince himself and his listeners how Nature should and will behave. He tackles his project with a definitively modern, scientific approach. Nothing is left to chance: everything is anticipated and calculated.To the villagers, because of his language, education, and culture, Jean is a kind of pedantic usurper colliding with the peaceful, traditional aspects of their village life. They make fun of Jean because his knowledge was acquired in books, not by experience. These villagers speak with the melodious Proven\u00e7al accent, their conversations peppered with old, colorful sayings and local proverbs. The people of \"les Bastides\" are isolated from Jean's world by their hills. They are attached to the land they have worked for centuries, and to their way of life.However, Pagnol, by presenting us with Jean's failure, seems to distance himself from the intellectual tradition, while, at the same time, not considering the country life as a perfect universe, without conflicts. He illustrates the violence that can result from the peasants' deep attachment to their lands. Pagnol exposes us to the tribal mentality of the villagers against \"foreigners,\" such as the inhabitants of the nearby village of Crespin. The only outsiders accepted by the villagers are the \"pillars\" of a village society: the priest, the doctor, and the school teacher, which the village needs in order to exist. Finally, Pagnol shows us the deep motivation of Ugolin and C\u00e9sar that is also easily understood by a city-dweller: making money.Pagnol's message is thus humanistic in so far as, without ridicule or Manichaeism, he presents the motivations and different points of view of each of his characters. On the same humanistic level, the story demonstrates that not withstanding apparent differences, such as social, regional or physical, all people are alike and deserve to be treated humanely. As such, according to Pagnol, the village life is idyllic, but for the eventual presence of harmful individuals such as Ugolin and C\u00e9sar.In spite of Pagnol's na\u00efve idealism, the films still succeed, because we are ultimately able to tie up all the loose ends, and to reconcile the warring factions through family and blood ties that transcend any geography.",

He now wants to devote his life planting nelliks. His friend and old \"mentor\" Papet (powerfull done by Yves Montad) see that without water (which is scarce in the area) he will fail. He helps him with money, and get him to buy land from his nabour, which has a very good water source. But he wont sell. Without spoiling to much, he dies. His land goes over to his sister, who dies shortly after. The land is inherited by her rather naive son, Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu, who gives the most impressive acting) a man of the city, he dreams of living of the land, farming what he needs, and selling rabbits. He moves there with his daugther and wife. Ugolin and Papet is then devoted to driving him down, so they can buy the land. They cover the water source.The film is beautifully shot, the area looks wonderful. Also, the score is absolutely marvelous, making the film throughly exquisite. A good thing, the film is not overwhelmed by this beauty. It is strongly concentrated around telling the story, about the up and downfalls of the family, who strive to survive. Also portrays humans as decivefull and evil. Ugolin's envy of the land Jean owns, is a strong theme in the film, together with mans battle to survive. I have not seen the second part, but I really look forward to it. Jean de Florette is a great film in all ways, and I recommend it to anyone. This is one of the few \"must see\" films out there.",

This is one reason that some tales have been brought to the screen over and over again. Unless we are interested in the actions or fate of the central character a film will fail to grab a viewer's attention.This is where Jean de Florette is pre-eminent. It tells a tale. It tells it simply and engages the viewers heart. The film is wonderfully shot in the French countryside with an almost photographic eye for images.Gerard Depardieu's performance must rank as one of cinema's greatest performances and he is more than ably assisted by Yves Montand and the rest of the cast.Also worthy of note is the selection of Verdi's The Force of Destiny as the theme music because throughout the film I felt that Destiny, cruel and heartless was driving the story forward.This is without doubt my favourite film and is recommended as a peerless effort in what cinema should be - story telling.",

With his greedy uncle, they go to their neighbor to buy his land. However the uncle gets into a fight and kills the owner. The death is assumed to be an accident. Le Papet directs Ugolin to block up a natural spring on the property and destroy the place so the new owner would sell it cheap. Hunchback Jean de Florette (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) from the city inherits the property. He brings his family with big plans to spend his inheritance to build a rabbit farm. Ugolin pretends to be his best friend while they sabotage Jean's operation. At first, Jean's hard work and book smarts make the place successful. However a dry summer makes it impossible to farm without water.This is a movie of great ups and downs. I was leery of the movie in the first half as the villains keep getting away with their evil deeds. The little temporary reversal of fortune is the key to the drama.

            "content": "As a B Western movie fan, I can't tell you how many films I've seen in which the plot had to do with some villain attempting to secure water rights from a neighboring rancher by hook or by crook. This often included such diabolical deeds as extortion and murder. What I never expected with \"Jean de Florette\" was for the same idea to be presented in such a compelling and provocative way in a French milieu. The story does have it's villain of course, and I'd have to say that Cesar/Le Papet (Yves Montand) was probably as remorseless as any Western Simon Legree when it came to duplicity and underhandedness. Not only did he airplane spin his neighbor Marius head first into a rock, but thought it might be a good idea to go back and 'finish him off'. His nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) wasn't much better, but had a subtler way of containing his emotions when the new occupants took possession of the Romarin property. One can do nothing but feel pity toward Jean de Florette (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) as he trudges relentlessly day by day to provide the needed water for his crops, as the underhanded tactics of Cesar and Ugolin are kept a secret by the town folk of Aubagne. Driven to desperation, Jean loses his life in a bid to release a potential spring beneath an underground rock shelf, thereby resulting in the eventual transfer of land to the Soubeyrans. What I wasn't expecting was for this picture to finish on an undetermined note with the fate of Jean de Florette's wife and daughter Manon (Ernestine Mazurowna) to be taken up by a sequel. Though I felt inconvenienced at the time, it turns out that the story's conclusion may be even better than the one presented here. For that, one's attention must be directed to \"Manon of the Spring\". I recommend watching both in succession for the full impact of the story to be realized.",

It should be stressed that both films need to be watched together, as individually they will not entirely make sense. This first part sets the scene and is by far the more downbeat of the two films. Set in the 1920's in south-east France in a rural community based in a mountainous region, the story centres on a city man, a hunchback called Jean de Florette, and his family who inherit an estate in the hills. His neighbours Cesar and his nephew Ugolin Soubeyran covet this property and try every underhand trick to force Jean off the property, including blocking the precious spring that his land depends on. As a result of their actions, as well as the complicity of the local villagers, Jean experiences ever increasing levels of stress and bad fortune in trying to make his new life work out.This is a good example of the 'cinema of quality' from France, incidentally a type of traditional film-making in which the young upstarts from the cin\u00e9ma du look movement were making films in direct opposition to. But I think it's only fair to say that, while it may be an obvious bit of commercial French cinema, it's also a very good example of it. The story-line is its strong point with themes of greed and prejudice, coupled with what can happen when bystanders do nothing when they witness bad deeds. The story is well presented with strong characterisation and excellent acting, especially from G\u00e9rard Depardieu as the optimistic and naive Jean, and with Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil acting as the well-drawn villainous neighbours. Add to this some attractive photography of the natural pastoral landscape, with the famous melancholic score adding a further dimension. It all adds up to a quality bit of cinema and a great appetizer for the second part of the story.",

It is simple, tragic story well told, unlike many of today's plots - implausibly lame, suffering on a CGI crutch for 85 minutes. The simple story is about enduring truths which have been the mainstay of the Greek classics and Shakespeare: Our human strengths, our failings, our virtues, and our vices. The story may be a fiction, but its kernel is not. It is stories and story telling like this which has kept our rapt attention for four thousand years.First we should understand that this film is only the first half the novel by Marcel Pagnol which would have been too long as a single film, and out of necessity, was shot as two. The second half is titled, Manon of the Spring. Neither film stands alone as satisfactory because, obviously, it would be incomplete, and naturally, is also important that the two halves be viewed in sequence. For a fairly dispassionate pr\u00e9cis of the plots, I suggest reading the ones on Wikipedia, so I won't be repetitive here. I also recommend reading the boards for comments and discussions.JdF & MotS were both shot at the same time in 1986 with a budget of $17 million making it/them the biggest budget French films up to that time. JdF grossed $86M worldwide, and of that sum, only $4.9M was from the USA. MotS grossed $56M worldwide, of which only $3.9M was from the USA. In other words, culture films are not a good fit for the American viewing audience, and the gross revenue numbers bear this out. The rest of the world seems to bear out this conclusion.Foreign language films rarely do well in the USA for the simple reason that the vast majority of the viewing audience are unilingual anglophones who do not wish to burden themselves with having to work at \"understanding\" their entertainment - they wish to merely consume it. If it requires the work of reading subtitles or thought, it becomes unpalatable. This film requires your attention and thought!But to be fair to the US viewers, the subtitles are at times incomplete or inaccurate, and unlike the spoken word, they do not convey the emphasis or importance of certain bits of dialogue well. The plot is woven steadily throughout the film, so the viewers with no understanding at all of the French language are missing essential dialogue, and therefore plot.The bottom line is this: You will either be entranced by these two films and love them, or you will be bored by the first 15 minutes, and you'll translate that into \"bad film.\" If your highest quality level of reading is Marvel comics then I suggest you stay away from this one.However, I recall years ago walking into a video store where this was playing on all the monitors. All the patrons in the store, ranging in age from 5 to 75 years, were standing transfixed watching this film. There was something magical about it!",

The movie constantly surprised me in new and different ways. At times it was humorous, and I thought that the whole movie was going to be a comedy, but that definitely changed. It got much darker as the movie progressed and I realized everything I predicted was wrong. The movie looks at the difficulties of farming and how hard it can be to make a living without easy access to water. It's also a morality tale as we watch people willing to do just about anything in order to make their own life better. The film gets a little heavy and that aspect was harder for me to deal with, particularly because I didn't see it coming. I also struggled with the fact that the movie doesn't feel complete on its own, in fact it literally ends with a message that it is only \"Part 1.\" Jean de Florette leaves you hanging so much that you can't quit after watching it, you have to keep going. This is not a terrible problem, though. Any time I get to the end of a movie and still want more, it's a good sign that I've been invested in the story. Jean de Florette is a film I found fascinating and I will look forward to watching it again, as long as I can watch Manon of the Spring right after.",

            "content": "The acting-pick any of the three stars, Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil-is superb, and the supporting cast is excellent. But what makes this and its sequel, Manon des Sources (1986), jewels of the French cinema is the story and the characterizations, which go hand in hand. There is genius in how naturally and almost inevitably the story unfolds. Although I haven't read the novel by Marcel Pagnol, I'm sure he's the genius. And this is not to slight Claude Berri's direction which is invisible and at the same time in total control, so that the film is simply a work of art. The characters are true to themselves, and what they do seems natural because of who they are. Jean Florette (Depardieu) fails because he puts too much faith in science, knowledge and the good will and fairness of his fellow man. (He should have listened to his suspicious wife!) Ugolin (Auteuil), whose selfishness and little guy envy lead him to do the harm that he does, is not a despicable character. We do not hate him the way Manon understandably does. He is a man of weakness who gave into greed. Papet (Montand), believes in the lineage of man, in property, money-all the standard burgher values. He is led to do his dirty deeds because of who he is. What is so, so superior in \"Florette\" compared to most movies is the lack of propaganda, the lack of adherence to some political or philosophic preconception. What shines forth is people living their lives and falling into some very human traps. I am reminded of Balzac and Guy De Maupassant in the depiction of French peasant and petit bourgeois life and psychology.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

We wait for Montand, Depardieu and company to break into song, but none come. I'm not sure this is a good thing, or a bad thing, but the film is pure late 19th Century drama. Pagnol, the author of the book, had a trilogy turned into film in the thirties in France. These films, one of which Pagnol directed, contain less melodrama than \"Jean\" but were closer to the author's intent. Not that this matters, for screenwriters and directors need a peg to hang their hats.Montand in his own way resembles Brando's Don Corleone, but with only one surviving relative, ugly Ugolin. Daniel Auteil in that part is the linchpin on which the film either works or founders, and his performance is great. Inside his plain being is a conscience, unlike Montand or Depardieu's Jean for that matter, who takes his family down to ruin in his quest to farm and populate the land with rabbits. Jean is Sisyphus, pushing the stone up the hill, not realizing that the gods have fixed the game. When Auteil sees the end results of his game playing, he breaks into tears, and in the sequel, does the honorable thing and 'falls on his sword.'Because the film is melodrama, we get carried along with Jean's effort and want to see Manon get even with Montand; we rush out to the video store for the sequel, but when all is over, we've not been changed, but rather have been to the theater.",

The acting is out of the top drawer especially from Yves Montand and Daniel Autiel who are mesmerising as the farmers intent on grabbing Gerard Depardieu's land. Depardieu is also in fine form as the hunchback who although bombastic and stubborn eventually evokes a deal of sympathy. It is hard to fault this film on any level and it absorbs you from the start to the finale. Although you can watch the film on it's own the subsequent Manon Des Sources ( another fine film) concludes the story in full.

Tears will well up in your eyes at the end of Manon.I really admired the Depardieu character in this movie. He is literate, intelligent and a true salt of the earth type. The harmonica theme and rural setting sort of reminded me of parts of Godfather (the scenes with Pacino in Sicily). There are other similarities as well.

            "content": "French cinema sometimes reminds me of Hollywood. And they have more in common with Hollywood as they sometimes would like to believe. When they find a foreign actor who really can act very well, they try to forget as soon as possible that he or she isn't French; chauvinistic as the French are, they prefer their own movies over foreign ones; making movies sometimes seems like mass-production;... Because of this mass-production it's also a fact that not too many movies are excellent (just like in Hollywood), but from time to time something special comes along like this \"Jean de Florette\".The movie has been based on a novel from Marcel Pagnol and tells the story of Jean, son of Florette and a hunch-back, who moves with his family from the city to a small town in the Provence. He has inherited a small farm house with a spring (very precious in a region where there isn't too much water) and a lot of land around it. But an old man and his only remaining relative already were interested in the property themselves. They need the spring water for growing their flowers and when they find out that Jean de Florette will move in, they block up the source. With pleasure they see how Jean gets desperate and how he tries to water his crops with water from wells far afield. The hard labor and the hot summer break Jean's health and the hearts of his wife and daughter, but all the old man and his relative can think about is the cheap land which will soon be available again...I admit that I'm normally not a big fan of French cinema, but when a movie is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from. Thanks to the strong story with its well-developed characters and the very nice acting by Yves Montand, Daniel Auteuil, Elisabeth Depardieu and yes even G\u00e9rard Depardieu (I normally don't like him all that much) this movie is much better than the average French cinema. This is a very nice drama that deserves to be seen by a great audience. It is one of the best French movies that I've seen lately. And what more than a nice story, some fine performances and a nice setting (In my opinion the Provence is by far the nicest and prettiest region in France - I wonder why people always think of Paris when they think of France, the country has a lot more and better things to offer) do you need to be convinced? The overall quality is very nice and that's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 7.5/10.",

That's the plot exposition basically but of course what we really have here is a study of on the one hand avarice, as exhibited by the calculating Montand and his occasionally conscience - affected nephew Auteuil against the nobility, enthusiasm and family - loving values of Depardieu's character. The fact that by the film's end, the former appears to have won of course will be overturned in the sequel (which I've yet to view) as Jean's young daughter Manon witnesses the deception of Montand and Auteuil as they glory in their apparent victory, even at the cost of Jean's death. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting characterful - you really feel that the actors fully inhabit their roles, and the story just unfolds in front of you like a classic novel made flesh. I loved the film whilst accepting criticisms of its being old - fashioned and conservative. But in the era, when it was made, of Rambo, Arnie and any number of SFX movies this film must have seemed then, as now, an oasis in a desert. Too bad the oasis never appeared to Jean de Florette!",

The first one was way better.\" I thought she must be recalling it wrong, or maybe I was. It's taken me a while, but I finally rewatched this last night.And... I was right. It's exactly the way I remember it, and I've never viewed it a 2nd time in the twenty years that passed, since it was released in '86. It is precisely as deliberate, plodding, overlong, tiresome, repetitive, obvious... as I recall.Since a laugh might disrupt the sermon, there isn't an ounce of humor in it. And for a movie that has no developments in its 2nd act, Jean D.F. is easily half an hour too long. It just sits there, and viewers are asked to do nothing beyond identifying the virtuous and villainous within a minute of their appearance. Then the pattern begins; each new scene again affirms that Jean, and the 2 genetically-blessed females in his household, are virtuous, and that the ugly or old Soubeyrans are treacherous dogs. This movie has NO dramatic arc and no payoff. It's a completely non-rich, non-nourishing viewing experience. Oh? The villagers don't reach out to the new family? Well neither do we see Jean & co. make any effort to connect to the community in the 3 years (!) they're there, unless the community comes to their farm offering gifts. Without Ugolin they'd be monks. Mrs. Jean and Manon have no emotional life whatsoever in this. The part of Mrs. Jean is barely written. Manon is a taciturn, blank-faced little robot. They're both infinitely less interesting or likable than Ugolin, even with his faults.The height of absurdity is reached when Jean & co arrive at the farm; he plays the theme music on his harmonica and Mrs. Jean chimes in (a la Snow White) with some tra-la-las. Jean embraces and caresses Mrs. Jean, framed perfectly by a rustic window. Guh!, it's like porn for women. The only way to squeeze more pastiche into the frame is if a bird landed on her finger, and began to tweet along. It's a powerfully unsubtle image that will probably never be matched for sheer corniness.The sequel Manon of the Spring is amazing, supplying all the development and emotion that this never gets around to; sorrow, pity, pathos, humor, rueful ironies, and of course that devastating ending. The fates visited upon Ugolin and Soubeyran are truly terrible. Plus, it actually has pacing! This is a tedious obstacle to endure on the way to the superior sequel.",

            "content": "I wonder, or can possibly try to visualize, if Yves Montand literally lept for joy when he got the script for Jean de Florette (and by proxy Gerard Depardeiu and Daniel Auteuil, but more on them in a moment). He was in his 60's by this point, but many of the roles that he was made famous for (Wages of Fear, Z) were years behind him. Here the role of the Monseiur Soubeyran, aka \"Le Papet\", is one of those major, awesomely commanding roles for an older actor to take on, even as it's not the most complex character of the lot. He basically gets to be conniving and cunning, and yet I think that's not the tough part to play; the hard part, I'd wager, is to make a human being out of someone who lacks empathy, or even basic sympathy. This is where all of the troubles lie for Jean (Depardieu) when he inherits a farm that was left to him by his mother, which in turn was an inheritance from her brother... I should also mention that he was \"accidentally\" killed as Le Papet was there, and sort of, you know, let it happen.How does he have some human quality to him? What can Montand play? I think the part of the intelligence is one thing, and of course one can see this man as a villain in a similar respect to the great villains who puppet-master their greed - the summary line refers to Daniel Plainview from There Will be Blood, but also Noah Cross from Chinatown (also a movie where water - how it's drained, where it flows to, how it's \"plugged\" counts more than anything and to where). He has a plan - plug up the water spring that is there on the property so that Jean has to resort to a much father spring, without the help of a mule (which his nephew could give him, but he won't by instruction) - and goes for it, hook line and sinker.Something about these men, who are the sort of very real monsters who ruin lives in everyday life, keep us watching, and with Montand I think it's that he imbues him with some odd, continuous form of dignity, at least from his perspective. He sees who owns what as just formalities - if you want something, you just take it, even if it takes years of plotting (not that a little bad luck, like a lack of rain, can't help along the process). Montand very likely didn't *like* this character, but understands him and certainly knows how to make him come alive and, of all things, make the audience see what he'll plot for his nephew to do next.Jean de Florette is a very rich film in how Claude Berri presents the story and characters since this theme of who cares and who shows what to one another, what it means to be a \"good\" neighbor (or not) and how everyone just wants to try to get what's theirs, or do from day to day, month to month. Depardeiu gets to play someone who is the opposite of Le Papet - Jean is someone who has grown up in a city, not a farm, but sees the possibilities and hopes (or just knows) that he can overcome things through having knowledge from books. A story like this might be tougher to pull off set in the 21st century just due to how many things have changed (better transportation, better weather prediction, loans), but there's still a resonance to the themes completely because Jean is a dreamer and yet at the same time puts in a lot of hard work - he deserves what he's working hard for. Shouldn't he get it, if not just for himself his wife and daughter? If I had to nitpick the film (it's great but not perfect, if that makes sense) some of the music is a little on-the-nose in some parts, like when Jean is running outside as a storm may (or may not) come to answer his prayers, and I wondered why the townspeople, shown occasionally, have such an immediate animosity to Jean just due to his hunch and being a \"city\" person. But these are minor, or I can let that go as far as 'it was the time/small towners', in the grand scope of what the film is trying to accomplish. You have a force of good (making one's own place prosper for oneself and family) and a force of not so good (total meddling to do a take-over, which one can see in action in major ways every day with corporations taking over small businesses and so on).But when it comes to Auteil, he has the best character to play, the one with the most conflict. He's not shown as someone very handsome, on the contrary Manon, Jean's daughter, calls him ugly and judges him. Maybe she can sense through some intuition something is fishy about him (and at times the wife doesn't like him either, only Jean is fine with him). Auteil has to play a character who is having to be the \"friendly\" neighbor, the cordial type, one who can help and give advice and be conversational and hear out Jean's ideas about how to do this or that with his crops and rabbit breeding. But what happens if he gets some empathy, which he has deep down? How does he reconcile it? I loved seeing this actor deal with this character on screen, and it's a shame Auteil missed out on some acting prizes for his work (or rather, I should say, in America).Beautifully shot (it looks like it was made recently with its solid 35mm film stock) and acted to such a high degree, this is a quality drama about success, failure and manipulation of people and land.",

            "content": "Jean de Florette is quite beautiful to watch. The French countryside, the carefully recreated farms and dwellings, and the scorching sunshine all combine to make the weather and landscaping two of the major characters in the film.Yves Montand and his nephew Daniel Auteuil have their hearts set on acquiring the neighboring farm after the owner dies. However, the inheritor, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, shows up, and rather than accept their loss, the scheming pair plot to make him give up his birthright. They're truly despicable characters, spreading gossip and laughing at G\u00e9rard behind his back, pretending to be his friend so they can be in a better position to sabotage him, and taking deliberate action against his progress. Yves has a cool, detached meanness that's chilling, and Daniel nearly steals the show with his conflicted obeyance of orders. Unlike his uncle, he realizes that their prey is struggling human being, but he doesn't have the backbone to switch sides. Their behavior is enough to take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster, and G\u00e9rard's character is so pitiable, it's impossible not to feel directly involved.G\u00e9rard plays a poor hunchback with dreams of breeding rabbits and growing vegetable gardens. Jean de Florette is one of his classic roles, like Cyrano de Bergerac, where he takes a character you already feel sorry for and turns your heart inside out. His enthusiasm, persistence, and trust in those plotting his downfall, are truly heartbreaking. In the second half of the film, he's faced with a drought, and he nearly kills himself trekking water back and forth to his property when his well goes dry. He, his wife, and his young daughter, give up everything to try and save the farm, and finally, G\u00e9rard runs outside, sinks to his knees, and yells up at God, \"I'm a hunchback, remember? Do you think this is easy?\" In another scene, when he's run out of money, he asks his wife-played by G\u00e9rard's real wife at the time, Elisabeth Depardieu-to pawn her valuable necklace. Elisabeth cries and confesses that she's already pawned it and received only half what he was hoping to get. It's such an exposing scene, and you really feel like you're in their house witnessing their struggle.This is a very heavy movie, so keep that in mind when you rent it. Every performance is wonderful, but it's pretty upsetting, so you might want to have a comedy lined up for afterwards.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to an upsetting scene involving animals, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",

            "content": "Yesterday night, while I was fueling my body with the refreshing coldness of a glass of water, one simple thought got me back to the film I had just watched: Claude Berri's \"Jean de Florette\", adapted from the novel by writer, director and Academician Marcel Pagnol. See, I always drink water before going to sleep, but for the first time, I could value it, it even tasted better. Water, and subsequently land, suddenly became the stuff dreams were made on, or nightmares in their absences, or echoing Pagnol' story, their apparent but no less agonizing absences.It seems logical that in a rural setting, water and earth would be the pillars of two-part novel \"Water of the Hills\" whose first chapter is \"Jean de Florette\", followed by \"Manon of the Spring\": but once you're immersed in what seems to be an epic family drama, spanning four generations of deceptions and lies, you realize nature was only an accessory to the film's real theme, which is the relentlessness of human greed and the level of cruelty it can push even the most benevolent persons, in that case, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil), an ugly farmer whose dream is to grow carnations and his uncle, C\u00e9sar aka Le Papet, Yves Montand in one of his last and best roles as the patriarch of the decimated Soubeyran dynasty. C\u00e9sar understands the profitability of flowers and for the sake of family whose remaining heir is his dim-witted nephew, he plots an evil scheme in order to buy at a very cheap price the only land that can provide enough water, thanks to an unknown spring of fresh mountain water.A chain of events going as fluidly as seasons and sun leads us to the land being inherited by Jean, the son of Florette, a girl from the country C\u00e9sar \"knew\" in the past. Jean is played by G\u00e9rard Depardieu and even a non-French ear would notice that he doesn't have the same singing accent than the people of Provence. But if he doesn't sing, the man is overwhelmed by happiness, believing he's just inherited a parcel of heaven on Earth (and from the beautiful cinematography of Bruno Nuytten, we can hardly disagree). Jean has a devoted wife (Elizabeth Depardieu) and a delicate infant girl named Manon, the characterization from Depardieu leaves no doubt that he's a good father, husband and man, but from an outsider's eye, he's a hunchback, a tax collector and a city slicker. Ugolin makes sure everyone knows his father belongs to the rival village, which deepens the shift of suspicion between Jean and the rest of the town.But Jean is too excited to pay attention, the man knows how to be practical, he wants to make profits out of the land, to raise rabbits and plant a species of cucurbits that grow fast, to feed them. He trusts the existence of a spring of water not far from the hill and the rains of summer to do the job; it's a hazardous mission that could have easily been solved had C\u00e9sar told him about the spring. But both Soubeyrans had stopped the spring already by loading it with cement, and not to unveil suspicions, C\u00e9sar tells Ugolin to befriend Jean so he never needs any other contacts. \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\" seems to be the motto of this slow and infuriating scheme, operated by a mastermind who spends his time spying behind the trees, as C\u00e9sar, Yves Montand is a peasant-like version of Noah Cross with a water-scheme of equally Machiavellian proportions.But Jean never sees his enemy and when weather stops being cooperative; he keeps going back and forth from the distant spring, fastening heavy barrels of water on his hunch. Villagers suspect something but there's a sort of Sicilian Omerta going in this part of France, Jean doesn't even know he didn't plant his vegetables at the right side of the valley and only discover it when it's too late. It comes down to the vital moment where all it takes to solve his problem is Ugolin's mule but then the nephew puts the final nail in Jean's coffin. Driven by madness and a furor against God who disgraced him enough with the hunch, Jean accidentally dies after trying to dynamite a well. And the film closes with the two men having succeeded in buying out the family and making a mock baptism with the unloaded water from the spring, under the shocked eyes of little Manon.Does she know that they knew from the start about the spring? What matters is that we know and that beyond the death of Jean, what they did was killing his happiness, sacrificing the spirit of a good man on the altar of greed and selfishness. r. This is how fascinating \"Jean de Florette\" is, it works like John Huston's \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" where a quest for gold says more about greed and paranoia than any study, when universal themes can be summarized through simple and palpable objects. This is what Cinema is about; using visuals to convey messages that can speak for many humans. Pagnol, by using a world that is unique within France itself, rural Provence, with its sepia and green landscape, its Mediterranean countryside, its lyrical accent, colorful population and grasshoppers in the background recreated a universe that could speak a language any foreigner could understand, because there's no need to be a farmer to understand how important water could be, it's not about the water but to which corner its importance can drive someone.Indeed, take the spring in \"Jean de Florette\", for Jean, it would have been the Holy Graal, for Ugolin and his uncle, a coveted treasure and for Manon, it was the weapon that killed her father, and in all poetic justice, the instrument of her coming vengeance in second opus \"Manon of the Spring\".",

Jean De Florrete, about this French farmer who moves onto his uncle's land and decides it would be profitable to grow flowers. But in order to grow a enough flowers to make a profit they'll need more water than they have available. Their neighbor has an untapped underground spring. The farmer and his uncle go over to negotiate buying the land with the spring on it. Unfortunately for them their neighbor hates the uncle, and when they offer to buy some of his land the uncle and him get into a fight and during the bustle his head suffers a fatal blow against a rock and he dies almost instantaneously. The whole ordeal took place by a tree, so the farmer and his uncle make it look like the old man fell from the tree and hit his head. They think the land will be theirs but a relative of the neighbor, a hunchback, moves onto the property. The uncle offers to buy the land from him but the hunchback wants to use it for raising rabbits and growing squash. Fascinating to watch the triumphs and failures of the hunchback as he goes about trying to fulfill his dream, always with a happy upbeat attitude. The thing that amazed me about the movie would be just how simple the actual plot feels. There are no huge twists, no distracting sub-plots, not much happens for most of the movie until the last 15 minutes; despite that it manages to grab the viewers attention wonderfully and it doesn't let it go until the credits roll either. Unless you hate French movies. I highly recommend Jean De Floret.",

            "content": "If you are the kind of cinema-goer who would choose popcorn entertainment like 'The Mummy Returns' over a beautiful, thought-provoking film, you'd better steer clear of Jean de Florette.There are no murderous mummies or scuttling, ancient beetles, not even a beefy Brendan Fraser. Instead, an intricate tale of greed, family ties, and blindness to evil.It tells the story of Galinet (Daniel Auteuil), who dreams of all the riches he could gain from selling blood-red carnations to local florists. After his grandfather (the fantastic Yves Montand) 'accidentally' kills the owner of the next-door farm, Galinet sets his sights on the plush, fertile soil of the land. However, a northern hunchback, Jean (Gerard Depardieu) inherits the farm, and plans to settle there with his family indefinitely. Galinet and his grandfather attempt to stir up trouble amongst the townsfolk over the hunchback, > with disastrous results.All 3 main performances are exquisite. Auteuil and Montand (a former lover of Marilyn Monroe) appear loving yet deceitful, without turning the audience against them. Depardieu brings an innocent freshness as the hunchback who naively believes that they want to be his friends.Indeed, the direction is also beautifully done. There is no singular viewpoint to enable the audience to side with a particular character. We see the strong love between the grandson and his relative, but also the underlying greed and selfish motivations. The camera does not waste too much time on languid shops of lush landscape, but involves them almost as another character. When Jean - who is desperate during a drought for water to feed his vegetation - hears a clap of thunder in the middle of the night, he runs out into the garden, whooping for joy. We see monstrous, looming hills, with flashing skies behind. Jean realises the rain is in another valley, and breaks down sobbing. He knows he has nothing to feed his family, and begins shouting at the sky and mountains, as if they - and God - are the enemy.There is no point in seeing this movie if you do not follow it with its sequel, Manon des Sources. Without the follow-up, it may seem pointless and slow. YOU MUST SEE THE SEQUEL. It explains why the ending of the first part is so poignant and painfully tragic.",

The matter is made worse by wholly outstanding actors, like Yves Montand, Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu, and for once Depardieu is the victim and the heroic Montand and Auteuil the despicable villains. Their villainy is not premeditated, they just act according to their primitive basic egoistic instincts, the whole drama is like an anatomy of opportunism in its most elementary and down-to-earth primitive instincts and methods, they follow their own earthal logic, while their victim Depardieu is as lost from the beginning as a fly hopelessly caught in a spider's web; but the tragedy here is that the web is woven by the victim himself without his ever getting aware of it, not even when it is too late. His idealism persists in getting the better of him driving him on unto his last stand, and his tragedy is his total lack of realism. He falls into the trap of actual circumstances against which overwhelming inevitability he stands no chance - and never realizes it himself.It's a masterpiece by Claude Berri for his direction, Marcel Pagnol for his relentlessly logical realism and for a marvellous cinematography that makes the film in spite of all unforgettably enjoyable.",

            "content": "Has farming, indeed agriculture in general, ever been as cinematic as it is in Claude Berri's Jean de Florette? The joy is in observing the rather articulate nuances that the characters must undertake when particular farming tasks require particular tools and items for a job at hand; the film eventually coming to resemble a tale about a man most probably as alien to farming as the audience and enjoying it as much as we enjoy watching his taking up of this challenge. The farming within the film, in its specificities revolving around the planning; the predicting; the techniques and the use of certain items and animals for certain events, is as intrinsic as the film's core study of greed and the capitalist infused garnering of an industrial item, an item which will bring large amounts of personal wealth and riches, eventually at the expense of others. The film eventually coming to form a remarkably executed, heart breakingly tragic, blackly comic, devilishly well put together period drama from France well worth checking out.The film begins with a young man named Ugolin (Auteuil) returning home to the South of France, and his uncle's farm, having served time with the French army; the soundtrack a dry and sleepy orchestral tune suggesting much in the way of travels and tiredness, only momentarily breaking off into louder bursts of a much more positive tone as he nears home. Upon arriving home, Ugolin takes clear glee in rushing to a small patch of soil on the grounds and unwrapping a plant of some kind so he may observe it; something he appears to enjoy more than being reconciled with his uncle after such a stretch of time and furthermore suggesting an inclination towards agricultural work, his dream eventually revealed to be one of which revolves around the growing and selling of flowers for a living. His uncle is Cesar (Montand), an elderly man whom demands Ugolin find a wife and have children in the near future so that the land may be passed down and kept within the family; his other eye on a stretch of land lying nearby to his own, a stretch functional enough as it stands and with a natural spring beneath it capable of escalating the quality of the goods that only Cesar knows of, but a stretch already owned by a man no way willing to just sell up.Berri spends a good deal of time with these two farmers, their dreams; their positions and their core characteristics filling up most of the film's opening act. We come to like them during this early part and their blackly funny misadventures as well as their dry observations on life and newfound situations which open up as a result of other events. We side with young Ugolin, this simple young man whom has only just returned from national service and wishes to move into floristry. It is only when the titular Jean of Florette arrives, in the form of G\u00e9rard Depardieu, that we see the true nature of them; Jean being the rightful heir to that of the land when Cesar and Ugolin accidentally-on-purpose murder the owner of the land thus bringing Jean into the equation following a string of other legal complications with the rightful land owner.Jean and his family of wife Aimee (Elisabeth Depardieu) and young daughter Manon (Mazurowna) are not used to such surroundings; their previous incarnation of living in a more urbanite locale ill preparing them for what they come into contact with here, the beauty and calmness of the locale coming to resemble mere surface featurettes as those within plot and brew. The obvious distinctions between themselves and those more attributed to the land arrive in the form of their clear differences in clothing, as well as their talk of things of a more cultured nature, namely the opera, as on occasion Aimee breaks out int chorus of song to Jean's own harmonica tunes.What unfolds is a game of cat and mouse and hope and frustration between the two farmers, in Ugolin and Cesar, and the Florettes whom hang around much to the annoyance of their neighbours whom still want the land, know of its true flourishing nature and retain the spring as their secret. Jean's gradual coming around to realise how wondrous and how magnificent the locale is, and how enthralling the individual tasks and procedures which make up farming echoes our own coming around to feel similarly towards the film. Just as agricultural activity is fresh to that of Jean, the arrival of he and his family acts as a fresh and very crisp presence within the film to that of the audience; the very gradual bringing of the audience around on Berri's behalf to have us see the two original farmers as cruel and calculating businessmen as this initial outsider and his family capture our hearts, is outstanding. The film is a really well executed drama, a wonderful piece persistently flicking from tone to tone and character to character in perfect tandem; a film working on a level of family drama, fish out of water storytelling and dark comedy culminating in something quite special.",

            "content": "Here is such a clear and affecting portrait of human cruelty, in the same league as Sansho the Bailiff. Beautifully filmed in Provence with a series of great French actors, Jean de Florette is a wonderfully engaging portrait of an earnest man being beaten down to literal death by the uncaring qualities of nature and men who are actively out to destroy him.A young man comes home from life in the military and surprises his uncle with how well carnations grow and sell in their corner of France. The problem is that their plot of land isn't particularly well suited to the growing of the flower because of the flower's water requirements. They simply don't have enough. Their neighbor, though, has a spring that everyone knows about but he refuses to use. They go to the neighbor in an effort to buy the land, but the neighbor is incensed by the mere offer and becomes physically combative. The uncle swings the man around by the legs, hitting his head against a rock, and killing him. He doesn't have a single demonstration of remorse for the act. In fact, when they leave the scene, it's unclear if the neighbor is dead or not, and he wants to go back and finish the job for sure.The property passes through the neighbor's departed sister to her son, Jean. Knowing that they couldn't get the property right away, the two find and plug up the spring. A tax collector from the city, he shows up with his family one day with all of their property and crazy ideas about farming and rabbits. The uncle and nephew come up with a simple plan. The nephew will be nice, helpful, and courteous to Jean, so that when his crazy plans fail, he has a friendly face to sell to.The plans end up succeeding to a certain degree, but the weather is not on Jean's side. His cistern runs dry at the beginning of a month long drought, and he's forced to walk his mule for miles to bring water to his plants and rabbits, both of which slowly die away. Jean just cannot get enough water to his farm. And, through it all, there's a wealth of water just beneath the surface.I think the key to the movie's power is the fact that it doesn't play up the drama of the situation. It treats the events as plainly as possible, allowing performances and the story itself to drive the drama. The closest we get to a melodramatic moment (and it doesn't rise to that) comes a little more than halfway through the movie. The nephew has been struggling with his role in the scheme, but not enough to actually say anything to Jean. At a particular low moment, we get a very quick shot into the nephew's head of a field of bright red carnations. It's that sight that keeps him from breaking and telling Jean about the hidden spring.Performances are excellent all around (I really like Yves Montand in his role of evil exposition man), and the movie is gorgeous to look at. It's involving and incredibly well structured. I greatly look forward to the second half.",

Two men conspire to destroy the farm of another man so that they can buy his property cheap. There is very little redemption, and the farthest possible thing from a happy ending.There aren't any real plot twists. The interesting twists come at the end of the sequel, \"Manon of the Spring\". This first episode is pure character study. Performances by Depardieu and Montand are absolutely first-rate.Depardieu is an interesting actor in a role made for him. Unless most actors, who study movement and dance, and move quite elegantly, Depardieu is a big clumsy guy. In this particular role, as an city-educated hunchback trying to be a farmer, he seems pluperfect. He is not hampered by his clumsiness, but uses it to lift the role to the apex of realism. I bought it completely. I loved the scene where he impersonates his rabbits.Those of you who find him impossibly incompetent in English-language films will be astounded by the excellence of his portrayal, and will understand a bit of why his stature is deserved.This film is excellent, but a tad slow. The sequel, \"Manon\", is a much faster-moving film.",

The film draws its strength from the simple, straightforward force of its story and from the elemental virtues, vices, and passions of its characters: sturdy peasant farmers working the arid hills of southern France. Yves Montand is the wealthy landowner who hopes to secure a fertile plot of land for his simpleminded nephew (Daniel Auteuil, hiding his leading man looks behind ugly backwoods makeup) by blocking its all-important source of water, forcing the new tenant (hunchbacked Gerard Depardieu) to sell the property cheap. There's quite a lot of background to establish, but from that simple plot hook Berri and his cast have created a leisurely (yet surprisingly involving) melodrama. It ends on an unresolved, downbeat note, a tease for the sequel, which will continue the saga with the surviving characters ten years later.",

The story of Cesar's greed, sins and retribution revealed the cathartic experience which I'd always heard about in school, but had never before felt while watching classical or Elizabethan tragedy.  I will never forget the mix of horror, pity and satisfaction which I felt when Manon exposed Cesar's crime in all its dimensions.  Yves Montand creates a character so real (though monumental) that you respond to his undoing as you would to that of someone you know personally -- not some character in a movie. Berri's art as a film-maker here vanishes into the telling of the story and transcends any technical or stylistic concerns. The films must, of course, both be seen in sequence for their full impact to be felt.  And you have to read subtitles or learn French: no dubbing can be tolerated!",

In contrast, Jack Lemmon stinks in the film.But to get to the point, there is a specific and profound moral in this marvelous film that is unfortunately softened by what I consider to be its inferior sequel [Manon should not be able to get the spring going so quickly].  Obtuseness in moral matters can lead to the same ends as serious attempts to commit evil. The moral demands on humans approach the limitless. Yes, those two guys are despicable, but they're not monsters.  They don't want to kill \"M.

And yet we can despise the crude and corrupt ways that he and his sympathetic prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Ugolin, proceed. The irony, the writing of Marcel Pagnol, the characters and the flavor of Provence, and the ending of the two movies is of such a magnitude and power that I rate it as the greatest to ever come out of France and as great as I have seen elsewhere.

The secret of Jean de Florette's past, and an unexpected little secret it is at that, is discovered in the second film, and it's well worth the wait to find it out!  Actually, I am surprised not to have heard a word here of mention about the two fine novels by Marcel Pagnol (whom I believe also directed the first Jean de Florette film back in the 50's); it's interesting to see how closely the films follow the action and plot in the novels.  In general, I would recommend Jean de Florette to an adult audience (since children may find the subtitles too much of a challenge for a short attention span).  And though I'm certain a lot of English speakers don't ordinarily like reading subtitles, je pense qu'une personne d'une culture differente puisse apprecier Jean de Florette et Manon des Sources;.

Jean de Florette is a cripple, yet hunchbacked and in feigning health, he makes the back-breaking hike to a well a long distance away to provide water. If only he knew what the two men knew.It's a nicely crafted French film but it's the sort of film that leaves you feeling hollow. I kept wanting something good to come of our hero, but no. The townsfolk shun the cripple, and his family. Nobody comes to aid him, in fact everybody is always on the side of the two villains of the piece, and of course the dramatic irony that de Florette thinks Ugolin is helping him is more savage than I'm used to.It's well written, directed and acted but it's not a satisfying film. Not having seen the sequel Manon des Sources which apparently piles just desserts on Ugolin and Cesar, I can't say this film intrinsically wooed me. I joked at the end how I would have loved to see Ugolin and Cesar club each other to death, or something that could re-enflame my faith in a just world, it would have been a fairly poor film then but it would have made me feel better.Really, this film is for lovers of fine cinema rather than your general movie-loving public.

However there should be criminal prosecution if one is allowed to watch this without watching Manon of the Spring at the same time....if you watch only one?  You have only half of a great work....Cannot tell you how important it is to rent or buy....but particularly watch these two films together and on the same day in the same sitting",

The acting is superb with Yves Montand and Daniel Auteil pulling off masterpiece performances with G\u00e9rard Depardieu cast as the slightly naive town person who can only see goodness wherever he looks.A modern chef-d'oeuvre.",

            "content": "Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring are more closely related than an original and sequel; they are really parts 1 and 2 of the same film, and in fact were filmed back to back.Set in Provence around 1920 (most people still use horses, donkeys and mules, but there are a few autos around; telephones exist but are rare, the mayor is very proud to have one), the first film tells of Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu,) a rather intellectual bourgeois civil servant from the city who, having inherited a farm in Provence, moves his wife Aimee (\u00c9lisabeth Depardieu, Gerard Depardieu 's real life wife at the time) and ten year old daughter Manon there, with the intention of applying scientific principles to raise vegetables and rabbits. But in the arid climate of Provence, everything depends on water: there is a plentiful spring on the property but Jean doesn't know it because his neighbors, local worthy Cesar \"Le Papet\" (\"Gramps\") Soubeyran (Yves Montand) and his rather dim nephew Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) have blocked it up, hoping that the lack of water will cause the farm to fail, so they can buy it cheap. This tactic has tragic consequences for Jean's family. The second film recounts how ten years later Manon, now a beautiful young woman, finds both the spring and a way of revenge for what was done to her family. In the end, everyone gets more or less their just desserts.The films have an interesting history. French writer and director Marcel Pagnol, whose play Marius was latter turned into the French film trilogy Marius/C\u00e9sar/Fanny, which was itself remade into the 1962 Hollywood film Fanny with Leslie Caron and other big stars, made a film in 1953, Manon des Sources, telling the second part of the story; his final cut of over four hours was so drastically cut by the distributor that Pagnol disowned it, and later redid the same story as a novel, adding a prequel novel, Jean de Florette; these two books together became the basis for these films.Jean de Florette and Manon of the Spring were a huge success both commercially and critically, and it's easy to see why. The Provencal settings are meticulously detailed and the landscape photography luscious. The acting is all around excellent: Gerard Depardieu and Yves Montand especially are as good as they've ever been.These films are not perfect works of art: they are not free of sentimentality, some viewers may occasionally be confused about exactly who some of the minor characters are, and the surprise ending ties together all the loose ends so neatly that it may see rather artificial. But these are minor flaws. All in all, this is a production that I think everyone will like: it's one of those rare films that leave you with memories that seem to be of people and places you've experienced rather than seen on a screen.",

            "review_title": "Solid film about selfishness and idealism",
            "content": "\"Jean de Florette\" explores how people end up in dire life situations, from their own devising and from the evil of others.The plot is fairly simple: Jean, a city man, inherits a country farm, and tries to achieve his grand plans of success. Meanwhile, his neighbors conspire to ensure that he fails so that they can get the property from him.The film explores how Jean's own naivet\u00e9 and blind idealism get him in over his head in the first place: a man's wild dreams that deny hard reality can endanger himself and his family.At the same time, it also shows how his neighbors can justify any bad action to get what they want. Whenever one of them doubts whether his bad deeds against Jean should continue, the other is always ready with a justification. The combination of Jean's actions with those of his neighbors prove dangerous for him.The story is set against stunning countryside -- even in the midst of showing its most unforgiving side, the natural surroundings always seem gorgeous.The acting is outstanding. The film is at heart a character study, and the main characters are able to bear up under strong study. A lot can be read simply in the faces of Jean and the peasants, and the final shot of a child's face is especially suggestive.The film lacks a certain charm that keeps it out of the ranks of the truly great films, but it is well done and worth watching, and can provoke a good discussion afterwards.",

            "content": "A remarkable film that manages to tread a fine line between comedy and tragedy throughout as two landowners conspire to thwart the efforts of their unsuspecting neighbour from making a success of his new venture. It's initial tone suggests a light hearted farce, but Depardieu's determined and sympathetic performance in the face of adversity are a constant reminder of the cruelty and greed of those around him. Whilst the film is beautifully shot, it is also equally adept at reminding the audience of the harsh environment that the farmers are working in. The final moments of the film clearly suggest a story that is unfinished, but as a stand-alone tale of greed and jealousy, it works extremely well.",

The story is wonderful, the cast are marvellous and no matter how hard bitten you are, if you don't shed a tear at the end of the story then you are simply not human.Yes the characters are starkly written; the gloriously heroic, naive and enthusiastic lawyer from the big city struggling to make a new life in the country, the wickedly cunning Uncle who plots his downfall with not a thought for the wife or the little girl.But its only at the end that you learn of the tragedy in his own life that explains this. The characters demonstrate the all too common frailty in human beings, people at their worst as well as their best. Its glorious.",
