            "content": "This film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement \u200b\u200bhad to arrest Al Capone, Chicago's biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was \"Scarface\"), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (\"The Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people.",

For a crime drama, it is not very gritty and is filled with Hollywood clich\u00e9s.Reasonably interesting but could have been great. However, there are so many Hollywoodisms and glamourisations it feels quite superficial.The weak script and formulaic movie-for-the-masses directing by Brian De Palma are compounded by the usual unconvincing performance from Kevin Costner. He alternates between dead boring and overly gung ho here.Sean Connery is almost equally flat and unconvincing.In fact, there's hardly a convincing and/or engaging performance to be found here. The only good one comes from Robert De Niro who is charming and suitably mean and scary as Al Capone. Vastly overrated.",

His main partner is Sean Connery as a Beat cop in 1930 Chicago. Robert DeNiro is Capone and all three are great. Connery won an Oscar. Ironically, it was tax evasion that was Capone's downfall. This is not a spoiler, as everyone knows the old story. Even so, the Untouchables is a violent and funny adventure.

            "review_title": "It's the Chicago Way",
            "content": "In 1919, over the veto of President Wilson, the Volstead Act was passed, which made provisions for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and successfully ushered in the era of Prohibition; what it did not do, was keep people from drinking, or more significantly, keep certain `businessmen' from selling it, which opened the flood gates to a billion dollar industry of illegal alcohol.  And in the larger cities, the mob bosses jumped onto the bandwagon with both feet, the most notorious of which was Al Capone, who by 1930 had a thriving business and the city and the people of Chicago in his pocket.  From the cop on the beat to the judges sitting on the highest courts, everyone seemingly had a price and could be bought.  And that's the way it was until Treasury Agent Eliot Ness showed up for work and hand picked a squad of honest cops to help him get Capone and clean up the City of Chicago.  `The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.  They were a handful against an army of hoodlums who wielded grenades and tommy guns, and they could trust no one outside of their own circle, not even the cops with whom they shared the streets.  Many looked upon what Ness was trying to do as an exercise in futility, but he never gave up, and went after Capone with everything he had, which wasn't much beyond his own guts and determination to `do some good.'\tNess's initial efforts were a disaster-- Capone had informants everywhere and always knew ahead of time whenever a raid was going down-- so he quickly realized that the only way to do this thing right was to get men he could trust and keep everything quiet.  The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.  Ness then recruited Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a veteran cop who walked a beat and was well versed in doing things `The Chicago way,' and George Stone (Andy Garcia) a crack shot recruited right out of the Police Academy. \n\tConnery gives an exemplary performance as Malone (for which he received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), the tough, Irish cop who becomes something of a tutor to Ness, letting him know from the start what he's getting himself into.  How do you deal with someone of Capone's ilk?  According to Malone, `If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.  That's the Chicago way-- that's how you get Capone.'  It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.  And Connery plays it with a hard, uncompromising edge that makes it so believable, and makes Malone a memorable character. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDe Palma brings it all vividly to life, building an underlying tension from the beginning that he maintains throughout the film, aided by the intense, sometimes haunting score by Ennio Morricone.  Costner gives a solid performance as Ness, but he is somewhat overshadowed by the actors and the characters who surround him, especially Connery as Malone, and Robert De Niro, who as Capone is absolutely menacing and larger-than-life.  De Niro captures the ruthlessness that indelibly marked Capone's infamy forever in the annals of criminal history, with a portrayal of him that is arguably the best in cinematic history.  De Niro plays it as it lays, presenting Capone as the brutal criminal he was, without attempting to airbrush away any of the attributes that made him so despicable.  It's a terrific performance, for which he should have received at least an Oscar nomination.\tThe supporting cast includes Richard Bradford (Mike), Jack Kehoe (Payne), Brad Sullivan (George), Billy Drago (Nitti) and Patricia Clarkson (Ness' wife).  Extremely well crafted and delivered by De Palma, who had a great screenplay (by David Mamet) and a terrific cast with which to work, `The Untouchables' is a powerful, intense film that successfully evokes this particular period in the history of America.  And it subtly underscores the true heroics of men like Ness and his crew, who through their fearless dedication possibly made it a little safer for someone to walk down the street, or for an honest man to simply go about the business of making a living-- things too often taken for granted in our busy world today; things that are important, and which makes a film like this so much more than merely entertainment (though it definitely is that).  And that's the real magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",

            "content": "Outstanding production that was the best film of 1987 with the exception of the very dominant \"The Last Emperor\". \"The Untouchables\" is the story of Elliot Ness (perfectly played by Kevin Costner) who tries to bring down Chicago Mob boss Al Capone (Robert DeNiro in one of his most under-rated roles) during the early-1930s. Illegal liquor smuggling and other much more serious crimes are running amok and corruption is all over. Costner realizes very fast that he must hand-pick his own men to bring DeNiro down for good. Thus he enlists the help of a young cop from the academy (Andy Garcia), a wimpy book-keeper (Charles Martin Smith) and a hard-nosed Irish beat cop (Oscar-winner Sean Connery in the performance of a lifetime). Together they slowly start to peel through the multiple layers of protection to get DeNiro for good. It seems that the fact that DeNiro has been lax in paying his income taxes could be his ultimate downfall. Beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, \"The Untouchables\" stands very tall with the other great productions of the 1980s. Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score is one of the finest the cinema has ever experienced. Really excellent. I have no negative comments on this production. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "I've been debating how hard to come down on 'The Untouchables' since I watched it again the other day. I don't know anything about the background of the film; whether it was made in a hurry or if there were problems with the production or a lot of re-shooting afterward. All I know is that with all the talent involved and the subject matter chosen, this should have been a masterpiece, a classic along the lines of 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas,' but sadly it doesn't even come close. To say it's an enjoyable little film about nabbing Al Capone is damning it with the slightest of praise. I mean, look at the cast. Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, even Robert De Niro! Can't get much better than that. So it's not them; they do what they can with the material. David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay (or at least gets credit for it), is one of the greatest living American authors. And yet the screenplay is as flat and thin as cardboard. It is almost impossible not to feel that other hands were involved in the story and dialogue; it has practically none of the incisiveness or bite one typically associates with Mamet. The director is Brian De Palma. That's where I'm laying the blame. I have never felt De Palma is the great director some claim him to be and there are many aspects of 'The Untouchables' which reinforce my opinion- multiple examples of shameless audience manipulation and tired clich\u00e9s. The geeky accountant who becomes a bad-ass during a confrontation and kills a bunch of bad guys. The adoring wife who has one expression, one that says \"I love you so much my heart might melt.\" The old Irish cop who dispenses endless pearls of wisdom and lessons-in-life. The straight-arrow leader who has a personal code he never violates. And all of this is put forward in such a ham-handed fashion; there is no subtlety to anything here. What's even worse is we never really get to know the characters; they are painted so broadly, they never register as anything but stereotypes. But there are SOME good bits in 'The Untouchables.' Mainly Robert De Niro, who is always interesting to watch. His shorthand impersonation of Al Capone strikes me as a throwaway, but it's a good throwaway and he manages to invest a fair amount of menace into the character, behind the fake smile and amiability Capone uses to disarm people. The same can more or less be said about Sean Connery (I can't believe he won an Oscar for this though). Kevin Costner is saddled with perhaps the weakest dialogue as Elliot Ness; the film can never decide who he is or what to do with him. At the beginning, reporters ask Ness, why bother to enforce prohibition? Because it's the law of the land, he says. At the end, they ask him what he'll do if prohibition is repealed. Probably go get a drink, he says. I guess that's supposed to be meaningful and profound. There seems to be no logic to the dialogue or situations. At one point, apropos of nothing, Connery's character leads them on a liquor bust literally on the spur of the moment, with no pre-planning, no explanation of how he knows about it. 'The Untouchables' has a climax of sorts in a railway station, then a courtroom scene which makes no sense at all (how can you switch juries at the END of a trial?). This film consistently disappoints; the fact that it still provides a modicum of entertainment is due mainly to the acting skills of De Niro and Connery.",

            "content": "As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is?. It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film \"The Thing\", they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks...",

            "content": "I'm going to make this short and to the point:To me, Eliot Ness and the Untouchables were true patriots, fighting to end corruption wherever it reared its ugly head. With that in mind, 1987's \"The Untouchables\" is one of the greatest gangster movies - period. Brian De Palma, coming down off of the landmark gangster classic \"Scarface\" (1983), continued the trend with this carefully woven tale (screenplay complements of David Mamet) about Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, perfectly cast) and his band of incorruptible federal agents. Ness is as naive as they come - bright-eyed and ready to take gangsterism down the \"old\" way - but being that this is Prohibition-era Chicago, the police are on the take, and no one can be trusted for fear of retribution from Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Ness finds his most trusted and loyal partner in a beat officer, Jimmy Malone (Oscar-Winner Sean Connery), who so carefully spells the law out out for him, \"He {Capone} sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!\" The Untouchables certainly do seem to overstep their boundaries in bringing Capone down, using a number of well-planned and law-bending tactics. The cinematography is beautiful, helping to capture the gangster-era in all its glory, and the Ennio Morricone score really gets you pumping for the action. De Palma is at his greatest in directorial excellence in staging stellar, heart-pumping action sequences (with the Morricone score blasting away too), which come to include the Canadian liquor bust, the train-station shootout, and the ending rooftop chase between Ness and Capone's #1 hit-man Frank Nitti (Billy Drago). Beware though, since this is De Palma territory here, we should be on the lookout for some scenes of pretty stylized bloody violence and the blood + guts action that characterized the times. Still, \"The Untouchables\" is one of my top 10 \"must-see\" pictures and I'm sure it's essential viewing for any gangster movie aficionado.10/10",

            "content": "Quite a few words spring to my mind when I think of The Untouchables. Words like: Excellence, entertainment, larger than life and Sean Connery. These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is. Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.Here are a few reasons why. First reason is that The Untouchables is just so darn entertaining. All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables. That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy. No. There is genuine emotion and real story in this film. The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable. This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in. To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.The acting is nothing short of brilliant. This is without a doubt Kevin Costner's best role. Some people have remarked that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that I can only ask: Were we watching the same movie?! He is a hundred percent believable all the way through. In the beginning he seems a bit too much like a square I-wanna-do-some-good kind of character but as the story progresses he really evolves and becomes more and more emotionally involved in what he does. Both in his friends and in the cause. He even bends some of the rules he initially tried so hard to uphold. Brilliant. Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in. Andy Garcia appears in this film in a very limited role as well and he serves his purpose brilliantly. He is the sharpshooter of the group and he is perfectly believable in that part. He doesn't get to say much but what he does get to say is said with as much passion as I have ever heard from him (he seemed a little stale and lifeless in Godfather III). Robert DeNiro is great as Al Capone. He steals every scene he is in and he really brings the larger-than-life quality to the character which is extremely fitting. The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though. The film is for lack of a better expression a Sean Connery tour-de-force. Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero). He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance. People have claimed that the Oscar wasn't as much for this particular performance but an Oscar in recognition of his contributions to the film industry. This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.The film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made. The score is very unlike most scores from the 80s which does that the film doesn't feel like an 80s film as much as Scarface which I find inferior to this masterpiece. The score is grand and epic just like the story and the effects. For an 80s movie the effects are pretty amazing. Once again everything works.All in all The Untouchables is a riveting story which is highly recommendable to all fans of crime/gangster movies.10/10 - on my top 10 of best films",

His quest is really tough, as his opponent is determined and powerful, but he has the help of three invaluable partners: Malone (Connery), a no-nonsense experienced cop, Wallace (Martin Smith), an accountant who will try to help bring tax charges against Capone, and Stone (Garcia), a great shooter.As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic. The acting is superb, and while Connery was the one who received his well-deserved Oscar, Kostner and De Niro made Oscar-class performances too.Although belonging to a typical genre, this film certainly stands out.

            "content": "Director Brian De Palma is the son of a surgeon, and perhaps this explains his high tolerance for the bloodshed that has translated into brutal, raw scenes in 'The Untouchables'. Then again, this film is set during one of the bloodiest chapters of American history and demands unflinching depiction accordingly. Zooming in on prohibition-era Chicago, a dirty, dingy, crime-infested retreat of mafia, the film lets us know a special unit headed by Kevin Costner whose objective is to frame the super villain himself \u0096 Al Capone (Robert De Niro).There are, in effect, three or four things that truly stand out about The Untouchables\u0096an otherwise standard crime by-the-numbers romp\u0096and at least one of them should be attributed to the surface of the spectacle; the costumework and settings are superbly breathed life into, as is De Palma's accolade, with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and accompanied by a swelly, jazzy moonlit music score. Another worthy accolade is of course Sean Connery as detective Malone \u0096 an American-Irish cop on the beat and down with the ways of the street \u0096 who may deliver one of the worst accents in film history, but makes up for what he lacks in verbal power with heaps of charisma. Malone is given, by far, the best dialogue in David Mamet's script as when he instructs Kevin Costner on how to get to Capone: \"He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue.\" Another worthy staple to The Untouchables is its strong individual scenes. In the front row for these sits the notorious baseball bat scene in which a furious Al Capone beats one of his associates' head into a bloody pulp with a bat, right in front of all the guests at the grand dinner table. Robert De Niro gained weight for his role as the crime-lord Al Capone and approaches his character with commitment, but sadly he is ineffective in the film as De Palma does not quite know what to do with him. Instead he craggily intercuts Capone's boisterous speeches and monologues with the template storyline of Kevin Costner's special unit, and the former are incongruous to the key story of 'The Untouchables'. Here it regrettably becomes apparent that the film possesses all the necessary ingredients but no blender in which to stir it \u0096 and De Palma is largely to blame for lacking the necessary skill.Having said that, The Untouchables keeps up the appearance of an epic crime film so rigorously through seamless costumes, stinky Chicago accents, vivid chases and a swarming taste to its sets that for a long time we are led to believe that De Palma has truly done it with this film. Certainly there are many scenes that testify to this and aptly camoflauge the shortcomings, such as the suspenseful pre-battle sequence at the Canadian border in which the Western-loving Costner is up on horseback to ambush the incoming shipment. Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude. Finally there is the unspeakably epic climax scene that plays on operatic in length through a long, glorious slow-motion capture by a staircase, politely nodding to The Battleship Potemkin's 'Odessa Steps Sequence'.The whole film is in fact an operatic affair with technicalities deluxe. With its mindboggling ensemble (Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson) it is easy to see how it is cuing us in to like it. To some extent it succeeds well, for it is suspenseful, but it is not well sewn-together. What good is a De Niro if you are not going to use him opposite the rest? What good is a Kevin Costner (who has never looked so ridiculously handsome in his career for that matter) if you are not going to let him emote? And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest? 7 out of 10",

For those who are fans of Brian DePalma's film it's no more accurate than the famous Untouchable series in the Fifties or its counterpart in the Nineties.The plain truth is that Eliot Ness's operations against Al Capone's liquor supply did hurt him economically somewhat, but hardly slowed down his operation in Chicago. As for the income tax conviction that eventually did land Capone in Alcatraz, it was accomplished by the hard working accountants in US Attorney George W. Johnson's office. In the film that is the Clifton James character and Ness and his squad did work for him, but Charles Martin Smith's character would not have been an Untouchable.Whatever else Ness was, he was a master of generating good publicity for his work, the same way J. Edgar Hoover was, or Thomas E. Dewey, right down to Rudolph Giuliani in our time. That is in fact, part of a good crime fighter's job, the more people know of your successful good work, the more cooperation you get from the public. When Ness who went on to become the Chief of Police in Cleveland and then unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of same, his career and finances took a nose dive. Just before he died he worked with writer Oscar Fraley on a memoir of his work and this became the cornerstone of The Untouchables franchise. Very much like what Wyatt Earp did just before he died, giving interviews for an authorized biography by Stuart Lake which became the basis for all the Wyatt Earp films done since the Thirties.Unlike the original TV series The Untouchables, Eliot Ness's Scandinavian background as versus the Italian Al Capone is made much of in this film. Kevin Costner is your basic good guy and Robert DeNiro joins a great list of actors like Rod Steiger, Neville Brand, and Jason Robards, Jr. in interpreting the volatile crime boss of Chicago who has come down in legend himself.Costner's a Boy Scout in this business and as Sean Connery says to him, those kind of rules are out the window in dealing with people like Al Capone. His bit of philosophy given to Costner when Costner recruits him for The Untouchables is the title of the review. Connery plays an honest patrolman of Irish descent who hates dishonesty, but also don't think a little prejudice against the Italian Capone isn't involved in his thinking as well. Jimmy Malone is a broad and expansive part that Sean Connery can work wonders with.To be honest I don't think The Untouchables is Connery's best work, one friend has told me The Name of The Rose is his favorite, another has said Woman Of Straw is his favorite. My personal favorite among Sean Connery's performances is the incredibly neglected The Molly Maguires. But like John Wayne's True Grit, Sean Connery's Oscar is for the work of a lifetime for a man who may be the most well known international film star we've ever had.Now Billy Drago's Frank Nitti is a performance that will leave you chilled for days and susceptible to pneumonia. That it's far from the real Frank Nitti and that Nitti did not end the way Drago does in the film is irrelevant. But that's just another inaccuracy of the film.Brian DePalma wasn't trying for accuracy, he was trying to make an entertaining film. In that he succeeded.",

            "content": "I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger, but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story. Costner is a good enough actor to make me believe he's anyone after awhile. However, after years of growing up watching Robert Stack playing \"Elliot Ness\" on TV on the hit series, \"The Untouchables,\" it took me a bit to accept Costner in that role. That part will always belong to Mr. Stack.At first, he just did not speak with the authority of a tough Chicago cop out to get Al Capone and the racketeers from the Prohibition Age in Chicago. His partner, \"Oscar Wallace,\" played by the little nerdy-looking Charles Martin Smith as a gun-toting T-Man, is even harder to believe. Of the \"good guys,\" Andy Garcia is the only likeble and believable guy. Sean Connery has the best character in the film (\"Jim Malone\") and is the most interesting to watch.Nonetheless, it's a good story with good characters and just about he right amount of action. It moves very well, which tells me the movie is entertaining. There are a few memorable scenes, such as the shootout at the train station with the baby carriage descending the stairway and a memorable scene with Robert De Niro as Capone.This is a tough, very violent and bloody movie.....nothing like the old TV show.",

            "content": "Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to The Untouchables Plot In A Paragraph: Federal Agent Eliot Ness (KC) sets out to stop Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and he assembles a small hand-picked team who can not be bought.OK, I'll get it out if the way straight away, it's historically inaccurate, but what it does have, is great direction, great performances, great sets, great costumes, a great score and a great screenplay. The screenplay by David Mammet has it all!! Good guys, bad guys, a fast moving plot, some good dialogue, the occasional bit of humour and sickening tragedy. OK, it's more style over depth, but that's not a problem for me.In 1987, KC was still relatively unknown. He may have had a semi-recognizable face (if only for Silverado), going into this film, but this was the role that propelled him to stardom. It's not a great performance from KC, but is perfect for straight arrow, family man Elliot Ness. He is not meant to be an over the top action hero, and had he gave a more energetic performance (like he gave in Fandango and Silverado) it might have ruined things.De Niro is a larger than life Al Capone, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith both offer solid support as does Billy Drago, but the movies best performance belongs to Sean Connery as Malone, a man who always has a one sentence rule/quote for every occasion. When Connery won his Oscar, many critics saw it as a \"lifetime achievement\" award (like Al Pacino's Oscar for Scent Of A Woman). I think this is grossly unfair on his performance here, which I do believe is award worthy in its own right. One of my few problems with the movie is following on from a characters death (no spoilers even though it is 29 years old) the violent shoot out at the train station, then the Ness V Nitti confrontation, the ending feels a little flat, but that's probably just me.With a $67 million domestic gross, KC had the biggest hit of his career, so far, as The Untouchables ended the year the 6th highest grossing movie of 1987. Grossing more than movies like Predator, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Dancing, Wall Street and the James Bond movie The Living Daylights. I almost gave it a 10/10",

            "content": "There is so much blatant emotional manipulation of the audience going on here that I stood and applauded when director DePalma crashed and burned with \"Bonfire of the Vanities\" three years later. Justice delayed is better than nothing.First, what's great about this film? The casting is wonderful. DeNiro gives the best interpretation of Al Capone I've seen on film, capturing the essence of a guy who enjoys being the darling of the media and perceived as a sophisticated clever businessman - the first dapper Don you might say - but at his core he is a murderous thug with an uncontrollable temper. There's a very young Andy Garcia as the uncorrupted rookie chosen as one of the untouchables, and then there is Sean Connery who won an Oscar for his performance as a cop, Jim Malone, tired of the good fight because he feels it just can't be won given the tide of money fueling all of the violence and corruption, and just wants to wait out his time walking a beat until his pension comes due until Ness comes along. I'll get back to Kevin Costner later.What's bad? The entire screenplay and its execution. If it's not just lying there it is trying to emotionally manipulate you, primarily with enforcer Frank Nitti doing what Capone is too important to do now - killing off lovable characters with a smile on his face. The film just can't let the conclusion be about the novel way in which Capone is brought down, it has to have a fight to the death involving Capone's surrogate Frank Nitti and Elliot Ness - a fight that never happened. Nitti met death at his own hand in 1943. And don't get me started on weird pieces of dialogue that don't even seem to mean anything. Example: Connery's character has just clubbed a mob guy as the untouchables burst in on a bootleg operation. He says as the mob guy lies there unconscious \"How do you think he feels now - better or worse?\" Huh??? What does that even mean? Then there is Patricia Clarkson as Mrs. Ness playing this entire thing like her husband is Ward Cleaver going off to sell insurance every day, not battle a band of killers. She's got this weird constantly smiling Stepford Wife vibe going that is just over the top strange given the situation.Finally, let me talk about Costner as Elliott Ness. The portrayal he gives is one of a guy who initially starts this assignment because he's told to do so, because \"it is the law gentlemen\", and he makes a complete mess of it. Only when some comrades fall in battle combined with the tutorage of Connery's Jim Malone on strategy, does Ness become effective at his job. At the end, when the fight is done, and he's put away Capone, the press asks Ness what he'll do after Prohibition is repealed. Ness says he'll have a drink. Again, huh??? No more reflection than this on the irony of the entire situation? In fact, the Untouchables era was the peak of Elliott Ness' career. Afterwards his marriage collapsed, his career stalled, and he failed at about everything he tried, so maybe Ness was indeed this hapless guy without a star, and thus Costner's portrayal would have been spot on rather than just a stiff poorly directed one.",

            "review_title": "Fun Movie, Though Don't Expect A Documentary!",
            "content": "When I was 11 or 12, I thought that this was the coolest movie ever made. And why not? It had some great action scenes, extremely good heroes, and extremely nasty villains. On that level, the film is perfect. Now that I'm a bit older, I still enjoy the film a lot, just not as much as I used to. It certainly isn't on my top ten list.In the 1930's, Prohibition is in full swing, and Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules over his empire with bombs, bribes, and machine guns. Since Prohibition is very unpopular with the American people, who's going to stand up to Capone? Enter straight-laced young Treasury Agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who wants to do the right thing but realizes that the methods required are much more unorthodox, what with the corrupt police department and all. He enlists the help of an aging beat cop (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning performance), a nebbish accountant (Charles Martin Smith) and a young police cadet who's a crack shot with a pistol (Andy Garcia) and begins taking down Capone \"the Chicago way\". After many shootouts, liquor raids, and assassinations, it all comes down to a climactic showdown - on the roof of a crowded courthouse! - between Ness and Capone's chief henchman, Frank Nitti (Billy Drago).The movie is, as has been pointed out, much more faithful to the original television series with Robert Stack than the historical record, of which it bears virtually no resemblance, not that that is necessarily a problem. In real life, there were up to a dozen \"Untouchables\", whose success was very limited, and never got into any actual shootouts with Capone (though Capone did try to kill Ness himself on at least two occasions). Capone thought of Ness as a publicity seeking nuisance, nothing more; the two never even met face-to-face. Frank Wilson and the IRS had a LOT more to do with Capone's indictment than Ness and the Untouchables ever did. And of course Frank Nitti lived for over a decade after Capone was jailed.That being said: who cares? This was intended as a fun, classy action movie, not a historical documentary. The movie is extremely authentic in attention to period detail, and though a bit over-the-top, it succeeds in its primary objective: to entertain. The movie was meant as a cross between a classy gangster film and a good old-fashioned cops'n'robbers shoot-'em-up, and was highly successful at that.The acting is great all around, with Costner and Connery in particular giving one of their best performances. Costner does a creditable job at making Ness go from a greenhorn do-gooder (the scene where he yells at the corpse of a gangster he's had to kill is one of the movie's few weak moments) to a tough, hard-assed veteran in a little over two hours, no mean feat. Connery does a great job as Malone, the aging, guilt-ridden cop who becomes Ness's mentor (though his death scene is a bit overdone, I must admit I actually cried the first time I saw it!). Garcia and Smith have somewhat less to do, though each have their moments (Smith sipping bootleg whiskey during the bridge ambush, and Garcia's initial confrontation with Ness and Malone). De Niro, who made a career playing gangsters, takes the logical step of playing THE single most famous gangster of all time, Al Capone, and DeNiro, Method actor that he is, does a great job managing to look, sound, and act the part, despite very limited screen time (does ANYONE come away from this film not remembering the infamous baseball scene?). Drago fits the part of a sneering, one-dimensional villain, and manages to make Nitti a menacing and even charismatic character despite having little to work with. Other talented character actors - Richard Bradford, Jack Kehoe, Patricia Clarkson, Brad Sullivan, Del Close, Clifford James - round out the cast.Where the movie excels, however, are its action sequences. The ambush of Capone's bootleg convoy at the Canadian border is simply exhilarating, and the suspenseful rooftop shootout between Ness and Nitti is extremely memorable as well. But what steals the show is the wonderfully done \"Potemkin\" homage in Union Station, where Ness and Stone try to apprehend Capone's book keeper, take out his bodyguards, AND save a baby carriage pluming down the stairs. Virtually the whole scene is done in slow motion, and is indescribably intense and even beautiful.Ennio Morricone provides a wonderful score, and I'm not sure why he dislikes it so much, as he's said in interviews. True, it's not up to par with his works for Sergio Leone's films, but what is? He provides an exhilarating, heroic score which captures the feel and tone of the movie perfectly (though for my money, the heartbreaking \"Death Theme\", played on solo saxophone, is the best track).Overall, \"The Untouchables\" is NOT a great gangster film, like \"The Godfather\" or \"Once Upon A Time In America\", nor is it an accurate account of the real-life events it portrays. But it's a fun, extremely stylish, well-made and enjoyable film, and on that score, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.Score: 8/10.",

It has an great ensemble cast, the 1930's period re-enactment is excellent, the magical music by Ennio Morricone and the incredible cinematography and editing. If you didn't see it you must see it now!1930. Chicago. During the Prphibition Al Capone (Robert De Niro) is flying high, making a lot of money with the bootleg of vast amounts of alcohol and of course the law is on his side (buying judges and corrupted officers). If you're against Capone get ready to run because he's implacable and kills those who betray him even bashing with a baseball bat the head of an colleague who failed in his duties. It's also the time of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) an honest man working as Treasure Agent and he's in charge of putting Capone behind bars. Capone is untouchable, dishonest and got the most dangerous crew on his side. Ness has a chance? Well, now he has three good souls on his side and things can be very different and Chicago might be another good place to live again. Ness's companies includes Malone (Sean Connery), an old and smart street officer who's up for anything, sometimes following rules and other times creating his own rules; Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) an accountant that wants to arrest Capone for not paying his taxes; and Stone (Andy Garcia) the best shooter of the police force. These are The Untouchables and with them there isn't things that they cannot solve it, no one can buy them, and those who are at the wrong side of the law are going to be killed or arrested. Writer David Mamet opted for not writing the real story of the events or even make a film version of the series of the 1950's. Instead he opted for an original work about four simple guys fighting against injustice and facing mortal threats. And to tell a story like that in the 1980's was a completely risk of failure in the box-office if one considers that the movies of that decade that were real commercial success were muscular heroes like Rambo or Terminator and many others. But with Brian De Palma directing, a great story developed and a amazing ensemble cast \"The Untouchables\" turned out to be one of the most remarkable movies of that decade and Sean Connery proved to be a actor even more talented than he is, and earn a Oscar in the following year.De Palma is known for his technique on editing, planning movies almost like Hitchcock (his idol) and here everything is done marvelously well. In the most climatic moment of the movie (the Stairway Shootout) he made a fantastic homage to \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (Sergei Eisenstein's film). Here Stone and Ness are in a shooting against Capone's thugs and in the middle of this shooting are Capone's accountant (Jack Kehoe), a woman and his baby in a baby carriage that runs out of control in the stairs. Unforgettable! And of course Ennio Morricone's memorable musical themes. He was robbed an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1988. He has a tremendous job here, setting the music in the cold and dark Chicago atmosphere, and he knows how to use the variation of instruments in a same theme for different scenes (For instance: the \"Death theme\" is used twice, two different scenes, but if you notice Ennio makes little changes with instruments). Brilliant!It's a mystery to me that there are people who simply just don't care about this film calling it superficial, or saying that everything was weak. I Disagree. I never get tired of watching this movie and see a great cast performing incredibly well, it has a good story (way better than some today's movies) and it's one of the best films of the 1980's. De Palma's top of that decade along with \"Scarface\", \"Blown Out\", \"Body Double\", \"Dressed to Kill\" and \"Casualties of War\" A must see film! 10/10",

A sharp script (written by David Mamet) and some surprisingly good performances from the cast combine to make this unmissable entertainment, a perfectly-formed film with excellent use of theatrical direction. De Palma is stylish at every turn, using his camera in innovative ways and developing some outstanding set-pieces along the way. Also boosting the film's epic value is a solid contribution to the soundtrack from Ennio Morricone which helps create the era and atmosphere wonderfully.The cast is uniformly good, especially the five leads who all give above average performances. Kevin Costner has always been a much-maligned actor but he gives a nicely subtle turn here as the family man with a conscience who finds himself up against one of the biggest crime bosses in history. All of the scene-stealing goes to the Oscar-winning Sean Connery, himself unforgettable as the chirpy Irish cop Jim Malone; I never thought I'd hear myself say this but he may well be the best thing in the movie! The other, less focused 'untouchables' include a moving and at times funny performance from Charles Martin Smith as an accountant turned shotgun-wielding hero, and a young Andy Garcia as a sharpshooter fighting for the side of good. As the obese villain, Robert De Niro steals his scenes with his own particular brand of method acting, and proves to be memorably scary when wielding a baseball bat.De Palma's direction is top-notch and a major reason for the film's success; without him it may have been just another run-of-the-mill worthy-but-dull drama, but De Palma goes to painstaking lengths to create an entertaining film. As such, he has received flak for twisting the events away from reality, but in my view a film's main aim is to entertain the viewer, which this does and admirably with it. The violence is strong and powerful and the story at times moving, and the highlight is undoubtedly the train station shoot-out at the finale in which De Palma proves that his use of slow motion is better than anybody else's; the result is unforgettable. As near a brilliant piece of film-making as you can wish for.",

With Depalma, De Niro, and what looked to be a huge budget with a story that is already compelling enough in real life, there's no reason to make a film this absent of quality.You can tell within the first ten minutes of the movie that the score is going to ruin the movie. The music was either clich\u00e9 (smooth touching melodies in every single last moment of vulnerability in the movie) or \"action music\" that feels like it belongs in homeward bound, not a crime movie. Music was even put into places where it make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Indeed, it sets the tone for the movie itself, which is a tone of farce more than grit.This movie just reeks of farce, from the accountant mowing down people with a shotgun with the nerdy grin symbolizing his transformation from mild mannered nerd to empowered bad-ass to the completely arbitrary scene of Robert DeNiro hitting a guy with a baseball bat (no back story,no plot movement, seemingly no reason for it to be in the movie whatsoever)to Sean Connery getting blasted with seemingly dozens of machine gun bullets, bleeding enough to have died three times over, and yet still having the power to gasp a few more words just as Elliot Ness gets there before finally dying. This movie is filled with enough corny commercial movie tricks and clich\u00e9s that it just cannot be taken seriously. This is not a bad thing if you're making a Disney movie, but when you're making a crime drama, (especially one based on real life) realism is probably the way you want to go.This is not even to take into consideration the awful acting throughout the movie. This actually may be why the movie so heavily relies on cheesy music. The actor's performances were so weak that it required cheesy music to make them look better. Kevin Costner is just not a great actor and none of the supporting cast is exactly Daniel-Day Lewis. Sean Connery won an academy award for his performance somehow. I suppose his acting may have not been particularly bad, but his character seemed so manufactured and out of step with reality that he simply couldn't be taken seriously. Maybe in a completely fictitious story it would have worked, but again, not in a story based on real people and real events.If you want to see a farce that tries to be serious, every movie clich\u00e9 in the book (this is no exaggeration, just look for them) an out of place and overdone score, and substandard acting, then this is the movie for you. I somehow doubt, though, that the target audience for this movie were movie watchers who enjoyed this type of film. Take out the violence and this movie belongs next to Pete's Dragon on the movie shelf. It's a disgrace to Al Capone and Elliot Ness both and to anyone who likes good movies.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.De Palma is never about story, nor actors, but about the eye. However, here he has some help in writing and acting that he rarely gets, making this his most accessible and popular picture. There is no one better than Mamet for this kind of writing. (`This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide' -- pretty good stuff.) Costner and Connery are relatively weak actors, but this is a good fit for them. (I'm told that Connery's natural Scots accent makes him completely goof the intended Irish.) Deniro hadn't begun his slide into laziness yet. The score is apt as well.Still, to appreciate this you have to ignore all that, even though it is good enough, and focus on what is excellent -- how the camera moves within the frame. It is not De Palma's best in my mind: `Snake Eyes' is the film that shows his talent most purely. But this is great filmmaking cinematically. Every shot has motion in the camera; often smooth movement that perfectly complements the movement seen. De Palma is the true son of Hitchcock -- Hitch's camera ballet was a major component of the story: who can forget for instance the goodbye Babs shot down the stairs and out the door in `Frenzy.'De Palma's camera is less bound than Hitch's. It swoops and turns and explores and navigates without gravity which always informed Hitch's eye. De Palma's vision is less intrinsic to the story, but that's the point -- we are detached, swimming angels, not of the world displayed -- not low tide.",

            "content": "Old but gold, The Untouchables captures all the heartache, suffering, salvation one can experience, in a fast, thrilling crime drama, with an exceptional cast.Despite Prohibition in the USA, a mobster, Al Capone, continues his illicit liquor business. A federal agent, Eliot Ness, is assigned to expose Capone's illegal business and bring him to justice.Based on an autobiographical memoir by Eliot Ness co-written with Oscar Fraley, published in 1957 of the same name; the film is a classic exemplar of vintage entertainment - a vibrant production with all the chases, gunshots and altercations any film lover can withstand. The most effective employment of the movie's script is the effect it has in its audience; we instantly feel connected with the characters on a personal level, allowing us to empathise with the events that take place, we suffer through visualising suffering - and that is a chief component of a perfect piece.The cast (as mentioned previously) is top-tier; Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia star in the 1987 blockbuster, which grossed over $100 million in the Box Office. Despite its $25 million budget. Connery picked up the film's only Oscar from 4 total nominations in the Academy Awards. The wise actors play their assignments to a tee, offering convincing displays that marry Brian De Palma's camerawork to the ever-so-enticing plot.Albert H. Wolff, the last survivor of the real-life Untouchables, was a consultant on this movie, and helped Kevin Costner with his portrayal of Eliot Ness, a fine example of the care and polish handled toward the script, ensuring nothing short of excellence was achieved. Also emphasising the true commitment of production, in telling the story in exactly the manner to which events unfolded.The movie is an icon for all to appreciate, an untouchable ornament of cinematic history.",

            "content": "The Untouchables is a well-made, well-acted gangster story from director Brian (Scarface) De Palma. One thing you can virtually always guarantee from a De Palma movie is flamboyance, and this is no exception. Not content with a compelling story, the director has thrown in a series of his typically bravura set pieces, the best of which is a truly outstanding railway station shootout. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed. Most of the city cops either haven't realized it's happening or have chosen to turn a blind eye. Ness soon learns that the criminal underworld is controlled by ruthless gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro), who men on both sides of the law fear to tackle. Aided by a trusty band of three loyal pals, Irish cop Malone (Sean Connery), suave George Stone (Andy Garcia), and reliable Oscar Wallace (C.M Smith), Ness wages war on Capone and his gangland cronies. While other law enforcers pretend nothing is going on, Ness and his men swoop into action against the smugglers, bootleggers, and gunmen terrorising the city streets. Capone is not pleased - he turns his attention to stamping out these troublesome law enforcers who have put a dent in his lucrative criminal empire.Unsurprisingly, the acting here is high-class. Costner does what's required as Ness, but Connery and De Niro go a few steps further. Connery's experienced Irish cop is a wonderful role (indeed, the role which deservedly won the big Scot his only Oscar), while De Niro demonstrates how to portray evilness as only he can (his baseball bat slaying of an associate is shocking and disturbing in the extreme). Also memorable is Billy Drago as Capone's most psychopathic henchman Frank Nitti (not only does he get some powerful scenes; he also dies the most extraordinary death in the whole film). De Palma provides numerous flashy sequences, including a smuggling raid on the US-Canadian border, the rooftop skirmish between Ness and Nitti, and the afore-mentioned railway sequence. Ennio Morricone's music score is exciting and well-suited to the events on screen. There are occasional misjudgements, like Connery's ludicrously prolonged slaying (any more bullets and he's be a walking hunk of lead) and some slushy \"family\" interludes with Ness which are intended to show his loving, caring side but which only interfere with the proceedings. On the whole, though, The Untouchables is a fine movie which probably represents De Palma's best work of the '80s.",

            "content": "\"The camera lies all the time.\" \u2013 Brian De Palma Brian De Palma directs \"The Untouchables\", a film which presents the flip side to his earlier gangster movie, \"Scarface\". So whilst \"Scarface\" was all about excess and unchecked consumption, the logic of capitalism taken to its grotesque extreme, \"The Untouchables\" is about Prohibition, regulation, control and the knights who maintain order.And so the over-the-top badness of Al Pacino in \"Scarface\" (\"Say goodbye to the bad guy!\", \"Bad guy coming through!\") becomes actor Kevin Costner's ultra saintly performance as the squeaky clean Eliot Ness in \"The Untouchables\" (\"Let's do some good!\", \"I'm a good cop!\", \"We must be pure!\"). A boy scout with a badge, Ness is the ultimate straight-arrow. Where Pacino was associated with foreigners, outsiders, vulgarity, sex and drugs, Ness is an all American hero, a morally righteous G-man linked to religious iconography, a Madonna-like wife, righteous crusades, noble sacrifices, wild west motifs, Norman Rockwell imagery and is constantly shot from low angles so as to emphasise his near mythic, heroic stature.There are other minor reversals \u2013 the man Pacino kills in Freedom Town becomes the henchman Ness kills at the end of \"Untouchables\", the little girl killed at the start of \"Untouchables\" becomes the little girls Pacino saves at the end of \"Scarface\" etc \u2013 but the major reversals occur toward the end of the film. Here, no one bats an eyelid when the super saintly Ness lies to a judge and commits murder to uphold Prohibition, a foolish law (which still exists in various forms today) which Ness abides to, not because it is worth enforcing (the film ends with Ness promising to take a drink), but because it is the Law.All these actions flip \"Scarface's\" redemptive ending, in which crime-lord Tony Montana becomes disillusioned with excess and loses his empire after refusing both to corrupt the innocence of his sister and to murder two girls. For all his vices, Montana was a disillusioned hero. For all his charm, Ness is a hypocrite, one film serving up truths via disenchantment, the other lies via illusions. If capitalism operates by promising the unattainable absolute object whilst disguising the fact that it is the object's inaccessibility which fuels Desire, then it is \"heroes\" like Ness who bolster the American Dream by ensuring that Desire is always possible but prohibited.Both films are derived from 1930s gangster flicks, but at times feel more like war movies (armoured trucks, assault rifles, high-tech surveillance). Like most war movies, \"The Untouchables\" message also appears to be that the ends justify the means. That our heroes commit crimes, but only that we may all live in peace. As Ness' world is one of crooked cops, dishonest judges, widespread corruption, and one in which power goes to the highest bidder, the audience not only accepts a little rule bending from our hero, but overlooks it completely.Throughout the film, Ness wrestles with one question: can the rule of law be re-established by violating the law? His answer is no. When the grieving mother of a dead little girl tasks Ness with capturing crime-lord Al Capone, Ness nobly takes on this \"righteous mission\". He will do anything within the Law to maintain the Law, he says. It is only through a character called Malone (Sean Connery), that Ness begins to embrace more cutthroat methods. As Malone is linked to churches, Rosary beads and saints, we accept his schooling. The government \u2013 federal, state and local \u2013 is not bound to obey its own laws.The film contains an extended sequence which takes place in Chicago's Union Station. Dismissed by many as being a \"mere homage\", this scene recalls Eisenstein's \"Odessa Steps\" sequence in \"The Battleship Potempkin\" for several reasons. Not only was \"Potempkin\" made during the time period in which \"The Untouchables\" is set, but both films are about battles for control, \"Untouchables\" the battle for capitalist control of \"war torn\" Chicago and \"Potempkin\" the Tsarist Regime's control of \"Russia\" in the wake of rebel dissidence.Eisenstein's \"Odessa Steps\" sequence was an unashamed piece of political propaganda \u2013 one of cinema's greatest agitprop moments - designed to defame the Imperial Regime by showing Cossak soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering men, women and children on a public staircase. De Palma re-stages the sequence in small scale, but puts his heroes in the position of the Tsarist Regime. Both scenes are designed to expose the fact that regimes have no moral compunction and will do anything (or have their foot-soldiers do anything) to hold onto power and control. What De Palma's sequence does is retain the propagandistic function of Eistenstein, but filters it through an ironic light. Here, The G-men are elevated to heroic status, and our mythologization of them legitimizes their actions. Likewise, both scenes feature imperilled baby carriages, but whilst Eisenstein's was threatened by Cossacks, De Palma's represents the psychology of Ness. Symbollically recalling the grieving mother and the dead child, the menaced baby represents the point where two Ness' converge; innocence and violence, public duty and moral responsibility. This scene, and the audience, then sanctions everything Ness does later.De Palma made \"The Untouchables\" after almost a decade of financial failure. A calculated crowd pleaser, the film then went on to become his biggest box office hit. The audience's love is disturbing, as the film is such a straight faced emulation of cheese-ball 30's pulp, no one reads it as a piece of pop-art propaganda, or in relation to \"Potempkin's\" anti-totalitarianism or even De Palma's early satires (Ness is the precursor to Tom Hanks' squeaky clean bastard in De Palma's \"Bonfire\").8/10 - Aesthetically the film is gorgeous (filled with beautiful compositions, architecture, elegant camera-work and a great score by Ennio Moriconne), but its style is too \"mainstream\" for hardcore De Palma fans, and writer David Mamet's minimalism and sharp prose are wasted on a baroque visualist like De Palma.",

Elliot Ness, a \"cop\" from the treasury department of the FBI is sent to make sure that Al Capone is brought to justice, but has trouble doing so. He seeks the help of Jim Malone, a worn-out beat cop, and a few others to take Capone out. They realize they have to stoop down to the level of the criminals in order to stop them, which of course leads to some cool gun fights and an interesting trial.For a Kevin Costner movie, it's not very long.

            "content": "The Untouchables has aged very badly... so badly, in fact, that Sean Connery as an Irishman is now the least chucklesome thing about it.Containing one of the most jarringly inappropriate soundtracks ever, the incredibly 80s incidental music stands out against the 1930s-set plot. DePalma's best film is obviously Scarface, perhaps closely followed by the cult Phantom of the Paradise. But while Scarface introduced the world to a shouty version of Al Pacino that never went away thereafter, here \"full scale\" performances are replaced by pure ham, DeNiro included. Astonishingly Ennio Morricone was behind the music, suggesting that everyone involved had a bad day.Oddly, there's never really any sense of danger in amongst the glib humour and very sanitised, Hollywood vision of the prohibition wars. Kevin Costner's Eliot Ness never really seems in any particular danger, and any detective work seems done via the easiest route possible. Ness wants to make some arrests, or shoot the bad guys? He does it, then on to the next scene. There's no real setbacks (other than the deaths of two of the Untouchables, obviously, though it's a little hard to take those parts seriously when Connery lives on for several minutes after being shot at least a dozen times by a machine gun).Writer David Mamet was involved with three other movies starring DeNiro, with We're No Angels, Wag The Dog and Ronin on his ledger, all of which range from mediocre to pretty good. This was also DeNiro's fourth film with DePalma, after three little-seen movies in the late 60s/early 70s. Both had better collaborations elsewhere.It's obvious that DePalma was stylistically trying to evoke westerns and noir, but having a stylistic conceit doesn't make it workable, whether intended or not... or maybe it's just that it's hard to take a gangster movie seriously when there's a wailing 80s sax behind it. A film like this needed to be gritty and realistic, not glossy homages to Eisenstein while what sounds like the theme tune to My Two Dads plays in the background.The Untouchables, largely based on a series of fabricated situations, isn't a BAD film. But neither is it a particularly good one, either.",

There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.That isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.Overall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The editing flows the film all together in the traditional film-noir manner, comprehending the film into an understandable experience and never losing grip of it's tone because of the good editing.

Both films were based upon brilliant and widely popular television series (by Desilu Productions), and each was highly anticipated by fans of those programs for many years. THE UNTOUCHABLES was the slickest piece of TV action drama that had ever been done. Besides the brilliant production design and the inspired idea of having Walter Winchell doing a voice-over narration, was the fine-tuned development of each and every character in the Eliot Ness Untouchables Team. By giving us a strong sense of their background and motivation we understood exactly why these men were \"untouchable\" that no bribe, death threat, intimidation, or anything else could deter their objective to bring down the mob.Brian dePalma's limp and pathetic imitation has the actors dressed up and saying, Oh, yeah! We're the untouchables; as they strut along like Sinatra's Ocean's 11. No character development or motivation to give any of them credibility. What follows is a travesty of a picture; including dePalma's \"tribute\" to Russia's director Sergi Eisenstein and his famous \"baby carriage scene\" in \"Battleship Potemkin.\" Equally pointless in Potemkin as in Untouchables, a runaway baby carriage just rolls right along, down a long outdoor flight of stairs, cutting thru the action. In Potemkin, it was silly enough; but in Untouchables, and knowing dePalma is doing his artsy-wartsy \"tribute\" it only raises one more howl to the parade of nonsense going down.I'd have paid ANYTHING to see this movie: $20, $50, whatever.

When Ness was given the assignment to bring down Capone . he mentioned a idea of a flying squad composed of nine honest men. Ness never wanted to head it up. but the situation in Chicago was so desperate. that they never gave it any chance of success and appointed Ness the leader. and right away Ness and his men went to work attacking Capone from the streets while the Government worked at getting Capone from the business level of not paying taxes Both teams did their job very well. and Ness and his boys stole the headlines when one paper called them THE UNTOUCHABLES .When Hollywood decided to remake the classic Robert Stack Series . they went with a script that took all the truth out of it. Gone were the historical facts . There was never a older Chicago cop who mentored Ness and the other Untouchables. The Role of James Malone wonderfully played by Sean Connery is a work of fiction. And Connery steals the show as the street cop with a heart of gold turned Federal agent. The entire idea of going to the academy to get a young rookie to help would have been laughed at in the 30s. George Stone would have been seen as too big of a risk for dangerous work like this. But Depalma and Connery and Costner and Gracia make it work. And third the Governemnt never sent an accountant to Chicago to work at it from a street level. but Charles Martin Smith makes his Oscar Wallace work so well that you don't mind the historical mistake. And no member of the Untouchables was ever killed by Capone . Only one member of the Untouchables outside circle was killed as a warning. Frank Basile who was the driver for Eliot Ness and helped the Untouchables in their work that Paul Robsky one of the last Untouchables called Basile a unofficial Untouchable.But still all the inaccurate information aside. The Untouchables is as great as a epic movie that you could ever hope to find. Kevin Costner plays a very human and very moral man pushed into a unthinkable situation in which he must stop the beast by working outside the law. Sean Connery steals the Movie . his James Malone is the honest beat cop with a heart of gold who is simply after 20 years on the beat trying to stay alive. Malone is a widower. He knows too much and he keeps his mouth shut. Because saying anything to the wrong people could get him killed at a second's notice. It's Ness who gives him the courage to go out and stop the monster that's ruling Chicago.Robert De niro is in fine form in one of his greatest roles Ever. Mention Deniro and chances are the untouchables is the first second or third movie mentioned. And for good reason as well He oozes evil and madness as Capone. As well as Charm. the real life Capone was charming and Deniro shows us to how charming he could be.Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith fill out the rest of the Untouchables. and do grand work. The Story is solid and the climatic shoot out in the Train Station is a work of art. Brian De palma has every right to be proud of that scene. Its not overly long but its a complicated scene which must have been a nightmare to film. But it holds together so well.Historical real life aside. The Untouchables is as great as it gets .My only hope is that next time they decide to do one closer to the truth. but until then I'll enjoy this one.",

            "content": "THE UNTOUCHABLES came out in an explosion of acclaim in 1987 with the critics hailing it as \" a masterpiece \" and \" An instant classic \" but after seeing the movie I was wondering if I'd been watching the same movie .My own theory as to why so many cynical movie critics liked it might have had something to do with the very poor standard of movies in the mid to late 80s which seemed to involve either teenagers getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways or a couple of well dressed cops pointing their guns while the billboard hot one hundred plays in the background . Off the top of my head I can think of only one movie from the same period that deserved much praise and that was PLATOON It could also be remembered that THE UNTOUCHABLES has a great cast list with DeNiro , Connery and a couple of rising stars in Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia , but the screenplay fails to focus on any one character . You do get the impression that it has been re-written to death in order to accommodate the big name stars . Personally I thought Capone should have been the main protagonist with Ness in the background with tough wily Irish cop Malone absent altogether . Maybe that was the intention with the original script but it had been changed with the casting coup involved ? Sticking one or two factual elements into the story would have helped too The more De Palma movies I see the more repetitive his directing techniques become . Long panning shots , slow motion sequences featuring bloody deaths . It was good in CARRIE but had become old hat hereOh and if it was such a great 1987 release how come it didn't get a massive load of Oscar nominations ?",

Di Niro as Capone seems to be doing a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit in a role that he was probably paid big bucks to do.The scene at the dinner when he makes those corny baseball analogies before caving in the skull of a fellow gangster with a baseball bat is thoroughly predictable and seems to be a leftover that never made its way into the equally bad \"Scarface\" a few years before this.This is not really a movie in the conventional sense. It plays more like a series of unrelated episodes strung together. It looks too clean, too perfect, kind of like a Hallmark greeting card.Di Palma-who practically made a career by ripping off Alfred Hitchcock eschews the Master this time and directly rips off the Odessa Steps sequence in Eisenstein's Potemkin when the baby carriage with its over age passenger rolls down the steps of the railroad station in the highly stylized gun fight, a sequence that you see coming before it actually happens. There are corrupt juries, gun duels, knife fights and more classic cars than you can shake a stick at, but these elements do not an engrossing film make. The overall amateurish quality of this film sabotages it from the outset. All you can do is stare at-and hope to get something meaningful from it. Shame on you David Mamet for this screenplay!

One more thing, you have an all out prize fight, you wait until the fight is over, one guy is left standing. And that's how you know who won.\" Kevin Costner stars as Ness, a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.A pretty amazing film by Scarface director Brian De Palma. One of De Palma's best although I still consider his epic film Scarface as his best film ever but still, this film delivers all the goods when it comes to the gangster genre. I can't really say that it was excellent because the script to me seems lacking and sometimes it suffers from plot holes and a cheesy, over the top death scene. It was a good death (I won't mention who dies for the sake of spoilers) but it was cheesy. Good, in a cheesy kind of way.Although, I think what made this film work was the superb acting by Class A Hollywood stars. You got Robert De Niro as Al Capone (the \"baseball\" scene is an instant favorite of mine), the guy never made a bad film according to my book. And in every film that he stars in, he gets better and better and better. De Niro is a method actor and The Untouchables just showed us how committed he really is to the job.On the other side of the law, you got Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who all gave pretty impressive performances.",

            "content": "Last time I watched The Untouchables was back in 2017, I have wanted to re-watch it for a while now and this was the right opportunity because of the sudden death of Sir Sean Connery. Seeing this movie for a second time makes me appreciate it even more, of the masterpiece and how memorable it is.The Untouchables is based on a true story, it's about Eliot Ness who's played by Kevin Costner and the squad he forms called Untouchables and their goal is to take down Al Capone that is brilliantly played by Robert De Niro. The ensemble is rightfully cast as everyone shines in their roles, it's one of the reasons why this is a movie you could re-watch multiple of times. This film is directed by the talented Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet, De Palma is a natural when it comes to making gangster movies as he have showed it with this film and Scarface, the vision he has and the direction he gives to the actors is amazing. There's also some great cinematography in this moving picture, with the camera angles and overall work mixed with the incredible sets just makes the immersion so much higher. The costume department was fantastic as well, truly capturing the 30's in Chicago. The musical score is another highlight in the movie, one of Ennio Morricone's finest works.I want to talk about the acting in this film, there's a lot of well known names. Like Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia. Sean Connery felt like a father figure to most of the cast, and so was his character to the others in The Untouchables. His performance gave him an Oscar for best supporting role, I don't know who else was nominated but if was a great performance but nothing really mind-blowing but worthy of it. Robert De Niro captured the character completely and delivered on point, great performance. Kevin Costner also gave one of his best performances but Sean Connery stole some scenes.The story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchables is an interesting one, a story you will find both entertaining and interesting. There's something for everyone, action sequences or drama. Many memorable character interactions and moments across the 120 minutes, a perfect length that will keep you satisfied and entertained from start to finish. An unforgettable movie!",

            "content": "After this little tiff, we get back to the killing. So who should we get rid of next? Why, Malone, of course! But wait..it's not that easy. You see, even if you sneak into his house and stealthily tiptoe up behind him, he can magically hear you, and will, at the last moment, whirl around with a shotgun. But silly Malone, he's just too nice. Instead of shooting you (as he should), he chases you out of his apartment, into the hallway, where my goodness there just happens to be another bad guy waiting, this time with a MACHINE GUN!! Now we see Malone get shot to pieces..but this bullet-riddled Scottish bad boy just doesn't feel like dying quite yet. No, he has to drag himself all the way to the back of his apartment (which leaves a nice, long, artistic trail of blood for Elliot to follow). Now does the b*****d die? NO! He just HAS to wait until Elliot shows up, so he can cough blood all over him and give him the last, vital clue (which I'm sure Elliot would never have found had he searched the apartment) and dramatically gasp, `What are you prepared to do?'...like I said, a walking clich\u00e9.Now we get to the REALLY good part. Yes, that's right, the infamous 'Train Station Shootout', where Elliot is attempting to get Al Capone's bookkeeper. At this point, we get to use lots and lots of camera angles, slow motion, and echo-y sounds in order to create, yet again, the 'artistic' effect. Here we go:The sequence begins with Elliot positioning himself on a platform above the stairs, and Stone going somewhere below him. Soon we get to see the clock. Then Elliot. Then the door. Then Elliot. Then a woman with a baby carriage, trying to go up the stairs below Elliot. Then the clock. Then Elliot.And so on.Just as the drama is beginning to get to be TOO MUCH..Elliot decides to be gallant and go help the stupid woman with the baby. So he drags the thing up the stairs (we've still got the slow motion and echo-y sound thing going on) and once he reaches the top, lo an behold, there's the bad guy. He shoots the bad guy. He shoots another bad guy. Stone magically appears and shoots a bad guy that was about to shoot Elliot but just didn't quite get the shot off. Meanwhile.the baby carriage has begun to roll down the stairs (in slow motion, of course). The plot thickens. So.Elliot starts to chase after it. Naturally. Meanwhile, he and Stone continue to nonchalantly mow down all the bad guys, one shot for each. Soon, Elliot has grabbed the baby carriage, but oh dear he's out of bullets. So here comes Stone, tossing him another gun (that he happened to have handy) while sliding- baseball style- in front of the baby carriage, just so it doesn't tip over.Wow. I don't know about you, but that's sounds like spectacular cinematography to me.(Let me just put this out in the open: The whole baby carriage nonsense WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED were it not for Elliot's ridiculous need to be a gentlemen at all times. If he had just let the lady struggle, she wouldn't have gotten up the stairs, and the stupid thing wouldn't have started rolling down again. Or better yet, he could have told her to get the hell out of the way..)Anyways, this whole shenanigan ends with the last remaining bad guy using the sniveling bookkeeper as a body shield, with a gun pressed firmly to his head. `Blah blah blah..if you don't let me get out of here, the bookkeeper dies' and so on. Elliot asks Stone in his most rugged voice, `Have you got him?' and Stone answers, `I got him.'..(a whole three words!!). This, of course, is referring to Stone's impeccable aim, even when he's lying on the floor, twenty yards from his target, leaning back and squinting really, really hard. Soon, the fat, blustery bad guy starts counting, but before he can even get to `Two', Mr. Stone goes, 'Bang!'. (I guess Georgie boy just doesn't have much patience)Now, instead of just letting the bad guy get his head blown off, or something normal like that, we're expected to believe that- get this- George Stone shot directly into Mr. Bad Guy's MOUTH.not only that, he also managed NOT to hit his lips, teeth, or any of the surrounding area. And as proof of this miraculous feat, we (as viewers) get to see blood come gushing out the fat guy's mouth. Lovely. And so believable, too.Cut to a close-up of the trembling bookkeeper's face. Yeah, that's right you little twerp, you better not mess with George Stone. He's a badass who can shoot people in the mouth.Don't you just love Hollywood?Following this delightful sequence of events, we begin to wrap things up. Dear Elliot and his pal Georgie head off to the courtroom, where they plan to pin tax evasion on Capone, with the help of his not so loyal bookkeeper. The trial commences, and things don't look too good for Capone. But gosh, something's just not right. Why is he smiling? Why is he.yawning?! Do you think...no, it couldn't be. He couldn't POSSIBLY have anything up his sleeve.Kevy (being the bright boy he is) figures out that something's up. Suddenly, he sees Capone's right-hand man- a guy by the name of Nitti- leaning over to talk to Al. And- gasp - he has a gun. Oh no, what's a boy to do.",

I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.  The way the little mousy guy kept referring to his tax problems... we all know that's how they brought him down, but they gave that away in the first 20 minutes!  And the music... terrible!  I actually perked up when I saw Ennio Morricone's name at the beginning because I loved his work in \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\".  But the director never used it to build suspense.  They didn't build any dramatic scenes with it, and when they did, he used all the wrong music.I am terribly disappointed with this movie.  I want my two hours of life back.

But this time I saw the whole thing. I just popped in the tape and watched the whole thing two weeks after I recorded it off of the AMC channel. Obviously there were commercials to fast forward through but I didn't care because whenever the movie would fade and go to a commercial, it kept me going wanting to press the two arrows pointing to the right (on the button). Every time a commercial would come, the suspense killed me! I could literally hear my heart thumping THUMP pause THUMP pause THUMP in the dead silence not even hearing the VCR fast forwarding. I actually wanted to fast forward through all the disgusting commercials. It was near Halloween when I recorded the movie meaning AMC had their traditional \"Monsterfest\" movies throughout the month of October. They showed the clip of the famous \"knife\" scene from the movie \"Carrie\" (Stephen King novel). Then showed the famous \"jumping\" scene from the John Carpenter classic \"Halloween\". Then a not so famous scene from the very disgusting movie (I could tell because the person had no skin but just bones, blood, muscles showing) Hellbound: Hellraiser II. That was one of the worst movies of all time besides the original \"Hellraiser\". Stupid, Stupid! Other movie clips shown were: \"Scream\" (1 and 2), \"Friday the 13\", another clip from \"Carrie\", and the horrible acted movie \"The Amityville Horror\" (original). Woops! I forgot! I need to be reviewing the movie. Let me shorten this a bit. This movie was basically trying to catch the notorious villain named Al Capone and the rest of his gang members. In the middle of trying to catch Al Capone and his gang members were many gruesome killings and many gunfights, and an interrogation. There was another very long scene where Kevin Costner's character Agent Elliot Ness has to help a lady bring her baby stroller and luggage up these steps to a train station but he also had to shoot some guys in the process. He shot a guy and then accidentally knocked the stroller over but his sidekick Andy Garcia's character Giuseppe Petri (Agent George Stone fake name) saves it just in time. This movie also includes a chase on rooftops of many buildings until finally a member of Capone's gang gets pushed off one of the building's rooftops. Okay, why did I like this movie so much? Well, mainly because Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors. I also think Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro did a great job in this movie as well. Andy Garcia was okay in this and so was everyone else besides Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert DeNiro. I also thought the story was quite entertaining and suspenseful. The cinematography was excellent which was directed by Stephen H. Burum, A.S.C. and the music was also excellent which was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Ennio Morricone. Even though this movie was violent and had some blood and gore, that doesn't mean you can't see it. Since I had the cut version (taped from AMC which cuts out every little thing), it wasn't as bad as if I had the uncut version. I still thought it was violent but I could tell they cut out a few swear words. I know if a movie like this has a person that says \"darn\" or \"goodness\" or \"golly\" and has all this blood and gore, there is something wrong with the makers of the movie!

            "content": "Paraphrasing Jimmy Malone, I would say that Brian De Palma's \"Untouchables\" fulfilled the basic rules of cinematic entertainment. But when a film had so many natural predispositions for greatness, this isn't saying much.First, the strengths. The costume design and the restitution of the 30's Chicago is so authentic that some beautiful panoramic shots make you feel like traveling back to the prohibition years, on that level, the film is the triumph of meticulous perfectionism and sense of detail conceded even by the most virulent detractors. The direction works, though trying sometimes to impress with unnecessary dizzying shots. De Palma, after all, proved to be a great director for such intense films as \"Carrie\" or \"Scarface\", with his unique ability to oscillate between calm and suspenseful moments to extraordinarily effective outburst of bloody violence, conveyed by the beautiful part-thrilling part-haunting score by Ennio Morricone. The movie was handled by professionals who knew their business and had everything to be one of the best.But it needed one thing: a script, a kick-ass one with the guts and the energy that Oliver Stone masterfully injected in the veins of \"Scarface\". The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the \"You're not from Chicago\" coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking \"God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness!\" By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with \"Robert De Niro is Al Capone\", this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success : one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of \"The Untouchables\" is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables : Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone\".The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge \"Once Upon a Time in America\". I simply hope that those who criticize \"The Untouchables\" for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at \"Scarface\" with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? \"Miller's Crossing\" is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch \"The Untouchables\" instead, anytime.",

            "content": "Untouchables, The (1987) **** (out of 4) DePalma's suspenseful tale of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and his untouchables (Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia) trying to bring Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) to justice in 1930's Chicago. It's strange what time can do for a film as it can either help or hurt it and in the case of this film it really seems to have helped it a great deal. I first saw this movie in the early 90's and found it rather weak and the next viewing didn't help much either. Now, being more than fifteen years, I decided to pay the film another visit and this time it really hit me as to why so many have called it as masterpiece. I still wouldn't call it DePalma's greatest film but it's certainly right up there and I couldn't help but wish we'd get this director back to making films like this. The film has a lot going for it but we can start with the visual style, which is at times breathtaking. DePalma has always been known for his style and that mixes extremely well with the scenes of early Chicago. Another major plus is a wonderful music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The score really puts you in the time and place of the setting but it also does a great job at pumping up the action as well as building the suspense. The train station sequence is one of the most memorable in the film but try watching it without the volume and without the score. It certainly isn't the same. Another major plus are the performances by the all-star cast. Costner is at the top of his game as the laid back ness and that's what makes Connery's performance so great. The two are completely different but together they make for an excellent team and you can't blame Oscar voters for awarding Connery the Best Supporting Actor. Garcia and Charles Martin Smith never get the credit they deserve but they too offer up fine work. I'm rather split on DeNiro because the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice as Capone seems to just be dropped into the film from time to time without any real need. I'm really not even sure we had to see Capone for the story to work. The film is rather brutal, violent and at times very suspenseful and this is why it remains so memorable today.",

            "content": "Upon its release a film critic commented that calling The Untouchables the best gangster film since The Godfather II is not saying much. As there have been hardly any good gangster films since Coppola's sequel.Brian De Palma known as a visually interesting but flawed director got a rather campy television series and made a bravado film filled with his visual touches. It is inspired by his love of Hitchcock and meshed it with an artful gangster thriller scripted by David Mamet.Kevin Costner plays the boy scout Elliot Ness in Prohibition era Chicago who is initially humiliated. After meeting beat cop Malone (Sean Connery) he assembles a team of Untouchables to take down Al Capone (Robert De Niro) for tax evasion.The film looks terrific. De Palma excelled in the art direction, the stage setting, costumes and photography. There is a bombastic and at times cheesy score by Ennio Morricone (just hear those sentimental tunes each time Mrs Ness appears.)Yet the film hits bulls eye despite some hokiness. De Niro plays Capone as camp and loud. Each appearance is a set piece, whether he holds court with the press, cries at the opera or beats someone up with a baseball bat.De Niro apparently had each hair in his head individually plucked in order to have Capone's moon face look.Sean Connery dominates as the Irish cop Malone teaching the street smarts to the green Ness on how to take down crime 'the Chicago way.' Yet this is a cop with a Scots accent and who can forget the line: '...brings a knife to a gunfight' before being shot a thousand times.Andy Garcia gives a star making performance as the cool rookie and sharpshooter George Stone. Charles Martin Smith almost steals the film as the meek agent Oscar Wallace whose idea it was to go after Capone for tax fraud.There are spectacular set pieces such as the homage to Battleship Potemkin with the pram and baby descending down the steps.The film is a good blend of action, humour and violence that stands up as a classic 30 years later. De Palma makes sure that the violence is not as overpowering as in his previous gangster film Scarface. He behaved himself here and this is probably his most accomplished film.De Palma would once more return to adapt an old television series in the 1990s when he made Mission Impossible a film series that still continues to this day.",

            "content": "At the heart of the matter, \"The Untouchables\" is a comic book put on screen: Its characters are one-dimensional; its storyline abounds with convenience and clich\u00e9. But the full commitment of its principals on both sides of the camera makes this riveting all the same.Chicago in 1930 is a \"city at war.\" A gang boss named Al Capone (Robert De Niro) holds court in a barber chair, explaining he is only supplying a need. \"What is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality.\" But Prohibition is the law of the land, and when Capone's ways of breaking that law include blowing up buildings and killing little girls, it's time for U. S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to step in.Director Brian De Palma was slumming when he made this film, according to a DVD documentary. Maybe that was the secret; he didn't press so hard. The film exists as a series of set pieces, much like other De Palma films, and the attention to stylistic visuals and atmospherics are there. But this time he lets the story breathe a bit more, giving you something to care about or laugh at between what amounts to an exhausting amount of carnage.How bloody is this film? There's one cast member listed in the credits as \"Gunned Head.\" Good luck finding him, too.Iconography is everything in De Palma films. Here he not only quotes from other directors, but develops some iconography of his own, like a famous moment when Capone expounds at length about his love for baseball and another when Ness is told about \"The Chicago Way\" by an older cop named Malone (Sean Connery): \"He sends one of yours to the hospital, you sent one of his to the morgue.\" One shootout scene in a railroad terminal managed to both quote a famous film (\"The Battleship Potemkin\") and become uniquely famous on its own.The body count is matched only by the clich\u00e9 count. Every pavement is slick with rain. A dying man imparts important information to a friend with his last breath. A couple of bottles happen to be standing on a building ledge just so they can explode in sequence in the middle of a gun battle. Ness actually tells someone he'll see Capone in hell.Many reviewers here criticize Kevin Costner as Ness. Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of \"The Untouchables'\" strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of \"The Untouchables,\" but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success.",

            "review_title": "De Palma and Mamet craft a brilliant gangster picture with modern day sensibilities.",
            "content": "A commercial and artistic high point for director Brian De Palma (\"Blow Out\" \"Dressed to Kill\" \"Scarface\" \"Femme Fatale\"), working from a script by David Mamet (\"House of Games\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" \"Heist\" etc.) and featuring Kevin Costner in his breakout star making performance as prohibition era crime fighter Eliot Ness. There's little historical accuracy to the film, but who really cares about that when there is so many other things to love about the film. Besides the above mentioned assets, you have an incredibly strong cast led by Coster as an idealistic Ness, who's joined by honest beat cop Jim Malone, a wonderfully over-the-hill Sean Connery, a rookie cop recruited straight from the Academy who hasn't been corrupted yet (\"If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.\") played by a young Andy Garcia (\"8 Million Ways to Die\" was his only other major credit before this), and capped off by Robert De Niro packing on a ton of weight to play Chicago gangster Al Capone. Incidentally, De Niro started his career with director Brian De Palma well before he made \"Mean Streets\" with Martin Scorsese, so it's a treat to see the two reunite. Besides the strong leads, you also have Charles Martin Smith, Richard Bradford, Billy Drago, Patricia Clarkson, Del Close, and even Clifton James (the tobacco chewing sheriff from \"Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Live and Let Die\") all in memorable parts, so it really is a cast to die for. In addition to a sharp script, an amazing cast, you have some serious talent behind the camera that includes cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (\"Rumble Fish\" \"Carlito's Way\" \"Hoffa\"), composer Ennio Morricone (\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" \"The Mission\" \"The Hateful Eight\"), set decoration by the guy who's everything from Disney's \"Mary Poppins\" to \"Back to the Future,\" and the editor of \"The French Connection\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Scarface,\" but the real hero behind the camera is director Brian De Palma. The sets, costumes, music, and overall period atmosphere are amazing, but it's the visual stylistics from De Palma that make this film a classic. Without spoiling anything, the Pagliacci scene and the Sergei Eisenstein inspired baby carriage scene are moments of pure cinema (meaning they are scenes that would be impossible to capture or recreate as effectively in another medium. Not written word, not painting, not stage play, not graphic novel, etc.). Although a major studio film, this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma picture. \"The Untouchables\" is minus his usual obsessions around voyeurism and sexuality, but the film does have his trademark fascination with violence (\"They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!\"), guilt/betrayal (most all of the characters are motivated by some form of guilt), as well as his many visual hallmarks (camera zooms, slow motion, and memorable POV shots). De Palma's fingerprints are all over the film, especially the \"Battleship Potemkin\" inspired train station shootout with a baby carriage bouncing down marble steps amongst a hail of slow motion gunfire. According to Mamet, the scene was not in the original script and was added by De Palma, but this particular scene ends up being the most memorable of the film. It's De Palma's signature suspenseful build-up that makes the scene so effective. In lesser hands, this 10-minute sequence might have been a straight forward shootout, but with De Palma it achieves operatic levels, with about a dozen moving parts all contributing to mounting suspense as he turns the screws on the audience, stretching out about 10 seconds of real time action into a two minute slow motion action masterpiece. Whether it's a bucket of pigs blood above Carrie's head or Tom Cruise trying to catch a bead of sweat, De Palma builds suspense better almost anyone. What makes \"The Untouchables\" different from many of his other films is its emotional center, which comes from an earnest performance by Coster and Mamet's carefully plotted script. Many of De Palma's films seem at times mere exercises in cinematic stylistics and explorations of his various obsessions, but his best films have an emotional center, which I would say are \"Carrie,\" \"Blow Out,\" \"Casualties of War,\" \"Carlito's Way,\" and this film. Overall, from the the stylish opening credits to the soaring finale, \"The Untouchables\" doesn't have a single false note. This is the film that De Palma will be remembered for and deserves to be recognized as a true American film classic. SIDE NOTE: Rewatching the film 2018, I was struck by how \"1980\" this otherwise very authentic looking period film seemed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what made it seem such a product of it's time, but I think it came down to the cinematography, with the use of hazy lighting, but still, I'm not quite sure what made this period picture seem so 80s.",

They quickly make progress, intercepting illicit alcohol and more importantly arresting somebody with information that could bring Capone down... this puts them in the sights of Capone's gunmen.This fictionalised version of how Elliot Ness brought down Al Capone is a lot of fun with great characters and some fairly gritty action. This action includes a young girl killed by a bomb and Capone killing somebody with a baseball bat as well as numerous shootings. The cast does a fine job with Kevin Costner putting in a relatively low-key performance as Ness which contrasts nicely Robert DeNiro's bombastic Capone. There are also notable performances from Sean Connery who is fun as Irish cop Malone despite his obviously Scottish accent.

There are loads of films depicting this time in history, but not all of them are nearly as fun as this. A federal agent vows to bring down the legendary kingpin Al Capone where an experienced police officer teaches the agent how to beat the mob. It's just the classic story of good versus evil. Law against crime. The beauty of such a simple premise allows the ability to have rich characters and an absorbing world. The production values are off the charts, this truly felt like Chicago and the costumes were authentic. Whilst the story as a whole is not particularly memorable, the film is built up on set pieces to keep the viewer enthralled. A great example would be a shootout in a train station where a baby in a pram is slowly falling down some stairs. That, is what I will remember. Acting was solid all round, Costner and De Niro were great however it was the legendary Sean Connery that made me smile. He is such a natural talent on screen, his charisma just shines through instantaneously. The character Eliot Ness' development was well executed where he starts to take the law into his own hands towards to the end. I would've liked to have seen Al Capone being used more in the film, but I fully realise that he got his henchmen to do the dirty work which is fine. Also admired one scene where Brian DePalma switches to a POV shot of a man sent to kill a police officer. Slyly moving throughout the house, I thought it was a creative method. The level of violence is hit and miss and sometimes borders on cheap but for the most part it was gritty and exciting to watch. The Untouchables is definitely one of the most entertaining films of its genre and I can easily imagine myself watching it again soon.",

The Untouchables looks like a very slick classy classic. It is not. It is cheap, with painfully dumb scripts and dumber acting, of course followed up by Sean Connery's 'i'm a great wise guy actor' role. This is film is insulting to intelligence. One minute, they will be busting speak easys in the heart of chicago, then it will cut to them on horseback somewhere in the West, foiling an alcohol import.

Go ahead if you like, but prepare to switch off. If you want to see a movie unrecognized, but is truly magnificent, and in my opinion thee most underrated movie of all time i urge you to see Contact. Do not be put off by its IMDb rating, in fact don't bother looking just see it. TRUST ME THat was by ultrajagger1. BUT THE BOTTOM IS BY ME!THE MOVIE IS OUT OF THE TOp 250 AND RIGHTFULLY SO, it Stinks!",

            "content": "The historical novel format in literature is a popular way to tell a fictional story against the background of real events that actually happened. This type of format can be very entertaining in the medium of film also provided that producers and directors are honest with the audience and do not deliberately mislead viewers into thinking they are watching something that resembles real history.The problem of unintentional misrepresentation could have been easily solved in this film if there had been a simple disclaimer statement at the start of the movie to warn viewers they are watching fiction, not history. The Untouchables is a very entertaining and skillfully produced film that succeeds wonderfully in offering viewers an enjoyable movie and memorable characters such as the fictional police officer played by Sean Connery. But at the same time the film fails miserably to offer the necessary warning that it is only a work of fiction.It is just plain wrong to imply that this film is even \"loosely based\" on real events or people. The screenplay by writer David Mamet is almost completely fictional. It is not based on the 1957 book with the same title authored by Elliot Ness and Oscar Fraley or the 1959 TV series starring the late Robert Stack as Ness which followed the book a little bit in its first season. This film has no more connection to the original book than the recent Steve Martin fictional \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" has to the original 1940s book by Ernestine Gilbreth. The title is the same and that is all.Except for using the names of a few people who really lived, there is almost nothing in this film that remotely tracks real historical events that happened in Chicago between the formation of a special Treasury Department task force called \"The Untouchables\" in January 1930 and the federal trial of Alphonse Capone in October 1931. As long as viewers understand that it is fiction, most people will find the characters enjoyable and the action exciting.Movie fans can enjoy this film at the level of entertainment alone and not worry about the bad history but for one problem where the first defect also intrudes on the acting. Most of the characters seem real enough and Sean Connery gives a fine performance. But unfortunately the characterization of Al Capone by Robert DeNiro is that of a cartoon character.Here is where the historical dishonesty interferes with the entertainment value of the film because DeNiro makes a ruthless gangster seem almost appealing as a warm and fuzzy colorful character. Make no mistake, the real Al Capone was an amoral monster who ordered the murder of many people who got in his way and civilians were hurt also. He was not colorful or clever as DeNiro portrayed him. The worst slander of the film and its artistic defect as well is a dramatic climax in which Elliot Ness murders Frank Nitti for revenge by tossing him off the roof of the Federal Court House in 1931. The real Frank Nitti died 12 years later in 1943 at the hands of fellow gangsters on Chicago's west side. There was no motive for revenge by Ness since there was no Sean Connery character in real life.Writer David Mamet grew up in Cook County and presumably knows local history. So it is hard to see why he chose to so severely distort historical events to provide him with a dramatic crutch for his convoluted plot device. The real Elliot Ness was a fine law enforcement man who later became Chief of Police in Cleveland, Ohio and he never murdered anyone in cold blood.Many entertaining movies take great liberties with history for the sake of dramatic impact. There is nothing wrong with that by itself just as long as producers are honest about what they are doing and the audience members do not walk away from the film thinking that they now know the true history of an era.",

He managed to assemble a top drawer cast to tell his story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and The Untouchables quest to stem crime in Chicago during prohibition and bring down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro).Eliot Ness is appointed by the FBI to coordinate efforts to stop the corruption and crime in 1930 Chicago. His first raid is a disaster, the crooks having been warned by corrupt police officials led by Police Chief Mike Dorsett (Richard Bradford). Ness despondent over his failure has a chance meeting with honest cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and asks him to join him. Reluctant at first, Malone eventually decides to join Ness' crusade. FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned to Ness and discovers that Capone hasn't paid any income taxes for several years. Rounding out the team is gung ho police rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia).When Ness refuses a bribe form a city alderman, the alderman gives the group it's name, \"The Untouchables\". The group begins to raid known liquor warehouses with great success. Capone meanwhile, disciplines one of his men with a baseball bat. The boys, with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) foil the smuggling of bootleg liquor across the border. Malone's \"questioning\" of one of the crooks is memorable.Capone now begins to take Ness seriously and orders him killed. Wallace is gunned down while transporting a prisoner. Malone learns that Capone's accountant, who has all of the names and places of public officials on the take, will be leaving town by train. In one of the film's most memorable sequences, Ness goes after the bookkeeper. As the shooting begins, a baby carriage with a baby inside begins to roll down a steep staircase and....................................Although Kevin Costner made a convincing Eliot Ness, he was up against some powerful performances. Connery literally steals the picture as the honest Irish cop. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts. De Niro eats up the screen as Capone ans Charles Martin Smith is excellent as the accountant turned G-Man. Andy Garcia was just emerging as a major player and holds his own with this high level talent.At the border crossing sequence, Ness refers to the leader of the Mounties as \"Captain\". I would be remiss, if I didn't mention the fact that there are NO Captains in the RCMP (there's called Inspectors) and they don't all speak with Englisg accents....and they DO have police cars.One of the all time great gangster pictures.",

            "content": "Arguably one of Brian de Palma's best films, THE UNTOUCHABLES tells the stories of Al Capone and Elliot Ness, both men who were on the opposite sides of the law during the Prohibition years. With a beginning that literally explodes (and is a homage or rip-off or both to the key scene in Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE), De Palma weaves his tale around the eventual moment these two men's lives will dovetail even when such a thing never happened in reality; however, the story is so well done up until that moment that you walk out of the movie thinking both men had that one moment where they told each other off. And that's again, the power of storytelling -- to tell a story with fictitious elements in a way that will make you believe such a thing has happened. With one of the mose masculine characters ever committed on screen during the Eighties and a readily identifiable screenplay by David Mamet, THE UNTOUCHABLES should have taken Brian De Palma's film career to even higher levels -- more so with Sean Connery's Oscar win -- but somehow his career went on a rapid decline. He went on to direct the awful and chaotic THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, the confusing but intriguing RAISING CAIN, and the so-so CARLITO'S WAY, only to make a slight rebound with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and SNAKE EYES before plummeting again with MISSION TO MARS. However, if at all, and for anyone who enjoys De Palma's liberal borrowing from cinematic masters such as Hichcock and Eisenstein, this is a great movie to watch, particularly for its breathtaking sequence at the train station where Ness' and Capote's men have a fantastic face-off as a baby carriage careens out of control in the midst, barely avoiding bullets.",

            "content": "Without a doubt, Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is one of the favorite movies to come from this decade. As someone who intensively studied the Prohibition era and the legend that is Al Capone, I knew this film would be up my alley. Add in Brian De Palma as director and Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, and Robert De Niro as the film's leads, you cannot go wrong right? In my own humble opinion, that is correct. I really loved the film so much, I was surprised to see how many lukewarm reviews it received (although it still received generally high marks from critics and regular folks alike).\nWhy does this film speak to me so much? Firstly, the film has an authentic look and feel. The streets of Chicago were perfectly embroidered with 1930's era cars, clothes, buildings, etc. The costume design from Marilyn Vance is impeccable, along with the production design of the sets which was put together by Hai Gausman. I loved the shiny, sleek feel of everything. Secondly, the man behind Dressed to Kill and Scarface was behind the camera. He brought the same kind of energy and style to this story. Some critics complain the film is stylistic...well, yes it is! De Palma's style. Thirdly, the performances especially from Sean Connery are fantastic! Say what you will about Connery's accent, but he nailed the role of Jimmy Malone. Fourthly, Ennio Morricone. Need to say anymore?\nThe film was written by David Mamet, who at the time was a famous playwright. His script has been criticized by his peers for not containing a point or anything meaningful to say about the story. I think the script is conventional and that is a good thing the story is told that way. His script also contained from powerful, masterful lines of dialogue. When Malone is offering his services to Ness for the first time, I loved his line about how Ness just made a blood oath. Also, individual scenes work incredibly well. The shootout at the bridge on the Canadian border is an all-timer. That scene exhibited incredible amounts of energy and I loved what Connery did to one of Capone's dead guys. You'll notice what I mean when you watch that scene.\nEliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is a young, incorrigible treasury agent who wants to take down the notorious gangster, Al Capone (Robert De Niro). With most of the police force in Capone's pockets, it will be a very hard if not impossible task for Ness. He receives some much-needed help when veteran, hard-nosed Irish cop, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) pledges his help to take down Capone. He does warn him that once he begins the war, Capone won't stop until they are all dead. They realize they have to be mindful in their recruitment, so they hire academy cadet George Stone (Andy Garcia) and IRS agent Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) to join the team. Once the war begins, Capone finds himself unable to touch these men hence the term \"The Untouchables.\" Violence is used from both sides, but there could be something called tax evasion which may be Capone's ultimate downfall.\nThe performances are excellent and well-rounded. Connery and Costner had excellent chemistry together. The film heralds the beginning of the success Costner would have for the next 7 or 8 years. His character is self-serious and wants to work within the law, but Costner kept the role of Ness from being too dry. Connery is the real winner here, and his performance gave him his only Oscar. I loved his gritty, hard-nosed attitude ready to kill at any moment. Despite his Scottish accent being entirely too noticeable, I can set that aside because his performance is just too darn good. I am surprised I could call De Niro's performance underrated, but people do not give as much credit to his hammy, showy performance. He certainly hams it up, but he is certainly having fun playing this historical legend. He actually gained thirty pounds for this role, which certainly gave him an interesting look. Finally, Garcia and Smith delivered fine supporting performances to round up Ness's team.\nThe Untouchables is not only a violent story about the takedown of Capone, who was in charge of Chicago's booze during Prohibition, but it is also a story about redemption and relationships. This is one of the reasons why the film was able to attract more female viewers when it was showing in theatres (I believe it was a 50/50 split). Morricone is a music legend, and he crafted another memorable, uplifting score. He can manipulate my emotions all he wants. The look of the film is historically accurate and gorgeous. Sean Connery stole the show with one of his best career performances. I loved learning about Al Capone and the movie tells the story in a stirring, beautiful way!\nMy Grade: A+",

Also, Kevin Costner's acting was terrible, as always; Ness' 'team' was extremely lame, and the scene with the baby on the staircase was just asinine. Malone's death was the most ridiculous overly dramatic death scene I have ever seen and was to this movie what Billy Preston's \"You Are So Beautiful\" was to Carlito's Way: The rock-bottom part of the film; (except for the fact that Carlito's Way was actually halfway decent compared to this hyped up garbage they call a 'good film').

            "content": "\"The Untouchables\" is reckoned as one of the kingpins in Brian De Palma's filmography by the insiders and his devotees. I would tend to agree with them and to be conducive about this general contention with however certain reservations.This transposition of the well-known TV series is surely one of his less personal works. His obsessions with Sir Alfred Hitchcock take a back seat and we're quite far from the thriller genre with grisly, bloody effects which helped to build the filmmaker's reputation. Actually, \"the Untouchables\" appears as formulaic in the presentation of events: Chicago during Prohibition under the control of the underworld with its main leader Al Capone, here acted by Robert De Niro whose performance is however less startling than in \"Angel Heart\" (1987) by Alan Parker, released the same year. A young fresh FBI agent Elliott Ness (Kevin Costner) rises up against him and has a yearning to make him fall. After a failed police raid in Capone's warehouses, he teams up with a seasoned cop, Malone (Sean Connery) and hires a band of volunteers who share his same determinations and then their hopes soar. But some members are killed including Malone. This doesn't help Ness's men to arrest Capone's accountant and his financial registers...It's sure that De Palma wanted to remain as close as possible to the historic reality. It seems that everything in the film from the scenery to the making was recreated to capture the stifling atmosphere of the Prohibition and the spirit of the film noir in the thirties but the contents of the film is very classic as a whole. And it's often aggravated by a streak to excessive effects, one of De Palma's main drawbacks. Visual excesses which are mostly present in shoot-out and fight sequences like Malone's slow death. Ditto at another level for Ennio Morricone's majestic but overwhelming music. But once again and like in some De Palma's works, the rumbustious form compensates the contents despite bombastic tendencies. Three seminal sequences would deserve to be legion in the filmmaker's canon: the western sequence with the Canadian mounted police, Malone's death, the arrest of the accountant by Ness in a shoot-out sequence doubled with a wink to Eisenstein's masterpiece \"the Battleship Potemkine\" (1926).It's rather acceptable stuff but I favor Phil Karlson's terse style on the same domain with \"the Scarface Mob\" (1959).",

The first is when Robert De Niro's Al Capone decides to take batting practice on one of the members of his Chicago mob. I guess the guy wasn't a team player. The other occurred in the latter half of the story, usually described as the baby carriage scene, and which may itself have been inspired by the 1925 silent film, \"Battleship Potemkin\". What I find incredible is that I've just watched these two movies back to back, and am constantly amazed when my viewing experience offers moments of cosmic serendipity like this kind of coincidence. For the reader who might not know what I'm talking about, you'll recognize the events if you see both films, and you don't have to do it the way I did. The scenes stand out in a way that makes them memorable whenever you watch the films.If I was casting this picture, I wouldn't have chosen Charles Martin Smith to play Agent Oscar Wallace. Smith has the type of face and demeanor that calls for roles like the ones he's portrayed in \"American Graffiti\" and \"The Buddy Holly Story\". Be that as it may, he did a credible job as part of the Untouchables team. Another scene that's a grabber occurred when beat-cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery) 'killed' a dead man to convince a potential snitch that he should testify against Boss Capone. That was a daring ploy that worked pretty well.The one thing I wish film makers and script writers would avoid is denying historical facts when coming up with a story line. Here I'm thinking about the death of Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) as established in the movie, a major departure from the real event. Nitti actually committed suicide, despondent over indictments handed down for extorting the Hollywood film industry to avoid union problems while filming. The 'accidental' death of Nitti shown in the film may have added to the drama of a dedicated Eliott Ness (Kevin Costner), but if you know the real story, something like that only makes you groan.",

Sean Connery's turn is cardboard, and this is not one of Andy Garcia's career makers, either. De Niro's portrayal is a direct lift from Rob Steiger's of the same character in a pre-De Palma version of \"Scarface\" called \"Al Capone\" (1959). Costner made more sense in \"JFK\" (which was another stretch).Compared to any of Curtiz's, Coppola's, Scorcese's or the Coen Brother's gangster epics, this is old school comic book stuff that looks pretty thin stacked up against work like \"Public Enemy\" (1931, not 2009), \"Angels With Dirty Faces,\" \"The Roaring Twenties,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"Miller's Crossing,\" \"Goodfellas\" or \"Casino.\"But I can understand why it works for some people: Big-name stars, good production values, manipulative tear-jerker scenes when good guys are killed, retribution and revenge, bullets and blood spraying.

            "content": "None of the TV channels seem to rerun episodes of the superior 1960s series, \"The Untouchables,\" with Robert Stack as Elliot Ness. If they did, no explanation of who the untouchables were would be necessary.They were a small group of hand-picked agents from the Department of the Treasury, supposedly \"untouchable\" because they were shrimp pink and incorruptible. Their primary job was to battle Al Capone and, shortly after his being sent up the river, Frank Nitti in Chicago. The whole city was more than ordinarily corrupt during and after prohibition. After all, bootleg booze brought in a lot of money and, as Lord Acton should have said, money corrupts and absolute money corrupts absolutely.Here we have Kevin Costner as the idealistic but naive Elliot Ness who recruits his honest first lieutenant, Sean Connery, whom he finds walking a beat on the Chicago streets. Connery is a crusty old battle horse. His advice to Kostner goes something like this: \"If your enemy brings fists to a fight, you bring a knife. If he brings a knife, you bring a gun. If he brings a gun, you send him to the morgue.\" Curiously enough, this particular line has been taken up and used in current arguments about conflicts with nations like Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Seriously. Connery helps Kostner get his act together. They hire an as-yet-untouched recruit from the police academy, Andy Garcia, and the team is sent an appointment from the Treasury Department, Charles Martin Smith, a pipe-smoking begoggled accountant seconded from Book Keeping who finds himself turned into a hero.Al Capone is played in an operatic style by Robert DeNiro, who enacts a tactic for imposing his will that is borrowed from Nicholas Ray's \"Party Girl.\" DeNiro is fine. He is apoplectic when Ness confronts him in a hotel lobby and challenges him to a fist fight. The team is triumphant but the happy ending is tempered by the terrible losses. The plot and dialog are effective in capturing a particular, brutal sort of masculine world. The only family we see is Ness's and it's used to pump up the threat quotient. Hardly any friends exist outside the cohesive group itself. There's a recurring refrain -- \"It's good to be married, right?\" -- and we must accept that it is because Ness's family dynamics are flawless. None of the other three members of the team seem to have families.With one notable exception, \"Casualties of War,\" Brian De Palma's movies irritate me to a greater or lesser extent. Too much Hitchcock. At some point, \"homage\" must turn into \"shameless rip off.\" Of course the suspenseful techniques work, otherwise Hitchcock wouldn't have become Hitchcock.Yet, it's still distracting when we see a point-of-view shot of an assassin approaching Sean Connery's apartment. The camera peeks through the windows as it follows Connery along the hallway, but when the camera steps on a board and it makes a creaking sound, causing Connery to glance at the window, the camera quickly slides to the side and hides against the brick wall. In a long take, the camera (that is, let me repeat, the killer and the viewer) open a window, glide through, and examine each room in the apartment until it and we and he discover Connery and he turns and aims a shotgun at he, we, and it. Holy Saint Jude -- enough is enough! That long and unprovoked point-of-view sequence would have been disdained by Hitchcock. The sources here are unquestionably the horror and slasher movies of the period, such as \"Friday the Thirteenth.\" There is another long, largely slow-motion sequence at Union Station involving a baby carriage bouncing down the stairs. The director's sources are getting classier. This one is no less than Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potyemkin.\"I'm having a little fun at the movie's expense but, as these things go, it's effectively done. A nicely put-together action thriller about a real historical group of tough cops who got the job done. If it's not entirely historically correct, so what? All stories of good and evil are partly fantasies. Relax and enjoy it.",

I can go out about certain directorial techniques that annoyed me, but when I saw the Canadian border raid and all of the agents on horseback miraculously dodging bullets, I wanted to become invisible. I WAS EMBARRASSED! I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN WATCHING IT!The shoot-out on the steps with the baby carriage was straight out of film history 101 - a rip-off of the classic Odessa Steps scene from \"Potemkin\". The opening scene with DeNiro as Capone getting a shave was a rip-off of the famous shave scene in \"Key Largo\".I seem to recall it was promoted as being more true to the historical record than previous (and MUCH better) productions with the same name, and that's why I wanted to see it. Also, I'd really liked \"Scarface\", so I thought this would be pretty good. WRONG!I'm not going to pick this apart, but:1. Al Capone was YOUNG. He did the majority of his \"work\" in his 20's. By the time he was DeNiro's age he'd already died of syphillis.2. Frank Nitti was NOT thrown off a rooftop by Eliot Ness. He committed suicide rather than do time in prison.3. Eliot Ness was not the squeaky clean and honest law man he's portrayed as being in this film. At least the Robert Stack characterization was more entertaining (he used to say he didn't act, but RE-acted to the various characters in the show).4. Shall I go on?If you want to see an entertaining movie on gangland Chicago, watch the original Untouchables pilot, \"Scarface Mob\", with the great Neville Brand as Capone (okay, he's too old too, but a LOT more entertaining!). It set the tone for the whole series, nearly any episode of which is infinitely better than this bloated piece by DePalma. It's not really historically accurate, but it did get the mob upset enough to put a hit on Desi Arnaz (it's a Desilu production). And it's full of little touches that really make it fun to watch. NO ONE does Frank Nitti better than Bruce Gordon.Oh yeah, Connery was ok, and I guess he was due an Oscar for something, but how this performance or this movie could compare to any of his 007 performances escapes me. His role seemed gratuitous, but his friends who had the votes in the Academy didn't show it if they felt that way themselves.Oh well, I guess I'm in the minority on this one. Sigh...",

This is a solid, though largely fictionalized account of the indictment of Al Capone (DeNiro) and the events leading up to it, headed by Eliot Ness (Costner).  It is a compelling film, and is extremely well-paced.  Though not in the `typical' De Palma style (unusual camera angles, point of view camera work, etc.) `The Untouchables' is slick and stylish with some great Chicago locations.  I did, however see a couple of the little Alfred Hitchcock-esque touches he has given several of his films; most notably in the scene with the baby carriage in Union Station (similar to the Jimmy Stewart `falling scene' in `Rear Window'.)I was surprised to see that David Mamet had written the screenplay because the script didn't have the regular Mamet `punch' to it, but I wouldn't call that a criticism as much as an observation.  On the other hand, the musical score by Ennio Morricone is something to rave about \u0096 it helped to contribute intensity to some scenes and to express the strength of character that Ness and his `Untouchables' possess.  `The Untouchables' is certainly not my favorite gangster film, but it is a solid one, and very entertaining.--Shelly",

            "content": "I'll preface this by saying that I'm not typically in the habit of \"calling\" anything out, especially a film, but it has just come down to that.So I purchase a lot of movies before i've seen them, typically based on praise I'd formally heard or read, or a film whose concepts just gripped me from a trailer or a brief synopsis. I've purchased plenty in this style, \"Requiem for a Dream\", \"Blue Velvet\", \"Goodfellas\" and \"Scarface\" to name a few. \"The Untouchables\" was the latest film I took a five dollar bargain with.Phenomenal credentials, a Brian DePalma film (director of such great films as \"Carlito's Way\" and the aforementioned \"Scarface\") written by David Mamet (who has penned \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" and \"Wag the Dog\") and starring Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia, Sean Connery and Robert De Niro as Al Capone, the infamous mobster. Here we set up a story in prohibition era 1930's and Capone rules the streets with violence and an unforgiving hand. The Treasury Department sends Eliot Ness to Chicago to deal with the terrible problems facing the windy city. He is young, he is naive, he is idealistic and he will soon learn he needs to be as uncompromising as the streets he is trying to protect. Enter Malone, an aged cop who has been weathered down by all of the agonizing distress and pain caused by trying to fight crime in such a corrupt place. Malone takes Ness under his wing and together they recruit two more men to their group, a group which will attempt to bring down one of the most significant figures in the history of organized crime.So I went in to the film imagining a dark and gritty noir type of film, with great characters, powerful performances and epic scenes of a great city struggling to reclaim itself in the wake of depression. None of that was present. Instead what I had stumbled upon was an obviously set-shot film for it's majority, something which I find sincerely weakens the tenacity of the opening scene in the bar with the little girl and in other places throughout.Something which let me down was Kevin Costner's single-dimensional portrayal of the man who vows to bring down Al Capone. But really, what did I expect from him? He did \"Waterworld\". His naive character who goes through a whirl of transformation from a good, wholesome officer of the law to a \"no holds barred\", \"Do what must be done\" cop couldn't have been any more poorly executed. A character who holds so much truth and sees and experiences so many things that change his psyche was just not present. It wasn't there. It just happened. It was all over and he was still the same. No one should be the same after dealing with what he has. Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia's roles are minor in the film and they way in which their characters were developed (or underdeveloped for that matter) is yet just another fault.Al Capone. It couldn't have been hard trying to figure out who should portray this man. Robert De Niro has been a godsend to any filmmaker wanting to depict organized crime. Who better to play a young Vito Corleone? Where would Scorsese be if not for De Niro in \"Mean Streets\" and \"Taxi Driver\"? And he does it again with magnificence. He IS Al Capone. He's nice but he's unforgiving. He's innocent until proved guilty. He executes his role so powerfully that you wish the film was told from his perspective instead of the good guys. He makes the movie real and what lets me down with his role is the mere fact that he is only in it a few times, and when he leaves you want more.The great Sean Connery received an Oscar for his role in this film and I can't disagree with that decision any stronger. I'm not saying Connery is a bad actor, on the contrary, i think he is a spectacular actor, he can make you laugh, or make you want to be a spy or really just kick some ass. But he doesn't make you want to hang out in Chicago. He's just there. Now I don't blame Connery for his characters seemingly strong lack of involvement, I blame poor direction and shoddy writing. His character was one of great strength, the only \"good\" cop left in a sea of corruption, but his time has passed, he doesn't want that dangerous life anymore, but he gets back into it because it's the right thing to do. Think of all of the emotional turmoil, the INNER turmoil that could have made his character more powerful and subsequently enhanced Costner's character as the man following his example. Just a shame.The music was another thing that let me down. That and some of the boring, \"made for TV\" style shots create a lack of depth in the heart of the picture. I never feel like I'm in Chicago, I never feel that I'm watching one of the most important things to happen in 20th Century US history, I feel like I'm watching a PG movie with more blood than normal so they upped it to R. I'm going to stop now while there is just so much I could say.But don't let me bring you down. It's premise is great, it just wasn't what I was expecting. As I watched the movie I saw a better one with each shot, with each clich\u00e9d line being changed, just so slightly, darker, more emotional, more in the vain of what DePalma did for \"Scarface\". It can be better, and hopefully someday it will be.",

For its value as history, it is far less realistic than an episode of Mr. Peabody and Sherman (as he uses his WayBack Machine on the Bullwinkle Show to visit the past). Although Elliot Ness was a fine person, he was NOT responsible for the arrest or conviction of Al Capone. Sorry, it just didn't happen that way. Also, although it DID provide some realistic violence, the baseball bat scene with Capone was incredibly brutal and cannot be corroborated. Plus, some kids seeing this might just need an extensive round of therapy as a result. I guess this isn't a surprise, though, coming from the ultra-violent Brian DePalma. He is, apparently, a great genius as a director, though I am incredibly concerned what sort of spiritual cancer he has planted within all of us with his insistence on horrific violence.

Director Brian De Palma (\"Scarface\" and \"Mission: Impossible\") engages you with this epic story of good versus evil that is so brilliantly crafted that it rivals \"The Godfather\" in terms of its treatment of the material and the accuracy of the performances. The entire cast is excellent from Kevin Costner to Sean Connery, De Niro's perfect performance is the biggest surprise as he brings to shocking reality the ferocity of the mob boss that ruled Chicago with an iron fist.

            "content": "An old-school kinda goofy gangster flick is never what you think it would be when there is a remarkable filmmaker like Brian De Palma behind the camera. Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.The Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.But what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think \"The Untouchables\" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.The issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.It would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.The end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.The Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.(8.5/10)",

Remarkably, the scene is actually very good, but the music turns what would be a gritty and even more intense scene into some kind of heroic, melodramatic celebration of these mighty men of honor taking out the bad guys.Other scenes also have it wrongly placed and times, and it just made me think of how the movie would be better served without the score blaring overdramatically at many of the best scenes.

Based on the TV series, it brings back the crusading lawman v ruthless gangster storyline set in the 30's. It's brilliantly made.During the prohibition era in the USA, gangland kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro) supplies Chigago with illegal liquor which has built up his empire. He is considered to be the undisputed leader of Chicago and rules the city with an iron fist. He also has all of the politicians and police in his pocket, and nobody dares to cross him. That includes his own men and other rival gangsters. Federal Agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is tasked to stop Capone and his supplies of alcohol. Due to the widespread corruption in the city, his efforts are hindered following a failed raid and he is left on his own. Ness decides to put together a small group of lawmen that are not influenced by Capone's corruption. The include the veteran patrol officer Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), police recruit George Stone (Andy Garcia), and accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Not only do they start to succeed in raiding Capone's warehouses full of bootleg alcohol and thwarting his incoming supplies, they also discover that they can also take down Capone on tax evasion. Ness and his men will not back down as Capone declares war.Brian De Palma did a fantastic job as director. David Mamet who wrote the screenplay was brilliant. Ennio Morricone is well known for his work in movies such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and The Mission (1986). Morricone's soundtrack for this movie is impeccable. The cast is first rate. Kevin Costner's role as Elliot Ness is one of his best roles. Sean Connery deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the aging beat cop Jimmy Malone. Robert De Niro was always brilliant and his role as Al Capone is one of his most memorable roles. Andy Garcia as the sharpshooting police recruit was excellent.The stairway shootout scene at the Chicago Union Station was and still is a memorable scene. The same goes for Al Capone's speech about baseball and wields a baseball bat during a meeting with his fellow gangsters. If you've seen the movie, I don't have to say any more. If you haven't seen it, you'll soon understand both scenes.The Untouchables is still a timeless classic. It was excellent viewing when I first hired it out on VHS back in 1997 and I've seen it a few times when it has appeared on TV. I bought it on Blu-ray several years ago and I still pop it on if I'm in the mood for an uplifting and powerful crime classic.9/10.",

A pulsating, slick vehicle for some big stars with an outstanding performance from Sean Connery.UNTOUCHABLES has the De Palma touch: slow-motion scenes, crooked frames, and some fine overhead shots.  Robert De Niro is merely a walk-on as Capone. His opening scene is great, however, his performance is nothing more than a brief blend of his other gangster roles with lines like: \"I want 'em DEAD! You hear me, I want 'em DEAD!\"  It is almost self-parody.  Costner assembles \"the untouchables\" through a chance meeting with tough Irishman Connery (who won an Oscar), a completely lifeless Andy Garcia (not his fault - the writers gave him nothing), and an accountant played by dopey Charles Martin Smith who has no problem grabbing a sawed-off shot gun and raiding a liquor deal without hesitation.  Costner is his usual dull self, but Connery is no doubt worth watching.  In fact, he holds the film together, barely.There are some brutal scenes, but the standout is the now famous \"Odessa-step\" sequence in the train station.  Rewind and watch a couple of times and you see a prime example of great choreography, set-up, and editing.  It is an outrageous and impossible sequence, but it is visually rousing.  (Look for a deadpan spoof of this scene in NAKED GUN 331/3)  The scene, of course, is inspired by the revolutionary step romp in the classic Russian silent BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.  Credit must be given to the set designers who have replicated Chicago, 1930.  It is a great looking picture, almost comic-book style.  De Palma is a master of technical design and overblown Hitchcockian filmmaking which sometimes takes away from the actor's ability to perform.  They are often overshadowed by the grandeur of it all.I am being very critical because I expected a lot more.  It is worth witnessing, especially in its wide-screen format.  You never get the sense that anything plausible is happening and Costner does not have the presence here to carry it all.  Thank the makers for thinking of Connery.RATING: 6 of 10",

            "content": "The Untouchables is a movie based on the true life story of Al Capone and the cops who eventually brought him to justice.  While often over the top and hard to believe, it's an overly enjoyable ride through 1930's Chicago and the problems with prohibition that ran rampant at the time.  However, if your're looking for a more mob themed movie, you'll most likely be disappointed.  Most of the shots are detailing the cop's point of view, and not much more.The cast and acting performances couldn't be better, in my opinion.  Costner stars as the determined Elliot Ness, the man that started it all.  He is pretty much the 'leader' of the team.  Sean Connery, who is by far the best performance, plays Jim Malone, a tired but wise character who turns out to be very likeable by the time the movie is up.  Other important characters include Al Capone (Robert De Niro), George Stone (Andy Garcia) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who all do a fine job.The score could've used a bit more work, but other than that, I recommend.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that once upon a time, buying a bottle of WKD Blue from Tesco's on a Friday night could have bought you a one-way ticket to the slammer. However, in 1930s America (aka the era of 'prohibition,' i.e. making alcohol illegal) this was basically happening. Luckily, for us hardened drinkers good men like Al Capone ensured that we could still get drunk outside the local Weatherspoons and start a fight with someone smaller than us... or something like that.Actually, it wasn't quite like that. No matter how silly banning booze may sound to us, it happened and violent gangs flouted these laws, most famously Al Capone. That was why the city decided that a special police task force should be compiled to combat such nefarious criminal activity. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) was put in charge of stemming illegal liquor activity in the city of Chicago and, at the same time, bringing down the most wanted of criminals, Al Capone (a padded out Robert DeNiro). 'The Untouchables' tells the, er slightly fictionalised, story of this.If you've ever done any research into this period of American history then you could probably make a twenty page list of the inaccuracies in this filmic interpretation of the actual events. For example, hero and villain never really met in real life and Elliot Ness was unhappily divorced, as opposed to his ideal life we see on screen. However, despite these sorts of points making the film more historically accurate, I'm pretty sure they would also make it a damn sight less enjoyable. And it is very, very enjoyable.First of all there's the cast. Whatever you may think about Robert DeNiro's more recent output, there's no denying that in 1987 he was still at the top of his game and he gives an excellent performance as the film's antagonist - the only complaint being that he's probably not in it enough, seeing as he - like the real life Al Capone - spent most of his life hiding in one luxury dwelling to the next. Kevin Costner was a gamble for the lead. This was before he was Robin Hood and his Box Office draw was questionable at the time as to whether he could headline such a big budget film. However, the film-makers made up for this by casting Sean Connery as his right-hand man (and, in doing so, helped market the film on the former Bond's inclusion). There's a young Andy Garcia in there too, but it's DeNiro, Costner and Connery who you're going to be the most interested in.Overall, it's a highly-entertaining gangster movie. Yes, it probably condenses more action into the film than should probably be there, but it makes it all the more entertaining for doing so. You probably don't have to be that into gangster/crime movies to appreciate this - definitely holds up to this day.a",

The film is stylishly shot, everything and everyone looks great, and the plot (although far from historically accurate) keeps us chained down.Ness and his small group manage to work together to bring down Capone, played with relish by De Niro, whose own organisation shows signs of slippage- the boardroom baseball bat scene is a prime example. Although Connery's accent is highly dodgy he is pretty good, his final scene particularly touching. Garcia is also effective, but it is the set pieces which set the movie apart from others- the train station sequence is highly tense, the Monty chase is captivating, and the final rooftop scene is rewarding. Underrated, and overshadowed by the grittier Goodfellas. 8 out of 10",

            "content": "This is a fine Hollywood film that plays fast and loose with the truth. It comes across more as a hagiography of Eliot Ness and his band of Untouchables, rather than as a gritty, \"-just the facts, ma'am-\" police procedural. That probably is the greatest shortcoming of this tale. I can easily see how a juxtaposition between Eliot Ness' real life and the war stories he relates in his book co-authored by Oscar Fraley could have generated an intriguing and fascinating tension between truth and legend. However, there is no doubt that fans of Costner, Sir Connery and DeNiro are going to ride with this one no matter what anybody, including the fact checkers, have to say about it.This is largely a piece of formulaic cops and robbers gangster cinema that, filled with contrivances, follow and obeys all the conventions of its genre. Costner comes across as the poor man's Gary Cooper, rather than the Judo expert with a flair for public promotion, who modernized the police force while developing a drinking problem through three marriages. But this straight arrow of law enforcement, taking up the baton from Robert Stack, flies right into the hearts of audience sympathies. He has his MY FAIR ELIOT moments with his foil and mentor, real life tough guy Sean Connery as the Irish cop, Jimmy Malone, complete with a Scottish accent rather than an Irish brogue, laddies. But with the dial on the glamor meter turned all the way up, who ya gonna find who will complain? So be sure to stamp the cold out of your feet before we raid these local breweries.Robert DeNiro's performance as Al Capone easily rivals that of Rod Steiger playing the Prohibition Kingpin. None can deny he is Holy Hell with a baseball bat. Unfortunately, his improbable encounters with Eliot Ness makes the latter appear childish and juvenile. While DeNiro seems wholly in his element as the Crime Lord, his dialogue with Ness seems awkward and implausible. All the more so when one considers that historically the two men never met until Capone was ready to be escorted to Alcatraz. It might also have been interesting to discover how Capone came to manage his various criminal enterprises besides bootlegging; and also how it was he contracted his sexually transmitted disease.For those of us who remember sneaking downstairs late at night to get a gander at what the grown folks were watching after we were supposed to be in bed, obvious comparisons between the Robert Stack television series and the DePalma film come to mind. There is no doubt each version of The Untouchables saga has it merits and limitations. Just as it's fun to compare Stack and Costner as Ness, it is also interesting to compare Bruce Gordon and Billy Drago as Frank Nitti. Andy Garcia as sharpshooter George Stone fresh out of the Police Academy has a beautiful action scene and Charles Martin Smith as Agent Oscar Wallace gets to settle accounts off the books as well as on them. The movie version at times seems more like cowboys and Indians in the big city, owing in no small part to Ennio Morrione's suspenseful and rousing musical score.The raid on the Canadian border and the shootout at Union Station are fabulous set pieces. It is telling that Connery as veteran officer Jimmy Malone, plays a pivotal role at the end of the former and, one could say, before the beginning of the latter. Both set pieces are fascinating contrivances largely due to the fact that these scenes and incidents never actually happened. This is essentially a man's movie and Patricia Clarkson's role as Eliot's wife, Catherine Ness, is minimal and barely memorable. So it may come as a surprise that women were discovered to make up fifty percent of the audience viewing this film. That may have to do with Cosner's more sympathetic portrayal of Ness; to Connery's dying words in an Oscar winning performance before the last bloody confrontation at the Station; and to Brian DePalma's grafting a scene from BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (1925) onto a young mother with two suitcases and a child in a baby carriage in an unforgettable homage.",

So i thought that i would tend to dislike The Untouchables anyways before i even seen it. But while watching it i realized that is not 'so bad' as his other works. Sure is cheap and clich\u00e9, and the characters wear a typical black and white dresses, the villain is very bad and the good is very good. The end just follows the predictable story arc. But even yet, despite all my dislike towards clich\u00e9 films(although based on real life events), i kinda liked this one. The cinematography is good, the art direction is very good, the score by Ennio Morricone fits perfectly in the film... And Robert DeNiro performance is not that bad as some claim it to be. Sure it was way too cartoon-esque, but he really don't appears a lot in this film. He is mentioned a lot in the film,though. I think that his performance was exactly what this film needed in order to not fade away Al Capone of it. So, if you are looking for a popcorn flick, Untouchables is the perfect choice. 7.5/10",

What a pulse-pounding, and astounding big-gulper. I sat in amazement realizing, that again every movie is not of equal standing. The moment that it started I was into this, moving all the way into the story, following everything. The night of the dinner that Al put on, and began to talk about baseball. I was enthralled, then...as he took and spun the bat around in one flowing movement, changed the 'destiny' of one of his own, that had employment with him, as the bat fell across his skull I felt it through me, like shock-waves!!! I was very alert and on edge at that place in this classic picture. Then later on I heard some 'critics' talking about how Connery was the worst accent, and bad acting etc. Then I saw that he not only won an \"Oscar\" for the roll, he won four more awards as well. The critics, weren't all right, because one of the awards came from the Kansas City Critic's circle. Enough said.The directing and camera angles and the score for this film made it all happened in the perfect order. The acting performances were stellar and through it all, there was Sean. A quintessential actor bringing a larger than life character to the front. The Story of Alphonse Capone and company played out for the rest to see. I really enjoyed all that went into the production of this drama.The mafia and all the crime drama and violence has never been an interest of mine, but this was different and it was a big part of History. This is a mile stone in organized crime drama, that every American should see and understand.(****)",

Looking back on \"The Untouchables\" now I view it as a different sort of movie - it seems somewhat less operatic and more of a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, exaggerated mob movie with all of De Palma's typical touches.But then again, it isn't. Because this is really the second of two times only that De Palma has totally proved to audiences that he's able to construct a masterful thriller/drama _on his own_ without copying (or \"referencing\") Hitchcock. \"Blow Out\" is a good movie, as are many of De Palma's others, but \"The Untouchables\" and \"Scarface\" are arguably the only two he's made where it's really a De Palma movie, and not a De Palma-Hitchcock homage.\"The Untouchables\" seemed a lot better when I was younger but it's still a classic and due to my fond memories of it I'll probably always have a soft spot for it. However I do now recognize flaws I didn't used to - De Niro's Capone, for example, is a great portrayal but given awkward screen time...it works as a sort of convenient interlude to Costner and co.'s adventures - Costner kills some people, flash to De Niro yelling \"I want his head!\", flash back to Costner...it's not exactly a perfect balance as many of it just seems out-of-place...De Niro is wonderful but would losing his scenes harm the film? Not much. Instead, studying his character more would have been a wiser choice - De Palma could have easily made a three-hour epic that studies both men's stories and motivations and as a result the overall story would have been much stronger and the film better.As it is this is sort of a \"Godfather Lite\" - it's not an incredibly strong film, it has some flaws, it could have had ideas expanded, but at the end of the day it's a really great piece of entertainment with some marvelous set pieces, convincing performances and a legendary and iconic turn by De Niro, who totally steals the show from everyone else.The baseball speech scene is a classic - that's the type of stuff that makes me wish they had spent a bit more time focusing on him along with Costner, rather than just Costner.",

But you'd never know that from watching this movie. The true story of the Untouchables, as written by Ness, was embellished with fiction before its publication a year after his death in 1957, fictionalized further by the TV show, and taken even further away from real life by David Mamet and Brian De Palma for this popular 1987 hit.In 1930 the Mob rules the streets of Chicago, spreading fear and violence wherever they find competition or defiance. Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner is his first true lead role) is the straight-up, honest, pure, incorruptible Treasury agent out to get him. Finding the local police filled with crooked Irish labor he keeps his group small, picking jaded beat cop Malone (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role), Fed accountant Wallace, and rookie Stone (Andy Garcia, also in his first big role). Together they go after big boss Al Capone, finding it rather easy to do so despite the fact that we never see any puzzle-solving, mystery, clues, or plot twists. Everything seems to conveniently fall into their lap, giving them nothing much to do apart from react and talk big.The Untouchables really does LOOK like a big screen epic. The lovely photography, period setting, and high-key production give it the feel of a classic, but the movie itself is hollow, flat, tepid, disorientating, ill-conceived, and laughably misjudged. I loved it when I was 7-years-old thanks to all the bloody violence, though watching it as an adult reveals it to be frustrating and weird. I am amazed that David Mamet wrote a screenplay this clunky. The man is a master of cryptic dialogue, and here, in a movie filled with gangsters who ought to be fast-talking and garrulous, every single line is so utterly basic and straight-forward.Even the moral difficulties of Prohibition (itself a moronic mistake by the US government) are gleaned over with no effort, care, understanding, no sense of irony or hypocrisy, no turmoil, and no inner conflict. De Palma is so busy shooting the ceiling with low angles it's like he only glanced at script once or twice without realizing how stilted and lukewarm it was.Ennio Morricone's wonderful score is the soul of this movie (and boy did it really appeal to 7-year-old me) giving energy and life to scenes that would otherwise be moribund. But even he doesn't know when to restrain himself, occasionally going over-the-top and spoiling things.The Untouchables is curiously uplifting, sporadically violent, and unfortunately over-praised. It fails on so many levels, though it seems that De Palma and Co. couldn't care less and were happy with the bizarre, confusing end result.",

Unlike Mario Puzo's \"Godfather\" saga which is fictional but alas paragon for gangster history - i.e., here the only true fact is the village Corleone, 35 km from Palermo then, and now suburb of that city in Sicily. On the contrary, the life and times of Al Capone as \"notorious figure\" in American society from the first half of 20th century has become somewhat blurred. I have watched at least 10 Capone's movies and most of them are hilarious. Conversely, \"Untouchables\" (1987) keeps value with time.Starting with David Mamet's brilliant script, suggested by book from Eliot Ness. The latter is real time figure though not highly instrumental in the conviction case against Capone. His profile from Wikipedia reveals a honest FBI official who wouldn't accept \"1,000 $ notes on his desk every Monday morning if he turned a blind eye to bootlegging activities ...\" Essentially, it was President Herbert Hoover who monitored Capone's trial through Judge James H. Wilkerson and U.S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson (those are photos from Library of Congress recently published in book format). Capone is flanked by his two lawyers but at end he defended himself alone, carrying law books at the courthouse and knowing things not going well for him. Famous trial was that 1931 case.On aggregate Al Capone seemed victimized but he was product of the Great Depression. The biggest criminal of America also endorsed election for Chicago's Mayor Bill Thompson in 1927 and organized free soup kitchens in town. He was a huge Sports Fan and attended horse races on regular basis. He was married to Mae Coughlin, deeply religious Catholic, and have one son - Albert Francis \"Sonny\" Capone. He did have two scars visible on his left cheek, etc.I wish to tell further the story of organized crime in America but it would take lot of time. Fragmentary periodization outline three main periods:1/ Outlaws and Bandits after the Civil War. Those work on \"the Quick and the Dead\" rule being rather marauders and looters. Most died chased from posse or by Pinkerton detectives;2/ Organized Crime as Strictly Business. This evolved after Great War, mostly ruled by second generation immigrants Italian, Irish and Jewish. Their legacy is infamous and they jacked America as top destination for crime;3/ After World War II came the Mafia, the Cold War and then the Jihad. This is the story where crime and politics go hand-in-hand right into the 21st century ...",

We want it to be a good movie - it has a big name crew and Serious Intent written all over it - but it fails. It doesn't fail badly - it fails in small, sad ways that in themselves are hardly noticeable, but which in the end just mount up to an unsatisfactory experience. De Palma wants to be a better director than he is - he uses intentionally \"interesting\" camera angles and movement. And just sometimes he can make a powerful sequence like the shoot out in the railway station. That the very effective minimalistic approach to this sequence came about through budget cut restraints, and that he borrowed heavily from Hitchcock, doesn't take anything away from the scene's effectiveness - though it does take away from any claims to De Palma's ability as a director. De Palma's wannabe serious pretensions drag this movie down and hold it from ever taking off into the thrilling action picture it wants to be. Mamet's script holds potential - it is a dark and somber script. When given to an actor with presence, such as Sean Connery, the dour, mean, repressed and aggressive nature of prohibition Chicago is fully explored. But the script is flawed. The sequence in Canada should never have been shot. The characters could have been better drawn and given more life and, well, character. But there was potential there that a good director would have exploited. Costner is wooden. De Niro is limited. Garcia says little. And Martin Smith is ugly in big glasses. It is only Connery and Bradford who do well. The set design gives everything a comic book feel. But not on the dark Gothic scale of Batman - no, this is more like Doonesbury. Take little snippets here and there, give it a fast edit with lots of Sean Connery, and you have a great trailer. But sadly the movie does not live up to expectation.",

There's no real life characters, ones of discussable moral qualities, there's so much fictitious moral in the good characters that you'll wish the ending was different and they where all put up against a wall and Al Capone or Frank Nitti shot the s**t out of them, especially Ness. Mind you, generally I'm not the type to boo at the good guy but this movie is so fake you just can't help but feel really really disappointed at the end when you see that Ness doesn't get his brain blown. To sum up - you know De Palma, you know Costner and thats what you have to expect. Forget about De Niro and Conory, I say its a shame they showed their faces in this crap.",

Kevin Costner does the role of his life in this and the only other thing by him that even comes close to this is The Postman. Sean Connery does good in this as an Irish cop who is trying to redeem himself. I believe that this is and was the turning point in Connery's career. Before this he was seen as a has been and had been type cast as James Bond, but this broke him out of that rut by showing that he had range. Charles Martin Smith is funny in this as he is in almost all of his movies. Can't wait to see him do something big again. Andy Garcia makes an early appearance in this as well and it helps the film as he is a good actor. But the real saving grace of this is Robert De Neiro. This is his forth collaboration with director Brian De Palma and it is probably their best effort together. Although I like Greetings a lot. Brian De Palma finally gets out of a tough patch that he was in and makes another masterpiece. This is easily one of my top five favorites from De Palma. Watch this.",

Take the train station for example: The scene was punctuated cinematically by the exquisite cinematography, De Palma's over the top direction and some dramatized action.  And let's not forget Ennio Morricone's thrilling score. But mind you the train station scene is one that integrates action with character; Stone's character. He's a pretty good shot. Remember where Malone and Ness recruited him.Love the way Mamet keeps things a question; who Malone gets information from... speaking of that, I also loved the ambush scene in the police headquarters, and the furious, emotional scene involving Ness and Capone later on. The ultimate payoff for me was to see Ness change his mind about sparing Capone's rind hand man in the end; see it to find out what I'm talking about.One of my top tenGrade A+",

Th 1987 film, with Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness, is also of high quality, although I prefer the TV series in general; if only for the higher volume of material. The film is set in Chicago during Al Capone's reign, when all levels of the government and police have been infiltrated by the mafia. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Costner) and his squad of Untouchables have vowed to bring down Capone and his organization. The other members of the squad are; James Malone (Sean Connery), an old Irish (?!) cop; George Stone (Andy Garcia), an Italian recruit; and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant from the Treasury Department. Capone is played by Robert De Niro, in another of his iconic mob roles. There are several classic sequences in the film: the harrowing death of the little girl; Capone's baseball lecture; the ambush at the Canadian border; the death of Malone; the shootout at the train station; and Ness's climactic killing of Frank Nitti. The plot is not airtight, but it hardly matters. This is a classic piece of entertainment.",

            "content": "Before \"The untouchables\", Kevin Costner wasn't as big a star as he is today.  So you could consider \"The untouchables\" to be the movie that made a movie star of him.  Nowadays, everybody knows him.  We all know that he has delivered some very good performances and some terrible ones.  But his best performance is without a doubt his performance in this movie.  He seemed to know the feelings of his character very well and was great in the role of Eliot Ness, the cop who finally gets Capone convicted.  Also, we have Sean Connery who plays Malone, the man who helps Ness put Capone in prison and I think he steals the show in his Oscar-winning performance as best-supporting actor.  The movie begins with Al Capone (Robert De Niro) getting interviewed while his personal barber shaves him.  The second scene is what sets off the movie: Capone's men, who are incapable of convincing a bartender into selling alcohol that Capone imported into Chicago (we are in the 30's and there is prohibition in Chicago).  The bartender refuses and in revenge, the men leave a suitcase with a bomb in it.  But there is a little girl in the pub who only went there to get her daily milk and as the men walk out, she follows them trying to give them back their suitcase.  But the suitcase explodes in her hands killing her on the spot.  And then the story kicks off.  Ness (Costner) tries to bust Capone but doesn't know how and doesn't really have the guts to go all the way.  But when he meets Malone (Connery), he is taught a lesson of courage as well as how to beat Capone and the Mob. But how can a few strong and courageous cops stop the impossible from happening.  So naturally, the Mob fights back and  causes some serious damage in the cops' camp.  Brian De Palma used some \"extreme violence\" to show the power of both the Mob and the cops in this incredibly powerful drama based on the true life of detective Eliot Ness who finally got Capone behind bars.  De Palma also masterfully directed the movie and made good choices for his cast which consists of Costner, Connery, De Niro, and Andy Garcia.  The script is excellent as well.  But as I stated before, I believe that it Sean Connery that makes this movie so great with his excellent performance as Malone.  I think that it is his best performance in his whole career.  So see this movie.  It's great classic about the Mob vs. cops where for once, the Mob appears as the bad-guy.  It's worth seeing at any cost.",

Don't make me laugh about Andy Garcia, who too, knows how to be a paper cardboard wooden actor, such as Costner is well known for. Does it take much to put some emotions into your acting abilities? Kevin Costner is sincerely the highest overrated actor in history of this industry. How he even has a job in Hollywood is beyond me. Sorry, De Palma, but this one is a dud.

Recruiting an elite group of lawmen who won't be swayed by bribes or fear, including Irish-American cop Jimmy Malone, Ness renews his determination to bring Capone to justice........Before this film, DePalma was known for homaging Hitchcock in many great movies, and his work with a camera was pure genius.using the unique mise en scene, he makes the film something more than your average crime thriller. He makes the film classy, with some amazing shots from above, and some very memorable set pieces.Costner, whilst brilliant as Ness, is shadowed by performances from De Niro, and arguably a career best from Connery. Yes, his accent is non-existent, but that's a standing joke with the actor. His performance is intimidating, warm, and probably the most humanistic part of the film.Connery is the foundation for the film, and whenever he is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off him. He's clearly having the time of his life playing Malone, but always maintaining the conviction of his characters passion all the way through.Garcia and Smith complete The titular crew, and although Garcia fluffs a line when he is first introduced, the final third is where he really stands out.Drago is an intimidating henchman, and could have been the inspiration for the Weasels in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? He is almost paranormal, and he has a element of sinister sleaze about him. He may appear underused, but his limited time on screen makes him feel more elusive.As for the set pieces, they are what make the film stand out as a classic. From the Canadian Mountie heist (and Connery interrogating a dead body), to Ness chasing Nitti across the rooftops, ending with the amazing line 'He's in the car'.But the standout scene is the homage to Battleship Potemkin, and the shootout whilst the pram is rolling down the steps in slow motion.The editing is perfect, the music a perfect accompaniment, and once again, the perfect wrap up of the piece ('Take him'.........'Two').By having a vintage feel to it, the film has aged remarkably well, and standout scenes in the film, (the above mentioned, and the harrowing death of Malone) never fail to thrill or pull at the heart strings.It's a film that needs to seen and revisited, and it will remain a true classic crime film forever.Here endeth the lesson..",

He will assemble a unique cast of characters in hopes of bringing down Capone by any means necessary; and best believe, Capone won't make it easy.This movie is directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface) and stars Kevin Costner (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves), Sean Connery (Dr. No), Robert De Niro (Heat), Andy Garcia (Ocean's Eleven), Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island) and Brad Sullivan (Slap Shot).Everything about this movie is entertaining. The storyline is tremendous and who doesn't want to watch a movie of Eliot Ness versus Al Capone? The characters are so compelling. It's rare the cast is just as legendary as the historical characters they are playing, but Costner, Connery and De Niro are an unbelievable ensemble. The backdrops, attire, props and depiction of the era was also perfect. The depiction of the tommy gun was very cool and the baseball bat \"team\" scene was legendary.

And it's the kind of great film that is so only through the combined efforts of everybody, not just De Palma, even as it is his vision (sometimes playfully homage-like, as I'll mention in a moment), but his cast, crew, and the script by David Mamet. The cast here includes Kevin Costner, in one of his three or four passably good performances, in the Ness part (like his later Jim Garrison role, the confident if a bit conflicted hero); De Niro in a ham-bone best as Capone, with one of the more eye-opening and funny scenes he's ever done (eg with a bat); Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia in juicy supporting roles. And then one comes to Sean Connery, in his deserved Oscar winning turn as Irish cop turned Ness partner Jim Malone, who has the toughest words and the biggest guts of the group. It's in his work here, where he has some of that confidence of past performances into a very real character that makes it quite a piece. Aside from the sheer presence of a star like Connery on screen, there's some depth he gives to the character too, just as De Niro does with his choices as an actor (even if his role is the larger-than-life one).De Palma, at his disposal as a craftsman, has good editors and camera people working alongside him, as well as Ennio Morricone on music (a small 'yey' emits from my mind). Through them his film is a slick, but not overbearingly at all, kind of 1930's Hollywood picture, with a story of the cops versus robbers, in some unconventional circumstances. The centerpiece of the climax, De Palma's homage to Eistenstein's Battleship Potemkin, is operatic and grandiose and puts the drama of what was in real life likely quite different into a spectacular sequence, is as entertaining as it could be. While it's not the only action sequence in the film, one could point to just that one sequence as being a true highlight of doing homage well. In truth it's been a little while since I've seen the Untouchables, and maybe even longer since I've seen it from start to finish (and, unfortunately, never on a big screen). But I wouldn't dare to tell you not to watch it if you haven't yet.",

DePalma takes a premise that could have been truly great and gives us the popcorn version.

The cast is excellent, and came out before Costner became the King of Flop and still appeared in decent films. De Niro as Capone was a wise choice, although he's not on screen much, and is entirely believable and Connery can play an old wise cop with ease. The climatic rail station scene is impressive even with all of that slow motion, but I do like it, unlike some who hate the movie because of it.

Of course, Connery, in his Oscar-winning role, just shines in the movie and, in addition to his quick wit, adds onto his character humor, drama and intrigue where appropriate.The cinematography by Stephen H. Burum captures the brilliance and aura of 1930s Chicago and the music score by Ennio Morricone was very haunting and catchy, especially his piece for the opening credits - having the flavor of that of a classic detective movie.Overall, it's a great movie, with a heart-founding climax!

            "content": "This and \"The Godfather 1 and 2\" are both the best crime flicks set during the late '30s-early 40s. Besides the time periods, they both have the best acting, music, action, memorable characters, cinematography, thrills and quality that anyone could possibly want. However, some viewers don't find this as popular as the other due to taking historical events and taking some liberty with them. But de Palma's film is still just as entertaining as Coppola's masterpiece because they have numerous \"pros\" and hardly any \"cons.\"Robert Di Nero greatfully embodies Al Capone and doesn't make it to where he's just hogging the show; Kevin COstner, an under-rated guy, becomes Elliot Ness no problem; Sean Connery equally shares the screen as Jim Malone; and Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith join the party as detectives Geroge Stone and Oscar Wallace. The writing is brilliantly thought out and has all the twists and turns keep the movie rolling; director De Palma ( Mission: Impossible, the over-rated Scarface) keeps things lively by having the brilliant musical score playing and the gun-fights lively; and the court-room scene is one word: awesome.",

The script tells the story of Al Capone from the point of view of his executioners, who despite all the crimes committed by the dry law kingpin, he was convicted of tax evasion, a story so incredible that it looks like a sweet fiction, though Extremely flowery and romanticized, in very general lines, the story is true. The screenplay tells the story of four men, an accountant, an almost retired police officer, a police officer who has not even finished the academy yet, and a treasury agent, all obstinate to capture Al Capone. We have betrayal, death and demonstration of power, and how simply the act of taking away the drink (drink) of people would cause chaos and gigantic contraband, proving also that in the case of alcohol, the restriction only created a parallel market. Technically, the film has footage that looks like a 1950s movie, and that's nice, although sometimes I'm a bit of a shame, because Hitchcock's style is copied, and copied very well, we have an exquisite camera job, With prefect angles, plans sequences, against plounge, always privileged the suspense, in addition to a soundtrack that has a beautiful song and very good (even being one of suspense in a film of mafia,) already the rest of the track often gets half Dislocated from the rest of the film, but Brian always makes a point of guiding the scenes from his extremely varied track, which refers to the western to pop music, we also have a beautiful photograph that shouts that the film was made into film, it is a film Which already causes nostalgia, even for the 80's. Kevin Costner is excellent, conveying an air of patriotism and honesty blended with anger, which suits his partner, and the film's great highlight in terms of Performances that is the wonderful Sean Connery, ale more, even if with little screen time, Robert De Niro is giant and completely scary when it appears. Brian of Palm is sure to have traumas of his great \"Scarface\" to be completely ignored of the great festivals and even of big cinemas due to its violence, with that, in \"The Untouchables\" he censures the violence and diminishes the very concept of it, and This harms his film because it takes away the terror of Al Capone's actions by taking the fear out of his viewer (even in the taco scene, which was done precisely to make the viewer feel the fear, does not work because it is badly made, and even in the Viscerality is silly); finally, \"The Untouchables\" is a good suspense thriller mafia movie, which appeals too much.",

            "content": "It's one of those movies in which the baddies are really bad and the goodies are so very, very good.Daffy Duck-voiced Kevin Costner plays an Elliot Ness who is such a self-righteous goody-two-shoes that it almost makes you cringe. He's a sort of Mary Poppins in drag. His wife is likewise such a doting, tractable paragon of womanly virtue that she must have been designed in the Ideal Wife Laboratory. Ness contracts the services of a dogged police officer, a slightly dilatory bean-counter, and a latter-day mixed-race gunfighter, to take on the whole crime syndicate. And in effect, impose upon the American people one of the greatest restrictions upon civil liberties before jack-boots became fashionable: that of banning booze.It is an example of how some people can be found to impose any law - even one entailing genocide - given sufficiently authoritative mandate.Robert DeNiro plays an Al Capone with the sort of uninhibited psychotic panache that has almost become his trade mark. He's good, so long as you're not at the wrong end of his baseball bat. Otherwise the confrontations are staged almost to the point of numbers. Whether it's the assassination of Ness's untouchables, or a lengthy slow-mo conflict in the station; you seem to have seen it happen almost before it's begun.The 'Roaring Twenties' are an extremely exciting and much under-utilised period of American history. Yet this recreation of one chapter is woefully lacking in any particular merit. I understand the recent Depp vehicle 'Public Enemies' has little more to offer.Frankly; I thought the TV series starring Robert Stack was more entertaining per unit time, and Rod Steiger's 'Al Capone' much more believable and periodically authentic.This is strictly for the fans.

            "content": "\"The Untouchables\" is an American 2-hour movie from 1987, so this one is already over 30 years old and it is one of the most known works by director Brian De Palma for sure. Actually I am a but surprised this has over 250k ratings here on imdb, I did not think it was this famous. But crime always sells in terms of films I suppose, even long after the years of mob glory films \u00e0 la Godfather. And it probably helps that it is based on real events and a book written by Eliot Ness, the central character here who is played by Kevin Costner during his days when probably no female would have pushed him out of their bed(room). Kinda ironic the real Ness survived all this and then died from a heart attack still relatively young. But let's take a look at the film now: It won former James Bond Sean Connery an Oscar, his biggest career success, and managed more nominations, including one for Ennio Morricone. I watched this movie as part of a retrospective on the legendary composer and I am actually really glad this way they get old films back to the theater, especially if they are as interesting to watch as the one we got here. I would say that for me it lived more through individual scenes than the plot as a whole, but that was fine because there were really many memorable moments. One would be the first meeting on the bridge between Connery and Costner. Of course the spectacular scene at the train station, even if the buggy moments were maybe a bit over the top, but the rest of it was just as good as it gets. Of course then everything right before and after the death of Connery's character. The umbrella delivery. Or also when the finance guy is killed in the elevator together with the one who has many information on the main antagonist. I still must say this finance guy's rise to gun action was a bit too much reality-wise perhaps. Or the final scene with Billy Drago who has great recognition value as always in perhaps his most known movie and career performance, although I always think of Charmed with him. And then of course everything involving Robert De Niro, who is as good as always playing the legendary career criminal Al Capone. A truly haunting turn by him, also in these scenes when he does not smash a man's head out of nowhere. The baseball monologue is probably still his greatest moment, but there are several others too. He almost feels like outside this movie a bit because he almost never shares screen time with the title characters. Except on two occasions when Costner's Ness meets him, first of all a victory for Capone, but in the end when we see them with their upper bodies directed at each other, which was just an amazing shot honestly because they have been going against each other all movie long and in this scene it also culminated completely with Capone's superiority completely gone (as his bribe did not work out) and his anger fully reelased. It was kinda funny when he physically assaults his lawyer because he pleaded guilty.Okay what else can I say about this movie. It certainly was good enough to deserve a few more lines. For me it is definitely among the more memorable and best films from 1987. There is great attention to detail like also with the little item Connery's character always carries with him and that we see at the end and the words he would have wanted a cop to have it. Of course not always everything works out, but with the high quality all around it comes easy to ignore weaker segments and characters like the photographer who could have been left out completely for all I care. Oh yes the words in the title of my review are memorable enough too, perhaps the best quote of the entire film and there were really many great ones, so it means something. The film could have perfectly ended afterwards with the closing credits rolling in after said quote, but it went on for a little longer still. The actual ending wasn't bad either with Ness saying he's gonna have a drink now that he is allowed to again, which shows that it is not personal for him the job he so relentlessly pursued before that, but he is just a true professional. We also see that during the speech when he talks to the other cops about how he does not care they had drinks occasionally and like alcohol. Or when our finance guy takes a quick drink in-between during the scene when they catch the first guy whose knowledge can get Capone behind bars. Honestly still I found that scene not too great and memorable as some may like it and with how good it could have been. It was slightly messy. But when they move on to the interrogation, it gets better. Honestly when Connery shoots that dead fella in the head right in front of the other guy's eyes, that was pretty funny and badass no kidding. He sure was old school here. But he managed to end up as a nice mentor nonetheless, somebody whose heart is in the right place and honestly with how long he lived after taking all these shots to his torso shows how much of a tough nut he is. I am not sure he gave the best supporting performance that year (kinda showing the BAFTAs did not honor him, but Americans did, the Globes too), but his career adds true greatness and fun and interesting scenes to this movie, so I am glad he won it, obviously also because I really dig Bond. Now sorry I am drifting a bit away. What I actually wanted to say is that you should also pay attention to how Costner suffers for a moment when he shoots that guy because with his native language maybe he did not understand that he was supposed to throw away his gun. So he is not that much of a tough nut, which we also see through his family background. He has a lot to lose for sure and his wife (Clarkson early career performance, but as forgettable as she always is) and kids are clealy more important to him than his work which we see from his reaction after Drago's character threatens them. But not too soft for the job either and if necessary also very violent which we see during the rooftop scene. I won't go into detail about this one, go experience it yourself. Oh yeah and one I did not mention yet was Andy Garc\u00eda, he was fun too, especially during his introduction scene. After that he did not have too much to work with anymore other than taking the crucial shot in the great train station scene I already mentioned. He went on to become an Oscar nominee les than five years later for another fairly famous crime movie. Okay I guess that would be all now. Thanks for reading until here. I think by now you should know that I highly recommend this movie to everybody. It is inspired, interesting and includes several memorable characters. Go for it, also you girls. Don't let anybody tell you this is a guys movie. There is a lot more for you to see here than prime Costner!",

Melodramatic music before almost a comedic scene where Kostner's and Connery's characters meet for the first time.

            "content": "Brian De Palma made his name working in films that scared and thrilled, primarily in the vein of Hitchcock, before trying to expand himself into new territory. One of those new territories was the gangster epic, which he jumped into with 1987's The Untouchables, written by David Mamet. He took the job primarily as a way to make a big studio movie that would turn a quick profit (after his last few pictures were financial failures) and allow him to make more movies that he wanted to. His lack of genuine passion is evident early on, resulting in a film that doesn't have much spark. It's a shame really, because the script could have allowed for a much stronger picture if better talent had been involved.De Palma has long been a hit-or-miss director for me and this one misses the mark completely. There are some wonderfully staged sequences that entertain and properly build suspense, but for every bridge shootout there's an unintentionally hilarious moment like the baby rolling down the stairs. De Palma once again pours on his fetish for slow motion shots and once again it results in more hilarity than anything else, often feeling as if it's a parody that the audience isn't allowed in on. Mamet's script had the potential for a lot of punch, but beyond De Palma's poor work here is a cast that screams to be replaced.Headlining the ensemble is Kevin Costner, the head of the titular squad of men organized to bring down legendary gangster Al Capone, and they really couldn't have found a more inappropriate lead if they tried. I'm not entirely sure how a lot of these scenes were able to make it past the editing room, but Costner trying to deliver Mamet dialogue is like Rob Schneider trying to read Shakespeare. There are so many scenes where you can see the passion and the rage that must have been on the script, but when Costner tries to bring it out of his mouth it comes off so forced, flat and borderline hilarious. Moments of damaged frustration have no meaning when the man portraying it sounds exactly the same as he always does. Costner is probably the worst thing about this picture, but the rest of the cast often leaves something to be desired as well.Sean Connery inexplicably won an Oscar for his role here, and I can't say I'm entirely certain as to why he did. His character serves as a mentor to Costner's and there's a lot of the standard moments that come with that dynamic but after the film was over I felt nothing that resonated with his performance. I wouldn't say it's particularly bad as Costner was, but I felt nothing for the character, there was nothing there that allowed me to take him as a believable human being. Taking on the role of Capone is Robert De Niro in a performance that feels almost as wrong here as Costner's. De Niro is often over-the-top, hamming it up to a dreadful extreme, but even when he's not, the performance still stinks of self-awareness. There's never a moment where this guy is actually Capone, it's just Robert De Niro putting on some makeup.The film isn't all bad, though. Like I said, there are some marvelously done sequences that are good enough to feel like they belong in a much better picture. Along with that, you can tell that Mamet's script itself could have been a quality work if it had been taken under the wing of a better group of actors or a director that cared more. I also thought that the film was shot incredibly well, with many scenes that left me impressed with their visual flare. Even when the film overall can fall into ruin, De Palma has always been a master at creating a memorable, unique and impressive style. I just deeply wish that it had been serviced by a better overall product.",

            "content": "The Untouchables is easily Brian DePalma's most accessible piece of filmmaking.  It is beautifully filmed and photographed and Mamet's screenplay is sharp and to the point.  Although this movie isn't necessarily considered one of DePalma's personal films (e.g. \"Dressed to Kill,\" \"Body Double\"), it is still, nevertheless, extremely well-crafted and never seems to be overcome by DePalma's indulgent tendencies.  This telling of Prohibition-era Chicago, with Costner in the lead, boasts a tremendous performance from Sean Connery as the wise, old cop who teams with Eliot Ness to stop Al Capone.  Some viewers may note the obvious lack of historical accuracy, but no one can doubt the pure craftsmanship and beauty of this period piece.",

            "content": "From an unknown and forgotten man, the publication of the novel, THE UNTOUCHABLES by one Mr. Elliot Ness and the collaborator, Oscar Fraley, brought real, 1950's style fame to the then retired G Man. From the novel, to the 2 parter of \"The Untouchables\"which was a presentation of The Westinghouse DESILU PLAYHOUSE on CBS.(Later released as a feature film titled THE SCARFACE MOB) It was the big success and immediate popularity of the Lead, Robert Stack, that warranted making a series of it on the ABC TV Network. After a measley 5 seasons and only l18 episodes, THE UNTOUCHABLES was given the old ax and went into syndicated re-runs.Well nigh well 25 years passed and it finally came to pass that that the public would be receptive to a retelling of the Chicago during Prohibition Saga. After all, it should be a natural. The movie going crowd seemed to liker those Gamgster shoot-em-ups, and especially if they involved old 'Snorkey', you know 'Scarface', Big Al, that is. Big Al as in Capone, would be the antagonist.The film opens up with the Musical Theme being about as different as it could be from the Nelson Riddle theme and incidental music of the series.The film's score by \"Spahhetti Western Veteran\", Ennio Morricone, is shrill, annoying and highly pitched. It sets the tone of the production.The violence is highly graphic and even could be called gory. This has been a trademark of Director, Brian DePalma's. Explosiives, gun play and the old fashioned blades are pictured in use and afterward. We of course expect such, due to the nature of the film's subject matter. It sort of borders on \"gross\" at times. This is not a real criticism of Mr. DePalma's work as the TV Series was none too subtle itself.The Chicago setting is well used, what with the downtown and neighborhood locale, s put to best use in giving a Prohibition Era Gangster and Great Depression time feel. The wardrobe, costumes and automobiles used serve to amplify the old settings even more. They have actually created a much more beautiful Depression than the the original, but that is the nature of the Technicolor Film process.(It seems that ordinary items in every day settings look much better on the screen, even in home movies.) The cast of Kevin Kostner, Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia make a fine group of Law Men, albeit rather unorthodox ones at that. Robert DiNero seems to have a fine time with his interpretation of Al Capone, with costuming making him appear to be more bulky. He uses his acting abilities to best advantage to project an ego that would do better in living up to the \"Big AL\" moniker than any height or girth.From a lot of what has been written about Mr. Ness and his exploits by different people, it would appear that of the characterizations of the boss Treasury Man by Mr. Robert Stack and Mr Kevin Costner, it would appear that Kevin's \"Ness\" was a tad more like the real guy, who is said to have been somewhat of a publicity hound.Please allow me to make mention of the part of the crooked Chicago Alderman who tries to bribe Ness on behalf of the Crime Syndicate. It was a brief part, but an important one. It was well done and sort of over the top. The actor in the role was the Late Mr. Del Close, a veteran of Chicago's Second City and was considered to be the High Guru of Improvisational Theatre.Sometimes we ask ourselves, just what was such a big deal about this Ness and His Boys? After all, these are the characters who our old buddy in the funny papers, Snuffy Smith, refers to as \"Revenooers\"!",

In a sense this subject matter become so powerful with the high performances of the actors who did maximum justice with their characters. Robert De Nero was most impressive in my view as the real life don Al Capone, while Sean Connery 's portrayal as Jim Melonie warned him Oscar for best actor in supporting role. Then comes Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness federal agent appointed by the authorities to gather real evidence against Capone and also to eradicate corruption in the premises of the police department and some related law enforcement agencies. To accomplish the mission he requires the selfless assistance of Jim Melonie who is a senior and experienced cop , he is the only one who knows how to beak into the web and network AL Capone made over the years. While also they asked for the services of a young , enthusiastic but a courageous officer played by Andy Garcia. I saw the film when i was 18 in that stage most people like either full action or supernatural horror movies but this movie at that time made a place in my heart. Its all because of the competition which the actors did with each other on the set , because of their effort i really went mad to watch it. The other credit goes to director Bryan De Palma , i also happened to see his Scarface , a very intense violent but a good crime drama. Great job done by all of you. I hope that multi star cast may never disappoint any time in anyway. I wish to see more.",

            "content": "Chicago. The first half of the 30s. The times of Prohibition. The local mafia under the leadership of Al Capone (De Niro) continues to rule in the city. The government creates a special team with the catchy name \"Untouchables\" to fight Capone and his empire. At the head of the brave is the young and energetic Eliot Ness (Costner), the soul and the main thinker of the quartet is Jim Malone (Connery), the best shooter and sympathetic \"gang\" is agent George Sloane (Garcia), as well as a local nerd and a specialist in financial fraud - agent Oscar Wallace (Smith). Together, they are destined to put Capone behind bars and destroy the business of one of the most famous bandits in history.Even strange, but three gangster epics (Scarface, the Untouchables and the Way of Carlito) The De Palms received only one Oscar nomination (the only statuette for Connery's career for \"best supporting actor\"). So much is felt now the \"format\" of these paintings by Brian and the stupidity (or blindness) of American academics. Of course, Coppola and his \"Godfather\"annoyed all his colleagues. Francis, who is Ford, raised the bar of quality to such an unattainable height that all gangster films woven not \"in a Coppolovian way\", it seems that they are immediately sent to the Oscar basket (it is enough to recall Scorsese's \" Nice Guys \"with a single statuette and Scott's\" Gangster\", which remained without awards).And De Palma, meanwhile, is not at all like a friend of Coppola, because his \" Untouchables \"(like\" Scarface \"and\" The Way of Carlito\") is a much more personal picture than the same\"Godfather\". And, of course, less academic. Here the viewer's attention is turned to the person, but not to the system. In the frames of faces, human emotions. De Palma is not afraid of close-ups, as if forcing us to make eye contact with the hero. And eye-to-eye, like Sherlock Holmes, using the deductive method, we begin to understand the laws of gangster Chicago, the formulas, rules and axioms of the criminal world. In Coppola, the main characters, despite all their character, are just cogs of a huge, long-established mechanism. Almost conservatives. And the mafia world, according to Coppola, does not tolerate deviations from its clearly defined line, just as it does not tolerate Individuals trying to unravel a criminal \"blanket\"woven for years. In De Palma, all the heroes exist outside of a given coordinate system - and Eliot Nes, who renounced honesty for the sake of a just cause, and Jim Malone, pushing Nes on the \"right\" path, and even Al Capone, a smart and resourceful bandit who managed to tightly crush the underground world of Chicago. And only they can change the rules of the game.",

            "content": "The Prohibition-era \"fight\" between gangster Al Capone and G-man Eliot Ness over the streets of Chicago is the stuff of legend. For this reason, director Brian De Palma's next big mob-themed follow-up to \"Scarface\" is quite a challenge. Capone is an enigma of sorts: the closest thing to a tall tale that history has to offer. Casting Robert De Niro was an excellent choice in attempt to do the character justice, but \"The Untouchables,\" as entertaining and suspenseful as it is, never fully captures the tone and magnitude of Capone and 1930s Chicago.Feds and gangsters flick would be a better way to describe \"The Untouchables\" than organized crime drama. Anyone expecting a Godfather film or \"Scarface\" should lower those expectations to the level of '30s-themed action movie. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, leading a team of feds called The Untouchables who decide to go straight after the mob. They consist of an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) a rookie who's a good shot (Andy Garcia) and the wise veteran (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role).For a mostly fictitious account of Capone's arrest, you'd think De Palma would pull out all the stops and that his film would glamorize the heck out of the mob and juice up the story to make it as cool as possible. He does a lot of nice aerial shots like the very beginning and the whole cast has lots of fun with guns, but it's the characters that feel a bit cold. Costner is just okay as Ness. Yes, his character is supposed to be a moral by-the-books type who eventually embraces the slightly less legal means of getting the job done because the ends justify the means, but he could us a bit more flavor. You do like him though by the end of the film at the least.I don't know what Connery does that well to earn an Oscar. I think the Academy was like most people with regards to Connery in the '80s: smitten every time he shows up on screen without a license to kill in tow. Malone is an ideal part being that he's wise, skilled and also reckless -- and David Mamet also gives him the film's best lines -- but there's nothing that suggests he's more than a likable character mold.The best scene in \"The Untouchables\" can be looked at in one of two ways: either as a fantastic modern ode to a classic war film (the silent Russian film \"The Battleship Potemkin\") or as \"well that was great, but it wasn't original.\" I'm somewhere in between. The train station stairs make a beautiful backdrop for the firefight that's not unlike the final scene of \"Scarface,\" and De Palma's slowing down of the action makes it all the more enjoyable, but there's a lingering sense of wanting something truly one-of-a-kind.What Mamet's script does best other than good action fodder is provide a sense of whether or not someone is really untouchable, whether or not the law truly protects anyone. Capone lived above the law for so long and Ness loses a ton of men in his restless pursuit, having to bend the law at times in order to continue it. Capone's arrest does suggest that we all have to answer sometime when we don't govern ourselves by a set of principles.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "SPOILERS It is not the best mafia movie out there, but it still a great example of a Brian De Palma movie. Although it does not stick too close to the facts it is still great. I mean, in real life Eliot Ness never threw Frank Nitti off the building, he actually committed suicide. The acting in this film is some solid acting. Sean Connery's acting is fantastic, and Kevin Costner has his moments. I do not know why people say that the music in this film is horrible. It is great. Sure, at some scenes the music does not fit in but overall it is great.Here is the plot of this movie. A man named Eliot Ness is after Al Capone. After an embarrassing confrontation with umbrellas Ness gets Jim Malone, Oscar Wallace, and George Stone to help him take down Capone. They become the Untouchables. Then, Capone's hit-man named Frank Nitti threatens Ness's family. He gets the family out of town. Then, Wallace is killed. One Untouchable down. Then, Malone is brutally killed. Two down. Capone is eventually brought to court. Ness then kills Nitti. In the end Capone is finally arrested and sentenced to eleven years in prison.Overall, this is a pretty good mafia movie. It had good acting and had a great real-life story that could be turned into a movie. I also thought that the scene at the train station steps when Ness helps a mother with her baby and then Capone's men come and their is a shootout but Stone saves the baby is a brilliant scene. Also, the death scene of Malone and Wallace are fantastic and depressing. Both scenes had some of the most saddest music that I have ever heard. Anyway, this is a terrific film that any fan of a good mafia movie will enjoy.9/10 Recommended Films: The Godfather.",

I don't understand this directed and purposeful hate for the movie.I know that De Palma can be a little polarizing for some people but this is one of his most mainstream and conventional movies. He directed it mostly how Mamet wrote it. Some reviews say that the dialogue is laughable? That is not what most film students would agree with as it was written by David Mamet, the king of dialogue. This film has some of the best and most memorable lines in film. If you want real dialogue, watch Mamet's 'Glengarry Glen Ross'. Perfection! I saw someone else criticize the music score. WTF! This music score won the legendary Ennio Morricone a Grammy and an Oscar nomination, following his other nominated scores for The Mission & Once Upon a Time in America. Personally, I love this score and have the soundtrack on cd. I think it's one of the best of the 80s alongside Once Upon a Time & The Mission. Incidentally, The Mission score was originally used on the first trailer as he hadn't completed the soundtrack at the time. Others criticize Connery's accent. OK, that was the running joke at the time, but anyone who knows Connery's work knows he sounds the same in all his movies ('The Hunt for Red October' anyone?) and takes nothing away from his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win. Most reviews love this movie and I'm one of them. For me, the stars aligned on every level. The brilliance of Brian De Palma, the music of Ennio Morricone, the costumes and sets, the look and style, and the performances from all the cast. Costner more than holds his own as lead after surprising everyone with his energetic performance in the previous years espionage thriller 'No Way Out'. Andy Garcia put himself on the map bigtime and of course De Niro brilliantly portrays Capone in what is a small but vital role. Personally, Billy Drago is an unsung hero of mine growing up in the 80s and was great that he was rewarded with a memorable bad guy role in a big budget movie for once. If you're a student of 80s movies you'll recognize him portraying villains' in many movies like, Pale Rider, Vamp, Hunter's Blood and Invasion USA.I don't know! I think some people like to hate on Brian De Palma because it was trendy to at some point. No real substance to it other than the fact that De Palma was an outspoken fan of Hitchcock and didn't hide that fact. So critics labeled him as a hack, which I don't agree with. I love most of De Palma's work, like, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Casualties of War, Blow Out, Mission Impossible and of course The Untouchables. Time has proven that this is a classic! So this is why I'm upgrading my score of 9/10 to 10/10.",

My problem with the movie was it tried to be two things at the same time; a family-friendly epic adventure and a gritty crime drama. The result was a full set of contrived and hokey scenes. There's no character development courtesy of the inane script. The actors spout off one cheesy line after another. Ennio Morricone's musical scores are always top-notch but this time the music doesn't fit quite well. The score sounds too upbeat and silly for the movie's vacillating tone. You also have an uninvolving antagonist in the form of Robert De Niro. All we get from him is long speeches that have nothing to do with the main plot. His scenes didn't advance the story. They only exist to show off De Niro as Capone. Furthermore, Sean Connery's performance isn't Oscar-caliber and Kevin Costner isn't convincing as Ness. Andy Garcia showed promise, but like I mentioned earlier, the screenplay didn't develop him or anybody enough for me to care. And what's worse, you get an implausible resolution set in a court room. It's a fast-paced movie with stylish images but not as great as some might suggest.",

For clarity's sake, this is not a bad movie, it's actually a pretty decent one but with all the perceived hype surrounding it I was expecting something masterful and it was fine, a bit better than fine even, but only a bit.What makes this is the cast. Costner, Connery and De Niro all in one film? Yes please. Their performances are all solid there but nothing ever feels right. The music is off, the lines lack the punch. It was like everything was just an inch, a smidge off from being something great to me. Again, the hype machine was firing full blast so maybe if I watched it again sometime I'd feel better about it, maybe the charm or magic others found here would find me but for now, on this viewing I'm left adrift in a world as a mere muggle hoping to find that spark.Again, I feel like I'm ragging on it but it gets a favorable review from me and I think those that really enjoy the crime drama genre are likely doing themselves a disservice if they haven't watched this.

            "content": "The Untouchables has little to do with reality. It's almost entirely a work of fiction. But that fact doesn't matter one bit. The historical characters are just a conduit for a simple tale of good and evil, one that, if anything, is more a western than a gangster film (albeit a western with fedoras and Tommy guns).The primary thing that makes me think of The Untouchables as a western is Ennio Morricone's score. Sure, what with his magnificent work with Sergio Leone, he's forever associated with the genre, but just listen to the music over the end credits. That's not music from a gangster film. Music that big and music that majestic belongs to a western. And then of course you have the bridge scene. Yeah you don't need to be a genius to see the horses and think of a western, but again the music gives it that feel.And of course there's the fact that you've got a posse of lawmen trying to kick some corrupt hoodlum out of town. Ness may be trying to bring law and order to the streets of 1920s Chicago, but it could easily be some dusty Midwest hellhole at the end of the nineteenth century.But talk of the film being a western is really beside the point. The only thing that really matters is whether the film works, and it works like gangbusters.However, some of the film's positives, the things that make it so watchable, are directly related to its shortcomings. For instance, the film is corny as hell. Just take the end scene where Capone's lawyer decides to change his plea. It didn't happen and it wouldn't happen, but who cares? This is a film where good triumphs over evil. This is a film where a man can survive having the entire contents of a Tommy gun magazine unloaded into his belly and live long enough to impart vital plot information. This is a movie with a capital M, and because De Palma is an excellent director, and because you care about the characters, the film transcends reality. It just isn't needed.Perhaps the shortcoming that works best is Kevin Costner's blandness. His Ness is a massive square. \"Let's do some good.\" But in the context of the film, it works brilliantly. I mean, here's a man with a shockingly happy family \u0096 he's probably the only 'cop' (yes I know he's not actually a cop) in the movies who has a wife who doesn't nag him to death \u0096 and who makes speeches about purity. He's a knob. He's a stick-in-the-mud. He's Rex Banner. Therefore it's even more satisfying when he throws the book out of the window and starts killing gangsters in cold blood. He's not the first movie character to realise that laws get you nowhere. True justice can only be obtained by breaking noses and throwing men off buildings.Then there's Sean Connery. He's the grizzled, seen it all cop who throws homespun advice at his young apprentice(s). Seriously, every line of dialogue contains some nugget of useful information. He's wiser than Gandalf, Gandhi and Yoda all put together. But somehow Connery makes it work. Not once does it grate. He's kind of like your dad. He's got an answer for everything. Although my dad has a much better accent. (He also becomes Ness' surrogate father. Just watch the rage bubble forth when Nitti insults Ness' daddy. He doesn't mind that Nitti has shot a bailiff and killed two innocent people. He only loses the plot when Nitti disparages his deceased surrogate pop. I just wish that the \"Cause you killed my friend\" line was changed to \"Cause you killed my daddy.\" That would have been much better. But speaking of that moment, I crack up at the way that Costner says that line. He's a square to the end. And another square delivery is when he has to kill the gangster in the shed. \"What is this; a game?\" Oh, the humanity.) Another shortcoming that works brilliantly is the fact that De Palma rips off (or should that be 'homages'?) Battleship Potemkin. Really it should signify a paucity of original ideas, but hey, a baby rolling down steps is timeless \u0096 he's trying to preserve purity; do you see? And De Palma gets extra points for having the bloke with a broken nose get blow away by a pump action shotgun and then having random sailors get shot in the crossfire in the shoot out that follows \u0096 I don't know why but I can never get enough of innocent people getting shot in crossfire; it's a sickness I have.And yet another thing that shouldn't work is Wallace. A short, bespectacled accountant turned untouchable? That should be awful. But here's it's brilliant. Too bad that he gets killed, though. I guess it just shows that when vertically-challenged accountants begin to get cocky, they get whacked. And I'm also impressed that Nitti manages to write his bloodstained message in double quick time. He must have done that before.Other bits of genius than transcend the material include the old man fight (I love it when Malone kicks the bloke in the balls), the corrupt Irish cop (I keep expecting him to say, \"Where's me lucky charms?\"), the prolonged death of Malone (De Palma cuts the scene to opera, just in case you thought it was a gritty, accurate depiction of events), the way that Ness' 'pure' existence (Ness himself became an alcoholic) is juxtaposed against Capone's decadent lifestyle, the 'Poor Butterfly' bit and Capone giving a motivational speech before bashing someone's brains in. Essentially it's a film of clich\u00e9s, but when clich\u00e9s work as well as this, who gives a damn?",

I don't think Elliott Ness killed a single man, for instance - certainly not someone as well known as Frank Nitti! Nor, I think, did Capone have any cops or Treasury officials killed, let alone witnesses in custody (it caused enough trouble when he had a journalist killed).So, watch this for what it is, a sort of modern western with about the same relationship to the facts as most westerns about historical characters. It has lots of enjoyable action, tremendous shootouts, some humour (I liked the accountant going wild and blowing gangsters away right and left), moral dilemmas, etc. and great performances by DeNiro and Drago. But Kostner's character (Elliott Ness) never really came alive for me, and Sean Connery certainly didn't sound American-Irish!",

            "content": "I grew up on \"The Untouchables\" and as a slice of cinema it was one of my earliest memories of true directing and style - watching De Palma's famous train station sequence used to always leave me in awe, but it wasn't until I was older that I understood and recognized some of De Palma's trademarks. Looking back on \"The Untouchables\" now I view it as a different sort of movie - it seems somewhat less operatic and more of a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, exaggerated mob movie with all of De Palma's typical touches.But then again, it isn't. Because this is really the second of two times only that De Palma has totally proved to audiences that he's able to construct a masterful thriller/drama _on his own_ without copying (or \"referencing\") Hitchcock. \"Blow Out\" is a good movie, as are many of De Palma's others, but \"The Untouchables\" and \"Scarface\" are arguably the only two he's made where it's really a De Palma movie, and not a De Palma-Hitchcock homage.\"The Untouchables\" seemed a lot better when I was younger but it's still a classic and due to my fond memories of it I'll probably always have a soft spot for it. However I do now recognize flaws I didn't used to - De Niro's Capone, for example, is a great portrayal but given awkward screen time...it works as a sort of convenient interlude to Costner and co.'s adventures - Costner kills some people, flash to De Niro yelling \"I want his head!\", flash back to Costner...it's not exactly a perfect balance as many of it just seems out-of-place...De Niro is wonderful but would losing his scenes harm the film? Not much. Instead, studying his character more would have been a wiser choice - De Palma could have easily made a three-hour epic that studies both men's stories and motivations and as a result the overall story would have been much stronger and the film better.As it is this is sort of a \"Godfather Lite\" - it's not an incredibly strong film, it has some flaws, it could have had ideas expanded, but at the end of the day it's a really great piece of entertainment with some marvelous set pieces, convincing performances and a legendary and iconic turn by De Niro, who totally steals the show from everyone else.The baseball speech scene is a classic - that's the type of stuff that makes me wish they had spent a bit more time focusing on him along with Costner, rather than just Costner.4.5/5",

            "content": "SPOILERSIn the 1930's, the American Gangster was widespread and world renown. One of the (if not THE) most famous gangsters of them all was Al Capone. On the other side of the law was Eliot Ness, the man who's goal was to put Capone behind bars. \"The Untouchables\" was the story of this rivalry.This movie begins with Ness arriving in a gang driven Chicago vowing to clean up the city. Along with his friend and adviser Jim Malone (Sean Connery), Ness takes on Capone and things then begin to get nasty.I'd love to praise this movie, I really would. In the top 250 list on this website, \"The Untouchables\" is currently around the 230 mark. Personally that feels far too high. I don't know whether it was the quality of the tape which I watched (a video which advertised \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" as coming soon to rent), or the film itself, but ultimately I felt very disappointed. Connery as Malone appears to first attempt to master the Irish accent, but then almost instantly ignores it. Then for the remainder of his screen time he appears wooden and with relatively little emotion. I fail to see how this performance could be anywhere near worthy of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. My only suggestion is that the 1988 Oscars appear to have been ridiculously weak overall. Truthfully though, it is not fair to criticize Connery solely for the flaws with this movie.As well as Connery's awful performance in \"The Untouchables\", the movie is also weak in characterisation (Connery & Costner are meant to be close but the friendship feels to be nothing other than an acquaintance), soundtrack (which is truly terrible) and dialogue.On the other hand, \"The Untouchables\" does possess a great performance by De Niro (although it's still not his best by a long distance) and it does also contain one or two nice pieces of scenery. Aside from these two aspects though, little else can be said which is positive about this movie. Some people will no doubt criticize my condemnation for this disappointing piece of cinema, but personally I just didn't find it that great.",

Garcia is completely wasted on a character who has no function and no trajectory. Connery works valiantly with the thinnest of material.\nThe script is so bad one can only imagine the pain Mamet must have suffered having to concoct this tripe and incorporate the hopeless suggestions of the (one imagines) producer, director and executives. I hope he got paid a LOT. A successsion of kiss-the-dog (or is that pat-the-wife?) scenes are probably the most embarrassing thing but really one is spoilt for choice.I guess the most ludicrous of many ludicrous things is that the 'untouchables' are portrayed as consisting of exactly four men, two of whom are killed, leaving exactly two people to bring Capone down. Despite the massive over-spending on scenery and sets, the movie never has the slightest feeling of epic scale that it oh-so-badly wants to have.I came away with new respect for Costner's ability after this movie, because alone among the cast he seemed to have some focus on his role. The rest seemed understandably adrift, caught between the clear and complete inability of the director to think in anything but cinematic cliches, and the absence of any kind of causal or emotional logic from the script.Mamet, Garcia, Costner, DeNiro, Connery... all very gifted and capable of greatness. Which leaves us with 'Snake Eyes' DePalma. How does this man get his movies made? My mouth hung open in awe (the bad kind) at his travesty of the Potemkin Steps sequence.

Burum deserved an Oscar for his heroic cinematography. The film absolutely shimmers, and you really need to see the full image to understand how much the film is visually of a piece with the rest of Brian DePalma's work.  Though the plot is minimal and the historical accuracy is for the birds, the dialogue and characterizations are tough and sure (listen particularly to the alley conversation between Malone and his old friend on the police force, a great scene I never hear anyone mention).I will not say anything about Sean Connery.   I want to praise Costner instead.  This is a man who has gotten a lot of flack for his acting, but this is the one case where he seems to have really found a role he could commit to.  He breathes the righteousness and honor of Ness down into his very shoes, and it pays off in a sincere and commanding performance.  Much praise also for his aggressive physicality in the role, from his  hurling of an envelope of cash into a would-be briber's face to his power in the train station shootout (it's him, not DePalma, who makes this scene work for me).This film is a wonderful period piece because it does not cram the period down your throat.  Instead, it seems lived-in and authentic.  The actors don't seem awed by the fact that it's the 1930s all around them.  It's just an afterthought, and that's the way it should be.See this one, and savor it.  Hooray to Brian DePalma for his best film.",

This is popcorn cinema at its best, maybe not based on complete fact, but giving its audience a great time in a two hour period that flies by.Even the most violent parts of this film about Elliott Ness (Kevin Costner) and the fight against the Al Capone mob can bring out laughter as long as it's the good guys winning. There are indeed many sad moments here, starting with the bomb that goes off in a little girl's hand, left by the sinister fictionalized version of Frank Nitti (Billy Drago in his most famous part) who has an evil smile made bigger each time he kills or makes a threat.Drago continues the terror with the shocking violence towards certain members of Ness's team. They include Charles Martin Smith as the nebbish accountant who finds out that he's handy with a gun, Andy Garcia as the Italian American, tough on the outside, but boyish when it comes to his humble nature and genial personality, and especially Sean Connery as the veteran Irish American beat cop who gives Ness the tools he needs to fight Robert DeNiro's Capone.With the Oscar winning performance of Connery, this combined the original James Bond with Costner, the most popular movie hero of the 1980's,\nand they are an incredible team. In her film debut, Patricia Clarkson is the epitome of sweetness and love, her radiant smile hiding the worry. When I first saw this in the theater, I had a feeling she's go onto bigger things, and she was getting bigger parts within the next year, going onto becoming a beloved major film, stage and TV actress.Connery truly commands every moment that he's on-screen, even in his brief moments with DeNiro, absolutely chilling as the manipulative Capone, a complete hypocrite in his claims of how he does business. The tensions in this build up to a very violent attack on Connery that does go on ridiculously far too long and defies any sense of reality. But that's the emotional key that wakes Ness up to his determination to bring an end to Capone's reign of terror and the classic scene at the Chicago train station, a homage to the silent masterpiece \"Battleship Potemkin\". So much perfection, and oh that score that sticks in your heart long after the movie is over.",

            "content": "No other director in the world better suggests Hitchcock in his/her work than Brian de Palma. Directors like Henri-Georges Clouzot, Polanski, Craven, Hooper and Francois Truffautt made indisputable footnotes and references to Hitchcock's unusual, controversial, innovative and redefining master works, although at the same time disguising their films in their own style. But Hitchcock inspired one director in particular so much to the point where he literally continued his work. De Palma in effect completely copied his teacher to such an extent as to make new Hitchcock films. This doesn't bother me as it usually would. Why? Because Hitchcock's films are the most engaging, entertaining and suspenseful ever made. Rarely have I watched films where following their conclusion, I wanted more. If Brian de Palma knows how to pull it off, then why not? He knows the formula. When he made films like The Sisters, Obsession and Dressed to Kill he must have been trying to cover up the fact that Hitchcock was coming to the end of his career, because they're almost as good as any Hitchcock film.Which brings us to De Palma's most expertly crafted film to date, \"The Untouchables\". Nothing psychological like most of his master's films, it is however very paranoid and dark, attributes that haunt Hitchcock's films from start to finish. Forgive my comparison, but you understand I look indifferently at these two directors. I'll shut up for now.Paranoia is perhaps the theme of this film about Al Capone from the perspective of the man who brought him down, Elliot Ness. While Al Capone (played with menace by Robert de Niro) as emperor of 1920s Chicago during prohibition makes violence a way of life, nobody could stand in his way. Illegal alcohol responsible for his power and employ of the government becomes an honest cop's obsession to bringing the gangster down. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) would risk his life for the American dream of justice and freedom - a quality rare in those times. Following an unsuccessful attempt to bringing the criminal down in an alcohol raid, with the public laughing behind his back, he meets his guide, mentor and the toughest cop in town named Jim Malone (Sean Connery in his definitive performance) a man with knowledge and important connections with a firm fist of an Irishman. It is Malone's loyalty, honesty and hard as nails attitude that takes Elliot Ness deeper than he had ever gone. Along for the ride is an accountant turned Untouchable Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and an uncorrupted prodigy marksman Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia). Together, as they head deeper to uncover Capone's racket, violence becomes a cat and mouse game with each side exchanging roles. But as it becomes increasingly more difficult to prove Capone's involvements, following alcohol raids, due to the paranoia and fear of losing power, he resorts to rely on his henchman who craves for a hit, especially when it involves Ness' family and Malone, the man who knows the darkest corners of Chicago. However, as Elliot Ness and his Untouchables hit a wall, the possible ultimately becomes impossible...........unless! This isn't your typical gangster movie. It has a tempo about it that wreaks of paranoia. It has the same suspicious and unsettling menace that pollutes Hitchcock's great espionage classics like \"The 39 Steps\", \"Foreign Correspondent\", \"Saboteur\", \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", \"North By Northwest\", \"Torn Curtain\" and \"Topaz\". In other words, see these films if you liked \"The Untouchables\" and you will find many scenes in those films that inspired some in de Palma's masterpiece. There is a scene in the film which stands on its own as a technically flawless achievement - the scene at the train station steps with the Peckinpah inspired shootout between Capone's and Ness' men which incorporates Eisenstein's famous pram scene from Battleship Potemkin and the brilliant technical execution of a Hitchcock 'footstep sound' technique. Here, de Palma was paying tribute to men who guided him in film making. The cast in the film is an achievement in itself. De Niro's devotion to playing hoodlums in his career has type cast him as one. His face has become synonymous with crime, and that's why his role works. He gives Capone such a one dimensional persona that you easily hate him. Kevin Costner playing Ness was good for the part. You could identify with his frustration, but in the scenes opposite Connery and Garcia, he was merely a mirage. Connery's performance was one of the most electrifying performances of the century. His tough Irishman's command is so sharp, intimidating and out right entertaining that it doesn't surprise me that the Academy Awards were blown away. Garcia's kid from a tough neighborhood role gives him a silent mystery (a role Charles Bronson tackled many times) and it makes him such an interesting character, because he isn't a criminal like he could of been coming from those parts of town. Charles Martin Smith adds comic relief and is a nice touch to a serious thriller. Oh, I can go on about this film, but it would be a crime not to mention Ennio Morricone's suspense symphony which is a work comparable to Bernard Herrmann's work. Instead of composing a score for the film's period setting, Morricone utilizes electronic sounds and blends them with an orchestra creating a kind of comic book quirky feel all the while maintaining the suspense. A definite product of the 80s, but it works - perfectly. The Untouchables not only a gangster movie. It is one of the most paranoid and suspenseful film-noirs ever made, as good even as Hitchcock's 'Notorious'. If you are new to Hitchcock or de Palma, \"The Untouchables\" is a great start to your education. And if it overwhelms you to the point where you need another fix, see the Hitchcock films mentioned and witness the brilliance of a man who bestowed upon us the greatest works of art in the history of the medium.",

As a gangster movie it's pretty far away from the best the genre has to offer. I don't think it's a poor film by any means but I just can never get involved in it as much as I hope I will. It may be down to that fact that this is only really partially a gangster film. Al Capone and his cohorts really only play a relatively minor role in proceedings, the focus is squarely on the four law enforcement men. This is a problem for me seeing as Capone is by far the most interesting character in the film. The 'Untouchables' themselves are a strangely bland foursome that just aren't terribly great characters to base this film around. If the picture had dedicated more time to Capone, it would have been a great deal more compelling in my opinion.Where the movie does work for me is in the Union Station set-piece. Brian De Palma has always been a director very much at home with cinematic stylistics, and this scene is him at his most showy. But it certainly works and it's a very well choreographed bit of action cinema. This, coupled with the rooftop chase are probably the highlights of the film as a whole. This should give you an indication that The Untouchables is a film that is more interested in thrilling the audience than giving them an authentic historical crime drama. I think maybe that's part of the problem that this movie has in that its peers in the gangster genre have often been so good that The Untouchables pales somewhat in comparison. It seems throwaway when compared to The Godfather or Goodfellas, while it lacks the sheer uncompromising attack of De Palma's earlier film Scarface. It's ultimately a good film but nothing more.",

Actually, I knew that as soon as I saw Brian De Palma's name. What I was hoping for was a solid piece of entertainment, possibly with over-the-top violence and drama a-la Scarface. I was shocked by how much I ended up disliking it.The first scene had a lot of potential, but it turned out that De Palma used up everything he had in that one shot - terrific cinematography, great art direction and costumes, and Robert De Niro. Those are pretty much the only things The Untouchables has going for it, and indeed, that first scene is one of the best in the entire film; the other standout scenes are Sean Connery's first two appearances, which probably earned him the very mysterious Oscar, but his character becomes bland in the second half and from then on his performance is less impressive, and it becomes ever more difficult to ignore his awful Irish accent. De Niro is impressive in his scenes, in a performance that's deliciously hammy and over-the-top, but it's not one of his best; even considering it's De Niro past his prime, in the rather slow period he had between Raging Bull and his comeback in Goodfellas, his Al Capone is still much less nuanced and less interesting than his characters in King of Comedy, True Confessions, The Mission, Once Upon a Time in America and Angel Heart.And still, Connery and De Niro are the best actors in this mess. Kevin Costner is wooden in Keanu Reeves levels; it doesn't help one bit that his character is one of the most deplorable in the film but played as an All-American Hero, which makes him hypocritical as well as unlikable. Charles Martin Smith, Jack Kehoe, Billy Drago and the rest are nothing but cardboard caricatures, while Andy Garcia has his moments but clearly has no idea what his character is about, no more than De Palma does. Most disturbing of all is Patricia Clarkson who gives an unintentionally eery performance as Costner's wife, who seems like something out of The Stepford Wives.On top of the bad acting and the shameless levels of historical inaccuracy, the film is a mess morally. Brian De Palma was never a master of moral ambiguity or subtlety, and here the morality is pure black and white, but he clearly doesn't really get what the story is actually about, and the result is a pretty enraging film with a hypocritical protagonist who goes on a killing spree and breaks every law possible to uphold a pointless law that he doesn't really care about, as the final scene clearly shows - yet the actor and director are both convinced that he's an infallible hero. All this in a movie full of clich\u00e9s, with some moments that were taken right out of a Hallmark movie, with every possible 30's stereotype De Palma could think of, all of it very stylish but completely devoid of emotion. The explosion scene near the beginning is a perfect example.So why, on earth, was The Untouchables so well received when it was first released? Maybe some cosmic radiation made everybody in the late 80's and early 90's think that Kevin Costner is a good actor - that was finally over when he made the combo of Waterworld and The Postman. The Untouchables at least looks great - the costumes and art direction are excellent, and for that I give it four stars; there's also a Ennio Morricone score, which has some fine themes, however those have nothing to do with what's going on on screen and are generally disruptive. The best thing I can say about The Untouchables, overall, is that it's unusual and memorable. But not in a good way.",

            "review_title": "A quality period gangster movie from the man behind \"Scarface\"",
            "content": "Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables\" is loosely based on the 1950's TV show of the same name. It follows the exploits of federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who leads a small group of 'untouchable' cops in an operation designed to topple the empire of Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro).The movie has a unique feel, which probably isn't for everyone. If you're expecting a serious crime drama like \"GoodFellas\" or \"The Godfather\", you won't find it here. Yet, the movie is violent enough to sport a well-earned 'R' rating. Ultimately, what differentiates \"The Untouchables\" from most other gangster movies is a deft admixture of action, humour and even nostalgia. To be honest, it took me a few viewings before I warmed up to the movie but now I appreciate its unique spin on this well-worn material.The cast is one of the movie's strong suits. The producers paid a high price for Robert De Niro but it was worth every penny. He delivered a larger than life performance and figured prominently in the movie's most memorable scene. Sean Connery was no slouch, either, winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone, the aging beat cop who educates Ness in the ways of Chicago. Kevin Costner's star-making performance is a good one as he was well-suited to playing the stiff, morally upright Ness. Charles Martin Smith provided a welcome dose of comic relief and a young Andy Garcia rounded out the titular squad. Other notable performances came from a memorably villainous Billy Drago and Patricia Clarkson as Ness's devoted wife.The direction by Brian De Palma shows masterful control and a keen eye throughout. Hitchcockian touches are in evidence at times and the climactic shootout includes a classic homage to Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\". Ennio Morricone's score is also well done but I think that it has a bit of a glossy 80's feel that I'm not too fond of. As for other areas of the production, the convincing period costumes and sets both deserve special mention.In the end, although \"The Untouchables\" delivers fairly lightweight entertainment it does so with quality acting, direction and production values. It may not be perfect but it's definitely good enough to warrant its status as a classic. The only thing standing in the way of an unqualified recommendation is the movie's overall tone, which skews more towards action/adventure than crime drama, potentially to the disappointment of gangster movie fans.",

This movie can seems to be predictable, which it isn't. When you see it, you think \"aha, he's gonna do that and that and that\". Later on, \"he\" does none of the things you thought he was gonna do. It can be compared to the Godfather movies, and if you do that comparing, I will have a serious problem to choose my favorite. Of course there are some differences, the Godfather are made up, and this is a true story, to a certain degree. But to be honest, I think I'll choose this one. It simply is one of the absolute best movies ever made. It is believable to the max. I have a serious trouble finding any bad parts in it that makes any sense. No, I cant find it. It simply rules.

Visually it's like the 30's, nice old cars, tommy-gun's, Canadian booze, the only thing I was missing was the 'mafia style' music, which in my opinion would have made the movie a lot more fun to watch. Instead they chose what I found disgusting Hollywoodmusic, the whole 30's sphere was taken out of the movie, which is too bad for such a movie. I now look at it as a modern action movie with a 30's decoration",

            "content": "The story is one of legend: Al Capone prohibition era reign is brought down by crusading Treasury agent Elliot Ness. What makes this better than any other version? Many factors. Firstly the director is one of the greats (when he's on target). De Palma has his weaknesses but he is technically proficient and excellent at creating tension in set pieces. Here he creates a spirit of adventure in the character of Ness but also delivers several very tense scenes where the action is slowly built up to.Secondly the story is strong enough to keep the interest throughout - you know the story but the style of telling is slick and the characters draw you in. It is a fascinating tale of the times, even when it has been fictionalised like this.The main factor looking back is the strength of the cast from top to bottom. Costner (before his career imploded) is excellent as Ness, the righteous man pushed over the limits of his morality in his quest to do right, and shows the internal struggle going on inside well. De Niro enjoys himself as the unpredictable Capone and many of his scenes here have become part of everyone's knowledge (the baseball bat!). Garcia and Martin Smith do well in support while Connery is strong as Jim Malone, the Irish (!) beat cop who becomes Ness's mentor. I'm not sure the Oscar was totally deserved but it's still a good performance.",

Of course, a patent example, is the train station shootout, on the stairs. I must say it was cool, but also was kind of really aggravating. I really felt there really could of been more pumped into the story and characters, here with this pic. The story line, where the subject of boot legging, was used, was really a letdown. Watching Costner in this again, as Ness, I really can't say he was good or bad, where honestly I'd be pointing towards the latter, to be frank. His wife, played by the great Patricia Clarkson, was wasted. Connery is just sheer fantastic, in the performance of his career, where the other two of Costner's justice seeking troupe are very good, especially Charles Martin Smith. De Niro, is brilliant of course, in an underrated and unappreciative performance as Al Capone, for what lesser number of scenes he has. I really wish I saw more of him. Another memorable standout with Billy Drago, again as evil remorseless scum, and lead henchman of Deniro's, who takes one might say, a memorable fall, before bloodying it up on his landing. De Palma has some unforgettably memorable, moments, like Costner, newly formed group, taking it to the streets. One really feels, the makers have focused too much on style, sets, whatever, where really the essence of story hasn't cut deep enough, where it's more skimming it's surface, but hey, it's decided to go this way, with the less approach, and in this case, has gotten away with it.",

All these actors surpassed the acting of Costner, who was also good, but not at the level of the others mentioned.

Between second-rate director Brian De Palma and above average screenwriter David Mamet, the film is given moments too intense to be remotely realistic. The oft-praised `Odessa Steps' shoot-out scene is ludicrous in content, and the bridge shoot-out isn't much better. Having just praised Mamet, I pin these scenes on Brian De Palma, the most over-rated director in the history of film.

Not many, maybe: but no-one whosoever would predict that he made a better one, within five years, especially. But he did, and in doing so, he created the perfect gangster movie: passionate, stylish and emotionally jerking, this is both stunningly graphic and surprisingly beautiful.1930's, Chicago. Al Capone (played superbly by De Niro) proudly proclaims what a success he is, and that he is in no way involved with any illegal shipments of alcohol, or any violent crime. He denies, very strongly, that he does not kill anyone who refuses to buy his products.The next day, Chicago: a little girl goes to boil her water in a local pub, and the owner refuses to a man dressed in white to buy any liquor. He 'accidently' leaves behind his briefcase. The girl notices, and runs out to give it to him, but before she even gets out, the briefcase explodes in her face, as well as destroying the whole pub. The man gets in his car and drives away.Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, his best performance) is a cop, a recent signing to the Chicago law enforcement team. He's a treasury officer, and on arrival with this news of the bombing, he becomes more eager to get Capone. A meeting with the mother (in an extremely heartfelt scene-trust me, you won't be expecting to cry so early on) really shows him what this man, Capone, is doing to the city. He's a crook, and he must be stopped.But his first assignment is a complete bust. Instead of picking up the alcohol, he gets the umbrellas, and becomes the laughing stock of the whole department. Not only does this hugely embarrass Ness, it fuels Capone to hilarity- thus is the start of a feud that will end more than one life...This film is superb on so many levels. As well as the action set pieces being excellent (if surprisingly violent- for its time, how did this get a UK '15' certificate) but it also has a majestic and epic feel to it. The emotions of both sides are shown and played out marvellously- particularly when Irish Cop Malone (Sean Connery) comes into the picture.Perhaps the most shocking scene, in ways, is the best. As Al Capone mercilessly beats the head in of a fellow 'family' member, and the blood spills across the table cloth, it really proves this is no popcorn picture. Fans of gory films will be pleased, but in some ways subdued. This is not gory for fun, or to push boundaries- this is gory to show in what graphic details these psychopaths will go through.An achievement that stands tall, 'The Untouchables' is a classic. This is very tense, very violent and very emotive: a must see, and the best picture 'De Palma' has done.",

From there I found more and more reasons to keep watching, mucho thanks to film-scoring legend of Ennio Morricone for bringing me into the world of the Untouchables.  De Palma's always been a director who keeps me on my toes.  I love one of his movies, hate the next, feel \u0091eh' about the next after that.  He's daring and different, I'll give him that, but generally his movies don't score to high with me (especially if he overuses split screens). \nUntouchables is a more normal/traditional in its look and feel compared to typical De Palma material that's bursting with avant guard artistic style, and a more normal film seems like the right way to go with this material. Of course, when I say `normal/traditional' I'm not saying it's boring Hollywood formula.  This is De Palma we're talking about.  And yes, he still directs with awe-inspiring flair particularly in the raids sequences.  One of the final major sequences in the movie - the hunt for Capone's bookkeeper involves a particularly brilliant shootout on the steps of a subway.  The camera work, actors performances, and Morricone's music merge beautifully and seamlessly - everything moves with crystal clarity in narration while never losing a stylish touch.All the characters may be the typical team you see assembled in similar films; however, the actors' performances rise above the stereotype potential and play their characters with just enough believability that they're something more.  I like Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness, the simple wholesome man in the middle of a war he'd rather not be in but has sworn to fight.  I really sympathized with him and his family.  Sean Connery deserved his Oscar for his portrayal of the streetwise and cunning Jim Malone; the interactions between Ness and Malone carried an interesting wit about them that left me grinning every time the two would exchange words.  Robert De Niro is a delight as the infamous and carefree Al Capone with his over-the-to showboating to the media.  Nods to Andy Garcia and Charles Martin-Smith with less to do, but still make the most of their screen time.I had a lot of fun with the Untouchables, and as of right now it's probably my favorite De Palma film.",

This movie was...well...not terrible, but it sure wasn't what I'd call good. On second thought, this movie was terrible. The acting was stale (even De Niro, sad to say), the screenplay was clich\u00e9-ridden, the cinematography was substandard (even for De Palma), the soundtrack was cheesy and unsuited to the action, the storytelling was implausible and pathetic, and the gunfights were laughable. And to top off all of the gooey goodness that is this film, the audience is treated to the most ridiculous and frankly idiotic courtroom sequence I've ever seen put to film. This movie tries to survive by placing a gunfight or a gallon of blood into every scene, and fails simply because it's too cheesy and contrived to be a serious drama, and too dull to be a true action movie.Now, I realize that a lot of people must have liked this movie (#237?), so my problem is probably that I'm an idiot or that I watched The Karate Kid too many times in my youth. Still, I simply don't understand what people thought was great about this film. I gave it four stars out of ten because I liked the homage to Battleship Potemkin. You know, the baby carriage on the stairs? I think it was during the 800th (give or take) gunfight in this movie. Anyway, that's my two cents. Don't bother.",

            "content": "There are some rare moments in film history when stars collide and movies are created with the fabric of sheer brilliance. This is one of these rare occasions.Brian De Palma is not the \"star\" of his film. Unlike the majority of his other work, he takes a step back and guides the \"orchestra\" masterfully. Every single shot of this movie is beautiful and appropriately placed. It feels like the director leaves his usual radical and personal style for a more conventional approach. The viewer is actually transported to the heart of 30s Chicago, partly of what it really was, partly of what urban lore has made us believe it was. One could say that this is the blueprint of Gotham city, in the batman mythos (1989's \"Batman\" by Tim Burton definitely feels like a dark spiritual cousin of this film). Anyway, to make you feel like you are actually in the heart of a city that has become legendary for its gangster activity is an incredible feat. Of course, whenever the plot delves into more \"thriller-like\" or suspenseful territory, De Palma grasps the opportunity and wrecks our nerves with his masterful approach. One of his most typical settings for a chase scene (in many of his movies) is a train/subway station, but the one in this film has to be one of the most gripping in the history of cinema! However, this movie would never have been what it is without its main feature: undoubtedly one of the best casting ensembles ever to grace the big screen. It feels like every actor was born to play his respective role. Obviously, Sean Connery steals the show with his Oscar winning performance. But apart from his highly praised performance, everybody else in the film fit their roles like hand in glove.The only drawback in this movie is the generic, soulless music by, the otherwise genius of a composer, Ennio Morricone. There's not much melody going on, just some random string chord progressions backed by terrible 80s synth drums. One of the great maestro's all time lows.Of course this is a minor detail in a movie of uncanny brilliance. If you are a casual movie-goer, this movie is guaranteed 2-hour entertainment, but if you are a longtime movie lover this movie will make you fall in love with cinema all over again. A real beauty!",

            "review_title": "Untouchable In It's Genre",
            "content": "I just revisited this film after having viewed it many times over. Not to date myself but I saw it premier in theaters when I was 17 years old. In this viewer's opinion it remains De Palma's best gangster crime drama, although it was a tough choice considering, \"Scarface\" and \"Carlito's Way\". This film has outstanding direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The ensemble cast includes artists such as Costner, Connery, De Niro, Garcia, Smith, Clarkson, Drago and Kehoe. The entire cast including the supporting cast deliver superb performances. However it is Costner, Connery, Garcia and De Niro who command the screen. De Niro even uses his method acting which he is liable to do. The film starts off blazing with Al Capone surrounded by his henchmen trying to reason with reporters why people are going to do what they want to do and he is simply responding to their will as an honest businessman. The plot is set during the late 1920's Prohibition and revolves around Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness who is assigned the task of taking down Capone, the mob kingpin of the entire city of Chicago. Ness is leading a special task force and is as straight as a shooter, pun intended, as they come. He immediately encounters corruption within his task force which forces him to go outside to find his own team. In steps Jimmy Malone who is an Irish-American veteran beat cop and is reluctant to join Ness at first. He agrees to work with Ness if he will let him do things his way which sometimes means thinking and acting like a criminal. Next is George Stone who is a hot tempered Italian-American sharp shooter straight out of the academy. Ness next consults with U.S. Treasury Agent Oscar Wallace who determines the best way to nab Capone is through tax evasion as he has not filed an income tax return for several years. Ness encounters more corruption when he is offered a bribe to drop the case against Capone as he is feeling the loss of income and heat from Ness. Capone dispatches his hitman Frank Nitti to threaten Ness' family in another attempt to back off. During a raid to intercept a liquor shipment at the Canadian - U.S. border the team captures Capone's bookkeeper George. Jimmy slyly hoodwinks a brisk agreement from George to cooperate with the investigation. Wallace and George are heading to a safe house, but encounter Nitti dressed as a cop and do not make it. Jimmy intuitively knows the Chief of Police Dorsett sold Wallace and George out to Nitti. He confronts Dorsett and beats the location of Capone's chief bookkeeper Walter Payne out of him. Later that night Jimmy is ambushed by Nitti and is bullet ridden by a Tommy gun. Before he passes Jimmy is able to inform Ness of Walter's plan to leave town. Walter eventually testifies in court about Capone's untaxed income, but it takes some chicanery on Ness' part to make things happen. The judge won't accept evidence of jury tampering and right before the judge is going to claim a mistrial Ness implies that there are many powerful politician's names in the bookkeeping ledger showing payoffs by Capone. This prompts the judge to immediately switch the current jury for a jury in an adjacent courtroom. The plot is thrilling, clever, intelligent, action packed, ingenious, cathartic, duplicitous, gritty, poetic and has a liberating end. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Ness confronts Capone in his hotel lobby over the killings of Wallace and George. It is an intense scene. My favorite quotes are from a scene where Ness and Nitti are on a rooftop after Ness is aware that it was Nitti who murdered Jimmy. Nitti says to Ness, \"You're friend squealed like a stuck Irish pig\". Ness tosses him from the rooftop and yells, \"Did he sound anything like that?\". It is a riveting exchange. This film has sublime direction by De Palma shot in his signature format and is bravura in it's genre. It remains a timeless classic.",

The script is over the top cheese at times and at other times it's really good but the acting is over the top - except for Costner, who is simply a mediocre actor.  Sorry Kevin, it's the truth - you don't make the role great, it's the other way around usually.For the most part, The Untouchables would've been five times better except you were utterly distracted from the events taking place by the absolute worst soundtrack since Ladyhawk.I give this movie 5 of 10, and 4 of those points are simply for some of the cinematography and for Connery.",

            "content": "The Untouchables is a brilliant,stylish and unforgettable classic and one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with excellent direction,a great cast,a powerful film score,an amazing script and fantastic cinematography,The Untouchables is Brian De Palma,Crime Drama and Cinema at it's best.Based on the television series and book of the same name and set in Chicago,Illnois in the 1930s during prohibition,The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness(Kevin Costner),a Federal agent in the Treasury Department who has been brought to Chicago to stop the flow of illegal liquor and to stop gangster crime boss Al Capone(Robert De Niro). After finding little success,Elliot enlists the help of veteran Chicago Cop Jim Malone(Sean Connery)to help form a team of cops called The Untouchables to get Capone. Now,with the help of two other cops Oscar Wallace(Charles Martin Smith)and George Stone(Andy Garcia),Elliot and Jim prepare to take down Capone at all costs and do it the Chicago way.The Untouchables is one of those excellent films that is an instant classic from beginning to end and is a film that you will never forget and it's also a film where everything the direction,the writing,cast and score just seems to work in a flawless way. The Untouchables is an epic Crime Drama that pulls into the world of the violent prohibition era of the 1930s in Chicago where violence is the name of the game and the only law in Chicago is a gun and money and gangsters rule the world. The Untouchables is great film because of the way it rewrites history and takes real life characters(Elliot Ness,Al Capone)and puts them in a fictional tale that feels very real but in a cinematic way and everything in the film is bigger than life. I know that some critics and viewers have complained about this film not being very realistic or true to real life events or facts but The Untouchables is a movie of entertainment not a documentary. The Untouchables is a great Gangster film and one of the few Gangster films where the events is mostly told from the cops point of view and not the Gangsters and instead of rooting for the gangsters you are rooting for the cops in a battle of good and evil and you want The Untouchables to win. The Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum is beautiful and visually stunning,with Burum bringing a stylish feel to the film where the atmosphere is dark with harsh lighting at night with blue colors and beautiful orange and yellow lighting during the day while bringing an accurate feel of Chicago in the 1930s. Flawlessly,The Untouchables balances out the light and dark not just with the characters but with the cinematography. The main characters Elliot Ness and Jim Malone are great because it's almost like a Father and son relationship where Jim is trying to teach Elliot the ways of how Chicago works and how you get Al Capone. Where as Elliot wants to do everything within the law,Jim tells Elliot to do it the Chicago way with a gun and aggressiveness and take Al Capone down that way. The relationship between Elliot and Jim is truly classic and will stay with you. Al Capone in The Untouchables is portrayed as being larger than life a gangster who rules the city of Chicago with a gun and iron hand but is loved by the media because of his charisma and quotes but underneath that charisma is a guy that is evil and brutal and will kill you when he gets the chance. Capone in this film is evil personified. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent and memorable,with Mamet giving the main characters tough and gritty dialog that reflects Chicago but is also done in Mamet's masterful style and most of the great scenes with Mamet's dialog is classic and doesn't miss a beat. The Action and gunfight scenes in the film are great and electrifying because each Action scene is done with fantastic build-up and suspense and when the Action happens you are on the edge of your seat especially the Train station scene which in my opinion is one of the best Action scenes in movie history. The ending of The Untouchables is wonderful and will have you cheering at the screen and is one of the many reasons The Untouchables is an amazing classic.The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Elliot Ness,with Costner bringing optimism,toughness and depth to the role. Sean Connery earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his excellent performance as Jim Malone. Connery brings grit,humor and greatness to the role and has great chemistry and scenes with Costner. Charles Martin Smith is wonderful as Agent Oscar Wallace,an accountant. Andy Garcia is fantastic as George Stone,a cop that is a great sharpshooter. Robert De Niro is amazing and at his best as Al Capone,with De Niro bringing charisma and pure evil to the role. Billy Drago is great and unforgettable as Frank Nitti,a Capone guard and assassin Richard Bradford(Police Chief Mike Dorsett),Jack Kehoe(Walter Payne),Brad Sullivan(George),Patricia Clarkson(Catherine Ness),Vito D'Ambrosio(Bow-tie Driver)and Steven Goldstein(Scoop)give good performances as well.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera using great camera angles as well as zooms and close-ups and giving the film a masterful visual style. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,epic,powerful and one of the greatest scores in movie history. Morricone's score is big,stylish and unforgettable and fits in with the tone of the movie and matches every scene in the film and raises the film to a higher level. Another masterful score from Morricone.In final word,if you love Brian De Palma,Crime Dramas,Gangster Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Untouchables,a brilliant and unforgettable classic that will stand the test of time and is a film that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

Kevin Costner isn't bad either since this is the era before his career took a nosedive.It's probably the most underrated gangster film of all time.

            "content": "In prohibition-era Chicago crime lord extraordinaire Al Capone (Robert De Niro) builds a sizable fortune and powerful empire through the sale of illegally imported booze and moonshine. As portrayed in the movie even the law enforcement officials are either corrupt, deeply saddled in Capone's pocket, or basically blindsided towards alcohol given the stupidity and infeasibility of the prohibition. In the midst of these affairs Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) assembles together a group of incorruptible individuals to turn the tide on the faltering war. Amongst his crew is Jim Malone (Oscar-winner Sean Connery), a dated Irish cop, who patrols the streets in an attempt to detach himself from the lawlessness rife in the police force.A meticulously delivered feature focused on details, sets, designs and captivating scenes, it does however have to cope with a less than stellar script, which skews the historical facts, rushes through to get to the end act and disdainfully disrupts the legend. For one thing Ness and his Untouchables count at a measly four people, a head-count introduced to be able to better flesh out characters, but ultimately causes the force to feel vulnerable, rag-tag and random. What's more the story-building jumps in leaps and bounds - one scene the merry band has just been formed, the next Capone is on the verge of being imprisoned. There is no sense of committed long-term police work on the boundaries of the law, only a rushed conclusion detached from history as well as proper dramatic pull. Ultimately the short-cuts introduced manage to lessen the impact of the story, despite the true sequence of events being such a strong source of material. An example of how tampering with history to deliver a reduxed movie version of events was extremely detrimental to the end product.Time has not been all that gracious for \"The Untouchables\" as character interaction feels outdated, mainly due to excess amount of corny corn on the cob, rushed developed and solutions unacceptable by todays standards making one question the reason behind Sean Connery's Oscar award.Nonetheless several tense scenes (the train station stake-out, the house attack on Jim Malone or the border crossing) cause the movie to stand out and remain a memorable experience, despite the countless other flaws inherent to the story. The moral ambiguity, however glossed over and underdeveloped, of the story, with Elliot Ness showing a disdain for the prohibition law itself, but a unwaning support for its enforceability, while Jim Malone drinks alcohol from his hidden stash, gives a powerful insight into the absurdity of the times. The fact that almost no one stood behind the law, indeed allowed for the creation of crime syndicates, where the whole society basically showed its fingers to the lawmakers and their ineptitude to see the bigger picture.",

            "content": "As others have pointed out- the historical inaccuracies are just far too many to count. This is problematic when you're making a movie based on very well known real people, and is incredibly distracting. Be wary of anyone claiming to be a history buff who missed that. In its favor, it does get across some of the problems with Prohibition, and at least some of its more devastating after-effects. Especially given that this is de Palma, the parallels to our modern drug war are inevitable. And unlike so many Mafia movies, the mobsters are portrayed as villains, not as amusing family men. Thanks to de Niro, you see Capone's charisma, but feel no sympathy. Unlike quite a few here, I got the fact that many scenes were meant to be HOMAGE, rip-off. I don't love de Palma, but he knows his film, and he knew exactly what he was doing. I enjoyed the nod to the true classic gangster movies. But even given that, I found the baby carriage scene maddening. The action was great and well-executed, and the unbelievable nature of Garcia's shot didn't bother me. But the thing with the baby was overly heavy-handed and drawn out. Puh-leeze. I don't think Costner is much of an actor, and his gesture towards a mid-Western accent is about as far as he can go. But his non-acting almost works here, as it does in a few of his other films such as Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. I say almost works because some of his actions seem strangely unmotivated and out of character. I'm referring especially to his throwing Nitti off the building, which is historically completely wrong, and highly questionable from both an ethical and film-making standpoint.\nConnery is his usual, but fantastic self. This was definitely one of those \"body of work\" Oscars, and I'm fine with that.  Overall, this film is over-rated as both a classic and a historical piece. But it is better than most, and is certainly engaging and entertaining.",

But it takes more than exciting gunplay to make an epic gangster drama, and all the usual film school references expected from director Brian De Palma (a famous Hitchcock plagiarist) can't hide the cartoon trappings.The end result is the sort of summertime adventure that passed for popular entertainment in the late 1980s, a grand and artificial gangland opera designed with careful attention to reliable stereotypes, right down to the disposition of the incorruptible quartet of G-Men, shown striding abreast and in step down the vice-riddled avenues of Prohibition-era Chicago: the idealistic, na\u00efve leader; his salty veteran partner, a crack-shot rookie cop; and a meek, comic relief accountant who naturally becomes a terror with a shotgun.Robert De Niro steals the film with his over-the-top caricature of Al Capone, but (true to life) his conviction on tax evasion charges lacks a satisfying narrative punch. The script (written by David Mamet, apparently while he was sleeping) takes so many other liberties with the facts, so why not have Big Al brought down in a final, heroic hail of gunfire instead?",

The remake features a virtual powerhouse of stars including Costner, Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor), Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia. De Niro is perfectly cast as the malicious Al Capone delivering a great performance despite having limited screen time. De Niro appeared to be far more selective in his roles in the 1980s/90s before he whole heartedly embarked on the comedy scene which has had mixed results (Meet the Parents was good whilst Show Time was not, and don't even talk about Rocky & Bullwinkle). It is reassuring to see De Niro do what he does best and with complete conviction to the role. Sean Connery steals the limelight from Costner as the experienced cop who knows how to bring Capone down: \"They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way, and that's how you get Capone!\" Costner is also very good as the young idealistic Ness who gradually abandons his ideals and becomes more and more like his enemy. A young Garcia is well cast as the cocky sharp shooter fresh out of the academy. Brian De Palma's movies have been very varied and include Carrie, Raising Cain and Bonfire of the Vanities. I personally feel that his best work falls under the gangster genre (Scarface, Carlitos Way) and the Untouchables is a fine addition to this portfolio. The Untouchables does have an underlying feeling of depression (although this is probably accurate given the era in which it is set!). Within the movie this is also likely to stem from the gradual demise of each member of Ness' team but this also appears to be characteristic of Palma's films (a depressing tone as opposed to death). Whilst everyone contributes a good performance the viewer does not truly get to know the main characters. Whilst we understand that Ness is somewhat blinded by his ideology and committed to upholding the law and defending his family we can not help but feel distanced from the other members his team including Malone (Connery) whose past is relegated to a passing comment. Whilst one can not expect detailed character development for multiple individuals without creating an excessive running time (already almost 2 hours) one can not help but think this could have been achievable with some tweaks to the dialogue. Overall, strong performances, a good story and some beautifully filmed action sequences (the pram on the train station stairway is a popular favourite) form an excellent film that is likely to stand the test of time. Credit should also be given to the excellent costume design, score and beautiful re creation of 1930s Chicago. The Untouchables should take its place as a classic in the gangster movie hall of fame.",

            "content": "Back in the 1930s, the gangster film was considered the most critically and commercially successful genre for studios to invest in, probably because so much of what was shown on screen rang so close to home and seemed very real to its contextual audience. Warner Brothers stood at the forefront of this revolution, almost solely on the back of James Cagney, an actor who made a life out of portraying 'tough guy' Americanised Mafiosi, and creating the archetypal figure that forms in the mind of modern-day audiences when they hear the word 'gangster.' With The Untouchables, Brian De Palma has directed an excellent homage to Cagney's crime classics, synchronising the plot and script of those films with a modern self- reflexive undertone not unlike that used in fellow 80's noir thriller Blade Runner.The film stars Kevin Costner as Federal Agent Elliot Ness and is set in Prohibition-era Chicago. Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules the streets, supplying illegal alcohol to those who want it and bribing those who don't. Contrary to popular belief, the film's title refers not to the criminals, but the small team Ness assembles to combat this corruption, including ageing cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar-winning role), accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and newbie George Stone (Andy Garcia).As mentioned above, The Untouchables applies a plot formula used an infinite amount of times since the 1930s: the confrontation of good versus evil, and how the pursuit of victory impacts each side. In fact, the plot is not the only convention De Palma has adapted from the earliest of crime films. The production crew pulls out all the stops to add authenticity to the setting, from the buildings, to the cars, to the clothes (legend has it De Niro tracked down Al Capone's personal tailor and asked him to design his wardrobe). But the biggest wink to the audience is delivered through the characters and indeed, the script itself.Through the first, say, half hour of The Untouchables, you might find yourself questioning its reputation as a respected classic. Much of the dialogue appears cheesy, and the characters over-the-top in their delivery and general mannerisms. However, as the film progresses, it becomes clear that it was written in such a way as to appear like a movie straight out of the Depression years (where characters seemed excessively emotive and outlandish in their behaviour by today's standards); and the sooner that is understood, the more enjoyable and engaging one will find the movie.Within this delightful script is a multitude of likable, well-developed characters. Connery's imposing presence and husky voice made him an excellent choice for the no-nonsense Malone, but it is arguably De Niro who delivers the best performance. Used sparingly, he makes the most of his screen time with the best dialogue of any character, seamlessly shifting his character's demeanour from charming (cracking jokes with members of the press) to macabre (all I have to say is: 'baseball, gentlemen!'). Finally, the camera is used in often-breathtaking fashion throughout the film. Long tracking shots build suspense, and the camera's involvement in a particular scene involving an assassination was (for me, at least) the turning point from which the film excelled from good to great. And although it has since become Scorsese who has made the steadycam shot a key weapon in his arsenal (think entering the Copacabana in Goodfellas), De Palma uses it to excellent effect, some three years earlier than Marty's triumph, no less. And by the climax, everything combines to form De Palma's best film. And remember, this man made Scarface.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

            "content": "I am a great fan of the original Untouchables TV series. While it was largely fiction, it was entertaining, had some memorable villains and lots of great actors (er, Special Guest Stars), like William Bendix, Nehemiah Persoff and Claire Trevor, just to name a few. I'd heard somewhere that the '87 DePalma movie was supposed to be more realistic and closer to fact. Well, I heard wrong. There might be a spoiler or two in here, just in case you haven't seen it.My first criticism is a technical one. Near the beginning there are a lot of close-ups on Eliot Ness and his wife as they move about their house. I found this to go on for too long and it made me feel claustrophobic. The opening scene with Robert DeNiro as Al Capone was a complete rip-off from an earlier scene in the great \"Key Largo\". Like Johnny Rocco (played by my favorite actor, Edward G. Robinson), Capone is getting a shave. It was okay, I guess. Maybe if I'd have know what was coming later I'd have disliked it more.Speaking of rip-offs, there's a later scene that features a shoot out on a staircase, complete with a woman pushing a baby carriage. This is STRAIGHT out of Film History 101: the Odessa Steps scene in \"Potemkin\", by Sergei Eisenstein. Okay, it was well done, and it could be excused. I'm not sure that many casual moviegoers would be aware of it or even care.But then there's the Canadian Border scene, in which our heroes raid a convoy of bootleggers on horseback. So good so far. Soon the inevitable gunfight erupts. The air is thick with bullets. Maybe these horses were possessed of magical powers. They either dodge the bullet saturated air or the bullets pass right through them. I guess that's why they use blanks. I tried to sink down low in the chair in case anyone I knew might see me. This was where I realized I'd been suckered into yet another summer film for kids out of school.There's a final point. At the end of the movie (big spoiler here), Ness gets into a fight with the evil Frank Nitti. He puts up a mighty struggle, but finally Ness gets the upper hand and tosses Nitti off the roof, presumably to his death. Okay, maybe it's not that big a spoiler since we all know Ness is going to win in the end.There's a slight problem with this scene. Nitti, the real Frank Nitti, was NEVER thrown off a roof. In real life he committed suicide after he was convicted and sentenced to prison. So much for the movie being more true to fact.I was also disappointed to see Sean Connery get an Academy Award for this. He's done many better films, but I guess the Academy members felt he was due an award and this was the only film he was in that year. He was probably the best thing in this movie, but the rest of it was so predictable that it was too much for his performance to overcome.If you want to see a much better movie, try to find the original Untouchables pilot, \"Scarface Mob\". It has another of my all time favorite actors, Neville Brand, as Scarface Al Capone, Bruce Gordon as Frank \"The Enforcer\" Nitti and Robert Stack as Eliot Ness. Their performances are excellent. Here's a bit of trivia: The Chicago Outfit actually put a contract on Desi Arnaz, whose Desilu Studios produced the original Untouchables, because they didn't like how Frank Nitti was portrayed. I doubt the later version managed to evoke such a response, except perhaps by dissatisfied viewers....",

            "review_title": "About as good as a De Palma film can get",
            "content": "Brian De Palma is a well-known director; I guess what he is known for is taking a theme that, in one way or another, involves violence and action, and he puts it on the silver screen, with immense amounts of both violence and action, labeled as drama, instead of more conventional drama. We saw it with Carrie, we saw it with Scarface, and now, we see it with The Untouchables. Now, those are the only three movies of his that I've seen, but if all of his movies are like this, then so be it. If not, then please forgive me for this review, and chalk it up to ignorance on my part. The plot is very good, and mostly well-paced; I understand that it's not entirely accurate to the original, actual story of Al Capone, but it's based somewhat on him. Personally, as long as the film is interesting, and somewhat true to facts, I don't mind the film not being the real story. Now, I said the pace was *mostly* good; once the first hour and a half has passed, the film goes a little slowly for the next fifteen minutes or so, but then it picks up again, and doesn't drag at all for the rest of the picture. The acting is all great; Costner, Connery, Garcia, Martin Smith, De Niro... even the supporting cast was great; I seriously doubt that Frank Nitti could have been portrayed better than Billy Drago did. His snake-like appearance and behavior was excellent, really made the character. Robert De Niro probably gives the most impressive performance in the whole film; unfortunately, he gets far too little screen time. Whenever you do see him on-screen, you thoroughly enjoy it. The four \"untouchables\" have great chemistry, which is what really makes their \"team\" work, together with their diverse personalities. The way they did the whole late twenties look, with the cars, the buildings, the clothes, etc. was great. It looks and feels authentic. The dialog was well-written, but the film does arguably have too many one-liners, for this type of film. The action is well-done, well-choreographed and very cool. The shootouts, the chasing... the film also seemed to have a very impressive amount of great, memorable scenes, for such a short gangster piece(compared to, say, The Godfather, which is three hours long). The score is excellent; Ennio Morricone usually does great scores, and this is no exception. The cinematography is pretty impressive, and De Palma makes great use of closeups, pans, zooming and long takes. All in all, a great film that is just slightly less than a masterpiece. Maybe De Palma could have made it greater, had he just toned the action down(not that I would want that, honestly; I'm fine with how the film and his overall style of film-making is), but decided to make it more \"accessible\" instead. Maybe he's just incapable of making a true masterpiece, due to his style. Who knows. I recommend this to any fan of gangster/mafia films, any of the actors, and/or Brian De Palma. 8/10",

The story is about law enforcers in 1920s Chicago who go after Al Capone and other mobsters.The long-running TV show is given a new polish in this showy, violent and widely popular gangster picture. Director Brian De Palma stages some spectacular sequences, most famously a re-creation of the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin (1925), but at a railway station. It looks lavish, Ennio Morricone's score ensures it sounds wonderful and David Mamet reins himself in with some crisp, pointed dialogue.

            "content": "Recently I watched this flim. My parents recommended it to me and after I saw the very high imbd rating I thought I'd give it a try and let me tell you, I greatly regret my choice.The story is a bland cop flick set in the early 30s during Prohabition era. Good guy FBI agents are assigned to help take down Al Capone. There's theme's of by the book cop vs the \"unorthodox\" cop (by unorthodox I mean loves police brutality) which has been tons of times before and the flim kinda pushes the message that both are equally valid by having the by having Ness straight commit police brutality by pushing a guy off of a roof which kills them. There is the underdog element where no one believes Ness will take down Capone totally not something that was done a thousand times in other movies in various ways before this one. So yeah generic cop flim thats been transplanted into the early 30s.The acting here ranges from passable to cartoonish in this flim. Kevin Costner and Sean Connery are on the passable spectrum. They play their characters good enough for this flim but they aren't interesting characters nor does the actors make them interesting and Sean Connery certainly didn't deserve an oscar for this role. They are just playing generic cop archetypes here. On the cartoonish spectrum are Robert De Niro and Billy Drago who play their characters as if they are Saturday mourning cartoon villians.The score by Ennio Moricone is an overly cheesy score that only serves to take cheesy scenes and elevate them into parody levels of cheesy. It's not good. It sounds way too much like other movies that were coming out around that time.The way this movie is directed is very reminiscent of early Speilberg movies apart from the sudden violent scenes which are a lame attempt to make the movie more interesting. This flim serously doesn't know if its a kids flim or an adults flim and the result is a movie too childish for adults and too violent for kids.",

            "content": "O kay, this was a good action flick, probably De Palma's best (unlike the drudgery of Scarface), but if your in it to learn about the real Untouchables and there hunt for Al Capone, watch the History Channel, because this is not what actually happened. For one thing, none of the Untouchables were killed by Capone or his gang, nor did they see any action, with the exception of busting open crates of Hooch.What I find most laughably inaccurate is when Eliot Ness throws Frank Nitti off the court house roof. Truth be told, after Capone was sent on his little vacation to prison, Frank Nitti took over Capone's Empire (though I don't think he did anything to make headlines). Now remember, I said it is still a good action movie.I though De Niro was awesome Al Capone. He kept a cool head around the press, but when it came down to business, he was stone cold. I always like De Niro's roles, and this one is no exception. He was fun to watch. I loved that scene in the beginning when the barber cuts him shaving (while the cameras are on him), and everyone is in shock waiting to see what he does, and the barber looks as though he's about to have a heart attack, and he just cleans it off and says 'don't worry about it'.Kevin Costner is a top notch actor, one of the best, and he really showed it in this. From watching people talk about him on t.v. and reading articles about the real Eliot Ness, it sounds like Kevin Costner really nailed it down. Sean Connery, in his Oscar winning role, is the hardened Irish beat cop turned Untouchable for his knowledge of the street and his tough as nails way to deal with crooks. I think he was my favorite character, and Sean Connery did a great job as Jim Malone.All in all, this was fun to watch for it's great action sequences ( the best was the train station gun fight), it's great acting, and the authentic 1930's Chicago background (which is my favorite city). Watch it for the above, but don't expect a history lesson, because that would leave you falsely informed. 8/10",

The film is saved by the performance of Connery, not to mention the Set Design, Cinematography and the Directing. DePalma makes good work of the script which doesn't really have a great ending as we all know Capone was thrown away for the laughable tax evasion. De Palma however does create some memorable scenes such as the Cabin, Train Station and Connrery's death. This film could have been great put the script is the biggest let down and I believe De Palma and his stylish team saved it from being just another good film.",

And taking on Al Capone, devoting himself to the task, was Treasury man Elliott Ness and his team, known as \"The Untouchables.\" This movie is very loosely based on those historical events, and is also in lineage with an old TV series of the same name. It's no history lesson, but it does give a bit of a taste of the era and - most important for a movie - it's entertaining. It's pretty graphic at times, and at other times it manages to be humorous. From time to time it even brings out an emotional reaction in the viewer.I give credit to the cast. The movie featured strong performances all round. As Ness and Capone, Kevin Costner and Robert de Niro were excellent, and Sean Connery (in an Oscar winning turn) shone as Ness's associate Malone. The atmosphere of the movie was excellent, especially in portraying the extent of the corruption in the city at the time: from police to the judiciary and all the way to the mayor. It was actually pretty sobering in that sense. As well done as it was, my only criticism would be that it seems to only barely scratch the surface of Capone's criminal empire, and his trial seems anti-climactic. Otherwise, it's very well done.

But I can see why this movie was such a entertaining and cool movie that left an impact in the 80's. The plot is loosely based on a true story about a Federal Agent Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) and his team taking down Al Capone(Robert De Niro) a notorious gangster that resided in Chicago and this flick takes place in the 1930's. Sean Connery is the one is the one that stands out the most in this film as Eliot's partner Jimmy Malone(Sean Connery) I would also add De Niro but his scenes are just too few. But than again De Niro has just about always been great at playing the gangster roles. Despite the lack of substance this movie does have that heroic vibe going for it with few riveting moments probably because of the uplifting musical score. And it's a entertaining and cool movie and I can see why this movie was somewhat of a hit when it came out. It has tough guys with fedora hats, suits with trench coats wielding Tommy guns. And it does have a decent narrative even if it isn't a very intelligent movie. This movie tries to put Eliot Ness on a pedestal but I just found Ness to not be all that likable character in this. Maybe it's because he claims it doesn't matter if alcohol is a harmless drink or not, it's the law of the land to not consume it. Then he goes bending the law in order to take down the bad guys. If it was cocaine or other very harmful drugs I would give him a pass but not really in this case. But he was one of the few cops that couldn't be bought, bribed or bargained with and I give him props for that. Also all the character are mostly one dimensional and very underdeveloped. It's a entertaining and watchable flick but just didn't stand out all that much and does have some really dumb parts or parts that doesn't make much sense.7.4/10",

This based-on-a-true-story film about a group of law-enforcement agents, led by Eliot Ness, is made up of four men who join up to stop the flow of crime and illegal booze from Al Capone.While the actual group had nine men, this premature depiction of the team is made up of some of the best acting I've seen. While I'm not the biggest Costner fan, I think this was one of his best performances. He basically nailed the by-the-book, good-hearted hero role on the head, flawlessly. Still, the one thing that makes this film one of my all-time favorites is the spectacular performance by Sean Connery as the racist, old-school street cop, Jim Malone. His rugged sense of humor and course actions give the film a certain charm that couldn't have come from any of the other characters. Oh, I can't forget De Niro, though. If there was one person who was meant to play a gangster or mob boss, it was De Niro.The main thing that surprises me about this film, is the fact that it fallows that clich\u00e9 \"path of the hero,\" with Costner as the timid hero, receiving his call to action and Connery as the disgruntled mentor, pushing and guiding the hero along.

Every time I see it, I can still see why.  However, I find it hard to understand how this film could be rated as one of the top 250 films of all time, seeing how 'Untouchables' has an insurmountable flaw at its center: Kevin Costner.There are certain roles that Costner can play, mostly because they seem tailored for his personality.  Roles like the one in Tin Cup, or Field of Dreams, or even No Way Out (a better film than this one) match up better. His Elliot Ness is treacly and unengaging, and Patricia Clarkson's June Cleaver performance doesn't help at all.  Costner's entire repertoire consists of furrowing his brow; the more intense the scene, the further it is furrowed, but nowhere does he ever project any true emotion. \nEven more unfortunately, Costner is paired off between two of the best actors of the time, Robert DeNiro and Sean Connery.  Connery gives the performance of his life here, winning a well-deserved Oscar, and DeNiro is simply DeNiro.  Even Charles Martin Smith gives a more energetic performance than Costner.  Brian DePalma outdoes himself, especially in the baby-carriage scene, but also in the overall lush look of the film.  That and the brilliant performances by DeNiro and Connery make this an entertaining film, but not a great one.",

I was disappointed with the 'feel good Hollywood' vibe and acting methods of a lot of the actors. Although this movie boasts some pretty renowned names (De Niro, Connery), and they did not give mediocre performances by any means, the weak and trite script coupled with their delivery style (surely the fault of the director De Palma) resulted in a piece of generic Hollywood fluff. Really the only thing saving this movie from being a complete and utter disaster, in my eyes at any rate, is the stunning cinematography and the inclusion of a few visual De Palma tricks of the trade. In the end I just feel let down, especially in light of what could have been had he opted for a more serious vibe like Carlitos Way, although The Untouchables is still ahead above The Black Dahlia- his worst film in my opinion. It's just sad when a director you hold in high esteem releases something so bland.",

However, when i watch this movie, i can't shake the feeling that it resembles an action movie more than a historical drama. I have no problem with that except that it takes away from the accuracy of the film. For example, Frank Nitti was never thrown off a roof by Elliot Ness. He actually committed suicide near some railroad tracks. That sounds a lot more dramatic than being thrown off a roof. But as an action movie, i guess it was more exciting.Robert De Niro and Sean Connery do great as Al Capone and Malone, respectively. De Niro resembles Al Capone and even put on extra weight to better fit the role. Connery is hilarious and bad-ass as Malone, the cop who helps Elliot Ness fight Capone. This movie is worth owning for the cool shootouts and great acting. 7/10",

            "content": "The film came long after the 1960s series and it was able to improve the discourse a lot from pure police and gangster violence and counter violence and counter counter violence to some kind of calmer and sounder vision of prohibition. The least we can say is the whole case was absurd. Absurd because prohibition was an idiotic policy and in 1931 it was on the very verge of being abrogated, nullified and voided. Absurd because they could never get Al Capone for his crimes since he never did anything himself but only through and via other people. Absurd because even tax evasion was nearly derailed by bribes to the members of the jury, to the judge probably and many other people. But it is also true that this famous case managed to make gangsters and the mafia think twice and start moving to legal operations for their own gangs and abandoning illegal operations to the street gangs, those they did not even try to control. It was also before the time of street gangs, mainly held and controlled by the Blacks and the Latinos, which was supposed to happen after WW2 with heroin and cocaine. The film here shows how fragile and brittle the police is when confronted to that crime. Apart from shooting first they have little moral certainty to hold in front of heavy corruption and hefty bribes. The film shows how these battle are necessarily in public places and they become some kinds of street war and there have to be collateral victims in the public. This is emphasized by the pram and baby scene, a scene borrowed from Eisenstein and transposed in that context with great art, though the meaning is a lot triter than Eisenstein's. On the Soviet side a baby in the middle of a real war act from the political power in place against some demonstrators who have to be eliminated by bleeding them to death. On the US side a baby in the middle of two shooting camps transforming a central station into a shooting gallery with cops on one side and criminals on the other. And what's more in a battle that will come to an end incessantly by political decision. The law was on the side of criminal absurdity. In Eisenstein the law was on the side of anti-historical repression. And in front of the law Eisenstein had romantic revolutionaries who will eventually win a few years later whereas the Untouchables had a band of criminal gangsters whose business was to make money by illegally importing and selling alcohol. In fact the whole value is in the punch line. Roosevelt has won and prohibition is out, what will you do Mr. Ness? I guess I'll get a drink. That's just the point. A battle that should never have come up if the bad policy that brought it up had not been adopted by a bunch of bigots.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",

Plot points that are so predictable that even a person who has never seen a movie before will realise it all.The way Sean Connery is introduced you know he is going to die. In the beginning you know the whole thing is a hoax and they haven't caught the criminals, Even the score by Ennio Morricone seems rehashed from other movies. There is nothing interesting about the movie, not it's dialogue, not it's acting. Nothing.Even the set that people praise is not that great. There is scene in the middle of the movie where a car comes down a road and every car parked on the side is the same. If you want to make a period piece why be so lazy why not actually make the effort to have it all down to detail.The acting is pretty generic. Robert Deniro must be laughing at the easy money he has made by playing the character that he has played in so many other movies. Sean Connery plays an irishman with the worst accent I have ever heard. At some points he is heavily accented at other times there is nothing.

            "content": "This wasn't bad at all. It may perhaps be a somewhat simplified version of the events and not strictly true to the actual events and I'm sure it would be much bloodier and filled with characters that don't show their true colours until later and probably more factually accurate if it was made today, but it got the story across well and it didn't take too much brain power to understand. I like it that way, too much cloak and dagger can detract from what is just a good story.Al Capone's downfall at the hands of Elliot Ness and his Untouchables (Sounds a bit rude doesn't it?) is given appropriate time and pacing, with good actors and direction. The costumes are good and the sets are well chosen. It's obvious that they had a good budget. It does still contain some bloody violence, but not necessarily in a gratuitous way. It's certainly not the sole focus, despite De Palma being renowned for his bloody flicks. I'm a big scaredy-cat so if I can deal with it, it can't be that bad.Does it make Elliot look somewhat lost until he recruits Malone, Stone and t'other one? Yes it does a bit and it seems a bit lead by Malone rather than Ness, who doesn't appear to have known where to start. That may just be how the film portrays him. Sean was the bigger star at the time after all, but I don't know how it all really went down, because I wasn't there. I've just heard of the Legend of Elliot Ness, but not of Malone.\nAccording to the IMDB Trivia section \"t'other one\" wasn't even present for the events.Robert gives a fantastic performance as Capone and stands out for that. Kevin is ok, but a bit wet and Garcia is surprisingly handsome, which I've never said before. No one does a bad job as acting goes.\nSean however frustrates me. He's reputed as this fantastic actor with numerous awards yet he has never, to my knowledge, succeeded in doing any accent other than his own. Why then does he get a part as an Irish-American. Was it for his name, was it because they don't care that Irish and Scottish don't sound the same or did they genuinely believe he sounded Irish? It's one thing that bugs me in films, when you have someone playing a role that they cannot do the accent for. If you're going for realistic, you've got to ensure this is correct. I have no issue with anyone playing a part that they weren't born in to, but I do expect them to work hard to produce the best version of that character, otherwise what are they getting those big bucks for? Allegedly De Niro wore similar undies to Capone just to get in to character, did Sean even know that he was supposed to be Irish? I'm sure he didn't know what type of pants Malone wore. In fairness, if you forget that he's not a Scottish immigrant, he's actually quite good in the role.I've seen better \"Gangster\" films, but this one was easy to watch and an interesting story to start with.",

            "content": "Brian De Palma's 1987 crime feature The Untouchables begins in a small, but busy and somewhat plush room as crime kingpin Al Capone sits and receives a shave amongst bodyguards and the press. The film begins in earnest, combining shot composition with character action as this crime lord, quite literally, puts his neck on the line in front of everybody; for the sake of everybody and desperately attempting to keep his cool at the same time, thus echoing what his overall role in the piece will amount to. The shot composition is that of a bird's eye view, a shot that looks directly down into the room and all the activity as a caption informing us of America's anti-alcohol attitudes in prohibition era Chicago, circa 1930. The chosen shot suggests a vantage point, a 'see all' ability much akin to that of the birds which lend their name to the shot name. This is given to the audience as the entire situation is laid out to us by way of a caption, setting up a power struggle between righteous and the criminally minded of which we will go on to observe both sides of.Very quickly, De Palma has drawn us into the world in which we will be spending the best part of two hours, as Robert De Niro's Capone and Kevin Costner's Treasury Department agent named Eliot Ness, plus their troops, engage in a battle between one another. Capone himself even compares what he has going on with Ness as a boxing match. The film is a triumph, bringing punch to a true story; gloriously recreating a city from a bygone era and additionally a film with a great attention towards its characters, simultaneously capturing the sorts of strenuous emotions and feelings one must go through as they begin a marathon task from the very beginning, in a wonderful manner.Contrasted to Capone's introduction, which at once saw him in both a powerful and vulnerable position quickly followed by a zoom in on the man thus furthering a somewhat uncanny feel about things, is that of Eliot Ness. Ness sits in his study, at home, to melancholy music which begins when the scene starts with his wife clearing up in the kitchen. The entire sequence suggests a somewhat quaint; down-to-Earth; domesticated aura as this man has climbed whatever metaphorical ladder was in-front of him and is living whatever American Dream lifestyle he deems worthy of both him and his family. All this prior to his first day at work, as if everything he's lived and studied for has readied him for this: the job that is to take on Capone and his crime-infused, alcohol distributing team of lowlifes.Ness is greeted on his first day by some members of the press, but the stark contrast the film implies is their attitudes towards him in comparison to Capone in the very first scene. Here, the journalists are on his back from the off and it doesn't get any better too quickly. This is in contrast to Capone, nonchalantly engaging with the press as he entrusts his life with another man whom has a razor at his neck as a shave is half way to being completed: he charms them, humours them and generally has them on his side. As a lead, Ness carries the necessary weight which enables us to relate to him and eventually get behind him in his goal; aided by his house-set introduction, his ideology of not recruiting men into his team of whom have families projects a thoughtful and level headed persona onto us.Ness' team of untouchables to which the title relates are formed of an Irish-American cop, named Jim Malone (Connery); a young Italian-American sharp-shooter named Giuseppe Petri (Garcia), otherwise known as George Stone, and ex-Washington based number cruncher Oscar Wallace (Smith). Ness' initial meeting with Malone, an elderly man walking the nightly beat as a cop, takes place on a bridge; a symbolic place on which the ability to cross over on and into another locale whilst avoiding the troubles below is apparent. It's this initial meeting with Malone that sees Ness' world change, and their initial interaction half way across that bridge acts as the ultimate for the establishment of transition which certainly comes about.The Untouchables balances its material between each opposing side wonderfully well, quite remarkably, seeing the two heads of these respective sides come face to face just the once prior to the denouement. It's a film that builds to an exciting climax but doesn't need a gunfight; an individual gunshot or an explosion to round things off, indeed just a singular word during which a change of plea acts as the fatal blow. It's additionally interested in more specific, intricate things; prior to a raid on a meeting between gangsters on the Canadian-American border, the characters take time to observe their rural surroundings and the mountains and fields are in stark, disorientating contrast to the mostly night-set, concrete jungle of Chicago. At one point, Malone recommends the rest of the team stamp their feet so as to block out the sensation of the cold as they wait for the dealers to arrive, further creating a more intimate and sensual feel to the hard-edged, male dominated crime saga than it need bothered to have done. Such a sequence captures the film's overall attitudes to its characters and subject matter, that of intimate and respectful. Untarnished by later American crime films which would break-down the gangster archetype, most notably 1990's Goodfellas, and others which would add more of a visual flair to the 'crime saga' approach to the American gangster genre, such as 1995's Heat; The Untouchables acts as a wondrous example of right attempting to overcome wrong, all playing out with a meticulous level of attention to character and film-making.",

Brian de Palma gets a fine entertaining product with a meticulous direction and a well created atmosphere of the 20's and early 30's in Chicago when Capone was at his peak. The film has tension, the action sequences are well handled and the musical score -though somewhat odd- fits enough.Kevin Costner is correct as Elliot Ness but the acting \"coup de force\" is between Sean Connery (as Malone) and Robert de Niro (as Capone), both outstanding in their characters; de Niro is perhaps the best in a role that has had excellent performers in pictures such as Rod Steiger, Ben Gazzara and Jason Robards. Good jobs too from Andy Garc\u00eca and Charles Martin Smith as Costner's sidekick lawmen. Billy Drago looks mean enough as Frank Nitti.The famous sequence at the train station (baby and stairs included) is not a highlight to me for I found it definitely too slow and long and the same with the sequence when Ness goes after Nitti at he Court House. Clear overrunning of some particular sequences is a usual characteristic in de Palma's films and no one knows why (Craig Wasson following Deborah Shelton through a mall in \"Body Double\" and Angie Dickinson and the man at the art museum in \"Dressed to Kill\", both being perfect examples).But all in all \"The Untouchables\" is a fine and enjoyable crime and gangsters movie.

But the federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) has put as a goal of his life destroy him. To his side is Jean Malone (Sean Connery) with a team of cops, the \"Untouchables\". The directing is excellent and Brian proves his experience for another time (see the scene with the baby carriage in the station, truly unforgettable...) As far as the performances are concerned Kevin Costner makes a good appearance but the show is stolen by experienced Sean Connery, who fairly wins the golden figurine. Robert de Niro is also delectable in his role. I believe that \"The Untouchables\" is the best movie of Brian De Palma.

Lead by agent Eliot Ness, they arranged raids on known breweries and hidden ale houses, confiscated vast amounts of illegal liquor and tried to pin it all on Capone.The actual story is of course much more complicated than would be practical for a film, but overall this movie is a rather faithful representation of the events that took place and keeps at least with the spirit of what actually happened. Certain characters have been combined to make for a smoother story telling experience. But, nevertheless, it stands on its own as a very interesting and intriguing gangster story, with plenty of atmosphere, Chicago style mood, gunfights, men in fedoras, all that good stuff. It's also very interesting to see the Prohibition Era from the point of view of the law, as the time is often thought to be the golden age of gangsters and thus they're usually the focus of any story.It's also a very professionally made film. Director Bryan De Palma is also known for movies such as Scarface and Mission: Impossible, and this movie showcases his strong points equally as well, from pacing to cinematography to characters. The movie also benefits from the talents of Kevin Costner and Sean Connery as the two main law enforcers. Probably one of my favourite Costner roles, and a good showing from Connery as well. Robert De Niro as Capone leaves me a bit cold. He certainly has the charisma and the presence to pull it off, but unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on him all that much, limiting his influence.Special mention should also be made of the score by Ennio Morricone. Some great tunes here.All in all, The Untouchables is a very good Prohibition Era film.

Kevin Costner, currently engaged in a relentless gunfight with armed gangsters, dives desperately towards the floundering infant, but the carriage is consistently out of his reach, and a devastating conclusion is imminent.

It has, unbelievably, taken me years to finally track down 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma's stylish take on the 1930s Prohibition era, and I can only say that the wait has been more than worthwhile.The 1959 ABC television series, \"The Untouchables,\" ran for four seasons and 118 episodes, and starred Robert Stack as Eliot Ness, the dedicated Prohibition agent who worked to put Al Capone behind bars. The story lines were adapted, albeit with much artistic license, from Ness' own 1957 autobiography of the same name, published shortly after his death. Director Brian De Palma, noted for his extreme if derivative visual style, had already achieved perhaps his greatest success with the bravura gangster picture, 'Scarface (1983),' starring an unforgettable Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana {this film was, in fact, a loose remake of Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson's 'Scarface (1932),' based on the life of Al Capone}. In producing 'The Untouchables (1987),' De Palma has crafted one of the most handsome and energetic gangster movies I've seen, and the two hour running time flew by so incredibly swiftly that I gazed at the clock in disbelief once the film had come to an end; is it a valid complaint to remark that a film should have continued for an hour more?Kevin Costner stars as Agent Eliot Ness, whose dedication towards bringing down arrogant and brutal gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) has been constantly thwarted by the corruption rampant throughout the police force. Compiling a small task-force of trusted cops, comprising gruff Irishman Jim Malone (Sean Connery), crack-shot Italian George Stone (Andy Garcia) and meek accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), Ness sets about disrupting Capone's illegal alcohol ring, and tracing shifty income tax dealings back to the infamous crime boss. Costner is strong in the leading role, particularly when his actions place his family in jeopardy, and Connery deservedly received the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Ness' brisk, irritable and racist mentor. After years of shamelessly imitating Alfred Hitchcock's film-making style, De Palma finally comes into his own, and the railway station shootout \u0096 a respectful homage to Eisenstein's \"Odessa Steps\" sequence \u0096 is a perfect construction of suspense, every minute detail absorbed by the audience with a continually-quickening heartbeat. As far as gangster pictures not directed by Francis Ford Coppola are concerned, this is about as good as they come.",

Even Kevin Costner, who I am not the biggest fan of does a fine job going from an inexperienced agent to one of the most well known lawmen in American History. David Mamet's script is is excellent with some lines that are unforgettable, one of which, my favourite when Robert De Niro loses his cool and says about Ness \"I want him Dead, I want his family dead, I want his house burnt to the ground and I want to go in there in the middle of the night and p*ss on his ashes\".True master composer Ennio Morricone fame for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is on board for scoring duties and it enhances it even further. The different types of camera shots make it a visual treat with a crane shot early on which depicts a street filled with Ford Model T's which transports you straight to the 1930's to a hand-held single cut as a killer stalks Connery's Malone through his apartment.I really have no bad words to say about The Untouchables, this to me is essential viewing.",

            "content": "I'm not going to rehash the story line at this point because you've most likely read the other ten pages or so detailing that. I choose to make mention of the acting and production values. Firstly, I saw this when it was released in the theaters and on a large screen it certainly makes a terrific impact, acting wise and in vision. The production was done with a \"money's no object\" quality and it shows. There is much detail given to sets, costumes and cars of the late 1920's. How many times have you seen a period film and there's always that one glitch in there like the most infamous one, a Roman centurion wearing a wrist watch? Not here. The acting, Kostner aside, is superb. Between de Niro and Connery there's pretty much nothing left for Kostner to do except read his lines, and he does that well. But as always, at least for me, for someone who's obviously more than just a capable actor, he STILL just reads his lines and plays it one dimensional. That's OK though because we get the impression, true or not, that Elliot Ness is a government worker just out doing his job, namely to bring down Mr. Big, aka Al Capone. Mr. de Niro on the other hand portrays as evil a character as Mr. Connery portrays an heroic one. Fact is, these two virtually steal the picture away from Kostner. I'm not being super critical of Mr. Kostner here because in essence he does shine dramatically and primarily because of the other two. They seem to have motivated him to go beyond and that's what any good ensemble with the chemistry can accomplish. One other point I just have to mention to all you film history buffs out there. The scene in the train depot where they're having a shoot out and the mother looses the grip on the baby carriage and it's shown rolling down the flight of stairs in slow motion. That is a direct quote from the early Russian silent film \"Battle Ship Potemkin\". Look for that scene and compare the two. A bit of an \"homage\" maybe or plagiarism? You decide.",

            "content": "Grand and stylish is the only way to describe this rewriting of the legend of Elliott Ness from director Brian De Palma. Many complained of \"The Untouchables\" lack of historic accuracy, and even of its dissimilarity to the Robert Stack t.v. series. All I can say is thank goodness on both counts. De Palma's film is a work of fiction, a piece of entertainment in every sense of the word.The excellence is evident from the ground up, starting with the gorgeous costumes from the classy menswear outfit, Georgio Armani. Art Direction is out of this world (William A. Elliott), recreating Prohibition era Chicago with grand assuredness, using the actual streets and settings. All those model-T's look great. Cinematographer Stephen H. Burum has a field day capturing the lavish sets (Capone's hotel suite, the specially washed Chicago streets). His work, during sequences such as the Canadian border raid and the train station shoot out, is spectacular. Burum also cleverly makes use of the fantastic architecture in several scenes by filming from the ground looking up. This also makes the characters appear larger than life.Ennio Morricone's score is one of the best I've ever heard. The commanding \"Strength of the Righteous (Main Title)\" draws out the suspense dramatically, the \"Death Theme\" is tragically poignant, his \"Machine Gun Lullaby\" is a melodic work of genius and the \"End Title\" is one of the most rousing themes ever composed.Screenwriter David Mamet has provided an exciting story, varied (likeable and loathsome) characters, and he dresses it all with sharp, incisive, biting and all together entertaining dialogue. Grand and stylish acting brings Mamet's characters to life. Costner solidly portrays the beyond reproach law man who allows himself to become corruptible in order to do justice. Good too is Andy Garcia as the rookie prodigy Stone, who joins the team in pursuit of Capone. Out shining these two easily are Sean Connery as world weary Irish cop Malone, and Robert De Niro, mesmerising as the megalomaniacal gangster boss who has a special speech for all occasions. When words fail though, look out. Charles Martin Smith comes close to these two as Oscar Wallace, the rather enthusiastic accountant who sets up the case against Capone.De Palma shapes all the above into a film that is dramatic, tense, forceful, funny and tragic all at once. Coupled with this are the movie's numerous scenes of power, the train station and the gangster banquet being just two. Truly every scene has a measured impact, thanks to Mamet's amazing scripting. \"The Untouchables\" is a real victory for De Palma, Mamet, Connery, De Niro and a host of technical professionals.Monday, July 7, 1997 - Astor TheatreI know I always open by calling this film grand, but that's what it is. From William A. Elliot's awesome sets, the superb costumes, Stephen H. Burum's classy cinematography and even Ennio Morricone's music (the best theme ever written for a movie), the whole picture is dripping with style.De Palma directs with a flair and purpose that he's never really shown before or since, while the perfect cast have a field day with David Mamet's razor sharp script. Costner is the epitome of incorruptible law, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith great value as a sharp-shooter and a dedicated accountant respectively. It I s scene-chewers Sean Connery and Robert De Niro who put the icing on the cake though. Connery's world-weary Irish cop won him a deserved Oscar, while De Niro is at his chilling best bringing Al Capone to life. The pair gobble up scene after scene, and it's a good thing they don't appear together (save for a brief moment). Who would cope?! See it at the movies!Saturday, June 20, 1998 - Video",

            "content": "Directed by Brian De Palma, \"The Untouchables\" is a classic remake of the television series as our hero G-Man (Kevin Costner) as he tracks down his arch nemesis the notorious gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and to bring his enterprise down with him during the infamous Chicago Prohibition era. Struggling to catch up or get any word among Capone's whereabouts, Ness hires a veteran cop named Jimmy Malone (Oscar winning Sean Connery). The cast also includes other big stars like Andy Garcia as a rookie cop George Stone/Giuseppe Petri and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.The story is pretty much everything you would expect from a movie like this. We see Ness doing everything in his power to dethrone Capone and offer him justice served cold but not very successfully. The money trail leaves them from one dead-end street to another with no trace of Capone's hideouts. But Capone's trail being followed also marked the end of his empire. If the pieces can be added up nicely, it will be evident that Capone owes the government a substantial amount of back taxes and evasion as we all know is major felony. Wallace, a certified accountant claims that tax evasion itself would be a gargantuan penalty if Capone was just charged on that alone. And as what comes with that an abundance of deaths occurred during this mob war era.The characters richness is what makes \"The Untouchables\" a very riveting movie. All the characters are multilayered with the exception of the leading character, Ness, who comes off pretty wooden and seems to be more opposing to the character of Capone who's quite charismatic and the wittiness and dry comical dialogue by Connery are the ones that I enjoy watching the most. Even Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith had lots of panache and the chemistry each character had towards one another makes this movie very special. The direction by Brian De Palma was fascinating, while the score by Ennio Morricone adds the right texture to the time period this movie was set in. The props and costumes were accurate. It felt like we had traveled back to the time of the Prohibition era.There are a lot of great scenes going on in \"The Untouchables\". One of the many scenes involved Capone's seminar about the benefits of teamwork as he tells his band of syndicates and it results in a man getting pulverized by a baseball bat. The focus on the blood splattering out of the man's head and all the syndicate's reactions is a scene that will linger in my mind till eternity. The other standout was the ambush located at the train station which ends with Agent Stone diving to save a runaway baby carriage while keeping his weapon at tow. This scene will send chills up everyone's spine.Overall, this truly is one of the more engaging mobster movies of all times. It has great characters and the dialogue is remarkable and the characters truly draw onto you very nicely. Sure there's nothing original about the plot or the outcome, but the development of the characters and the technical aspects make this movie one you have to see to believe.",

This sequence is finely executed and a charming homage to Eisenstein.

But most definitely, it is one of his most rousing one, packed with a great ensemble cast (greatest for any of his movies) backed up by a solid screenplay, great camera work and masterful editing. It is a rare crime and gangster movie that set its moorings very wide and deep into moral and religious righteousness. And it is that very mooring which lends the movie a very credible emotional base and connect whereby we share 'the untouchables's feelings of despair, joys and triumph. This film also brings out De Palma's versatility in ample abundance and shows that he is equally adept in showcasing drama and action-piece set on an epic scale (for example the scene at the US-Canada border) on screen as much as voyeur-driven suspense and pulpy thrillers. The climax scene (another greatly set action set piece) at the railway station bears Brian De Palma's stamp all over. Sean Connery is extremely charming as an honest competent and resourceful cop whose performance clearly stands out. Kevin Costner is good while Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson provides credible support. However it is Robert De Niro leads all of them with a short but nevertheless the most menacing gangster role that he has ever portrayed.

Eliot Ness is a perfect role for Kevin Costner - a what you see is what you get American hero with a passion for justice. Robert De Niro has played so many tough guys and mobsters that playing Al Capone is second nature to him; I just wish Capone and his mob had been a little better fleshed out here. Sean Connery steals the show in his Academy Award winning role as a beat cop who reluctantly signs up with Ness. And Andy Garcia's performance as another of Ness' team should not be overlooked. The music by Ennio Morricone creates tension and mood. All together, the production values are very high.And there are some great scenes, like Ness' group and the Canadian Mounties pincering a liquor run at a bridge - on horses no less. I'm easy, I thought the re-staging of the famous baby carriage scene from \"Battleship Potemkin\" in the context of a shoot-out was a knockout.I wish there had been more context given about the effects of the Eighteenth Amendment - maybe something that would give some perspective on our more recent war on drugs.

            "content": "First time I have seen the cough (33 year old!) film about prohibition era Chicago and I enjoyed it. Unlike some of the more clever clog reviews.The Untouchables was originally a television series but director Brian De Palma brings a successful film adaptation.The film focuses on the gangland warfare between gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Federal U.S. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) brought into Chicago to snare Capone.Ness forms an 'Untouchables' police unit with an older and wise Irish-American Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace, a young Cop George Wallace (Andy Garcia) and a federal IRS like accountant?The film is notable for the elaborate production design. I am thinking of scenes in 1930 Chicago including street scenes with period features, a Chicago courtroom and Chicago Grand Central railway station.A good musical score is presented by Ennio Morricone that has elements of his Once Upon A Time In The West work.I don't usually endear to Kevin Costner's career opus in the late 1980s/1990s but he delivers a good performance here. In fact all the cast do in particular Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for this.Al Capone is played by De Niro. Watching De Niro strutting around and smirking got me thinking. He plays the same character in a lot of his films! In particular some of his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.Coming in at just under two hours, perhaps the film could have been beefed up with some other scenes?",

            "content": "When wanting a classic, unashamedly audience-pleasing film, one need look no further than The Untouchables. The film is partially based on the 1950's television series of the same name, but updates the retelling a bit to better suit today's audiences. The story takes place in 1920's prohibition era, when it was illegal to drink or possess alcohol. Enter alcohol baron Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his mafia, who begin bootlegging, or illegally distributing alcohol to the public. It is the duty of Treasury department agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to stop Capone, and withhold the law, but his work proves difficult when he discovers no one is to be trusted; most everyone on the police force, media or any form of authority has been bribed by Capone to keep their mouth shut. To avoid detection, Ness assembles a handpicked team of 'untouchables', or law enforcers who refuse bribes. Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar winning performance) acts as a mentor for Ness, teaching him how to get Capone before Capone gets him - shoot fast, and shoot first! 'George Stone', or Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) is the youngest member of the team, a sharp shooting aspiring cop with old fashioned beliefs about law maintenance. Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is an unassuming accountant who gets dragged up in the plan, but ultimately proves an essential part of the team.Brian De Palma delivers a real masterpiece here, in what is easily one of his best films: the pacing is excellent, the cinematography is superb, marvelously capturing sensational (and Oscar nominated) 30's era sets, vehicles and costumes. (Robert De Niro's costumes were made exclusively by the real Capone's actual tailors) The great cast, of course, does nothing but add to the splendor, with Costner, Smith and Garcia all giving strong performances.Connery bestows his character with his usual charisma, and enough drama to well deserve his Oscar, and De Niro creates a wonderfully wicked villain, complete with a memorable bit with a baseball bat, easily giving a picture perfect portrayal of the original Capone. Add an excellent script by David Mamet with tons of memorable lines and a wonderfully flowing score by Ennio Moricone and you get a wonderful, larger than life piece of film history. That's the Chicago way.-9.5/10",

            "content": "The story of Al Capone, his legendary control over the underworld of Chicago in the 1930s, and the policemen who made it their life's mission to have him convicted in court, is one that has been told and retold countless times over. So when it is told again, the new version generally needs to have something to set it apart. The problem with The Untouchables is that it doesn't have a whole lot to set it apart from any mob story, leave alone one based on the life of Al Capone.In this effort, Capone is played with gutso by Robert De Niro, who seems to be every director's first choice for a mobster film. De Niro plays the legendary figure as a fat, arrogant bastard. Whether this is accurate or not, De Niro plays it so well that it really doesn't matter. It is so easy to believe in his Capone that in a way, it makes the film.The same cannot be said of Kevin Costner, who gets to play famed lawman Eliot Ness. In 1987, when Costner was a relatively unknown actor, it was a lot easier to believe in this portrayal. But as Costner's projects got grander and grander in scale, a certain kind of trend was noticed. In essence, the manner in which Costner portrayed Eliot Ness was more or less identical to how he has played in every film since. Even The Postman or 3000 Miles To Graceland have him displaying little, if any, variation from his standard stock character. Under these conditions, casting Sean Connery, a veteran of playing every character in such a manner that they cannot be distinguished, seems like an incredibly bad move, even if he raises the acting above the level of a TV drama.Spare a thought for Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith. Their roles are so underdeveloped that they often exist merely to provide an extra gun or some plot movement. Although it is kind of amusing when the accountant starts showing a good dose of the Rambo-syndrome, the next scene when Connery uses a corpse to gain information from one of the few survivors on the mob side shows a kind of energy that, as Ebert so eloquently put it, the rest of the film lacks.Credit where credit is due. The world of the 1930s is very effectively reproduced here. Even if you've only seen the so-called golden era in photos, it's hard to escape how convincingly it is recreated in each frame of the film. Unfortunately, it makes the general unconvincing nature of the rest of the film all the more difficult to understand. One can't help but ask if anyone's heart was in it.In all, I am giving The Untouchables a five out of ten. I would have given it a six, but Robert De Niro's set pieces also seem so cut off from the rest of the film that one can't help but wonder if they were put in as an afterthought.",

            "review_title": "Somewhat disappointing",
            "content": "Here we have a movie which tells the story of Eliot Ness and his efforts to bring Al Capone to justice. Playing very fast and loose with the facts of the real Ness/Capone story this is definitely a Hollywood version of the Prohibition saga. Honestly there seems to be very little based in fact here other than that there once indeed lived men named Eliot Ness and Al Capone. So the movie isn't going to work as a history lesson. Does it work simply as a movie? Not as well as one might hope. The movie holds your attention throughout, the story is certainly compelling. But there are definitely problems littered throughout the film. You get the sense all the film's pieces never quite come together as well as they should.One of the movie's biggest problems is right at its heart. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness always seems a bit off. The character comes across as very bland, Costner seems to often be scared to show even a hint of emotion. He's rather boring and that's certainly not good. Meanwhile in portraying Capone we have Robert De Niro who appears to be acting in an entirely different movie than everybody else. With the film focusing mostly on Ness and his lawmen the Capone sequences often seem forced and oddly out of place. And, aside from one instance where he provides a novel use for a baseball bat, we never really see Capone's ruthless streak. In fact De Niro's Capone at times seems almost charming, likable even. Something about that doesn't seem right. Undoubtedly the best performance in the film comes from Sean Connery playing an Irish beat cop who, in the real history, never actually existed. Connery gets the lion's share of the memorable lines and certainly does well with the role.Director Brian De Palma, as is his wont, goes for the memorable visuals and the \"look at me, aren't I brilliant\" directorial touches. The famous baby on the staircase sequence? If it wasn't an homage you'd call it downright silly. Actually even as an homage it's still rather silly. And almost interminable. Unfortunately De Palma seems far too often to be more interested in filming things in a unique fashion than in making sure his story works. And sometimes the story simply isn't working. The movie is often too Hollywood for its own good. There are some things which you see up on the screen which simply aren't believable, having that \"only in the movies\" feel which takes you out of the film entirely. Most notable is when one character has perhaps the longest death sequence in film history. You can't help but find yourself saying \"shouldn't you be quite dead by now?\" Matters often aren't helped by the widely praised musical score which in actuality is at times rather intrusive and jarring. What we're left with is a movie which works in bits and pieces but which doesn't quite add up. With all the big names in the cast, and with the undeniably compelling story the film is (loosely) based on, you get the sense this film should have ended up being better than it actually is.",

Robert De Niro's Capone is charismatic but feels quite seperate from the rest of the film.But these flaws struggle to matter when everything else is firing on all cylinders. Brian De Palma directs multiple classic sequences, Ennio Morricone's score elevates many scenes that sends a small chill, and the script's focus on characters pays off extremely well as the film continues. And the film is only about 2 hours, which is uncharacteristic for a crime epic like this, but it welcomed.An easy recommend for just about anyone, it's a terrific film.",

            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Capone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.The Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative \"line-cut-line\" type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.I don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.Sure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.Rating: A-",

(This is an extension of the review I wrote in July 2008)As I said in originally in this review, I liked THE UNTOUCHABLES the first time I saw it. I loved the performances, loved the superb production design, loved the directing and loved how the pace was kept at the right speed. But it was only when I currently revisited Brian DePalma's gangster classic did I truly appreciate it as a brilliant masterpiece. Perhaps its true that its better the second time around! After introducing us to \"His little friend\" SCARFACE, a remake of the classic gangster film, director Brian DePalma voyages again on yet another bold and challenging project. THE UNTOUCHABLES is a violent and daring recapturing of the famous TV series of the same name, which chronicles the days of the Prohibition era, the days of gang kingpin Al Capone and stalwart agent Elliot Ness who vows to bring Capone down. Kevin Costner is decent as Ness, who miserably fails in his attempts to bring down the powerful kingpin, until taken under the wing of one of the films best actors, Sean Connery as Malone. Robert DeNiro is marvelous as the corrupt Capone and little-known actor Billy Drago is creepily effective as Capone's deadly accomplice. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith provide small but dignified support. So far, may be one of DePalma's finest. It's good-looking, breathtaking and boldly violent entertainment, armed with an intelligent script by Pulitzer-winner David Mamet. Still a must-see classic! Rating: ***** out of 5.",

            "content": "Gangsters. Cops. Tommy guns. Hand grenades. Bootlegging. Model T's. It's 1930 and the Prohibition war is raging. And thus we have The Untouchables. Al Capone practically runs the corrupt city of Chicago through his illegal liquor distribution. He has the entire city wrapped around his finger until Eliot Ness, a special agent from the treasury department, forms a group of incorruptible cops to take down Capone's entire operation. This group of cops will stop at nothing to uphold the law and bring down organized crime once and for all. And so we have an incredibly enticing Prohibition era tale with enough gangster action for the whole family! The film opens with a vivid overhead shot of Al Capone, played by the magnificent Robert De Niro, having a shave from his barber while reporters shuffle about the room waiting for Capone's face towel to be removed so that they can speak to him. The camera moves in closer to De Niro's face, still overhead. The barber removes his towel and Capone begins to speak about what it's like to be in control of the city and how he runs his crime operation. David Mamet's dialouge flows like gold and De Niro hits every profound line on the nose. In this one initial scene all of the great things about this movie have been established. We have Brian De Palma's excellent visual flare which captures the 1930's so well. We have Mamet's poetic yet raw dialouge that always impresses. And we have the establishment of the superb acting ability in this film, not only from De Niro, but from everyone. And so the film goes from there, telling an exciting story with loads of great characters, dialouge, and action.The Untouchables is loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, and it is pretty obvious. The film has a very serial feel to it, with a kind of television dialouge cadence that is also very fitting to the time period. It has a somewhat television look and feel to it, other than being incredibly graphic and loaded with plenty of foul language. It has an adventurous and fun mood, with a kind of mock-seriousness tone to it. But probably what makes it the most classic television-esque would be Ennio Morricone's excellent and commanding score. The score has a very powerful ability to make certain scenes very lighthearted and fun, so much so that you want to get up and cheer for the lovable heroes of this film. Then in other scenes, tragedy strikes and the score is so moving and so gripping that you're taken by surprise at how emotional the film has gotten all of the sudden. The whole film flows like this, making for a strange yet captivating watch.I have to say, don't expect The Godfather or Goodfellas going into this film. The Untouchables isn't nearly as complex and intricate as those films. The Untouchables is a different kind of film. It is driven by its cops and robbers mentality, probably because, unlike the aforementioned films, it is from the perspective of of the good side of the law, rather than the gangsters themselves. The film has to take on a completely different kind of approach to pull off what it is trying to accomplish. It isn't putting the gangsters in a good light. Al Capone isn't a character we pity at all. He is a character we hate, despise, and want revenge on just as much as the heroes of the film do. In all honesty, I prefer the stories told from the gangster point of view, but The Untouchables does an incredible job telling a story from the other side of the law.As far as gangster movies go, The Untouchables is different but great. Visually it is excellent and David Mamet's screenplay is pure genius. The whole cast gives great performances, especially Kevin Costner in the leading role as Eliot Ness. Sean Connery even won an Oscar for his role as Jim Malone, the aging Irish cop who goes about things in his own unique ways. Ennio Morricone lifts the film up with an incredible score that makes the whole film a joy to watch. This film is fun, yet moving, something a lot of films can't find a balance between. If you're a fan of gangster movies, definitely check this one out.",

It is an incredible list of films. This one is at the top of that list. This biopic, crime-drama is the story of Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) and Elliot Ness (Kevin Cosner), as they wage their Prohibition war against each other, in 1920s Chicago. Ness needs help competing with the corrupt police force, at his disposal, so he gets help from a semi-retired, Irish, beat cop, named Malone (Sean Connery). They form a team (with Andy Garcia as George Stone and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace), name themselves the Untouchables and learn, that not only do they have to fight Al Capone, but they also have to fight the politically, corrupted, Hell-hole, known as Prohibition Chicago. We are transported back to the 1920s.It is a fascinating film to see in the 21st century. The controversial idea of Prohibition, attitudes towards alcohol and different ideas, involving the role of law enforcement, are much different in the 21st century. This film offers a cinematic recreation of a period in our history, from 100 years ago, albeit with the Hollywood punch. Things are so different in our world today, that while you watch this film unfold, these 100 year old ideas, create an interesting, blurring of the lines, between good and bad. It creates a new dimension to this film. It allows you to look at it from many different angles. The Untouchables (1987), may well be one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. It is definitely one of De Palma's best. Director Brian DePalma weaves a great story around a time in our history, that has become more like folklore, than history, from a 21st century standpoint.The cinematography, editing, pacing, intensity, along with the riveting soundtrack by legendary film composer, Ennio Morricone, make this a heart pounding, action thriller, with a little taste of history thrown in too. Robert DeNiro makes you speechless, with his performance. Sean Connery is his normal greatness in this film. When this film was released in 1987, I got the pleasure of seeing it in the theaters, during its original release. After I saw the film, for weeks and weeks, all I read about or heard about, was how much everyone loved Sean Connery in this film. He deserves the credit too, because he would go on and win the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the following year, at the Academy Awards. This film also made Kevin Cosner's star soar from this point. He was already on the rise, but after this film, he became a major Hollywood hero, because of his portrayal of Elliot Ness.The Untouchables (1987), places you right into Prohibition-era Chicago. It rolls out the plot with a high amount of energy and gives you a cast, that does not insult you, with actors, just doing their jobs. The cast puts everything they have into it. DeNiro will not disappoint those, who haven't seen the film yet. This film is a brilliant piece of work, which Brian DePalma has done many times before. You are transported to a place, time and history, that happened a century ago. It puts you at the crime scene, completely with action-packed moments, dramatic character development and the serious intensity of blood-soaked violence. You love the good guys and you love to hate the bad-guys, is the ultimate reward when watching a piece of work like this. Whenever anyone mentions this film in conversation, the first thing I think of is Ennio Morricone pulse-pounding soundtrack. This film is excellent.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

Which is why he saddled him with some heavy hitters like Robert DeNiro (as Al Capone), Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and even the vicious Billy Drago who plays Frank Nitti to a pitch perfect level. Now, look, Eliot Ness was never an interesting person. He seemed stuffy and square, which may be what Costner was going for. But he is really corny in this flick. Yelling at a falling guy whom he just tossed from a building with as much zeal as reading the Bible.\nBut the movie is big time Hollywood. Looks like big time Hollywood thanks to cinematographer Stephen Burum who gives this movie the polish it really needed. Large format, big vista (in the Canadian booze bust) and just wonderfully executed shots. It gave this a boost the t.v. show didn't have.\nAlong with the horrific violence of the film, the corruption, and the politics, DePalma gives Chicago in the Prohibition Era a really grungy feel. The dialogue is wonderfully David Mamet though. Hard edged, tough guy talk about putting people in morgues and whatnot.\nThen there is the marching bombastic score of legend Ennio Morricone. It puts this film into another stratosphere. Beautiful segments around.This is a wonderful watch and great repeated watch. Though again, Costner bugs the hell out of me. Looks great as Ness, speaks as if he just got the script pages for the day.",

ALIENS, Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Raging Bull included, I love them all. The Untouchables is one of those decidedly 80s movies that hasn't aged quickly--unless you want to count the demise of Kevin Costner's career. Brian DePalma proves here that, while he cannot make a compelling film, he can at least make an entertaining one.  The editing feels jackknifed, especially when some sequences seem out of place.  Nonetheless, it is a superb film that is not for the easily squeamish.Overall, with another terrific score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), and impressive costume and production designs, the Untouchables proves to be well worth its weight in gold.

            "content": "I used to love this film the few times I saw it when I was a kid.  Now, after watching it again, I can't help but feel that something was missing with the movie.  It is this missing link that really prevents this film from being a great movie.Don't get me wrong, I really like The Untouchables.  The acting is good, with what little script that David Mamet, who is usually a much much better screenwriter has to give them.  Connery, though sounding like a total cliche line after line of dialogue really stands out, in my opinion, one of his best roles ever.  Garcia is also good with what unfortunately turned out to be little more than a standing extra, and of course, Deniro is simply awesome as the Charasmatic and often brutal, Al Capone.  However, Costner, as usual, simply lacks every hint of emotion in his role as Elliot Ness. His 'tough guy' scenes with Capone are more laughable than serious, and his tender acting makes Ness appear to be more of a wuss than the passive-aggressive vigilante who out smarted Capone.  What really is missing is hard to place...it's not one big problem, it's a series of small problems that add up.  As mentioned, the weak script and Costner's bad acting are both serious detriments to this film's success. But, there is something else that I can never and could ever put my finger on...it's an extra edge or an extra passion that was missing that really prevented this film to be a true epic.  Also, after reviewing it after ten years, there are so many parts in the action scenes that involve either completely idiotic acts by the characters, or incredibly inconsistent scenes (for instance, in the raid on the liquor convoy, a platoon of mounties on horseback are charging a group of tommy gun clad mobsters who are hosing their guns at them at close range, yet not a single one is hit.  Also, the final scene where Costner looks at the matchbook, finds out his friend's killer is really the same Capone henchman whom he just disarmed AND then rearmed, makes the killer very aware to the fact and is then responsible for the guy going gun crazy in the whole court.  Also, I find it very hard to believe that NOONE heard the gunshots that echoed throughout the courtroom building.  And finally, though cool, the scene with the baby carriage has it's fair share of problems).  Plus, the pacing of the movie was a little too fast...I felt that there were scenes missing that should have been there...scenes that could have been spent with more characterization, and most importantly, the building passion of the team to bring down Capone. There are far too little scenes that convey this passionate desire that we are supposed to be feeling with the characters.But when you add all of this up, surprisingly, it matters little.  With so many flaws, it still turns out to be a good movie with a great score by Ennio Morricone (who has provided scores for dozens of famous movies) and great direction by De Palma, though the pacing seems really choppy at times, and doesn't always flow well.  This film, next to Scarface, is probably De Palma's best effort overall.  It is entertaining and features some cool characters that unfortunately have very limited dialogue.  Overall, not a bad film, but there are much better gangster films out there.  Watch it for Connery, he truly shines.  7.5/10 stars.",

I don't think people realize what a small piece of art this movie is and treat it as mere entertainment . Also, when talking about the best 80's movies people often forget about this pearl . Life's unfair.\"The Untouchables \" is a gangster movie , yet you shouldn't compare it to \"Godfather\" , \"Godfather 2\" , \"Once upon a time in America\" or \"Goodfellas\". The reason is simple \u2013 it's a different kind of a movie despite it has gangsters in it. The movies I've mentioned more or before more or less tell the same story of hero raising to the top of the criminal world and then falling into hell . \"The Untouchables\" is more of a \u0085 western . It's a story about group of people that couldn't stand the injustice in their city anymore and decided to fight with it by all means necessary. Yes , it's very entertaining , but it has a lot of heart and substance too.As one of the heroes says everybody knows where evil hides , it's just nobody wants to do anything about it ( out of fear , apathy or corruption) . To fight evil you have to be even more ruthless than the criminals . You have to sometimes do illegal methods (torture , blackmail). You have to get dirty if you want to keep the streets clean . You have to be brave , because it might cost you family or life . That's the whole movie is about . It's all in the story of Elliott Ness . When we first meet him his a honest and idealistic , yet unexperienced and soft rookie when it comes to fighting crime . Through the movie he will become tough , charismatic and confident crime fighter.I don't agree with opinion that characters are one dimensional . Ness (Kevin Costner) as I've mentioned earlier changes through the movie . Malone (Sean Connery) is a true mentor for our heroes . He's bitter and lonely old man when we meet him . Later , he will become a father figure for the rest of group . He's wise , strong willed , cynical and determined . Stone (Andy Garcia) is a young rebel with a softer side. Oscar (Charles Martin Smith ) works as a good comic relief , yet people forget he's also intelligent and brave. Al Capone ( Robert de Niro) deep down is nothing , but a simple primitive street thug , yet he hides it under his gentleman behavior.Sean Connery quite probably gives the best performance of his career . The Oscar was deserved . I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner , yet he fits the role of Ness PERFECTLY . Along with \"Silverado \" it's his best performance . He's character could be very boring since he is so noble and all , but Costner makes him a true human being you can care for. Robert de Niro has a rather small screen time and many complained about that . Still , he plays Capone with obvious irony and that makes his character memorable.Let's not forget about Billy Drago (Frank Vitti) , Richard Bradford (Mike) , Jack Kehoe (Payne ) and Patricia Clarkson ( Ness wife) . They all give solid support to the main stars of the movie . The music by Ennio Morricone is BEAUTIFUL .\"Four friends \" , \"The Death theme\" , \" Al Capone's theme \" , \" The Strength of the righteous \" and \"The Untouchables\" . Beautiful tracks . I need to get the soundtrack . Along with Basil Poleudoris music for \"Robocop\" this was the best soundtrack in 1987 . The art direction-set decoration and costumes are wonderful. The movie looks very elegant and takes you right into the prohibition era. David Mamet created a screenplay with incredibly stylish and memorable dialogues . Along the way there are also some surprising twists and good character development . Brian de Palma has outdone himself with the direction . He gives the audience brilliant shootout scene (obviously inspired by \"Pancernik Potiomkin\") , great chase scene and assassination scene . I loved the first person perspective in one important scene and the various camera angles through the movie . It's also worth noticing that \"The Untouchables\" is one of few movies that shows how violence hurts and affects lives of the characters , just like in real life it would. I cry during this movie about 4 times , but I'm not gonna spoil the movie . Awesome . I give it 9/10.",

The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters its last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is? It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, they must have missed it that time I presume!

He is pompous, arrogant, intimidating, flamboyant and ruthless in all of his endeavours (particularly when wielding a baseball bat)- Robert De Niro secures himself as a frighteningly believable Al Capone - even down to the hand gestures, facial sneers and the silk underwear. (apparently Capone was a fan of wearing them)On Capone's side, Billy Drago's portrayal of Nitti has to be mentioned. From his villainous smile to the striking white suit ensemble - Nitti is one to watch out for. Despite his characters lack of dialogue, he stands out amongst this star-studded cast.Sean Connery plays Jim Malone, a wise bobby on the beat, and the oldest recruit of 'The Untouchables'. His Irish accent was somewhat questionable, though his wit and Mr Miagi styled performance distract from this. A well deserved Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.Kevin Costner's straight- laced performance as Eliot Ness has to be commended, alongside Andy Garcia as the slick Italian and Charles Martin Smith as the eager and loveable character of Oscar.The most attractive thing about this film is the score (composed by Ennio Morricone.) The arrangements work fantastically in the film, creating feelings of triumphant joy in certain scenes, to sheer suspense. A particularly memorable piece is the \"Machine Gun Lullaby\" which plays during the slow motion train station shootout. (An iconic scene)I really appreciated the creeper sequence inside Malones house (can't say much more without spoiling the plot)The only downside of this film is the special effects/stunts - given the year it was made its obviously not high-tech or sophisticated in comparison to recent film.This is one of the first films I remember watching when I was younger & it's still up there with my absolute favourites - despite being made 33 years ago.",

Unfortunately, The Untouchables is an unsatisfying gangster film that is ever-so overrated. Kevin Coster gives an astonishingly lazy performance as Eliot Ness -- in a role that is just wrong for the actor.  Sean Connery -- while perfect in his short role, is not used enough.  Ditto for Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro who just kind of blend with the background.If the film gets anything right, it's the violence.  The Untouchables is a deservedly violent film, with some nice action scenes.  The action scenes however are over-sylized at times (typical De Palma), including a laughable shoot-out that steals from Potemkin.  Add to that a soundtrack that makes ears bleed and it's overlength -- and you have a film that isn't very entertaining and barely passes the mark of being viewable.",

Some of them weren't successful and Ness and crew were the subjects of much ridicule in the press. This is no spoiler, but eventually they got Capone on a tax evasion charge. There is plenty of violence if you like that sort of thing. The film is told almost totally from the law's side, but, in the end, that was the only side that mattered. Robert De Niro shows how great an actor he is and is downright scary as Capone! Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia also star. I don't know how factual this film is, but I truly enjoyed it.",

Started this movie not knowing what to expect and loved seeing so many well-known faces. Though, seeing Andy Garcia act did make me want to hurl. The acting was cheesy in some parts. Take, for example, Sean Connery's horrendous \"Irish\" accent or breathing \"dead\" people.Attire and set design in this movie were visual eye-candy. Giorgio Armani did a nifty job making sure everyone's suit were a sign of the times and roles. Chicago was visually stunning and the movie portrayed the classical Windy City well.The action scenes pepper the movie well and leaves enough to not bore.For all its pluses, two things bothered me about this movie.For starters, the cheesy musical score was distracting and felt ripped from a cheap 90s film. Nothing in the musical score was memorable or added much to the movie. I found myself more annoyed by the music than anything. Punches and gunshots sounded off and didn't match what was on screen. Out of all the money spent on this movie, more should've been spent on sound design.Second, historical inaccuracies were glaring. The operation itself was a lot less flashy than what the movie makes it out to be. A lot fewer people died than what was in the movie. But this can be forgiven, Hollywood has to sell a story somehow.For all that it gives and takes, this movie was a tough one to rate. I'll have to settle on a 3/5. Average at best. The movie aims too high above the bar and misses its mark.Though critically received at the time, this movie felt a bit too cheesy and cliche for my tastes. Scenes were predictable, music was horrendous, and Sean Connery's accent was damnable.I'd recommend this to those interested in Prohibition-era Chicago culture... but not for those with an eye for historical accuracy.",

De Palma's \"dazzling\" direction, ceiling shots for example, are unnecessary; as if De Palma is more concerned about impressing the Academy than telling the story. Smith and Garcia do their job, but nothing fancy. De Niro delivers a surprising unmemorable performance as the notorious Capone. The film itself is overly-theatrical for what it is, what it needs to be and what it should be. But despite all these flaws, none of them are fatal.

Every second that he was on screen made this movie more thrilling and enjoyable.

A GREAT direction job, superb for a popcorn flick and elevates the film beyond that.Connery's performance is solid though I've read differently here. He won Best Supporting Actor - OK, well if the academy thinks so who am I to argue. The prolonged death scene is a bit too Hollywood for me but other than that he makes a great account of himself.Also a lot of criticism was heard about De Niro's performance - I say it was just as brilliant as Goodfellas. He is fantastic as fat, nasty Al Capone, very believable and well executed. He's a pro who's not afraid to take a supporting role.Great lines in this so-so script, as well. They showed the ethnic divisions in the mob vs. the cops vs the Feds very well. Capone was as war with the Irish factions in Chicago, but this wasn't shown. The scene where he beats the guy to death is unforgettable. The actual incident was much uglier and involved three people, not one.Andy Garcia milks his part for all its worth and makes a background character stand out so well, a true talent.Overall, a very watchable film and good fun for all. They really didn't use too much foul language, but it was 1987 after all. Highly recommended!",

Even Morricone's score feels recycled and less inspired than most of his works, but it's still nice to have his flair in there - it still adds to the movie quite a bit.

I am not a huge fan of his, but he has made some good movies.This movie is about a federal agent who is hell bent on arresting and convicting the infamous Al Capone. Federal agent Eliot Ness gets help from a beat cop, a rookie and an accountant.This drama is actually really good. I was expecting this to be a very slow film, but it wasn't. There were a lot of good action scenes and the gun fights were really good. In places this film was gritty and really sucked me in. It was interesting to see how the federal agent planned on convicting Al Capone, especially as Capone was a very dangerous man and was also bribing everyone. Eliot had a big problem trying to get anything to stick on him.The effects were not too good. There was one scene where a guy was falling from a roof top, but this was awful. You could clearly see it was a fake background as he was falling. It reminded me of a comedy film. The only other thing I can complain about the effects. When a guy got shot in the face, you saw the blood on the wall behind him, but he clearly didn't have an entry wound in his head. They didn't even try and make it look real.The acting was pretty good throughout. The film stars Kevin Costner in probably his best role I have seen him in. Other cast members were Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro. I thought this casting was perfect. I was not sure Sean Connery would be any good in this role either, but I have no complaints. He did a great job. The best performance for me though would be for Andy Garcia.

            "content": "Brian DePalma's The Untouchables, made in 1987, demonstrates in what subtle ways film-making has changed in these past 20 years. The Untouchables is an admirable actioner in which, as of course, it should, good beats bad and we can all sleep soundly in bed at night knowing that guys such as Eliot Ness are out there fighting the good fight. It would be tactless to point out here that back in the real world, at the time Ness was operating, the cops were more intent on brutal strike-breaking and beating up the unemployed than nailing gangsters such as Al Capone, but then this is real life as seen through the Tinseltown lens, not real life as experienced by many on the dole queues. Anyway, this is Hollywood, and DePalma does point out that he has created a fiction based on fact and is not trying to show what really happened. And what he has created is a decent film, loads of action and great moments of suspense. I first saw The Untouchables when it was released and liked it. Twenty years on, it doesn't satisfy quite as much. In retrospect, and compared with similar work being produced these days, it is remarkably one-dimensional. There is precious little characterisation, precious little motivation and the ease with with Ness and just three sidekicks manages to nail Capone is all rather too glib. Capone, the unofficial mayor of Chicago, had, after all, the chief of police in his pocket, the city council, much of the judiciary and Lord know who else. But in the DePalma's version of events, Ness does it and does it seemingly with ease. A more satisfying film and the film a more modern director might have attempted would surely have shown a little more of the moral ambiguity which made it all possible, the process by which Capone held such supreme control. And I doubt it would have gone for what can only be described as the cartoon option of giving Ness three partners straight from central casting: the gruff, tough and straight Irish cop, who isn't above taking a dram himself despite buying alcohol being illegal; the kooky egghead accountant who discovers the joy of firing a shotgun and is also not above enjoying an illegal snifter; and the 'ethnic' from the wrong side of the tracks. Historically, Ness had a far larger squad of 'untouchables' and, ironically, wasn't actually responsible for putting Capone behind bars: the accountants did do that, finally nailing the seemingly invincible Capone because he hadn't paid any income tax, and the Volstead Act banning alcohol was eventually repealed. But what the hell, this is avowedly fiction and fiction is what we get. Subsidiary quibbles might be that however great an actor Robert De Niro is, on screen he is not Al Capone but invariably De Niro acting well. Ditto Sean Connery (who must be the first Irishman with a pronounced Scottish brogue). They suffer from the unfortunate fact that it is so difficult to suspend disbelief when they are on screen. Kevin Costner was a relative unknown when he starred in this film and Charles Martin Smith as the kooky accountant is one of those actors who face seems familiar but you can't quite place him. It seems unreasonable to quibble, but just how moral was the untouchable Eliot Ness when, as he does here, he takes justice into his own hands and hurls from a great height the, admittedly very nasty, Capone henchman who had brutally gunned down Sean Connery. This is morality American style. But what the hell, this film was made 20 years ago and cannot really be condemned for not pressing all the modern buttons as well as one might have liked. By all means worth a visit.",

Notable scenes include the formal dinner with a baseball bat; Ness and Malone on one of the bridges over the Chicago River; Ness's confrontation with Capone at the hotel; and the scene at Chicago's Union Station, which I am sure they analyze in film school today.

Action, violence, and blood done with a touch of class, a solid dose of heroism, and some drama.The theme music is excellent. The rest of the soundtrack, though, is not always up to the same standard. Sean Connery is very good, as well as Robert De Niro. The same cannot be said for the others, like Kevin Costner who did give a good performance, but not one of his best.The costumes are great, especially the suits, thanks to Giorgio Armani. The story is uninventive, yet interesting, even if the events seem to move along too quickly, giving us the impression that everything happened at the same time. The sets are great, and detailed. However, the dialogs of the good guys are rather simplistic, to the exception of Connery's.The film is good entertainment, especially if you like old prohibition cops versus gangster flicks.",

Gratefully this wasn't the case at all. You really cared for each of the individual protagonists. Kevin Costner's performance was fantastic, you felt how much he cared but mostly how he just had enough of Al Capone's rain and corruption. Sean Connery was excellent as always, you can believe he's a old school type cop who's seen it all. I didn't realise till after he gets killed how much I cared for Charles Smith's character I think this is due to how well directed the film was, it was full of unexpected twists that kept to you glued to the screen. I needed a pee during the last 40 minutes of the film and I didn't go. I just couldn't stop watching, I had to see what happened next! The sound track was superb, it enhanced every scene it was used in. The directing was brilliant I loved it was done so well, I thought it was better than Scarface. The whole feel of the movie was brilliant and it didn't drag on like some movies do (especially in this crime/drama genre), it was a nice length. This makes the film even more re-watchable which is another positive. One thing that stops it being a ten is I didn't see enough from Al Capone you got a few snippets but you never felt how feared he was by everyone not only who was around him but the people in Chicago in general more of that would of made it even better for me. Overall I really liked this film and thought it was brilliantly done, I will be watching it again for sure.",

The film is curiously very academic for the director, without any really memorable moment of staging (the slow motion seems ridiculous now on the sequence of the stairs in the station at the end).The music of Ennio Morricone changes a little and the composer leaves his usual patterns.The scenario is very classical: constitution of a team, each of its members being complementary in their talents, then they get to know each other, then it's the action and the confrontation and finally it's the epilogue with the collateral damage and the balance.The film leaves an impression of lack.

Another standout performance is by BillyDrago, who played Capone's right-hand man Frank Nitti, whosemain hobby in life is to fill people with lead.

            "content": "The Untouchables is a great film. There, I said it. Perhaps that's not an altogether risky opinion. After all, most people would agree with me. However, some people \u0096 namely critics \u0096 would not hesitate to rank it several places lower on the gangster ladder than, say, The Godfather and Goodfellas. \"It's not as deep,\" they might say, \"pure entertainment.\" This is exactly why I love this film and find it to be one of the best in the genre. It's not a rich character study, it's not a sweeping epic covering multiple generations, and it's not a twisted tale of corruption and redemption. It's just a damn fine piece of movie-making.The characters in this film are not fleshed-out, multi-dimensional, altogether interesting people. But this is not a knock against the film's quality; like everything else about the film, these individuals are highly stylized and lacking a fair amount of substance. They're larger-than-life heroes and villains. And it works. The story being told is a classical, metaphorical, allegorical tale of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, white hats vs. black hats. There are no mentions of conflicted allegiances, double-agents, or self-serving motivations. It is just the good guys against the bad guys.It is true that the story takes many liberties with the real-life accounts of Eliot Ness and Al Capone. Large portions of the film are radically altered for dramatic and narrative purposes. Many characters never existed. But, again, this is not a fault of the film. This movie does not purport to be a documentary or even a historical retelling of famous events: it is just a movie. Situations and events must be dramatized to create suspense, to draw out sympathies, to direct the audience's feelings. I have no problem with fictionalizing historical events for the purpose of the narrative; after all, films are only 'based' on a true story.This movie is full of so many classic moments that it's difficult to pick a favourite. Of course, there's the memorable scene when the Untouchables embark on their first liquor raid. The wide, iconic shot of the four crossing the street, the fantastic production design remaking Chicago's beautiful La Salle street, Ennio Morricone's incredibly sweeping music \u0096 all combine to make a brief scene that is certain to be remembered on many a film montage in the future. There's the sequence at the Canadian border, which \u0096 despite my patriotism flinching at the pathetic portrayal of the Mounties \u0096 utilizes the same music and cinematography to maximum effect. And, obviously, there's the brilliant homage to the Odessa Steps scene in Battleship Potemkin, complete with a couple sailors caught in the crossfire. This climatic scene is by far the most thrilling of the film, stretching on for what seems like an eternity but never losing its suspense or excitement. It is, truly, a film of memorable moments.Sean Connery certainly deserved his Oscar, as he owns the screen whenever he's on it and makes us pine for him whenever he's off. His character is by far the most developed (despite the focus being on Ness) and thus his performance is by far the best. Costner is given little to work with besides a rather boring goody-two-shoes protagonist, and De Niro chews scenery like there's no tomorrow, but Connery draws us in and makes us stay there. It's one of the more deserving Oscar wins I can think of, and it's a fitting tribute to not only the actor, but to the film itself.As said before, this is definitely no Godfather. In fact, I would liken this film more to something like Star Wars than Scarface. It certainly owes much more to the pulpy serials of the '40s and '50s than the dark sagas of the '70s and '80s. It never pretends to be anything more than a piece of entertainment, and it excels at that brilliantly. Every single aspect of the production is top-notch, from De Palma's recognizable direction to Mamet's solid script to Morricone's amazing score, making for what I believe to be one of the greatest gangster films ever made and certainly a landmark in recent cinema.",

            "review_title": "Gripping Chicago gangster thriller depicts touching bond between four law enforcers",
            "content": "Although liberally laced with violence and profanity, this movie provides a gripping depiction of the monumental effort involved by a handful of men in bringing to justice the gangster, Al Capone. It features an authentic 1930's Chicago atmosphere, the styles and automobiles of that era. While perhaps the story isn't totally historical, I always found the reality amazing that this ruthless murderer was finally nailed by authorities on the comparatively trivial charge of income tax evasion. The movie is set in Prohibition Era Chicago. Crime lord Al Capone rules the city and even controls the police force, where corruption is rampant. Unlike most of his fellow law enforcement officers, Federal Agent Elliot Ness, cannot turn a blind eye to the criminal underworld and resolves to take Capone down by indicting him on income tax charges. To achieve this goal, he assembles a team consisting of a veteran cop Jim Malone, a rookie sharpshooter George Stone, and a Treasury accountant Oscar Wallace. Together this band of very disparate individuals sets out to bring Capone down.The film features a stellar cast. Kevin Costner imparts the right touch to Ness, who is originally innocent and honourable, but later finds himself involved in an increasingly dirty war. At first he is a fresh faced do gooder in a three piece suit, determined to do everything strictly by the book. As events unfold, he realizes that he must resort to a few less noble means to achieve his worthy goal.Sean Connery shines in his performance as the tough, old fashioned, Irish-American beat cop Malone, for which he fully deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He displays humour, charm, and unfailing no nonsense wisdom in the ways of both Chicago's criminals and crooked cops. The other team members are well portrayed here by Andy Garcia as the sharpshooter Agent Stone, fresh out of the police academy, and Charles Martin Smith as the bookish accountant, Oscar Wallace. There's a cute and amusing scene in which the scholarly, bespectacled Wallace takes to horseback in a 'yee haw' fashion during one of their shootouts with the illegal alcohol dealers.Always the quintessential expert at mobster roles, Robert DeNiro is perfect as Capone. Some claim he gives too warm and fuzzy an image to this ruthless gangster. However, I believe he portrays perfectly this cocky, cold blooded killer. Even Capone's barber is terrified when he inadvertently cuts him while shaving. The tuxedo clad Capone's tears during a sad scene at the opera failed to elicit much compassion from me, instead merely inspiring a sense of outrage and disgust.Ness's family life is portrayed briefly here. We see his wife's little notes in his lunch bag, Ness at his young daughter's bedside as she says her prayers, and him visiting his new baby son in hospital. His family must of course be hustled off to safety after they are threatened by Capone's hoodlums. My only complaint is the dewy eyed, unrealistically innocent and naive wife. Her cheerful nonchalance strains credulity, as in reality one would predict her to be distraught with concern over her husband's safety.This cops and robbers thriller is engrossing but also troubling with so much violence. There are certainly gripping action sequences and shoot outs, especially the masterful train station scene. Personally, I would check with reliable sources before taking any of it as historical fact. However, the movie brilliantly captures the touching bond that develops between these four highly motivated and personally endangered Untouchables.",

But this is the retelling of recent history. And they are doing so much wrong in retelling it. So many of the details are false...there may very well be more falsehoods than truth in the movie. And we are talking about some very big things too. For instance two of the officers who are working together in the film never actually met! And the worst part is that they have the main character kill a man in the movie who he didn't kill in real life, but instead went on to replace al capone as head of his family and then eventually died of natural causes. Where they hell do they get off doing that? What they should have done, if they had the integrity, would be to say that that is what happened after al died at the end of the film. After they say how long al served in jail and how he died...but they don't do any of that! The movie ends with al going to jail, not knowing what happened after that. A very poor ending.So I give this movie a 1-2 for accuracy. Altogether I give it a 6. Worth watching only if you watch it alongside a documentary on al capone so you know whats what.",

The acting of De Niro and Connery were on point and many other actors were not far behind.  The plot and the shoot out scenes were very lacking.  Almost from the beginning, we pushed to believe that Ness was out to get Capone on tax evasion.  This just seemed a little lame, although i know it was factual.  In general, I'd say that De Palma was trying too hard to make this movie commercial and a box office hit, as opposed to a solid dramatic piece.  I found myself laughing at Costner's pathetic lines that were obviously meant to be more emotional and dramatic.  They just turned out weak and too hokey.  If you're sitting around and someone brings The Untouchables over to watch, go for it.  Not a bad movie, but I would recommend that you wouldn't waste this movie as your pick when going to a rental store, let someone else waste their choice on it.

The film's story follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner in his best role and perfermance), a Treasury officer who is sent from D.C. to Chicago during Prohibition to enforce the law and discovers after a raid that there's corruption in the city's police force.  Ness begins the crackdown when he enlists the aid of three men: Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a Irish cop, a very raw and curious police recruit named George Stone (Andy Garcia), and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant who Ness meets in his office. In that scene, Wallace tells Ness that one of the city's most notorious mobsters, Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro in an amusing yet in wicked fashion) has committed tax evasion.  Besides that scene and the one where Ness and Malone are together in the church, the film never shows any serious signs of letting down.  De Palma, who is also known for directing the classic bloodfest known as \"Carrie\", wisefully mixes in the sequences that either have action or Hitchcock-like suspense and squeezes in the ethinc conflict (Italians and Irish).  Besides that, two lesser known actors, Billy Drago and Richard Bradford are good here as Capone's swift and vicious enforcer Frank Nitti and the police chief who tries to convince Malone to stay out of the battle between Ness and Capone.

You could swear, with each passing frame that the film you are witnessing the progression of an outstanding production. We have De Niro, playing the role he seemed to be born to play (Al Capone) and Sean Connery giving a great comeback performance as a witty, hardened police officer. The shots are beautiful, with Prohibition Era Chicago looking it's finest. However, these qualities are unfortunately the only feature that this film really has going for it. Kevin Costner is bland in his leading role, spurting forth some of the more dramatic lines in the equally bland script with the abandon of a high school drama student trying his best to gain some additional credit. Some of De Palma's directorial flourishes fail entirely here, particularly in a zoom into close-up shot of De Niro's face after murdering one of his men brutally with a baseball bat. A once- effective scene now becomes funny, largely thanks to the addition of some corny music. However, the film proves to be entirely watchable and thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless. It has flashes of genius, but overall seems to be a failure in the final product.Clich\u00e9d writing, average performance's from most of the cast and some straight-up laughably phoned in performances make this film one of the most overrated 'classics' of our time.",

Except that it seems to take the violence up a good notch and has the treasury police having to use a good deal of firepower in addition to their accounting skills to finally put Capone away.That and the budget and attempt to grab mainstream appeal should make it not at all surprising that it's got its flaws. Namely, it frequently descends into typical chase and shootout scenes for nothing other than the sheer joy of yanking the audience around. Certainly, as the poster attempts to telegraph to its audience from the beginning, this is an action movie at heart. No one will complain that this movie attempts to meticulously analyse the US tax code and its application to organised crime.Yet as dumb as some of the action scenes are, the movie is great food for thought if you stop and think of the historical context in which it takes place and which is frequently hinted at by the movie. This is the era of Prohibition, where a drug the majority of the people indulged in and society at large felt was benign was prohibited. While the whole affair probably didn't unfold as this movie tells it, I don't think anyone will doubt that it was a brutal war on drugs involving a hearty portion of grenades and tommy guns.And all for what? As the movie's tongue-in-cheek ending reminds us after all the exhausting mindless shootouts, it was all pointless, pointless. It was a drug war that no one wanted against a drug that everyone wanted and it left a lot of senseless deaths in its wake.Amidst rising drug cartel violence all over the world, this movie, just like the great experiment of Prohibition itself, leave a lot to ponder with regard to society's penchant for banning of substances and the ugly violence that results from that.Honourable Mentions: El Infierno (2010). The curtain eventually falls in Prohibition and, although it was pointless, there's something of a relieving ending in The Untouchables - one less thing to worry about tomorrow. Not so in El Infierno, that represents the drug war as an endless cycle of violence.",

            "content": "A fairly humdrum retelling of the Chicago gangster wars of the 20s & 30s and in particular Elliot Ness' long term battle bringing top gangster Al Capone to book on a range of  charges from murder, prohibition & bootlegging to his eventual downfall of simple tax evasion.De Palma does a pretty bad hash with this movie. Firstly, he is hard pushed into thinking of any original cinematography he can genuinely call his own. The most blatant rip off is the \"Odessa Steps\" scene at the train station which was originally done so masterfully decades ago in the Russian film Battleship Potyomkin (1925).And I doubt if the real Ness swaned around in designer clothes back in the 20s either. But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.Then we have  the actors. Connery really does amaze me sometimes. He plays Malone a bit like Office Dibble out of Top Cat, unsure of what accent to use and always coming out with words of wisdom but never really convincing us with any true conviction. Although his death scene was quite moving otherwise he was as wooden as a beer keg.Costner again excels as a man with a total charisma bypass. He sparkles from time to time but generally he just plods through the story in his customary dot to dot style.The only shining light would be De Nero as the Big C himself. Totally convincing, totally ruthless, played just right - never drifting into characature, never falling into cliche, De Nero is excellent. And of course who can forget his little baseball story around the dinner table!The only criticism with De Nero is that we don't get to see enough of him; we don't get the chance to absorb his character or understand his evil mannerisms. De Palma offers simple sign posting telling the audience that this guy is all bad and that's all you need to know.The supporting cast give a good account of themselves, especially Garcia & Martin-Smith. The production values are obviously high & lavish but all this eye candy & stylish camera work doesn't make for a good film with an underworked script. De Palma is too heavy handed with his character development with regards the good guys - hense the heavy emphasis on Ness being a good family man, doting wife, child & baby on the way. All done in about 10 minutes.The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.The musical score is very upbeat & concise which is perhaps the only good thing about the movie; that and some decent lighting & 2nd unit camera work.Overall, a film full of other people's ideas packaged with 80's designerism & style over content but with nothing new to offer. **/*****",

That was until I saw The Untouchables, things changed ever so much after the first viewing, at that is the only viewing that I can stomach. Although I will say that this film lead me to do some research of my own on Prohibition, I still feel that that is not what this film is about. On the other hand it wants to be so badly, politically speaking that is. It wants to be a historical/accurate portrayal of the era, at least in the beginning any way, but it diverges off on a path that makes it out to be a typical gangster film. The characters are all disposable to one extent or another, the only two that I actually care for are Capone (Robert DeNiro) and Malone (Sean Connery), the only reason I find them some what attractable is because they have the best lines. Kevin Costner is so full of himself that it is really a joke to watch him on the screen, the other actors are mostly expendable, anyone could have played those respective roles. I lost interest in the film about thirty to forty minutes in, I wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I've come to the conclusion that Brian DePalma couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag, the only film of his that I enjoy is Scarface and that is mostly for the performances. Other than that DePalma is a lousy director and should not be considered an elitist among the top tier American directors. When I review a film I hate to give anything away, therefore all I can say is that if you really want to watch this, be my guest, it's not the worst thing ever but it certainly isn't great. If it was good, all I would say is go see it, but if it is bad I can talk about it at length for the misfortunes and wrong turns that a specific movie can take, this is not really either of those, it isn't great and it isn't terrible, the thing that makes it unbearable, in my eyes anyway, is Brian DePalma, it is as if he is still a student in film school and it truly shows while watching the Untouchables.",

Most of them commenting on the performances, the direction, the way that 1930's Chicago was painstakingly rebuilt...and the list goes on. Does it live up to the hype? well, yes and no.Basically, the story revolves around Elliot ness, who is newly appointed treasury officer, and his band of 3 other men (otherwise known as the untouchables) and their fight to bring down Alfonso Capone. And thats it. No beating around the bush, the story is simple. And that, for me is the films first failing. It is one of the few epic dramas which i felt could have gone on longer. There should have been more about Capone, and Chicago in general. I felt that it was just a bit...light. However, gripes aside, this is a fine piece of cinema which reeks of quality and is obviously a labour of love from every one involved. Every performance is brilliant, worthy of note are Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. The direction is as good as anything we have seen from De Palma, and shows that he is one of the best directors out there, easily a match for Scorcese, Cameron, Spielberg, etc. He packs the film with detailed reconstruction of Chicago, brutal violence and knows how to get the best out of his cast.My verdict? There is no doubt about the fact that this is a good film. However, i felt it needed something more. As period dramas go, Millers crossing had more style, Once Upon a time in America had more substance, and The Godfather...well, we all know what that turned out like!",

            "content": "Clearly, because this movie existed, Public Enemies should never have been made. With very believable depiction, legendary film-making and performances, The Untouchables gave you the best crime epic about 1930s.One of the best efforts pulled off by the movie, as mentioned, lies within its believability. The depictions of either Ness or Capone could have been totally cartoonish or on the other extreme, being like robots. However, Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro were so good in their characters that Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should have taken notes. Ness was never an \"action hero\" or someone really so \"untouchable\" in the movie. On the contrast, he is weak, regularly depressed and could fail at all. As the core character of the story, he is legendary not only in his achievement in taking down Capone, but also in his character's development from a dedicated white knight to a somewhat bad-ass crime fighter. Costner's performance totally made Ness more convincing and emotional, charged by Brian De Palma's best casting ever. The movie is convincing also because it's multi-dimensional, that a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old will both enjoy but got different things from it. The storyline flowed so naturally and realistically that as an audience one felt the pain, the fear and the price of fighting crime and criminals. Yes, this is a movie where the heroes can get hurt, killed, but still they pulled off a legendary fight with the most vicious criminal. Unlike Public Enemies' self-indulgent storyline, The Untouchables is a lesson about character study in a streamlined story-telling. The reason Sean Connery deserved his Oscar is also justified here.The visuals, along with other aspects of the movie, are nearly perfected by director De Palma. The gunfights may not be so stylish and kinetic as in recent films like Public Enemies, but definitely had their edge. Essentially, the movie never put too much weight on actions, yet the actions stood out to entertain. Sometimes, old school is good school.If you notice, The Untouchables already had everything that Public Enemies wanted to talk about, and in a better way and shorter time. It's full of mesmerizing camera works and likable characters, yet stayed true to the nature of reality, no doubt it's only getting better and better after all these years.",

Well, that may be so, but at the end of the day, i am the view and i haven't read that damn book, and it is I who has to be convinced in what i see on the screen in front of me, and i felt ashamed and cringed whenever i saw him! Bland, stiff, with that really dumb look in his eyes, i just couldn't stand it, and even felt bad about - i really tried to like this movie! The screenwriters made his character the all-winning star of Chicago police department, the hero who smashed the villains with a pure good heart and some tough attitude. In this case, even the tough attitude was missing. I just couldn't take him seriously. Yeah, maybe De Niro was over the top, but he breathed *mean* and arrogant. Connery's acting (and overall character) was too much for me. The old man who always knows best and runs around screaming at people, at all times obsessed with Capone and his gang. And I liked Drago's 10 screen minutes, he's a nice villain like always. And my liking ends there.4 stars for the nice suits and nothing more to do here.",

Or perhaps I don't respond well to the cloying nostalgic music and acting, even. There was certainly one really strong sequence, taking place in a train station in the final half-hour of the film that actually really bored me at first. I think perhaps that some of what Brian De Palma tried to do for suspense struck me as indicating lack of momentum. Certainly at the beginning of the scene, I found myself largely wondering what I was supposed to think was going on, and I'm not even sure if that was deliberate. It probably contributes to the thrill when the confrontation does ensue, but maybe there's a smoother way to do that, especially when regarding the particularly lethargic.Certainly, the colors are very rich, and there are some masterful shots, which all shows a good level of artistry. Maybe I just expect my action to be too fast, or maybe this is really more of the Disney version of cops vs. mafia, ambiguous morals and hardcore violence aside.

He shines in any scenes where emotions are high and everything becomes serious. Robert De Niro plays Al Capone, and I kind of wish they showed more of him, because I enjoyed watching him, especially in the end courtroom scene. It just felt like he was giving a good performance that couldn't be 100% enjoyed because he wasn't present enough.The film includes quite a few classic scenes and quotes that are extremely memorable.

My first clue should have been Kevin Costner and Sean Connery.

Then you got the creepy evil gangster and the big time mob boss. All this is just so reminiscent of every other cop/criminal movie that wasn't that good. So you take these clich\u00e9 characters and you put them in a less than exciting story. Prohibition, has there ever been a law less respected. Costner's character doesn't even have passion for the law, he states he just wants to uphold it, so why fight so hard to uphold a law you really don't have strong feelings for is beyond me. Anyway a bunch of over dramatic events pan out with semi gruesome murders to add to the film trying to establish its rugged credibility. All the while we have to listen to one of the worst scores in movie history. I mean the music is bad, when someone is sad the music is so over the top sad music it is ridiculous. And when something exciting is happening the music is so in your face it is annoying. The movie should have also concentrated on Capone and his cold bloodiness more...instead he is rarely in the movie and really serves no purpose. This movie did have some OK points but for the most part there are plenty more movies you could watch to get what this movie was going for. 2 worst things 1. score 2. actor choice 2 best things 1.De Niro 2. gruesome murders",

There are only a handful of true classics from that time and this is one of them.There's plenty of comedy, action, clever dialog, beautiful music and costumes present to make 3 good films. The best part of this film was probably the score. One of the best ones the master has made and definitely my favorite. He's reinvented movie scores in so many ways. The whole cast delivers a decent performance, with the exception of Sean Connery and Robert De Niro, who really lift this film to a higher level. I can't think of anyone more perfect to portray Capone than De Niro. Connery got the Oscar. Did he deserve it for this? Maybe, maybe not. Fact is he did deserve it for a great series of wonderful performances before 1987. He steals every scene in The Untouchables, like he does in so many of his films. One thing I can't fail to mention is the camera-work in this film. It may not be very modern but it sure is stylish. I loved it and would prefer a style like this always over modern camera-work \u00e0 la Greengrass.Many complain about the level of cheesiness, but I find many scenes charming and endearing rather than cheesy. I guess it depends on how you feel the movie personally. It's never meant to be as gritty as Carlito's Way or Scarface. People who expect everyone of De Palma's films to have the same atmosphere as his most famous works shall be disappointed.

They way he portrays a Italian mafia is just awesome! He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol\nBad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie.\nFrom the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene. The elevator scene is pretty good.

Costner is the golden Ness, a genuinely uncompromisable and good person. Connery, in an Oscar-winning role, is great as the old Irish cop who doesn't let rules get in the way, in one of the most shocking, brutal and awesome moments. And De Niro... he's one of the best ever, and the Untouchables is no exception. The dinner scene.Like the more current Inglorious Basterds, the action in Untouchables is mostly quick and brutal, carried out by a few men.

The whole build up with the \"lets gather a bunch of of misfits and throw them into action\" was beautiful and entertaining for five minutes, then it just became obviously manipulative from a plot perspective. Many of the scenes seemed weirdly empty, like something was wrong in the world building process. Not enough smoke, not enough rain and dirt, not enough people! Everything was very set-piecy which fit the overly clich\u00e9d cinematography though.One of the things that annoyed me the most was the \"folksy\" - \"good old timey whimey\" lets a have big ol' shootout with music so overly dramatic and hollywoodesque your ears almost fell of. Also you grew increasingly tired with the weird mix of violence, and fun-for-the-whole-family atmosphere. Which leads me to the main problem: While Scarface and Carlitos Way had some kind of nihilistic and grotesque humor in the depiction of the coke era, and made no effort to make anything PG13, this movie didn't really seem sure of what it was doing. Everything seemed to clean cut, to polished and without nerve and humor. Which weirdly enough made this movie come of as being lot more sociopathic in its utilisation of violence. Because when violence is used in tandem with the Hollywood clich\u00e9s the whole thing reeks of money grubbing producers and not willful directors. Give me more nuance, more grit, or at least some warmth from unexpected characters. Scorcese did it better. Palmas other movies did it better.",

On the flip side of this, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, and there are a few movies he made that I either haven't seen or only seen once because I don't think they're worth watching. But on to THE UNTOUCHABLES.When I commented on the television show, I mentioned that Costner plays Ness more like a nerdy accountant. I don't particularly like this interpretation of Ness, although after reading Ness's bio, I understand that this was the way he really was. I suppose it makes sense, since he worked for the treasury department.This is a great story about the Chicago underworld in the thirties and the men who helped bring them to justice. And what have we here? Another soundtrack by the great one, Ennio Morricone. Slightly different fare from his great spaghetti Western scores, but still not bad. I'll take Morricone on a so-so day before I'll take most other composers on their best day.Robert Di Niro is chilling as the ruthless Al Capone. Did he win an Oscar for that performance? He should have. And the movie kept you on the edge of your seat, wondering how this chess game was going to be played out. Interesting that Frank Nitti met his demise after Capone was convicted of income tax evasion. He lasted a pretty long time in the TV show. And Jimmy Malone's statement is so true. In order to win a war on crime, you have to play dirty. To borrow a quote from the movie, \"If Capone comes at you with a knife, you bring a gun. If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way.\" Ness had to slaughter all sorts of sacred cows to bring Capone and his men down. But that's what it takes sometimes to keep this country safe. Something our politicians should think about before they pass legislation protecting the rights of criminals. 9 out of 10.",

But the focus one in this film is a police agent, Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) as the main character. It's about the effort of Eliot in bringing Al Capone to the justice department for many crimes were made by him.I'm not sure if this film really based 100% on true story as I don't follow that much on Al Capone's cases. Next, back into the story. Two hours given was satisfying the feeling. A calm story line and not too rush. And it's given me to feel the worry and nervousness that felt by the main character and the other protagonists.Character building is pretty good for me which the main character are struggling on his shameful working performance at the beginning of story and start to rise in the fight to take down Al Capone. A bit disappointment, Al Capone's character seems not to be given a chance to emerge his evilness in the film instead Frank Nitti(Billy Drago) is more evil as Nitti is simply the sidekick that responsible for dirtying his hand to make sure the hands of big boss is always clean. Maybe because of this is a true story and nearly end of the power of Al Capone in Chicago. So only that little things could be shown there. In addition at the beginning scene, the dirty hand of Nitti was the cause of making me shocked and thought that he is the person that should be kicked in the ass than Al Capone.The action that will keep to be remembered of course at the shooting scene at the train station that shows in amazing slow motion. The excitement is so tasty. The cinematography that matches with the west/American fashion in the setting of time around 30-40's making me felt like watching a 60's Hollywood film in color, just my feeling only.",

We learnt nothing about most of the \"Untouchables\", and Al Capone was just a gross caricature, with De Niro hamming it up shamelessly.The soundtrack sounded like it belonged to an episode of Inspector Gadget, and ruined a number of scenes.The scenes themselves were largely predictable or horribly overblown (e.g. Connery taking twenty bullets before dragging himself across the carpet to the sound of opera, the silly shootout with a baby's pram careering through the middle of it, the accountant-turned-Rambo who kills several hired guns before avoiding certain death thanks to blind luck, the nauseating scenes of Costner's wife cradling their perfect blonde child/in prayer/gazing into his eyes).Watch it by all means, but prepare your expectations - this is no masterpiece.",

There are some differences between characters and scenes in the movie that are featured in the book.  For example:1.  Instead of an all-white suit, Frank Nitti wears a blue suit with a grey fedora with a narrow black band.2.  Vito D'Ambrosio's character of Bowtie is called Rudensky in the book.3.  After the speakeasy bombing, Nitti is stopped by a suspicious patrolman. That scene was also supposed to be in the movie, but it was dropped before its release.4.  Ness's daughter is called Cora.  Her name was never spoken in the movie.5.  Ness has an informer named Stash Moser, who acts as an undercover agent during the disastrous first raid, but is killed by the mob shortly after.6.  Ness meets Jimmy Malone before the first raid, not after it.7.  The newspaper reporter who follows Ness around is called Ferguson, not Scoop.8.  After the first raid, Ness takes a walk around Chicago and finds himself in front of the Lexington Hotel, Capone's headquarters.9.  George Stone is called by his Italian name \"Giuseppe\" by most of the other Untouchables members.10. Every Untouchables member except Oscar Wallace carries a tommygun during the battle at the Canadian border.11. The Capone member whom the Untouchables nab at the Canadian border is not Capone's bagman George, but his bookkeeper Walter Payne.12. The Chicago District Attorney's name is Ralph Morgan.13. When Ness goes to the hospital to visit his wife who's just given birth, three Capone men dressed as hospital workers attempt to kill him.  A gunfight ensues and all three Capone men are killed.14. Wallace isn't shot to death inside the elevator with the witness.  He gets killed after he steps out of the elevator at the bottom of the elevator tunnel, and Payne is picked up by Frank Nitti.15. We find out that Malone was married, but his wife died while giving birth to their child, and the child died too.  Also, his father was shot and killed by robbers a few years before he was scheduled to retire.16. Instead of chewing up Malone with tommygun bullets, Nitti shoots him in the head with a revolver and cuts his throat from ear to ear.17. The shootout at Union Station doesn't take place on the steps, but inside the train that's scheduled to take Payne to Florida.Sure, the movie may distort historical facts, but it's a great action film. If there had been an MTV Movie Awards back in 1987, Billy Drago could have taken home a Best Supporting Villain award for his chilling role as Frank Nitti.",

            "content": "I reviewed The Untouchables about a year ago, but after watching it yesterday on television,I felt I had to do another review, because I perceived a narrative quality that I hadn't notice in the first time I saw it. The movie marked me, specially due some brutal action scenes (who can forget the gruesome moment in which the underrated Billy Drago blows away Sean Connery with a machine gun?), but The Untouchables isn't just about style.Well, the movie is undoubtly a stylish and violent thriller, but that's no surprise, since De Palma is known for his peculiar way of making films, it has masterful performances, and although some people say that Robert De Niro was terrible as Capone, in my opinion he did one hell of a job. His Capone is as menacing, cynic and tough as the Jimmy Conway of Goodfellas.Sean Connery was great too, Malone, his character, was the toughest one of \"the crew\" and his performance was terrific, controlled and true-to-life because when you watch the film, you are actually absorbed by the way De Palma develops Malone's relationship and friendship with Costner's character, and you realize that in the end, Costner's character isn't the same man he was, he took a lot of his old friend with him.In the end, you actually feel that you've known each one of those characters, and you fell sorry for the fate of some unfortunate members of the team and glad for the success of the others who survived.Brian De Palma is acclaimed for his technique in delivering complex takes and thrilling tension, but here he also managed to give space for the actors to give stand-out performances and he also knew how to tell a good story without letting his personal visual and technique abilities to get in the way of the plot, something he didn't achieved in Mission to Mars.",

Counting on few, but courageous men at his side, including a veteran and violent policeman, Malone (Sean Connery, delivering the best acting of his career and 1987's Academy Award Winner for best supporting actor). \"The Untouchables\" was filmed with exuberance and talent by film director Brian DePalma. Agile and full of action, \"The Untouchables\" shines and thrills, be through its rhythm, be through its performances.Connery and De Niro transform the film in a memorable show, a faithful picture of the 1930's Chicago, a study on the Mafia and about the personality and the men's who decided to challenge it interior motivation, taking a risk and challenging all the dangers. Pretty and dramatic music, detailed picture and rebuilding of  time and an experienced and vigorous direction consecrates \"The Untouchables\" as a classic, in spite of being excessively violent. The death of Malone, who is killed by a gangster who strafes him copiously, is frightening and shocking and when Ness holds his hand and promises revenge, we felt that the action will begin. \"Your friend died like an Irish pig, you think on that when the jury acquits me...\", the murderer of Malone comments, happy and cynic, for Ness. Costner catches him and pulls him of the top of a building, the man drops over a car and squashes the head: at this time, Ness and DePalma show that nobody is above the law, and that the action will begin!!\"The Untouchables\" i rated for extreme violence and language.The cast: Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Sean Connery.",

            "content": "It's the 1930's. Prohibition is affecting the nation. But, in the Windy City, there's a war waging. A war between the good guys and the bad guys. A war between the cops and the gangsters. A war between Elliot Ness and Al Capone.Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is a film that tells us that story and tells it very well, indeed. In the 1930's, Prohibition was affecting everyone. Businesses had to be shaken down by the law for illegal booze and drinks. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the main character and leader of a squad of police officers who called themselves, The Untouchables. Ness and a fellow Irish cop, Jimmy Malone, (Sean Connery) enlisted Italian-American policeman George Stone (Andy Garcia) in the group along with accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Together, their main objective is to bring down the big man who runs all of the illegal business in the streets of Chicago. And that name is Al Capone (Robert De Niro). After cracking down on illegal booze operations and successfully cutting off Capone's gangsters in Canada, the Untouchables gain popularity. Later on however, several members of the group are being killed off by Capone's right-hand man. It's up to Ness to go against Capone's right-hand man and also Capone.The film has a real sense of authenticity to the period era. De Palma has all of the right ingredients to make this picture works. From the cars to the guns to the clothes. The art direction is very well done and achieves the actual historic setting of the 1930's. What De Palma does in this film and his earlier gangster film, Scarface, is that he brings us into a glamorous world of the gangster life, but doesn't let the artistic details get in the way of the characters and the acting.As for the performances, I admired the supporting casting of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone. Connery did win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this movie. Connery does a very good as portraying Malone as Ness' mentor. In one particular scene where Ness is at a church and meets Malone for the second time, he gives Ness a little piece of advice. \"Shoot fast and shoot first.\" Together along with Garcia and Smith, their chemistry is the most interesting part in this movie. For De Niro, I felt that he gives a mediocre performance as Capone. In my opinion, I had a very hard time accepting him as Capone, since his appearance doesn't necessarily match with the real Capone. Kevin Costner does a good job portraying a very young Elliot Ness. This young Ness is very different than Robert Stack's portrayal of Ness in the older version of the TV series. Even though The Untouchables is based on a true story and that it achieves on both style and authenticity, it is actually a fictionalized account on Ness and Capone. But, I think the reason why this movie is entertaining is that it's wonderful and great to look at and that we, as the audience can enjoy what is being done between both men who come from opposite sides of the law. I believe that this film rivals up there with The Godfather. What I mean by that comparison is that the two films presents us a glamorous look and feeling of the gangster world. It is lively and very colorful to look at, yet the characters are wrapped in their own situations where they have to deal with certain people in order to get the job done. In this case, The Untouchables is ambitious, yet it is not longer than Scarface.The Untouchables is a very good gangster film, both well directed and well art-directed. It's style and substance drives the energy toward the film, creating a sense of motion and ambition. The chemistry between Costner and Connery works and also it works for the members as well. Brian De Palma made a very modern version of the TV series and it's his best work since Scarface. \u2605\u2605\u2605 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",

Yet as the credits roll, I'm left with the undeniable feeling that this wasn't so great.When you see a great movie, it hits you fast and sure. There's no doubt. Kevin Costner's performance on the other hand left me with a lot of doubt. I'm left wondering if the real Eliot Ness could have possibly been as one-dimensional in his pursuit of honourable justice. Even more disappointing is Robert De Niro as Al Capone. We are given no insight into the brilliant criminal mind of Capone. What we see is an articulate gangster who throws an abundance of hissy fits. Still, the sheer energy that De Niro brings is refreshing to watch.Arriving to rescue the film are Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. Connery is decidedly not an Irishman, but who's paying attention? In Malone we see a man beyond the basic notions of justice, and we are genuinely touched by his death. I could hardly say the same if Ness had bit the bullet. Garcia's character is convincingly mysterious. He wants to be a cop, and I'm eager to know the reason.There's no shortage of cringe-worthy scenes, reminding us of the supersaturated and clich\u00e9d state of the gangster movie genre. One example can be found in Costner's refusal of a bribe from the mob early on in the film. Another can be found in the stupidly heroic shotguns-blazing liquor convoy raid at a bridge in Canada. To compensate, there are some great moments like the train station arrest of Capone's bookkeeper.It should be mentioned that the whole movie strikes with a less than serious surreal attitude, which was pivotal to SCARFACE, but incompatible with the very real story of Al Capone.In the end, the movie works. I enjoyed it, and that's more important than anything else.",

Basically, The Untouchables is a movie where a nerd, a geek and a grandpa fight against well organized mafia guys. The main character is, both in this movie and in any other books I read, an average man, that acted following the orders given by political leaders of that time. He basically led, in reality, not according to the movie, a well prepared team of gunmen that finished the mafia in a short time. Once again, do not get fooled by the movie, politicians decided that Mafia is no longer useful and they finished it. It's that simple.

And now I decided to check out Brian De Palma's 1987 The Untouchables.first of all I have to say that Robert De Niro's interpretation of Al Capone was very memorizing he not only sounded but looked like the true Al Capone. Rod Steiger in 1959 did a commendable job sounding and acting like Al Capone also. The late great Neville Brand did a good job also on the TV series pilot the Scarface mob potraying a menacing Al Capone also.Kevin Costner: I believe he was great casting, he actually even look like Robert Stacks Eliot Ness from the TV show only much more taller. What surprised me was that Costner does not have a manly voice! There were quite a few scenes in this movie that to me required a very aggressive and loud voice and Costner just did not have it in him!? Other than that I believe he was right on casting but the voice thing really surprised me.Sean Connery: as Eliot Ness right hand man Malone, Connery was ideal casting. it was fun to watch Connery still having that \"James Bond\" energy and power back in 1987 still. He had someone great one-liners and some nice scenes even though his death scene was a little unbelievable and overdramatic but it was an essential scene since this motivates Eliot Ness to really go after Capone hardcoreAndy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith: two very good actors but they were pretty much regulated to the background with they're small and somewhat insignificant parts in the movie.. but still they made history as one of Hollywood's most awkward and weird pairing of Superstars in a one-of-a-kind movie and a one-of-a-kind group.Richard Bradford: ideal casting for Bradford as a chief of police, he even has a very nice fight scene with Connery's Malone and the back alleyBilly Drago: wonderful ideal casting for this evil Sinister looking actor who was cast as Capone's number one henchman Hitman Frank Nitti. He practically does away himself Eliot ness's team! It was only fitting that Costner's Eliot Ness was the one to do him away.There was an assortment of background stars who were to become future stars on their own in the future which included Patricia Clarkson as Eliot ness's wife really didn't have much to do but be a scared wife and mother and was regulated to the background scenes, Don Harvey got a very small seen as one of the officers that assist Eliot Ness in a raid. Chelcie Ross had a bit part as a reporter but I felt he was truly wasted since this character actor in the past has made very good movies and can play Sinister villain as parts to perfection. Jack Kehoe as Al Capone's accountant was also wasted to me in a very small bit role. Robert De Niro's friend Clem caserta play the role of Capone's one of many bodyguards.There was one actor that threw me off for a little bit at 57 minutes into the movie Eliot Ness and his crew hit went to Capone's operations on the Canadian border and one of the individuals that gave them trouble for a minute to me look like Robert De Niro as Al Capone!? But after carefully seeing him, it turns out to be a character actor Robert Miranda who actually looks exactly like Robert De Niro as Al Capone that was kind of unnerving and kind of weird like to me. And also what threw me for a loop that the district attorney played by the late great Clifton James was uncredited and almost unrecognizable with all the real weight that this actor had gained I couldn't believe it was him when I read the credits later on IMDb.all in all it's a great movie nonetheless for the fine acting involved especially Robert De Niro he isn't in the movie that much but his very few scenes that he is in he steals them right away what is performance alone is worth seeing",

            "content": "Am I the only person who found this movie a little mediocre?  Okay, let me start with this:This movie isn't bad.  But it isn't genius.  It is not one of the best movies of all time.Problem Number 1: characterization.  This is pretty standard if you ask me. These are basic characters that become more boring as the movie moves on. Many characters, like Andy Garcia, just seem to be there.  We never really learn about him.  I'll address a bigger character problem later.\nProblem Number 2: the whole movie is a bit screwed up in awkward ways. Example: There is a scene where Malone and Ness are busting a bootleg outfit.  This should be a tense moment.  A bunch of cops are about to break in on a bunch of criminals.  But, the music!  The music that is playing is this triumphic, victory music, EVEN BEFORE THEY EVER ENTER THE WHEREHOUSE! I thought that it would have made much more sense to have a tenser moment with tenser music.Problem Number 3: Robert De Niro.  He's supposed to be the villain, the antagonist.  But how long is he actually in this movie?  It couldn't be any longer than 5 minutes.  He is wasted in this movie.Finally, Problem Number 4: Is it just me or is Sean Connery over praised in this movie?  I know, I know; everyone praises him for his work in this movie.  I know he won the Oscar that year for this.  But does anyone really care about Oscars?  Does Saving Private Ryan ring any bells?  I am not calling his performance bad; I love Sean Connery.  He's the one, true BOND! The man is one of my favorite actors!  But people over praise him for this movie.  His performance, while intense, lacks depth.  Not to mention his accent is a mix between Irish (his character's accent) and Scottish (his real accent).  And yes, there is a diffence.Honestly, I didn't hate this movie.  I did like it a little bit.  I really, really can't see why this movie is considered as great as it is.  There is some good, (great) stuff here.  The elevator scene and the train station scene leap to mind.  The Untouchables isn't really trying to say anything but, `Eh, here's a mob movie.  Enjoy'.  The Godfather said, `How do ya like that! POW POW POW! GENIUS!' and Goodfellas said, `You will love this movie, or we will kill you'.I will say Costner gives a great performance.  DeNiro, for what little time he has, is great too (but DeNiro is always great, so no surprise there).In conclusion, the whole movie is good.  It's worth a rent or an HBO viewing.  I'm just p****d that I bought the movie before I saw it. Everyone said it was great!  I now have a new rule: never buy a movie without seeing it beforehand no matter how praised it is.  I don't regret buying it because it is enjoyable (and that opening sequence is cool), but had I seen it before I bought it, I would have gotten something else.  My basic attitude toward the movie is that it's one of those movie that comes out, you see it, you say, `Eh, I liked it', then you forget about it.  I just don't see the attraction.Tin one sentence: the whole movie is about as deep as piece of paper, and just as heavy.Overall Originality: 4/10 Plot: 6/10 Memorable Scenes: 9/10 Acting: 6/10 Characters: 4/10 Interest: 4/10Overall: 6/10 (not an average)",

            "content": "Historical inaccuracies aside, Mamet and DePalma's conception of Capone vs. Ness and the Prohibition Era is mechanical and silly. Mamet's script is full of tired gimmickry (Malone's St. Jude necklace being passed on, Ness coming to terms with the violence and lawlessness within him, using children in danger as a means of upping the emotional ante), and his clipped, hit-the-beats style of writing does not mesh well with DePalma's outlandish, tongue-in-cheek sensuality. (Stone's script for Scarface matches perfectly with that style.) The result is a film with wildly uneven tones: it's both darkly (perhaps unintentionally)comic and moralistic in a square way. Mamet portrays Ness as a naive bore (Costner certainly plays him that way), and allows Connery's Malone (a good performance) to take over the film. DeNiro's scenes as Capone seem disconnected from the rest of the film, and provide no more than a surface portrayal of the infamous gangster. On the plus side, the sets, costumes, cinematography, and supporting actors are all excellent, and DePalma manages to give a charge to a few of the set pieces. The Ennio Morricone score is another highlight and among the best of the maestro's distinguished career. Overall, it's a simplified, dime-store novel approach that isn't even as fun as the TV series that preceded it. The real story deserves better.",

            "content": "Truth be told, I was very disappointed by The Untouchables when I first saw it. As part of a crime movie marathon I was going through (which included Casino, The Godfather, and Goodfellas) this was definitely the worst of the night. Confused by its' high ratings, I searched around on the internet trying to find out what was so good about it. I mean, certain films don't suit certain people, but I was sure I knew a good crime flick when I saw one. Then I discovered my mistake. What I expected was a fact-based account of the dealings and on-goings of Al Capone, and the men who ended up stopping him. I wanted to be submerged in the 1920's life of suits, hats and tommy guns. What I instead watched was a movie that overglorified one 'untouchable' and focused only on his life and on-goings. There was corniness all over and cheesy characters. I only really liked two parts: the opening credits, and the baseball bat scene. There were only a few clips of Al Capone, and in those rare moments it seemed as though I was watching a different movie.Turns out, it doesn't help finding out a bit about a movie before you watch it. What 'The Untouchables' actually is, is a fictional and classy noir-style film. Plus, it is titled 'The Untouchables' and not 'Al Capone', and there were high review of the movie all around. Because of this, I decided to give it another chance.My second viewing was far more enjoyable than the first. Now appreciating it for what it was, most of the cheese had turned into style. Ennio Morricone's score really captures the noir-style feel of the film. The performances are great, especially Robert De Niro as Capone. When I first discovered that he played the part, I was in chuckles. Not because I didn't think he could do it, but because I thought that the role choice was strange. But my, how much range thins man has got! De Niro really makes the cahacter his own, giving Capone a fierceness that is nesseccary so that he becomes a solid character in the few scenes that he is in. The plot is pretty much told side by side from Eliot Ness' story with Al Capone's, until they both clash in court.I appriciated a lot of scenes more the second time, too. The pram scene, court scene, and the death of Jim Malone all stood out, among every part with Robert De Niro. Its not a perfect film, however, especially when it comes to classic 80's cheese. For example, the ambush on the bridge was accompanied by, in my opinion, inappropriate music. 'Strength of the righteous' took out any tension that was built up prior to the attack. I'm not a big fan of the ending, either \u2013 Had I put all my family in danger and lost two close friends in order to take down a crime boss I certainly wouldn't be saying \"I think I'll have a drink\".However, there were far less complaints from me after my second viewing, and this has become one of my personal favorites when it comes to crime movies.Final Word: StylishMy rating: 7/10Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/movie-review- the-untouchables/",

All of the performances by all of the actors is amazing, this is by far Robert De Niro and Andy Garcias best film that i have ever seen. The look of the film, and also the awesome direction by Brian De Palma (who utilizes the zoom button on the camera to perfection, which was very common in older movies)makes this a standout as a film, and as an American Classic. The only thing really bad about this movie is the trailer for it. Not only do they give everything away, but the trailer makes it look sooooo boring. If i watched the trailer before seeing the film, i probably would not have even seen the film, which would have been one of the biggest mistakes in my life. This is only my sixth review and I'm not very good at it, i guess i am mad at IMDb for not posting my review in which i diss the Dark knight, oh well, and happy viewing.",

The score is fantastic, as well is the writing.The acting is top notch. This film tells the tale of Al Capone , the vicious and sadistic gang lord of Chicago in the 1920's (played EXCELLENTLY by Robert De Niro). Capone runs everything and everyone in the city. No one will stand up to him. But one man has the courage. That man is Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner in the role he was born to play). Elliot Ness is portrayed as a man who believes in good and truth, and a man who wants to clean up a dirty town. While he is good of heart, he is naive about how to do it. He meets a man named Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery in the role that finally won him a much deserved Oscar). Malone , much like Ness, has a good heart but unlike Ness, he knows how to fight Capone. He schools Ness in the way to get Capone: shoot fast and shoot first! After Ness assembles a gang of men with morals like his called \"The Untouchables\" , the wage their righteous war on Capone and his henchman. Everything about this film is excellent. But the man who owned this film was Kevin Costner. He has had plenty of experience playing heroic good guys, but this is his performance. No one else seems right for this role. He plays Ness as an everyday man who decides to do some good in a bad town. Hats off to Andy Garcia, who plays one Of Ness' best friends George Stone, a straight arrow, loyal memeber of Ness' gang.

The set pieces were great throughout and the story flowed well from start to finish. The score was a little cheesy here and there and the cliches were plenty. De Palma is no Coppola but he does his best with what he's got. I appreciate the authenticity in this film and I'm glad to of seen this for a second time. I'm real pleased to know Connery won his only Oscar here and it was well deserved. Again, the costars really shine in this crime piece. The only one lacking was Costner.

Set in the 1930s when alcohol was illegal in the US, Al Capone is the Crime Lord trading the stuff for masses of money, and Eliot Ness, the federal Agent who is determined to bring him down. I wasn't particularly blown away by any of the acting, I guess Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness is worth a mention, but although each character played their part well none of them stood out or really made the character their own. What does deserve a mention however is the style in which the Untouchables was filmed - lots of weird camera angles and shots, lots of dramatic music, all building up suspense, tension, fear, excitement, sadness, etc. The viewer gets sucked into this film, as long as they have the patience to sit through the first 30 or so minutes until it gets really interesting.A good film, very well made, but not one I'd be quick to recommend to friends or want to watch again in a hurry.

Andy Garcia, an actor which hasn't played in a good movie for a while is perfect for his \"tough new cop\" role. But two of the best actors in the movie, right behind Connery, are actors I had never heard of: Billy Drago, which is absolutely perfect as Frank Nitti, giving him a cold, and Charles Martin Smith is well cast as Oscar Wallace. Ennio Morricone's score is incredible... And David Mamet's script is very good. But what steals the show is certainly Brian De Palma's directing and Stephen H. Burum's cinematography.

One particular incident concerns DeNiro's baseball batting of a board member, which is pretty gruesome.Set in the 30's, it strangely never feels old-fashioned, probably due to the fact that Brian DePalma is at the helm, managing to bring a truly unique style to the proceedings. He also brings the best out of the cast, most notably Andy Garcia, in one of his better roles, and Sean Connery, who finally gets a long overdue Oscar for his portrayal of the doomed Irish Cop.The Untouchables is one of DePalma's greatest achievements, managing to deliver a movie that is perfectly executed on all levels, and never has a dull scene. I rarely enjoy these types of old-style gangster movies, but this is one of the few that truly deserves the title 'classic'.9/10.",

There were several things about this movie that just made it intolerable. The acting was very flat, it was hard to believe how cringe-worthy and clich\u00e9 the dialogue was from start to finish. In addition, a lot of scenes in the movie just didn't make any sense. For example, the fact that Ness would just change his opinion about the geeky accountant in an instant and hand him a gun to go on their first \"bust\" was completely unbelievable. In addition, Malone had an entire tommy-gun clip emptied on him, yet he stays alive for long enough to crawl into his house and then still be alive for what seems like a good while later to tell Ness about the Capone's accountant. The music was unbearable, I felt like I was watching a 20's silent film with color and dialogue at points when the action music played.

They can't, or rather this can't half as well as it could have.It's all smothered in the look though. Perfected haircuts, brandished liquor, breathed mists of cigar lit mercy, so in the respect of playing the era, it is the best character to be found \u2013 though Connery also gives it enough reason to watch (unsurprisingly). Costner, also playing a mostly straight laced, no nonsense police officer along with two other 'characters' who form the untouchables.Admirable though it is to detract from the mob lifestyle, to show segments of it that seem to have no use except characterisation is cruel. Especially when the tension and style is carried with it, in sweet but short blips. Costner also can't seem to entirely stray from his Western prime either, that segment feels nothing more than a word in from himself or a hastily added diversion from the office scenery. Biased though this is coming from a gangster fan, fellow police drama Zodiac worked brilliantly and that was as ambiguous as you could hope for.In short, if the last twenty minutes had been as good as what preceded it then this would have been a more than welcome change in perspective.

I don't often find he fits into the roles he plays in his movies but here he is powerful and yet human and you can really feel his pain and frustration throughout. I love Sean Connery in general and here he is in classic form playing a strong, growling Irish cop with a big chip on his shoulder and a lot of heart hidden beneath his gruff exterior. I think everyone agrees De Niro as Capone was incredible casting, no need to say more on that. The score was a perfect fit as well, lending a sense of urgency and foreboding without stealing the whole scene. Also the directing is so well done that I can watch this film again and again and each time it reaches one of the suspenseful scenes I still find myself holding my breath and tensing up despite knowing exactly how it will all end! Now that's powerful storytelling!",

            "content": "I had never seen this movie before last night when I had the chance to watch it and I must say I was pretty damn impressed. The movie takes place in the 1920's when the mob warlord Al Capone ruled Prohibition-era Chicago. Federal agent Elliot Ness, quoting one of the plot outlines, assembles a personal team of mob fighters to bring Chicago crime boss Al Capone to justice using unconventional means. This team becomes known as \"The Untouchables\". This is by far the best movie I've seen from Brian De Palma. I knew it was going to be good, but I was surprised that it was even better.The screenplay, the whole story, is just brilliant. It has this absolute flow, which I think was more normal back then, as it seems to me that less newer movies have that specific flow nowadays. The progress and the twists in the plot are just excellent and they keep you concentrated throughout the whole movie. The way the movie progresses itself is just pure glory for your eyes and it also compliments the directing. The directing is just so fitting with the screenplay that it's even better than it actually is, though it is honestly very good. De Palma has captured the soul and the whole feeling of the 1920's, making \"The Untouchables\" a real masterpiece of a movie and I can't believe I've missed it before. The music is superb, despite the fact that it has that cheesy 80's feeling in it at times. No wonder the music's so superb, as the composer is the master Ennio Morricone himself. He does compositions that are so recognizable that you just know it's Morricone behind the music.What comes to role performances, well there's one above everyone else and that is no-one else than Sean Connery himself, at his best. I just can't believe the work he has done, as it seems to me that every role he plays he does it perfectly. I can't do nothing else than admire him, there's just something so charismatic about him that it always makes me stare in amazement. In \"The Untouchables\" he plays a veteran patrolman who teaches Ness how to beat Capone and he just does it so believably that.. Well, read what said above. The role performance he does is just excellent and it is no wonder that he even won an Oscar from it. Robert De Niro is very fitting in the role of Al Capone; I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing it. I have to admit that I don't know much about Capone's real behavior, but to me Capone is everything De Niro does in this movie. The movie actually shines with the whole cast as well, including for example Kevin Costner as the tough Elliot Ness and Andy Garcia as one of the untouchables, master shooter George Stone. Everyone performs their roles so well that the whole movie is a real pleasure for eyes throughout.\"The Untouchables\" is a must-see-masterpiece. I think it's highly underrated, as I was so surprised how good it actually was even when I have really never liked mob-movies so much. It has superb role performances, excellent directing, a brilliant story and it is all in all, a great movie. A recommendation for everyone who haven't seen it! Everything just works so well together, giving it that flow and making it click in every aspect. The movie has this excitement and tension, this real feeling of pure man power, in a way that can not be described. A great movie indeed.",

            "content": "WARNING- POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN!!!Brian De Palma's take on THE UNTOUCHABLES presents me with a conflict... I like it as good film making, but on another level I'm made very uneasy by it.As a movie, it's a whole lot of fun; what we have here is a cowboys & indians sort of film, set in 1920s Chicago with Feds and gangsters. Lots of shoot-'em-up action, hard bitten, laconic dialogue, and even some dark humor. There's something for everyone here.I was especially surprised, as well as amused, by De Palma's shootout sequence in the railroad station. It's an unabashed homage to Serge Eisensten's \"staircase\" sequence in THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. De Palma manages to lend it a sort of dark humor to go along with the flying bullets and gouts of blood. It's hard to tell if he was paying tribute to POTEMKIN or if he was creating a parody of it, but it IS quite an effective sequence.Special mention and praise is richly deserved by Sean Connery for his part as Jim Malone, the wise, world weary Chicago beat cop who takes Costner's neophyte Elliot Ness under his wing and teaches him the ways of Chicago style law enforcement. Connery's not only a great actor, but an enthusiastic scenery chewer of long standing; he has a GREAT time with the script & steals practically every scene he's in. I can imagine his scarcely concealed glee at delivering his most hard bitten lines... \"OK Pal, why the Mohaska?\" when he first meets Ness and discovers he's carrying a gun. He delivers THE memorable line of the film with his sage advice on dealing with Al Capone...\"If he pulls a knife, YOU pull a gun. If HE sends one of yours to the hospital, YOU send one of HIS to the MORGUE. THAT'S the Chicago Way!!!\".Connery must have had a ball with the part, and it's clear that he enjoyed every minute of his over-the-top performance. Also worthy of praise was another over-the-top performance, De Niro's somewhat wild and savage portrayal of Alphonse \"Snorky\" Capone. Here's another scene stealer of the first order. Rod Stieger's take on Capone is certainly much more real, but De Niro's is a whole lot more FUN... it's closer to the legend than the truth.Chicagoans (and us ex-Chicagoans) are a sort of a strange breed; over the decades Al Capone has become a larger than life legend for us, and we're prone to hold an odd sort of pride and affection for the gangster past of our city... many see Capone as a sort of Robin Hood figure in our past, as was shown in the Rat Pack film, ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS. Snorky is, without a doubt, the most famous Chicagoan that there is, with Richard J. Daley, the ultimate political boss, running a distant second. Even today if anyone has the temerity to speak badly of Al Capone in the presence of a Chicagoan, he'll most likely get an earful of the perceived virtues of the man to counterbalance the criticisms. De Niro's performance does the Capone legend justice, and does honor to the Big Guy.Watching veteran actors De Niro and Connery absolutely steamroller the rest of the cast is a joy to behold. It would have been interesting to see the two of them TOGETHER in more sequences, to watch them try to upstage each other... the rest of the cast didn't have a prayer in that contest with either one of them!Costner's deliberately understated and almost effeminate portrayal of Elliot Ness is, ironically, probably closer to reality than any of the many other screen portrayals he's had. Mentioning Elliot Ness to my father or grandfather usually elicited a sneering obscenity or two, occasionally comments speculating about Ness's sexual preferences, and the standard comment that Ness wasn't a REAL cop; he was merely a paper shuffling tax man. This seems to be a widely held opinion of Ness among the generation of Chicagoans who lived through those times. Suffice it to say that the memory of Elliot Ness isn't held in high regard with many of them.That's what's good here. There's another side to this coin tho.Americans have, unfortunately, become a people who are more and more ignorant of their own history. What little we know about it comes from movies and pop cultural sources that are, due to artistic license, JUST PLAIN WRONG!!! THE UNTOUCHABLES is guilty of that.For all of it's entertainment value the film is, historically speaking, a pack of utter BS. That's sort of dangerous; these days movies are cited more and more as historical reference, and the artistic license becomes fact.Given that premise, movies CAN and DO rewrite history in the popular culture. We've seen it happen before in Hollywood's version of the settling of the West.It's called \"Propaganda\". And it's dangerous to the health of the Republic to expose an uncritical public to it in large doses. The most glaring example in THE UNTOUCHABLES... the death of Frank \"The Enforcer\" Nitti, as depicted in the film.NO WAY is it anywhere near accurate; the reality is that after Capone's conviction, Nitti was also facing a prosecution that he had no prayer of beating. Before he could be brought to trial, Frank Nitti took his own life.If taken in context, STRICTLY for it's entertainment value, I can heartily endorse THE UNTOUCHABLES. The trick here is to NOT believe everything that you see. Legends can be fun... but consider that Legends are NOT TRUTH.",

            "content": "I once heard a story about Stanley Kubrick's reaction to Stephen Spielberg's Holocaust film Schindler's List, where he expressed his disappointment in the film and when asked why, he said that he found that the film missed the point of the Holocaust. That the Holocaust wasn't about success, it was about failure. Now I have no idea if this story is in any way true, and Spielberg has even disputed this narrative, but it's one that I come back to when it comes to films that I find profoundly miss a point.I wasn't expecting a factual analysis of Prohibition, hardly so. The original show that it was based on was based on the tall tales of a huckster who, despite popular belief, didn't take down Al Capone. In fact, he was viewed as little more than a nuisance by old Scarface and would later botch his whole career in not catching the Cleveland Torso Murderer. I did expect to see a solid crime film, with a collective talent of gifted people. Yet this wasn't a film that was darkly intense or morally ambiguous, it was romantic and moralistic, relying too much on simplistic morality and psychology, emotional appeals, and over the top histrionics to get its point across, rather than anything that might be compelling or interesting.De Palma is a director who I really want to like, yet I always seem to catch him at his most self indulgent. Scarface, while hailed as a crime classic, is a rather ridiculous film, with a half baked message at its core about the American Dream that gets lost with a memorable, if not utterly silly performance from Al Pacino and a manic, intensely wild ride from beginning to end. But luckily this film isn't quite as manic, though it does have its silly moments, no doubt about it.The film feels gelded, like it's not reaching its full potential. It's too...Hollywood, and safe for me to sit back and truly enjoy. It feels like such colossal talents like Mamet, Morricone, and others are holding back and not pushing boundaries as they have been proven to be able to do in the past. While the script is ripe with Mamet's trademark dialogue, I found the actual story to be simplistic and overtly idealistic, psychologically undemanding and unstimulating. I was constantly frustrated by the romanticism that was in this film, the constant naive heroism that reeks throughout this film and the complete lack of awareness for the lessons that should have been learned from the Prohibition. Yet it's a generic cops n' robbers flick, though without the flair of such greats as Heat or The Dark Knight.However, this film wasn't 'bad' by any means. The acting is consistently strong. De Niro's Capone is easily the best part of this movie. For playing someone as notorious and larger than life like Capone, De Niro brings his A game as a charming, yet utterly vicious and psychotic. Under a lesser actor, he would've been relegated to a mustache twirling villain, but De Niro plays him just right to the point to where it's believable. I'm honestly baffled that it was Connery who won the Oscar and not De Niro, though don't get me wrong, Connery is still quite good in this movie. It is a bit funny to see him barely hiding his Scottish accent in the role as Jimmy Malone, but he brings his usual natural talent to scenes that could have been flat, Costner is also solid in the film, bringing his usual everyman personality to the film that works fine within the film's constraints.Overall, it's a rather fun, if not another cheesy film from De Palma and crew. It doesn't have the ham fisted attempts at being profound that Scarface had, though it does rival Scarface in the over the top theatrics department. I don't think it's a very compelling crime film, and is rather naive and overtly sententious in its messages, in a way that I feel to be harmful to anyone who might watch it. In the end, it's escapism at its most distasteful.With this film, I find another case like Spartacus, where a large group of talented people team up together, yet it doesn't seem to come together in any meaningful way.",

Kevin Coster, Charles Martin Smith, Sean Connery, and Andy Garcia make up \"The Untouchables\", a group of good cops who could not be swayed by bribes or threats. The Untouchables' main goal was to take down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro) who was trafficking booze into Chicago, which was illegal at the time of prohabition. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is just assigned as the head of investigation in the Chicago police force, sent by The State Department. The whole movie is a rivalry between Capone and Ness as they both try to outwit and outgun each other, threw a series of action-packed and exciting adventures. Malone (Sean Connery) is an old Irish cop who wants to help Ness, and he does, by telling him exactly how to get to Capone and beat him, with his insider information. Charles Martiin Smith is the brains of the group, who can bring down Capone by using IRS laws against him. Andy Garcia is the marksman of the group, and he is recruited last, while they are looking for the best shooter in the Chicago P.D. trainee department. The Untouchables are kind of like the internal affairs group, they can't trust any of their fellow cops, and they go at it alone.

From my readings of articles and viewings of newsreel footage of the real Al Capone, De Niro's Capone suggests what the crime boss may have been like. I think it's the best interpretation to date. Sean Connery is his usual terrific self and is given some first rate dialogue. The 4 Untouchables each has a strength which combines well to make an excellent team equipped to bring down Capone. According to available literature on Ness and company, the script strays from certain realities, but, so what? The movie more than makes up for that in other ways. My only gripe is the less than good moments from extras with their unconvincing remarks during certain action scenes (in minor ways, extras reactions can add or subtract from moments in a film). Billy Drago's Frank Nitti looks and sounds like a character from a drama set in the South. It's an otherwise colorful interpretation though to be enjoyed within the context of the movie's entertainment value. Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Brad Sullivan, etc. are all excellent in their respective roles; great score by Morricone. I highly recommend this as a top example of Hollywood entertainment.",

            "content": "The Untouchables has two major things going for it: its well-realised 1930s Chicago setting and its cast, particularly Robert De Niro who gives a decent and convincingly threatening portrayal of the notorious gang leader, Al Capone. Its lead, Kevin Costner, however, who plays the main 'untouchable' police officer Eliot Ness, doesn't do as good a job as his fellow performers and feels a bit stilted. Some of his scenes I would even consider laughable. The way he delivers the lines \"God, didn't ya hear what l said? What are you, deaf? What is this, a game?!\" was a memorable standout that gives off the impression of being a first take, a warmup for an \"actual\" performance. His romance with his wife, Catherine (Patricia Clarkson), also felt terribly cliched, like you've seen it in so many films before and his character as a whole just has very little going on - he's your typical morally driven good cop that's seen (or rather, is about to see) some sh!t.And unfortunately, despite the other members of the cast's performances, the deaths of two 'Untouchables', Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), lacked any real punch for me as the film didn't give them enough time to grow fully as characters or for the audience to sympathise with them and get to know them better. Yeah, Oscar's death is brutal for sure (getting shot in the head and then hung inside the elevator), but it just didn't yield that much of a reaction from me. Plus the copious amounts of blood that poured out of Connery's body made highly unrealistic the idea that he was still alive, let alone conscious. And he somehow manages to stay alive long enough to impart information and wisdom to Ness and Stone (Andy Garc\u00eda)! The film isn't exactly historically accurate, not by any stretch of the imagination, but Malone's prolonged survival throws any semblance of reality out the window.And hell, the death of a little girl in a bombing in the opening scene was far more impactful to me than two of the main characters' deaths (perhaps merely due to its abruptness)! Speaking of which, The Untouchables has this opening that raises the stakes higher than the film can actually manage as nothing else that happens throughout the rest of the story ever reaches that extreme. Well, other than maybe Ness throwing one of Capone's gangsters off the roof of the court building for insulting Malone (something which he apparently gets away with without consequences - but hey, its 1930s Chicago, I'll let it slide).There are a few moments which I thought were excellent though, the most famous of which being the train station stairway scene, an elaborate, unfolding, escalating series of events that in real-time probably only lasted 30 seconds or so, but gets drawn out to great effect as the baby in a pram tumbles down the stairs amidst a violent shootout as the child's mother watches on in horror. In a lesser film, it would be cheesy at best, but The Untouchables manages to sell it well.Other than that, the most I can say about the film is that its far from the best crime film I've ever seen - many of its elements seem borrowed and cobbled together from similar films and fiction - but its something a bit more than competent.Overall: 6 or 7/10 - Somewhere around there; maybe more, maybe less.",

Or even worse: He played James Bond, disguised as a Chicago cop. Once again the script is to blame: It doesn't give us the slightest hint, why an ordinary cop, who is doing street patrols, should suddenly become the leader of a \"gang\", which challenges the all-mighty villain Al Capone and his unscrupulous hitmen.

            "content": "This movie is awesome. I have no idea why it is not in the top 10 but it really should be. This is most certainly Brian DePalma's best work ever. The story revolves around a Treasury Officer Elliot Ness. Ness is maddened at the fact that Al Capone rules the streets with an iron fist. After a failed bust resulting in his rep losing much credibility, he assembles a crack squad consisting of James(?) Malone(Sean Connery's greatest performance), a bookish Oscar, and sharp shooter George Stone(Geuseppi Petri). Together they peel thru the layers of Capone's Organization,(SPOILERS AHEAD!!) finally jailing him on an income tax violation crime.That being said, this movie has some truly great scenes. For example, Even though a lot of people complain about the ludicrously prolonged death of Malone, the opera music in the background adds to its importance and significance. And the UNFORGETTABLE baseball bat slaying. The dark music in the aftermath clearly speaks without words that Capone is evil. But Even the most eloquent words cannot do this movie justice in its awesomeness, brilliance, and greatness. NEVER STOP FIGHTING 'TILL THE FIGHT IS DONE",

Drago's lines in this movie are finely crafted, and the only people who can say that he does a bad job are people who have tried to act like Drago and can't. These gealous idiots have no idea what a real actor is, and Drago comes through a true hero in this movie. Drago's costume is also very appropriate in this film. He is dressed as the fallen white angel, described by the Sardis and Philadelphia Dispensations in the latter part of the Hebrew Testament. Anyone else who tried to play this character would have failed. Drago delivers once again. 10 out of 10 for Drago. 7 out of 10 for the movie. Bravo.",

            "review_title": "The Untouchables",
            "content": "The music under the opening titles of The Untouchables, from Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score, sets the tone of what is to come; the quick-tempo beat suggests hard-hitting action, and the stealthy horns promise something sinister. The movement over and around the title itself indicates other qualities of the approaching feature: shadowy, stylish, and artful. These movements, however, do not foretell the entire story. Triumphant fanfare will later signal legendary deeds, and somber winds will mourn fallen heroes. We open with a view from the ceiling (a favorite perspective of director Brian De Palma) of an opulent parlor where Alphonse Capone (Robert De Niro) takes a shave. De Niro looks larger than usual, having ostensibly gained the weight appropriate for the role, and his portrayal of Capone is appropriately larger than life. Screenwriter David Mamet's signature brand of stylized, naturalistic dialogue becomes immediately recognizable as Al fields questions from pandering members of the press, who hang onto every one of his words and laugh at every one of his jokes. Despite Capone's claim to the contrary, violence comes quick, as the next scene follows a little girl into a shop where a salesman unsuccessfully attempts to peddle beer to the owner. The owner and the little girl both pay for the owner's refusal to buy with their lives. In a later scene, the mother of that little girl thanks Eliot Ness (played by Kevin Costner, in one of his first and finest feature performances) for taking on the dangerous task of bringing the murderous gangster to justice. To do that, Ness needs to recruit some help, and he starts, quite accidentally, with a beat cop named Jim Malone. This is Sean Connery at his best. His portrayal of Malone rightfully earned him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and this performance is worth more than all of his earlier turns as James Bond put together. Sporting an Irish brogue, Malone bestows wit and wisdom onto his fellow Untouchables, which come to include sharpshooting Italian-American George Stone/Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) and FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). This terrific team of four covers a nice range of maturity and street smarts. Stone, aside from protecting the property and citizenry of the city of Chicago, also shields the film from ethnicism, and his recruiting scene is one of the funniest in the movie. Wallace also provides some comic relief, as he moves from pencil-pushing bean counter to heat-packing avenger. More importantly, he provides Ness with the idea of bringing Capone in on income tax evasion. Ness finds strange irony in the idea of trying a murderer for not paying his taxes, but is trying him for running liquor any less insidious, especially when it is apparent that Ness is merely following the letter of Prohibition law by enforcing the Falstead Act? Malone fuels the whole operation by blackmailing information on Capone's movements out of an old acquaintance from the police force, George (Brad Sullivan), who is obviously playing both sides for profit. Why this fact escapes Malone is not clear. In a movie so packed with violent, bloody conflict, it is notable that the father-son relationship that develops between Malone and Ness provides the film its heartbeat. When Malone falls, Ness's pursuit acquires an aspect of revenge, and although the real Eliot Ness never took down Capone's top enforcer (Nitti actually committed suicide), fictional Eliot Ness's discovery and chase of Malone's killer, played to slimy perfection by Billy Drago, constitutes one of the greatest scenes in a movie characterized by one great scene after another. When he finally catches up with Nitti, Ness has an opportunity to take him out, but decides instead to do the legal thing and arrest him. \"I'm gonna come see you burn, you son of a bitch,\" he tells Nitti as he cuffs him, \"because you killed my friend.\" Nitti decides not to let well enough alone: \"Your friend died screaming like a stuck Irish pig. Now you think about that when I beat the rap.\" Morricone's violins screech as we see in Ness's face the snapping of the strings that had been keeping his mental instrument together, and he sends Nitti over the edge of the rooftop, screaming all the way down, Ness taunting him from above, \"Did he sound anything like that?\" Mamet and De Palma don't stop there. Back inside the courtroom, Stone asks Ness where Nitti is. Ness responds, \"He's in the car.\" We creep up behind the car through which Nitti's body met with its bloody demise, as Morricone's violently insistent strings continue. A tad much, perhaps, but isn't the essence of overindulgence to linger too long on something that's too good to let alone?",

            "content": "Brian De Palma is known as a director who likes to let the blood flow, but he does more than that in this film. This film outdoes his earlier Scarface in nearly every way - namely, the actors have more of an opportunity to act, the score is better, the action is less drawn-out, etc. One notable difference in his style is his reliance on the perspective of the Untouchables, and not of Capone's men. In giving more screen time to the good guys, he allows some beautiful shots to enter the foray; but don't think that he has completely abandoned violence. It is here as well, and plays a vital role in the film, but is pushed to the background most of the time.Kevin Costner (in one of his early roles) stars as Eliot Ness, the leader of the so-called Untouchables, a branch of the government responsible for nabbing the bootleggers in 1930s Chicago (and elsewhere, though the Windy City is the sole focus here.) He is very convincing as Ness, and De Palma does a great job at showing his early rejection, his first triumphs, and his ultimate success. De Palma also makes Ness' work seem more personal, because he has a wife and children for whom to care.Sir Sean Connery gives one of his best performances in recent times as Jimmy Malone, who somewhat reluctantly joins Ness in his crusade against the bootleggers. As a hard-nosed cop with decades of experience, he is essential to the Untouchables and their mission. His performance understandably earned him an Oscar.The other actors are also well-cast, especially Robert De Niro, who is famous for his mobster roles. His part as Al Capone does not get much screen time, but the time that he is in the picture is perfectly captured.Special mention must be made of the score by Ennio Morricone, surely the greatest and most prolific composer of film music. As in most of the films that he scores, the music becomes an essential part of the work; not only do certain scenes become firmly implanted in your mind, but also his music for each scene. He received an Oscar nomination for this film, but did not win (he has never won, despite six nominations.)I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is unique in its perspective, the images are not excessively violent, and the score is outstanding. Consider this De Palma's good-guy gangster film, and a must-see.",

Robert DeNiro gives perhaps one of the most incredible performances to never get nominated for an Oscar. It is without a doubt the best portrayal of Al Capone ever put on film or television. Sean Connery is also great as Malone, a tough Chicago Irish cop, the kind of man that makes the fair city-my place of residence-one of the toughest cities in the world. It is an action film that doesn't buy into action-film cliches, it doesn't try to be great, it just tries to entertain. Ironically, the quality of this movie arises from the fact that it isn't trying to be great.

            "content": "1930Prohibition has turned Chicago into a city at war.  Rival gangs compete for control of the city's billion dollar empire of illegal alcohol, enforcing their will with the hand grenade and tommy gun.  It is the time of the gangsters...it is the time of Al Capone.    With this title card, Brian DePalma's grand opus to the era of Prohibition begins.  The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness, the man responsible for bringing Al Capone to his knees and finally to justice. Kevin Costner, in one of his many \"dry as a bone emotionally\" roles plays Ness as a passive-aggressive monster.  At times, when he is without a tommy gun in his hand, Costner's Ness becomes as soft as a newborn puppy dog. When he is with the police force he is almost maniacal in his attempt to eradicate Al Capone from the streets of the world in total.  For this reason, I give DePalma kudos for casting Costner in this role.  He is just like a whute blob upon the screen in every scene he appears in, forcing those actors and actresses around him to pick up the cues and carry on without him, almost as if he isn't there to begin with.    Backing up Costner, De Palma cast some of the most veritable actors in the cinema canon to be his cohorts: Robert DeNiro, Andy Garcia and Sean Connery.  It was with his role as Malone, the trenchant Irish cop that Connery finally snagged his first Academy Award.  Some of his scenes within this film to me are reasons why he won the award to begin with!    As a film in general, the Untouchables reaches for the gold, blazing out of the gate only to stumble upon reaching the finish line.  Even a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist David Mamet couldn't begin to save this film which on its own merit has some very good sections.  It is almost as if the film staggers about from one bloodshed to another, only gathering steam towards the ending.    The Untouchables is of course, based on the classic television series starring Robert Stack.  The film was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Supporting Actor, Best Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Score), winning only for Best Supporting Actor.My rating: 2 and a half stars",

Only the word reminds me of a great number of scenes, for example the scene in the train station with the baby carriage, the scene when Eliot Ness went to kill Al Capone and so many others. Furthermore the script was really tremendous, written by David Mamet. As far as the performances are concerned, what can I say, they were marvelous. Robert De Niro and especially Sean Connery did their best to offer us unforgettable performances. The second one deservedly won the academy award of best supporting actor. Finally, if I had one complaint this would be the fact that the movie had not a single nomination in the categories of best picture, best directing, best original screenplay and why not a nomination for De Niro's performance in the category of best supporting actor.

That the cast delivered this dialogue with stony straight faces is truly a credit to them, as lesser actors might have been tempted to overact, lessening the impact.The plot is outstanding - it doesn't unfold - it explodes in your face, covering you in the director's trademarked warm corn syrup. A particular highlight is a certain death sequence which moves the plot along with skill and finesse rarely seen on the big screen.De Palma's direction is brilliant in its strict defiance of originality. Every scene he shoots is refreshingly over-the-top obvious and no stereotype or convention is left unused.The real stroke of genius comes towards the end of the film where De Palma - for absolutely no reason relating to plot or character development - uses the 'Odessa Steps' sequence from Battleship Potemkin, for a full 9 minutes. Complete with sailors getting shot. All the while managing to avoid even the slightest hint of tension.Finally, Morricone's soundtrack fits the film perfectly. It's incredibly cheesy, at times wholly inappropriate, and all the while rooted firmly in the 80s.It's a film that has to be seen to be believed.",

            "content": "There's an 80s cult out there -- people who think the decade was great because 1.) that's when they were in their teens or 20s; or 2.) they like 80s music. But the sad truth is, the decade was (with a scant handful of exceptions) one of the lowest periods in the history of film-making. One of the few exceptions is The Untouchables. DePalma has always been an uneven filmmaker who at one time seems to have thought of himself some kind of latter-day Hitchcock; and he made a few great pictures. But in 1987, all of that preteniousness combined with his remarkable technical skills to create a fun, watchable, if often brutal, quasi-historical drama. You can snicker at the sentimentality, the humane-good-guy vs. inhumane-bad-guy dichotomy, but this is the last Hollywood picture I know of where that old formula really works. By the 1990s, sadism and brutality were more to the point; by today's standards, the famous \"bat scene\" has a lot of fans. I'm no moralist (I'm a huge Polanski fan) but I like to see a movie where morality actually makes the story WORK. As for Costner -- otherwise one of the least inspiring, most annoying actors in the business -- this is the role he was made for: bland, full of pure American \"virtue,\" and therefore totally vulnerable. I can't think of anyone else who could have played Eliot Ness.",

Awarding just one to Sean Connery is a flagrant understatement of this great achievement of all those who made it.The sound score is brilliant and inspiring. Cinematography is at its best.The outstanding train station shooting scene surely and eternally ranks among the top ten or top five scenes in Cinema's history. It's one of my favorites.Costner, Connery, Garcia, Smith and, of course, De Niro deliver great performances, no exception. All the other bad guys are excellent, too.Again, in my view only one Oscar for this masterpiece is a clear understatement. If you don't believe it, just watch \"The Untouchabels\" and judge it yourself.",

It's your average cops gone rouge to fight the mob story we've seen but with bonuses.Plot is simple. It's 1920's Chicago, and the mob is running wild. Al Capone runs the city and pays off the cops. Enter Agent Eliot Ness, who is sent to stop the crime wave with the help of some cops who are incorruptible.This film does some things right. First, I love Sean Connery as Malone. It's a good performance from a talented actor. Kevin Costner is average in his performance. Same with De Niro, which is disappointing considering his other performances in mafia/mob films like Once upon a Time in America and The Godfather Pt. 2. Also Andy Garcia was nice in his role too. The Music is overall to stylized to the 80's and disrupts the mood of the movie and some of the scenes just feel too much at times. Overall good but very unimpressive mob film. The performances are average( except for good old Sean) and music and stunts feel cheesy. Close to a 6 for me but I'll be nice. Hell, I'll be generous. 7/10",

I saw a documentary on Elliot Ness that said that in his last moment B/4 a fatal heart attack he had poured himself a drink, & dropped dead just as he raised it to his lips. Tempting to view this as poetic justice because he was doing what he made a career condemning in others.  What qualifies this is his expressed view of prohibition-as played by Cosner. \"It's the law of the land\". That leaves open the possibility that Ness was after the disregard for law & order that seemed to explode from disregard for the prohibition laws, rather than a condemnation of alchohol itself.",

Connery who like Robert Mitchum up until the performance in this film was a very underrated actor. He deserved more oscar nominations than the sole one he got for this film for appearing in such underrated gems such as The Offense, The Hill, Outland and The Man who would be King.

No seriously the acting really is very, very good Sean Connery as always gives brilliant performance, though Costner is on top form and plays his part engagingly and you feel great compassion for all the men involved. Even De Niro is the villain you love to hate though his screen time is limited, you just can't wait for them to bring Al Capone down by the time you reach the last gripping 30 mins. It's also got that famous train station scene which oozes tension like no other film. Despite the Godfather's delicious 'it's good to be bad' approach this experience has you craving for justice to be done - no other film makes you feel this way.

            "content": "Brian DePalma's \"The Untouchables\" is a blast from beginning to end, and there is nothing not to like about this movie's unique quality. It tells the story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who vows to take down the notorious Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Capone is ruling Chicago's Prohibition-era streets. Violence along with bootlegging is everywhere. Ness is a firm believer in following the law, whether or not he agrees with it. Because of this dedication, and of all the lives taken by Capone, Ness decides to be the first officer to take action and bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. Yet, failed raids and harassment from the media lead him to make another decision; he needs help. Some nights later he meets Irish cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery). Malone is an aging, yet very smart police officer who finds himself dedicated to stopping Capone, and help Ness is his mission. \"You want to get Capone, here's how you do it: if his man pulls a knife, you pull a gun. If he sends you to the hospital, send one of his to the the morgue. That's the Chicago way.\" This being one of Malone's lessons to Ness; it's a rough neighborhood, and you'll have to be rough to stop it. Ness, with his teacher and partner, decide to search out other possibilities. George Stone (Andy Garcia) is an Italian who has changed his name in an attempt to avoid connections with the mafia. He has chosen the right side of the law, and he wants others to know it. He is an excellent shot and both Malone and Ness like him. The last member is Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant for the FBI, who discovers he can be tougher than anyone ever thought. This is the story of a group of four men, the first of who decide to stand up to the crime wave lead by Al Capone. A great story it is.Much of the films events are based on the real life experiences of an actual group, nicknamed \"The Untouchables,\" who did bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. While many of the events are actual, there is still plenty of the film that was imagined. I will warn you that this film is probably not an accurate representation of the criminal underworld, but can be stylized in its storytelling. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. It's a new way of looking at a dark part of this country's history, and it makes for a very interesting perspective. Everything about the story is a blast. Written by David Mamet, the screenplay lets us look into the past in a very romantic way. The only reason this film is romantic, beautifully shot, and executed is because of Brian DePalma. He directed this film to greatness, and made this movie worth every penny; whether you are renting or buying this picture, and feel satisfied at the end, it is due to DePalma. Hats off to him.Extraordinary acting leads this old-fashioned movie to even greater heights. Kevin Costner, in a role where he was first unknown, pulls his job off in every way. He is likable and charismatic. We do know, however, that when his life and family is threatened, his methods can become intense. A very well-rounded performance from Costner. Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace is a great performance. He is not only funny, but just a great overall acting addition to this group. Andy Garcia, pulling off a career-making performance, lets us know why he should never be underestimated. Sean Connery is great here, scene-by-scene he knocks us off of our feet. This great performance garnered him a well-earned Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Robert De Niro. We can't say enough about him. Ever. He pulls off one of the best performances of the movie as Al Capone. Not only will his bodily features remind you of Capone, but so will his behavior. There is one point where he smiles just like Capone used to do, and there is a scary similarity. A great, great job from De Niro. You shouldn't be surprised by that.In the end, everything works. The old-fashioned allure. The great directing. The great script. The great acting. All of these elements make this film a classic. A film that will go down in history, and is every bit worthy of doing so.",

Capone, who was eventually both tried and sentenced, was the leader of the largest smuggling ring in Chicago during the times of United States prohibition of alcohol. He gained so much power through his use of money and violent displays of aggression that many would say he held more power than the chief of police and mayor. De Palma without doubt selected the perfect team of actors to fill the roles of both Capone, and the untouchables. The Untouchables were a group of Chicago cops that sought to take down this smuggling ring and with hard-hitting head on tactics.

The dialog as the team assembles is hilarious and chilling.In most movies with plot holes, you can say that the characters do not understand and simply react. The problem in Ronin is that Robert DeNiro's character Sam understands exactly what is happening. He is the only one that does. Once the real target has surfaced and Robert DeNiro knows exactly where the target will be, at about 2/3 through the movie, his job is done. Until then, the plot lines make some sense despite the coincidences. At that point, a hit team waits and takes out the target. Job done. Instead, we get a lot of innocent people killed and wounded in the remaining third of the movie.The Jean Reno character Vincent does not understand at movie's end that DeNiro used him? Does this movie count as one of Sean Bean's dying character roles? Do we assume a cleaner takes him out off screen?",

Prohibition has gripped Chicago, illicit liquor dealers have taken over the underworld and at their head is Al Capone. Kevin Costner takes the lead role as Elliot Ness and doesn't fail to deliver in his role as the ever evolving idealist.

Andy Garcia is George Stone, the rookie cop out to make a difference and Charles Martin Smith is Oscar Wallace, an accountant for the FBI who gets caught up in the enthusiasm of Ness' crusade. The Untouchables has an ace in the hole for anyone not quite convinced of its cinematic merit. Hollywood heavyweight Robert DeNiro takes the role of Al Capone. His assured performance as the troubled mobster has you on the edge of your seat throughout. His ability to go from put on sincerity's to blind rage in mere seconds is outstanding. The movie itself is fast paced and doesn't have the viewer bogged down in any unnecessary plot filler.

That seemingly never ending budda boom, budda boom, budda boom, budda boom, set my teeth on edge and had I had the misfortune to have experienced it in a theatre I might have been tempted to get up and leave the theatre for fear that that irritating noise was to be continued as the sound track throughout the film. Fortunately I have it on DVD and can skip to Scene 2 or hit the Mute button instead of tearing my hair out.I absolutely recommend buying and watching this movie on DVD, just skip over the opening credits or hit the Mute button in compassionate consideration of your teeth and your hairline.\"Here endeth the lesson.\"",

Such a killer cast, such a killer waste of my time. I fast forwarded some parts of this movie! People that rate this a 10, please explain to me what the deal is.. Good costumes/acting/dialog i see in some reviews, lol? Some of the dialog in this movie is so horrible that i started laughing when it wasn't funny.. Won an Oscar too, hahahaaaaa!Different times we live in.. different times.. wow. If this movie was made in 2010 or later, it would go straight to DVD with a 4-5 rating probably. And that is only due to people being fan(boys/girls) of some of the leading actors, cuz else it would get a 3!Do not waste ur time people. This has nothing to do with a 'good' movie, and sure as hell ain't no classic. I love classic/gangster movies, specially with a cast like this, which is why i saw it in 2016. This one i will try to forget as soon as possible.",

            "content": "As a gangster film, The Untouchables is among the likes of Goodfellas and The Departed, however as a film about the hunt by Eliot Ness for Al Capone, it should have been so much more.Don't get me wrong it's a very good film, the performance by Andy Garcia as Giuseppe Petri was brilliant (he was my favourite character in the entire film and Robert De Niro as notorious gangster Al Capone is one of his best performances I have seen, it's up there with James Conway from Goodfellas. However, not all the performances hit home. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Eliot Ness was anything but spectacular, which is a great shame as Kevin Costner is a very good actor. Also Sean Connery's portrayal of Jim Malone is by no means bad, it's just that his character is Irish and, yeah, whatever that accent was, it wasn't Irish.What the film does really well though is how it is shot. The sweeping shots of Chicago look magnificent. However, on a technical standpoint nothing else really impresses like it should. There is one scene in particular where they use slow mo. The reason I bring this up is that it is one thing to use slow mo but it is another to over use it, especially as it is only this one scene that uses it, it does really take you out of what is meant to be a pinnacle moment of the film and it never really brings you out of that area and gets you immersed in the film again. The music can also be distracting, for the most part it's okay, it does its job but when an important part of the film rears its head, it goes all operatic which really doesn't fit the tone or the setting of the movie, which again slightly draws you out of the movie. In conclusion, The Untouchables is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, however, for what it is and how much of a defining moment the plan to bring down Al Capone was in history, it just wasn't enough and for what I was expecting, I was a little let down. I just hope Scarface is better.",

I wouldnt say that this is one of the best movies of all time in its genre but what you have to remember is is that it is not taking itself seriously it is cops and robbers in its purest form and it should be enjoyed as that ,even so it has some very tender moments showing the friendship and bond that develops between the four (Untouchables) I would score this film 8/10",

Plus, nowadays people are interested in Mafia, Gangs or Al Capone movies. Like \"The Untouchables\", \"Road to Perdition\" and \"Godfather\". Also, the movie has a great \"pack\" of actors, which all fit their roles VERY WELL. Robert De Niro matches Capone very well, the way his face has and the way he laughs, etc. The other thing that makes the movie interesting is that the story is true. I, myself, like movies with true story (The Untouchables, The Beautiful Mind) or just real characters (Adaptation).The story is on Capone's time. It's time of prohibition. We have Eliot Ness (Costner), which is a detective who has sweared to get Capone. He soon finds out that he's going the wrong way. Just when everyone's laughing at him and he's dissapointed, he finds Malone (Connery), and together they get two other people, and the group is made, \"The Untouchables\". They start very good, and they are close, but something happens...the group gets touched. It turns to a touchable group. But Ness doesn't give up... I'm not gonna say the whole story and spoil the movie. But I tell you, the ending is greatly made. VERY good acting by De Niro and Costner, I just say that YOU'LL LOVE IT, as I did. 10/10",

But the one thing that really really bothered me about this film was its musical score. The whole thing wasn't too bad, but at times, such as the opening credits and most of the sequences with De Niro on screen, the score had great musical themes, but was way to modernized and didn't fit the atmosphere at all. It had a hint of 80s, heavily reverbed drum beats that were entirely not necessary. Also, the use of some of the music in a few parts of the movie made the scenes seem a lot cheesier than they needed to be, and i had to sympathize with the actors that their abilities were diminished by the score.And one other thing that i would find negative about the film is that a death in the movie was played out very poorly and dragged on to an unrealistic amount of time for the damages done.But all minor complaints aside, the movie is very enjoyable and is definitely worth a watch. It has one of my favorite scenes of all time and probably one of the more famous scenes to ever hit the screen. But I won't spoil that for you.Hope you enjoy it!",

Connery supposedly plays an Irish cop. He can't lose the Scottish accent. Perhaps Americans don't know the difference? Hard to believe he won an Academy Award for this! Some scenes like the revenge of the nerds (accountant gunning down mobsters) and judge ordering the swapping of a jury are completely ridiculous.\nDeNiro, as expected, is the star of the show but even he seems confused as to whether this is a drama or a comedy!",

            "content": "The action scenes were very well done, and the stylized violence is throroghly enjoyable, I enjoyed the scene on the stairs, as well as the scene where Sean Connery pushes the corpse against the door, tricking another fellow into thinking it's his friend, and shoots him through the head. But, unfortunately the performances and writing in this movie were very disappointing. Chiefly of those disappointments was De Niro, I'm a massive fan of Robert De Niro, and I loved him in Taxi Driver, Godfather II, Goodellas, and Awakenings (I haven't yet seen Raging Bull, Deer Hunter, or Mean Streets). In this flick De Niro portrays Al Capone, the infamous crime boss, his performance is so terrible and half-assed, that I almost stopped watching the movie because of it. He acts as if he is a parody of himself, and overplays every moment. I would have liked to see a better performance, and I'm not asking for a depthful oscarworthy performance or anything, just something Al Capone would approve of, but no. De Niro's performance is disappointing to say the least. Kevin Costner does an alright job, though he doesn't have much to work with in terms of script. Sean Connery does a fairly good job, and his character is quite likeable and well written, it's a shame his character dies before the climax of the movie. I felt that the script was wooden at best, and cheesy at the worst, it does it's job, and gets it's point across, but not very well. Now despite my critiscims of the acting and writing I think that many of the fights are really well done. There's a scene where they are in a gunfight on the stairs at a train station, and they have to do their best to not hit a baby carriage coming down the stairs. At the end of this scene there's this really badass scene where the sharpshooter cop gets a hostage taker right in the end, the hostage makes an animated face of shock. Another scene I found enjoyable was when he was chasing the guy out of the courtroom, and there's this part where the guy is escaping on a rope dangling off the side of the building. The Camera angles itself just like a scene out of a Clint Eastwood flick, it's a well down scene. Overall this is definetly a movie that had great potential, and had some enjoyable scenes, but lacked good characterization and plot, not to mention acting that was mediocre at best. 6.5/10",

It is one of my all time favorites.  \"You got nuttin, ya hear, nuttin'\" Classic. There are plenty of other good lines. Mainly this is a comic look at gangsters.  It was based on a kids show for crying out loud. The characters are little more then characatures. So what! Unlike other gangster flicks, we identify with the good honest Ness instead of the Deniro character. At the end however he sacrifices his moral integrity by commiting murder. You know, when he throws the guy of the building.  Oh well, you weren't expecting it were you? Uneccessary maybe but its just a movie.  we pay to see the bad guy get it in the end.  Freudian catharsis and all that.  HOwever, I think some of the violence was completely unnecessary. Forget the historical innacuricies.

And by the directing of Brian De Palma, the movie was looking amazing too.It was in 1930. It was the time of Alphonso Capone. Who doesn't know this man? That was a little girl at a small coffee shop who was died by a bomb. The bomb was putting in a bag, carrying by a mafia. They want offer alcohol drink; but the owner of the coffee shop denied. Then... bum! A bomb exploded. Newspaper and television report the exploding. Special Agent of Treasury Department, Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) who have a romantic relationship with his wife and little child, take an order from federal government to control the violence.It's not only about good or not to drink alcohol; the point was in its circulation (selling, distribution, I mean) and the mafia who control it always make crimes (murder) when they found a conflict in the circulation process. There are many mafias have their own business illegally; their business make them rich. And what you can't do without money? Prohibition's Law has no more power and attention.Behind crimes, alcohol, mafia, there is a good point for me I can get from this movie. When there is violence, crimes and everything out of control, attempting to do something good is possible even people around say that it was ridiculous.Actually, nobody cannot be trusted in Chicago, even the policemen. There are maybe only two person who support Ness to stop the crimes: his wife and the mother of the little girl. But, Ness, somehow found his men. An innocent-funny accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) The old policemen Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), George Stone (Andy Garcia). This four men accompanied against Capone (Robert De Niro). The blood shed in every steps. Capone has big organization, money and influence in Chicago. He and his people I guess mentioned as the untouchables in the title, by law.",

            "content": "Even though parts of the story weren't true, this movie is definitely a psychological thrill ride.Why \"psychological?\"  Because Elliot Ness in the beginning of the film was a clean honest cop who followed everything in the book.  Naive too, since he was unaware of the police corruption during the Prohibition in the film. Then after a mishap, he meets a \"beat\" cop, Malone, brilliantly played by Sean Connery (Best Supporting Actor for the film).WARNING: SPOILER.  Malone tells Ness that if he wants to capture Al Capone, he must go all the way, and then asks him \"What are you prepared to do?\" That question is answered throughout the whole film.  Ness must escape his comfort zone and find unorthodox ways to find Al Capone, with the help from Malone.The scene I liked is that when he asked the first apprehended bookkeeper in Canada to translate a ledger from Capone, the bookkeeper refuses at first. Then Malone punches him, goes outside of the cabin, picks up a dead gangster (shot by Ness, which I'll discuss later) and asks him to decipher the ledger;  he puts the gun in the corpse's mouth and said \"I'm going to count to three...what's the matter, can't talk with a gun in your mouth?!  One... two... three!!\"  BANG!! Blood spills, and the bookkeeper, very intimidated, begins to talk.  The mountie, who helped Ness, says to him, \"I do not approve your method.\"  Ness counters, \"Yeah... well you're not from Chicago.\"The scene which Ness reacts after he shoots the gangster in Canada was the turning point in which he had to do whatever it takes to get Capone;  that and the shooting death of Malone, who said in his dying words \"What are you prepared to do?!\"This movie showed us that no matter how stable things are, and although we use this term relatively, no one is really \"safe.\"  We must take chances at something even if it means breaking the law... and I mean it relatively.",

Of course it dosen't hurt that it has an intelligent, witty script, a superb director and a top quality cast, but all of these things would amount to nothing if it didn't come together. I can safely say though, that they do and combine to create a great film.One of the film's most obvious strengths is it's narrative drive. It's simply unrelenting. Great scene follows great scene and several top notch action sequences pepper the film. As you'd expect from DePalma, he handles these with flair and injects real pathos into the film.The performances too are fantastic. Sean Connery gets all the best lines and displays his natural charisma, DeNiro gets to menace people with his inherent intensity, Billy Drago dosen't get to say much but says everything he needs to with his eyes and Kevin Costner's bland drawl suits his naive character perfectly. Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith aren't bad either.A film like this also needs the right feel and I can't find any fault with the art direction, the costumes or the photography. It feels like the Thirties and not a collection of people dressed up playing gangsters. Lastly, I must acknowledge the great score by Ennio Morricone. It suits the film like an Armani suit and is certainly one of Morricone's best non Leone scores. His use of the harmonica was only bettered in Once Upon a Time in the West.One to watch and watch again.",

            "content": "The Untouchables is a masterpiece. Every detail is meticulously calculated and revealed, creating a vivid and fascinatingly beautiful picture of a time of extreme violence. Using a smooth, tracking camera, De Palma creates a film that is paradoxically both beautiful and disturbing. This allows him to showcase a basic theme that figures prominently in the entire film: war is hell, even war against crime; it changes people.The idea of change in man's values through violence can be seen in multiple ways. In the train station shooting scene, a great deal of action takes place in going down the stairway trying to catch a falling baby carriage. This is an obvious nod to the canonical Russian propaganda film Battleship Potemkin. This war motif continues through the whole film, including many references to the classic westerns of the forties, fifties, and sixties. Some call De Palma a plagiarist, but in truth what he does is allude to other works. He is the James Joyce of film.So, given this, what could make this film better? Well, it could stand for a little trimming in the midsection. The scene in the staircase grows long after a while, drawing the viewer's attention away from the film. Other than that, however, De Palma has produced an excellent and unique film with unusually deep implications.",

            "content": "I believe the strong points of the movie are Kevin Costner (acting & aesthetics - both great), the costumes and the music (subtitles only - more on that below). Costner's character & acting was as sophisticated & captivating as I wanted it. The costumes were superb, and the theme (Ennio Morricone) was superb too and very suitable for that movie.Beyond these points, on a first level, I found the rest characters either not suitable for the story of Al Capone or the cast under-utilized. Robert De Niro could have been a guest-star here, completely under-utilized. Still amazing performance, but the director didn't give any depth or color of the huge Al Capone, zero serious dialogues, more like a caricature of Al Capone. Sean Connery's character was this of the misfit-cap, and although his acting was good (he is anyway great), I was not convinced he is suitable for this role, I just think he fits more bigger-than-life characters. Andy Garcia has close-to-none dialogues, plays more like the good-looking & all-in-style Italian (including shooting, the 1 of the 2 only elements of his character, the other was his good looks, honestly) - to the point that the close-up at the end of the film to his face for couple of minutes, really doesn't feel suitable considering his character.On a 2nd level, I was disappointed with the plot, I was expecting bit more about Al Capone, and the movie got more intense only on the 100'-115' - the rest was very mediocre, complete lack of depth of characters, few plot twists, no serious dialogues.As for the music, with the exception of the great theme (subtitles), the rest was not suitable (in my opinion) for an action-drama-thriller movie for the great story of Al Capone's case. In some parts, the music playing could very well be from \"Police Academy\", really...I believe the great cast and the big story of Al Capone contributed to my great expectations, but I guess this is the risk the director took here, and it doesn't always work for all audience.I would watch it again years later if I had nothing better to watch - but was not exactly memorable (for all the right reasons a least).This is a 6.5 for me, rounded 7.",

That's classic.Or it WOULD have been, if there hadn't HAPPENED to be a conveniently placed platform below the ledge of the roof, which, of course, Elliot landed on. But Nitti thinks, as I did, that Elliot has met a squishy, messy demise down on the ground, so he peers over the edge to confirm this. Unfortunately for him, Elliot is ready and waiting, and proceeds to shoot Nitti, point blank. You'd think that'd do it.So.Nitti goes flying backwards and falls down.only to hop right back up again, unscathed. Explain that one to me.Elliot finally gets back on the roof, and starts running around in search of Nitti. Meantime, Nitti has decided to climb down a (once again, conveniently placed) rope that was dangling off of the roof. Elliot discovers this, and stands at the top, looking down scornfully at the bad man. To show just how scornful he really is, he raises his gun and cocks it. But you know where this is going. Instead of shooting this dirty churl, as he rightfully should, he lowers the gun and casts down his eyes. Aw. Nitti sees this, and triumphantly climbs back up the rope to the roof, where Elliot actually extends his hand and pulls him up. choking.So Nitti is riding high. Not only is he still alive, he's going to get off with a little help from his benevolent employer, Mr. Capone, and he'll be able to continue with his murderous doings. Best thing for him to do at this point is to go quietly. But nooooooo...he's got to ANTAGONIZE Elliot. This is not a wise decision. See, Elliot can only kill people if they start disrespecting his dead friends.and since this is exactly what Nitti does, Elliot takes the opportunity to THROW HIM OFF THE ROOF. Yay. Elliot finally got some chutzpah.This leads to a hysterical and incredibly bogus shot of Nitti screaming bloody murder as he goes hurtling towards the ground, finally smashing through the roof of a parked car. Ouch. That's got to hurt.A manly Elliot returns to the courtroom, and Stone asks where Nitti is. `In the car,' Kevin says, trying to sound as clever as possible. Har de har har.Coming to a close: At this point, our hero discovers a list showing that the jury has been bribed, and in an attempt to get a new jury, he bluffs that the judge's name was on the list as well. Apparently, the judge was less than honorable, for he gives Elliot the new jury. For some reason, this turn of events causes Capone's lawyer to change the plea from 'Not Guilty' to 'Guilty'..and everything basically falls apart. Al jumps up and starts shouting nasty comments at everyone, Elliot walks around triumphantly, kind of like a peacock, and the whole courtroom goes ballistic. Typical.At long last, the movie comes to a close, ending with a reporter asking `Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness! Have you heard that they may repeal prohibition? What will you do then?'.where we see Kevy turn toward the camera and say with a sly grin, `I guess I'll go have a drink.'HAH. I'll take Bogie any day.",

            "content": "THIS WHOLE THING IS A SPOILER...but since the movie isn't worth seeing, you may as well read this scintillating review and save yourself some time.So the lights go down, the credits fade out, and the movie begins. I lean forward, as do my classmates, in eager anticipation of things to come, my hopes high, my mind waiting to be enlightened. After all, my history professor wouldn't show a movie that was disastrously abominable, would he?HAH.Okay, the first scene begins with this oh-so-artistic overhead shot of Mr. Al Capone (Dinero) getting a shave and an interview by a bunch of nervously obedient reporters. This gives him the opportunity to introduce his character as a smooth talking tough guy. I'm trembling.Then we lead into another artistically shot scene where we see just how tough he really is. See, he makes stores (and little girls) go BOOM if they don't cooperate with him. I'm shaking.And this, of course leads into the sharply contrasting scene that portrays the idyllic life of Mr. Can-do-no-wrong, Elliot Ness. Aw, look, his sweet little wife is packing him a lunch. All we see of our hero at this point is the back of his head. So far so good.AND THEN...To the police station, where we first get a glimpse of our Good Guy.  And who do you think it is? That's right, none other than KEVIN COSTNER. Let me tell you, I almost threw up.(Let's just say my opinion of Mr. Costner is less than. complimentary)Okay, I says to myself. So the main character is played by Kevin Costner. Maybe the rest of the movie will make up for it.HAH.Alright, alright. The first half an hour, give or take a few minutes, was `Okay'. Not stellar or even worthwhile, but definitely tolerable. During this time, we are introduced to the sage old timer cop (Malone), played by Sean Connery.basically, a walking clich\u00e9. Following this, we meet the young 'prodigy' of a cop (Stone), played by Andy Garcia, who says what, a total of 10 words throughout the duration of the movie? And then, last but certainly not least, we throw in the nerdy accountant (Wallace), who somehow ends up with a gun and an attitude.of some sort. I never really figured that one out. Oh well, I must be stupid.Sometime during all this, we came to a scene where Elliot and his family were gathered in their living room, listening to the radio. I honestly got a kick out of this, and here's why: They had a 1930's model Cathedral radio (Which my family happens to own), and they were listening to Amos and Andy (I'm a big old time radio buff, and own many of their shows). However.this little highlight fails to compensate for the rest of the film.The other memorable occurrence during this first portion of the film was the scene where, again, Mr. Capone is showing his deeply rooted nasty side. See, as soon as I saw him pull out the baseball bat (even though he was supposedly using it for an analogy) I put two and two together. See? : Bad guy + baseball bat = bad situation.  And guess what? I was right.Anyways. All of a sudden, we're at the 'Bridge Shootout' (in order to stop a shipment of booze), and our four Untouchables are now desperados (give me a break). on horses, no less. And here's where things really start to go downhill. Although, to be perfectly honest, I couldn't really pay attention during this scene. I was too busy cracking up. I mean, who are you trying to kid with that MUSIC?!. But what's most priceless about the whole thing is at the end, when poor Kevy (Elliot) actually has to kill someone.insert gasp here. Being the noble and decent guy he is, he gets very upset about it, and yells at the dead guy for making him have to do something so atrocious. (Hey Elliot! Guess what? HE WAS A BAD GUY. Just let it go.)After this incident, Mr. Capone is not a happy camper. In fact, he's rather put out about the whole thing. He displays this by stomping around and yelling at the top of his lungs. A lot. So naturally, The Untouchables begin to feel his wrath. (Didn't see that one coming)First, let's start by killing the nerd. In order to do this, we must arrange it so that he is escorting an essential witness (and squealer) to the courthouse. Of course! That's perfectly logical. Then, to spice things up, throw in a glitch in security, thus allowing one of Capone's men to sneak into the police headquarters, dressed as a cop, and somehow manage to get appointed as the armed guard for Wally and his witness. Toss in a small service elevator, and you've got a double murder. Woohoo!Poor Elliot. Things are just not going his way. So the only thing to do is- you guessed it!-  go storming over to Al's hotel, confront him and his posse, and get in his face. Here we get to see his ghetto side. I really thought he was gonna say, `C'mon, bitch. You wanna piece of me?' and bounce his stomach off of Dinero's. Too bad he didn't. That would have made for some quality entertainment.",

I would have liked the film to be 25 minutes longer with 20 minutes of time showing Capone's iron first rule of Chicago in the 1920's and 1930's. This could have helped severely strengthen the plot, and not just assumed people knew how big Capone was in 1930's Chicago.Overall it's a good film, it receives an 8.3 from me just due to the missed opportunity of what could have been a signature performance with DeNiro as an icon in the Gangster world.",

Upon receiving it, we put it on the pile of films to watch, when my sister and her boyfriend came downstairs. Agreeing there was nothing better to do than watch a film, my Dad suggested we watch the Untouchables with it being the most soft-core. My sister doesn't share our passion for film, but she enjoyed it as much as us. My Dad warned that it isn't the best film, fair point (with Chinatown in the same set, how can it be given such a title), however, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's subtle with it's comedy, cynical with its views (a pro) and not afraid to hold back with some of its violence, the first scene involving a child blowing up. Robert De Niro maintains his menacing and yet friendly manner as the big cheese, Costner gives his best performance, and Connery's best since Dr. No. Very much a fun film for families with kids in their teens, and a nostalgic treat for those who saw it on the big screen.

            "content": "The film \"The untouchables\" directed by brian de palma, made in 1987 features well known cast members like Robert de niro and Kevin costner. It takes place in Chicago during the prohibition era where a gang member group lead by al capone was politically protected, causing him to rise in power. The movie also introduces the Chicago investigators, a group of special agents that was formed to put an end to al capone illegal activities. It can be described as a crime and mystery that includes touches of action when needed to make the movie more enticing. The way the move is structured allures the audience to want more, where in the end you will be satisfied you waited the two hours to finish it. \n\nWhat stood out to me the most was when the title of the movie \"the untouchables\" was mentioned. In the beginning the Chicago investigators refer to themselves being the \"untouchables\", meaning that they are undefeated. Though we find out later that this isn't true when one of al capone's gang members writes on the elevator walls \"touchables\" with the blood of investigator Wallace. After this, the movie becomes progressively more chaotic. We are presented with the perspective of one of Al Capone's men as we see him looking through a window at \"agent Jim Malone\". Essentially it has us as the audience anticipate what is about to happen. A big part of how the movie does this is how it's shot and by its music. The music and how its shot connects effortlessly, causing you to feel a sense of tension about how it will occur. It also moves through the scene quickly once we enter inside Jims home and eventually gets shot multiple times. The feeling gets left lingering when \"Elliot Ness\" approaches Jim in his blood, struggling to catch his own breath while slowly reaching out to grab something. This is a classic movie trope, yet every time makes you feel frustrated because you want it to go faster, having you question \"What is he trying to grab\" and how crucial it will be to the plot for us to know. The lighting in the movie as well was very vibrant, which was interesting because the overall theme was dark, though the contrast of the two makes the movie work nicely. \n\nAt the beginning of the film, I honestly was left wanting more. The build up to the good part took a while, so if you aren't patient this is not the movie for you. Though if you are someone who appreciates movies that are well shot and have a slow dramatic climax, this is for you! Personally I like movies that are more fast paced and if it's an action movie, go all out. Although, this is not only an action movie, it's mostly crime and mystery, which I think it did decently. I also felt the acting was a bit bland, although there were some scenes that did a great job. The scene where \"Elliot Ness\" is locking eyes with agent George and tells him to shoot his shot, perfect! It was the best scene in my opinion. Overall, I would give the movie \"The untouchables\" a 3.5/5.",

Although the \"gangster pinstripe suits\" are a bit stereotypical or cliche, I think they really tie the characters together as a person. The suits feel old-timey which makes sense since that was the attire for a lot of people in that era. If the characters had worn modern clothing such as jeans and t-shirts, the movie would feel like it is all over the place. This aspect was one of the more noticeable ones especially as the characters were constantly in said costumes. Overall, I would give the film a 4 out of 5 stars. Although the film is inaccurate and dramatizes the events that lead to the eventual fall of one of America's most prominent mafia leaders, it does successfully paint a picture of the struggle and difficulty that law enforcement faced while taking down Al Capone. This was Brian de Palma's second film; the first being Scarface. Although this was his second film, it did feel like he had been directing for years.",

And finally, I liked the lighting in one scene with a store catching on fire had a sudden moment (Spoiler Alert).\n\nMy overall reaction to this movie goes like this I liked the action and adventure, and the character's beginning of the movie. If I were to recommend this movie to young viewers I would give them the chance to watch this movie but ask them if they have the courage to face the violent scenes plus the harsh and strong language. In my honest opinion, this movie feels too long I cannot complain about the quality of the movie since it was made in 1987, and besides, I had a hard time understanding what they are saying at the end of the important sentence of a scene. On a scale of 5 stars, I would probably give this movie about 3.5 stars out of 5 stars because my full reason for this is that the movie didn't have really great sound quality it was hard to make out words while they are speaking, and plus if viewers were watching this movie it would give other viewers a hard time to understanding what the characters, and also the movie was in color making it easier for me to see things that are easier for me and viewers to see the whole scene and where it's taking place and also black and white makes it difficult to see objects with shades of darker colors.",

DeNiro as Al Capone is really quite sinister and its certainly a pretty gripping film in general. I was aware of the general story but not all the details and so I found this, I suppose, an insightful watch, although I can't be sure how accurate it is. There was one long scene set in I think Grand Central station, feautring a mother and a pram, that really did have me right at the edge of my seat. I thought the use of incidental music was quite well judged too - not too little and not too over the top. There are some nice settings/locations too. \n\nI would definitely recommend this film, yes.",

I was bad at biology, but she was one of the few teachers at the school who really took an interest in her pupils and formed relationships with us. I remember telling her how much I'd enjoyed 'The Untouchables', and her replying 'The best Western I've seen all year!'. \n\nShe was right, of course. There's much of the Western about it, and nothing about it that doesn't work together as a whole to expertly crank the tension to levels that are at times almost unbearable. It's moving too, with fleshed-out minor characters and a real sense of the stakes as the situation escalates. \n\nMy son, 19 years old with intellectual limitations, asked to watch 'a mafia movie' with me, and this was what I chose today.

I spent a long time choosing which film to bestow with such a title, and decided to turn to my favorite subgenre - gangster cinema, namely, to its only cult representative that I had not watched - The Untouchables.\n\nHigh expectations, although I usually try not to give in to them, this time was unavoidable. And it's not just about the numbering of the score. A film by Brian De Palma who directed the legendary Scarface, one of my favorite films, about my favorite era (20-30s), in my favorite genre, with one of my favorite actors (Robert De Niro) as Al Capone himself , and composers (Ennio Morricone), screenwriters Pulitzer laureate, and costume designer - Giorgio Armani himself - this cannot but excite.\n\nIn fact, I can not say that the film is bad - by no means. These people will never do anything wrong. The movie is good, but not great. It is too standard, licked, correct, schematic, simple and as if made according to a training manual. It's overly superficial and straightforward, very predictable and lacking in zest, and in this day and age, outdated. All the characters here are clearly divided into good and bad - each character has his character written on his face. Almost every action and event of the story is absolutely obvious and understandable - it's boring. I would like more disclosure of the same Al Capone, at least as a villain, because the main character is just despondency itself. The film lasts only 2 hours, which is not much for gangster films, but still manages to sag and be drawn out. Sean Connery pulls here and De Niro, although he performs a flat antagonist, and Costner has almost nothing to play here. Garcia walked by.\n\nThe atmosphere of the 30s is conveyed well, but the music is also insipid. I liked only the theme of Al Capone. De Palma's directing is no match for his previous work in Scarface. The feeling that he was holding himself back here in order to make an academic picture and like awards, but only Connery received an Oscar.\n\nAs a result, my thousandth assessment, unfortunately, will be a seven. It could have been worse, but I expected more. Not to say that I'm just disappointed - the film, I repeat, is not bad and, if you don't expect anything from it, you can read it once. And it just so happened that it was he who became a great anniversary for me. Well, it was my choice and I don't regret it. But now I have seen all the outstanding gangster sagas, with the exception, of course, of the classics of old Hollywood, but more on that some other time ...",

There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.\n\nThat isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.\n\nOverall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

De Palma here creates an exhilarating and powerful drama of cops vs the mob with some cheesy acting coupled with great action and intense bloody violence. The film stars some of the most prominent macho actors in recent cinematic history with Kevin Costner playing Elliot Ness the prohibition agent who brought down Capone, who plays ness as a by the book law and order agent who's not quite ready to face the wrath of the mob but is persistent in bringing justice and ending the carnage brought by Capone. Robert De Niro as Al Capone who has to be now one of the most celebrated and powerful male actors in cinema plays a very cheesy and perhaps cartoony version of Capone yet De Niro is able to humanize the man and show him as the powerful and sadistic gangster that he was. The best performance goes to the now late legend Sean Connery who plays a cop with a strong sense of justice , bravery, bravado, who steals every scene he is in. The script is great as written by the great writer David Mamet and De Palma's incredible direction of close ups and interior spaces and his signature bloody violence make this film a quite entertaining  and delightful piece of cinema.",

However, that's nothing new in Hollywood. The Untouchables is a solid fictional gangster film based on a certain part of history, nothing more. Still, there are two exceptions that should be named artistically great, the railway station shoot-out, which was a tribute to the Odessa Steps montage in Sergei Eisenstein's famous 1925 silent movie Battleship Potemkin.

Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.\"",

Started this movie not knowing what to expect and loved seeing so many well-known faces. Though, seeing Andy Garcia act did make me want to hurl. The acting was cheesy in some parts. Take, for example, Sean Connery's horrendous \"Irish\" accent or breathing \"dead\" people.\n\nAttire and set design in this movie were visual eye-candy. Giorgio Armani did a nifty job making sure everyone's suit were a sign of the times and roles. Chicago was visually stunning and the movie portrayed the classical Windy City well.\n\nThe action scenes pepper the movie well and leaves enough to not bore.\n\nFor all its pluses, two things bothered me about this movie.\n\nFor starters, the cheesy musical score was distracting and felt ripped from a cheap 90s film. Nothing in the musical score was memorable or added much to the movie. I found myself more annoyed by the music than anything. Punches and gunshots sounded off and didn't match what was on screen. Out of all the money spent on this movie, more should've been spent on sound design.\n\nSecond, historical inaccuracies were glaring. The operation itself was a lot less flashy than what the movie makes it out to be. A lot fewer people died than what was in the movie. But this can be forgiven, Hollywood has to sell a story somehow.\n\nFor all that it gives and takes, this movie was a tough one to rate. I'll have to settle on a 3/5. Average at best. The movie aims too high above the bar and misses its mark.\n\nThough critically received at the time, this movie felt a bit too cheesy and cliche for my tastes. Scenes were predictable, music was horrendous, and Sean Connery's accent was damnable.\n\nI'd recommend this to those interested in Prohibition-era Chicago culture... but not for those with an eye for historical accuracy.",

Unlike some of the more clever clog reviews.\n\nThe Untouchables was originally a television series but director Brian De Palma brings a successful film adaptation. \n\nThe film focuses on the gangland warfare between gangster Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and Federal U.S. Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) brought into Chicago to snare Capone.\n\nNess forms an 'Untouchables' police unit with an older and wise Irish-American Malone (Sean Connery) and Oscar Wallace, a young Cop George Wallace (Andy Garcia) and a federal IRS like accountant?\n\nThe film is notable for the elaborate production design. I am thinking of scenes in 1930 Chicago including street scenes with period features, a Chicago courtroom and Chicago Grand Central railway station.\n\nA good musical score is presented by Ennio  Morricone that has elements of his Once Upon A Time In The West work.\n\nI don't usually endear to Kevin Costner's career opus in the late 1980s/1990s but he delivers a good performance here. In fact all the cast do in particular Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for this.\n\nAl Capone is played by De Niro. Watching De Niro strutting around and smirking got me thinking. He plays the same character in a lot of his films! In particular some of his collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.\n\nComing in at just under two hours, perhaps the film could have been beefed up with some other scenes?\n\n4/5",

            "content": "Brian De Palma's career has been tumultuous as he experienced huge success with Scarface (1983), an unabashed celebration of violence, but a crushing defeat in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) which proved he didn't necessarily have a strong grasp on tone. This film falls somewhere in between as it contains beautifully choreographed action set pieces but struggles to decide whether it is a serious crime drama or a campy, over the top caper. This allows for some odd scenes as a scenery chewing performance from Robert De Niro, phoning it in, left me sickened come up against a bland, expressionless performance from Kevin Costner who displays the lack of charisma that would weigh down Bull Durham (1988) and Dances with Wolves (1990). I enjoyed the film but it didn't reach the heights of the crime epics it clearly aims to imitate and it was disappointing to see a director with such exuberance in his style of filmmaking bogged down by a subpar film.\n\nIdealistic police officer Eliot Ness, Kevin Costner, attempts to take down gangster Al Capone, Robert De Niro, in the era of prohibition but is fooled repeatedly and mocked as he begins his quest. He discovers that he will need to toughen up if he is to take down his enemy and enlists mentor Jimmy Malone, Sean Connery, to serve as his partner along with meek accountant Oscar Wallace, Charles Martin Smith, and fiery George Stone, Andy Garcia, to take the fight to Capone. The men are successful with their new freewheeling tactics but still struggle to pin any real blame on Capone and face constant threats to their families from him. After the murders of Malone and Wallace the two remaining members of the team are more motivated than ever to take down their primary target.\n\nThe film has several major assets with an excellent score from Ennio Morricone, beautiful cinematography from Stephen H. Burrum and the over the top choreography from De Palma but somehow this is lost amongst the film's attempts to appeal to a wide audience. One can't help feeling that for a film which so clearly delights in graphic violence it is odd to have such a generalized good guy who is supposedly anti-violence presented as our hero. De Palma is clearly more interested in the film's ostensible villain but this aspect of the film is let down by De Niro's scenery chewing performance which is not campy and enjoyable as it should be but painful to watch. The scenes of an underused Patricia Clarkson staring adoringly at a stolid Costner were so overplayed that they felt like a parody of sorts and the menace of De Niro is cut down by how much of him we see before the final act. I wanted to like the film more than I did but it was let down by these tonal issues and the misjudged performances which lean heavily on stereotypes and lack humanity.\n\nFortunately there are some scenes of note as De Palma doesn't lose all of the flair he brought to previous films with an homage to Battleship Potemkin (1925) and a violent chase on top of a courthouse being highlights. While the original is still more impactful De Palma restages an iconic scene with gusto as our fears for the gurgling baby are alighted as he slowly descends a staircase in his carriage and the carefully choreographed sequences of bullets flying every which way are damned entertaining. The shootout towards the end is helped considerably by the creepy appearance of Billy Drago as the appropriately titled Frank Nitti and the climactic descent of the character onto the pavement below is another clear homage to Rear Window (1954). It is hard not to be thrilled and exhilarated by these moments but sadly they are sandwiched in between scenes of incredible mediocrity which drag down the film as a whole.\n\nConnery won an Academy Award for his portrayal of a sagacious old Irish/Scottish? cop against relatively weak competition and although I can see the charm in this sort of old fashioned performance he doesn't bring anything new to the table. Similarly the entire film feels like a rip-off of other better films that I would recommend you watch instead of it.",

About the only two characters in this movie that ever really existed were Ness and Capone, who never actually met. So pretty much everything else that happens on screen with Ness's deputies who never existed is total BS. The evil Frank Netti assassin character in the movie (who Eliot Ness throws from the court house roof)  in real life was one of Capone's accountants. He committed suicide. The baseball bat scene was sort of true, although it happened in a kitchen with Capone's henchmen holding two victims down while Big Al did all the swinging. The Judge at Capone's trial swapped juries on his own accord after realizing they'd been paid off. I'm sure his descendants aren't too pleased at how he's been portrayed. I wish some Hollywood producer would actually read the true story of Capone's life and make a decent film about it. It doesn't need embellishment and fiction. The true story, as horrific and violent as it was, properly told would far surpass this script.",

The only thing that sometimes creeps through that hindered the movie was the youthful exuberance of Costner that he couldn't escape making it a bit kiddish and when it worked in Silverado, not so much here, but it does work in the end; something does feel missing from his character though.  It could be too that his career was just on the rise and he was simply outshined by the likes of Connery and De Niro who had more experience. Nevertheless, De Niro really comes off as a very good typecast in this movie. It feels like after his roles in Godfather Part II and Taxi Driver he never stopped playing the same tough guy character...even in his comedies he is a retired tough guy, but to the tune of 300 million doing the same thing every day who wouldn't? I think this comfortably sits at the 90-95% range and will continue to age well and for those who enjoy the genre it is a must watch and must have.",

More than three decades after it's premiere, the movie still delivers on every level.  The performances are uniformly excellent from a young Kevin Costner in one of his early roles to Sean Connery in a role that won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (and rightfully so).  What also helps this movie is that many of its scenes were actually filmed in Chicago and not on studio sets which just made me enjoy the film even more.  The script is terrific with well written dialogue and well staged action scenes.  There is a lot to like about \"the Untouchables\".  So much in fact that I don't have enough room to list them here.

            "content": "A commercial and artistic high point for director Brian De Palma (\"Blow Out\" \"Dressed to Kill\" \"Scarface\" \"Femme Fatale\"), working from a script by David Mamet (\"House of Games\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" \"Heist\" etc.) and featuring Kevin Costner in his breakout star making performance as prohibition era crime fighter Eliot Ness. There's little historical accuracy to the film, but who really cares about that when there is so many other things to love about the film. Besides the above mentioned assets, you have an incredibly strong cast led by Coster as an idealistic Ness, who's joined by honest beat cop Jim Malone, a wonderfully over-the-hill Sean Connery, a rookie cop recruited straight from the Academy who hasn't been corrupted yet (\"If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.\") played by a young Andy Garcia (\"8 Million Ways to Die\" was his only other major credit before this), and capped off by Robert De Niro packing on a ton of weight to play Chicago gangster Al Capone. Incidentally, De Niro started his career with director Brian De Palma well before he made Mean Streets\" with Martin Scorsese, so it's a treat to see the two reunite. Besides the strong leads, you also have Charles Martin Smith, Richard Bradford, Billy Drago, Patricia Clarkson, Del Close, and even Clifton James (the tobacco chewing sheriff from \"Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Live and Let Die\") all in memorable parts, so it really is a cast to die for. In addition to a sharp script, an amazing cast, you have some serious talent behind the camera that includes cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (\"Rumble Fish\" \"Carlito's Way\" \"Hoffa\"), composer Ennio Morricone (\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" \"The Mission\" \"The Hateful Eight\"), set decoration by the guy who's everything from Disney's \"Mary Poppins\" to \"Back to the Future,\" and the editor of \"The French Connection\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Scarface,\" but the real hero behind the camera is director Brian De Palma. The sets, costumes, music, and overall period atmosphere are amazing, but it's the visual stylistics from De Palma that make this film a classic. Without spoiling anything, the Pagliacci scene and the Sergei Eisenstein inspired baby carriage scene are moments of pure cinema (meaning they are scenes that would be impossible to capture or recreate as effectively in another medium. Not written word, not painting, not stage play, not graphic novel, etc.). Although a major studio film, this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma picture. \"The Untouchables\" is minus his usual obsessions around voyeurism and sexuality, but the film does have his trademark fascination with violence (\"They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!\"), guilt/betrayal (most all of the characters are motivated by some form of guilt), as well as his many visual hallmarks (camera zooms, slow motion, and memorable POV shots). De Palma's fingerprints are all over the film, especially the \"Battleship Potemkin\" inspired train station shootout with a baby carriage bouncing down marble steps amongst a hail of slow motion gunfire. According to Mamet, the scene was not in the original script and was added by De Palma, but this particular scene ends up being the most memorable of the film. It's De Palma's signature suspenseful build-up that makes the scene so effective. In lesser hands, this 10-minute sequence might have been a straight forward shootout, but with De Palma it achieves operatic levels, with about a dozen moving parts all contributing to mounting suspense as he turns the screws on the audience, stretching out about 10 seconds of real time action into a two minute slow motion action masterpiece. Whether it's a bucket of pigs blood above Carrie's head or Tom Cruise trying to catch a bead of sweat, De Palma builds suspense better almost anyone. What makes \"The Untouchables\" different from many of his other films is its emotional center, which comes from an earnest performance by Coster and Mamet's carefully plotted script. Many of De Palma's films seem at times mere exercises in cinematic stylistics and explorations of his various obsessions, but his best films have an emotional center, which I would say are \"Carrie,\" \"Blow Out,\" \"Casualties of War,\" \"Carlito's Way,\" and this film. Overall, from the the stylish opening credits to the soaring finale, \"The Untouchables\" doesn't have a single false note. This is the film that De Palma will be remembered for and deserves to be recognized as a true American film classic. SIDE NOTE: Rewatching the film 2018, I was struck by how \"1980s\" this otherwise very authentic looking period film seemed.",

Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.\n\nThe Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.\n\nBut what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think \"The Untouchables\" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.\n\nThe issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.\n\nIt would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.\n\nThe end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.\n\nThe Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.\n\n(8.5/10)",

            "content": "One of the greatest gangster films ever!\n\nNotably, Brian De Palma directed his masterpiece with his 1987 movie The Untouchables. Crime films reached their peak with movies like The Godfather, Gangs of New York, Heat, and The Untouchables. L.A. Confidential (1997) certainly was influenced by The Untouchables. The deep dive into the mindset of good law enforcement is commented on in this movie. It's style is reminiscent of the aforementioned movies, while creating an atmosphere all its own. The Untouchables goes full noir style police work. You get to watch what Eliot Ness had to do to catch notorious mobster Al Capone.\n\nVisually, The Untouchables contains some of the most memorable and skillful cinematography ever captured on film. The opening alleyway raid is so tense right off the start. The scene in Sean Connery's apartment is so suspense and nerve racking as we get long pans up and down his hallway. The finale at the train station's stair is as violent and exciting as any shootout. The camera is always showing emotional close ups or characters in the foreground speaking while we get the reaction of someone in the background. Endless clever and creative camera work is on full display throughout The Untouchables.\n\nMusically, Ennio Morricone composed the most thrilling score for The Untouchables. There is grand classical music to build up an air of class, while some sultry jazz might be playing elsewhere. The suspense is multiplied by the anxiety inducing score underneath the most tense scenes. Morricone proves he is still a genius with this score.\n\nFurthermore, the attention to detail that De Palma went to recreate 1930 in Chicago is astounding. You get to see many Chicago landmarks and familiar spots that build a sense of verisimilitude. Giorgio Armani did all the gorgeous costumes and suits that create a sleek style and continue the realism of The Untouchables. You actually believe you are there.\n\nIndeed, The Untouchables boasts a brilliant script with many lines that will stay with you. You feel the audacity of Al Capone and the bravery of Eliot Ness. There are moral and legal lessons to be learned within, but you always feel like these characters would speak like how The Untouchables is written.\n\nLastly, The Untouchables has one of the most well cast ensembles in film. Kevin Costner delivers his most humane performance as the stalwart Eliot Ness. Charles Martin Smith plays the most lovable accountant officer on film. Sean Connery astonishes and delights as the  experienced beat cop Malone. Andy Garcia is a compelling rookie cop that is hellbent on catching Capone. Billy Drago is perfectly cast as the creepy murderous henchmen to Capone. Finally, Robert De Niro is monstrous and threatening as the ever boastful Al Capone. The Untouchables stars some of the greatest actors ever as their best. It is a pleasure to watch them work.\n\nOverall, Brian De Palma did a fantastic job directing The Untouchables. This movie holds up with its imaginative direction, suspenseful sequences, thrilling shootouts, clever investigation, deep characterization, lovely music, stylish suits, painstaking recreation, historical accuracy, apt casting, and genius acting.",

Kevin Costner; as the protagonist is convincing but the real game changers are the supporting cast i.e. Sean Connery and Robert De Niro.

The script tells the story of Al Capone from the point of view of his executioners, who despite all the crimes committed by the dry law kingpin, he was convicted of tax evasion, a story so incredible that it looks like a sweet fiction, though Extremely flowery and romanticized, in very general lines, the story is true. The screenplay tells the story of four men, an accountant, an almost retired police officer, a police officer who has not even finished the academy yet, and a treasury agent, all obstinate to capture Al Capone. We have betrayal, death and demonstration of power, and how simply the act of taking away the drink (drink) of people would cause chaos and gigantic contraband, proving also that in the case of alcohol, the restriction only created a parallel market. Technically, the film has footage that looks like a 1950s movie, and that's nice, although sometimes I'm a bit of a shame, because Hitchcock's style is copied, and copied very well, we have an exquisite camera job, With prefect angles, plans sequences, against plounge, always privileged the suspense, in addition to a soundtrack that has a beautiful song and very good (even being one of suspense in a film of mafia,) already the rest of the track often gets half Dislocated from the rest of the film, but Brian always makes a point of guiding the scenes from his extremely varied track, which refers to the western to pop music, we also have a beautiful photograph that shouts that the film was made into film, it is a film Which already causes nostalgia, even for the 80's. Kevin Costner is excellent, conveying an air of patriotism and honesty blended with anger, which suits his partner, and the film's great highlight in terms of Performances that is the wonderful Sean Connery, ale more, even if with little screen time, Robert De Niro is giant and completely scary when it appears. Brian of Palm is sure to have traumas of his great \"Scarface\" to be completely ignored of the great festivals and even of big cinemas due to its violence, with that, in \"The Untouchables\" he censures the violence and diminishes the very concept of it, and This harms his film because it takes away the terror of Al Capone's actions by taking the fear out of his viewer (even in the taco scene, which was done precisely to make the viewer feel the fear, does not work because it is badly made, and even in the Viscerality is silly); finally, \"The Untouchables\" is a good suspense thriller mafia movie, which appeals too much.",

The film is based off of the real Eliot Ness' memoir and is directed with ferociousness by Brian De Palma who crafts a gritty, street-level cop film that has a shaky first half, but really picks up momentum in the latter half and becomes something truly memorable. Kevin Costner leads the cast, including Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith, Patricia Clarkson, Robert De Niro as Al Capone, and Sean Connery as the fourth, and most bitter, member of the Untouchables in an Oscar-winning role! Connery really nails it as the take-no-shit, grump and easily steals the movie, De Niro on the opposite spectrum plays it over-the-top, though he's not in the film much so it's easy to look past. The real highlight of the film is the gritty violence and there are many stand-out moments, including a truly suspenseful sequence at a train station involving a big shoot-out and a runaway baby carriage! As mentioned, the first half of the film is a bit uneven, and most of that is due to the bizarre music choices that turn dramatic moments into cheesy, almost lighthearted affair and the constant tonal shifts really made it a struggle to connect with. All in all, The Untouchables is a pretty good cops vs. gangsters film and the period setting helps it tremendously. The acting is great, the directing is creative, and the shoot-outs are worth seeing!",

Certain of those parts are very good indeed: Sean Connery gives an Oscar winning performance as a street-wise Irish-American cop, Robert De Niro is unforgettable as Al Capone (though he's not actually on screen that much), the atmosphere of Prohibition-era Chicago is elaborately and convincingly realized, and certain of the cinematic set-pieces, like the justly famous midnight shoot-out in Chicago's train station, are about as good as they can be. But against this, Kevin Costner's performance as Eliot Ness is wooden, the scenes with his family seem too goody-goody, as if the film were straining to make a point of the decent values he's defending, and, with the exception of Connery's character, it's hard to feel much empathy with either the good guys or the bad guys. All in all, an ambitious film which ends up being a bravura piece of film making but a good, not great, gangster movie. Rated R for occasional language and lots of graphic violence. Available in various DVD issues, including a recent Blu-Ray; I saw it on the 2004 Paramount standard DVD Collector's Edition, and I thought the DVD quality was very good.",

It has a classic story of a small group of good guys who seem to be taking on the whole world, it has amazing scenes that are emotional and intense, and it has a great cast. In fact I really did like the movie a lot. Sean Connery was better than words could possibly describe. Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro were stellar as you'd always expect them to be. Even Charles Martin Smith was perfectly cast as a nerdy accountant who finds the financial loophole to catch Capone. The only problems I have with this movie are 2 things, but they kept taking me out of the movie and I'd have to struggle to get invested again. First of all was the music. I'm not sure what Morricone was thinking here, but there are scenes where the music is extremely out of place and it changes the tone of a scene from dramatic to silly. And there was a couple other scenes where the music was overly dramatic and telegraphed the events that were coming. It's not something I ordinarily point out in films, but the fact that it stood out so much to me should attest to how distracting his score was in The Untouchables.\n\nThe other, perhaps even bigger flaw is Kevin Costner. I don't ordinarily have a problem with Costner starring in a movie, but there wasn't a single second where I was convinced of his performance in this movie. He was not the right person to play Eliot Ness in my opinion. He was flat and awkward, and I just couldn't figure out what he was doing. His facial expressions barely shifted from a scene where he was supposed to be in deep mourning to a scene where he was furious with rage. There were a couple of scenes where I found myself laughing involuntarily, because the line delivery felt so wrong. I don't know what it is, because at the beginning I thought he was perfect as the straight-laced cop who wouldn't dare to bend the rules. The problem is when his character was supposed to start shifting, I just wasn't seeing it in his performance. It's tough because he's on screen with so many others that are knocking it out of the park, but he did nothing for me. (On a side note: It also didn't help that I recently saw Naked Gun 3 and that movie has an opening scene which directly parodies the baby carriage/train station sequence. I seriously had to fight to avoid cracking up when I saw it here.) The plot of the film, and the other great performances lifted it up so I still enjoyed the experience of watching, but I think it could have been truly great if a couple of different decisions were made in the production.",

            "content": "Hollywood has always loved outlaws, from Billy the Kid to Bonnie and Clyde, and the outlaws that it has most consistently loved are gangsters. Gangsters tick all the boxes for classic Hollywood antagonists: they're stylish, dangerous, well-spoken, they combine history and nostalgia for the 'good old days' in the old country with weapons and schemes that are quintessentially modern. Quentin Tarantino was right when he called gangster films \"parodies of the American dream\": they hold up a mirror to American society and its ideals, letting it either question its very foundations or revel in its dark underbelly.\n\nIt's ironic, therefore, that despite decades of trying, Hollywood has never really done justice to Al Capone. Numerous directors have tried, including trash maestro Roger Corman, but Capone has always worked best as an incidental character in other people's stories. The Untouchables may enjoy a better reputation that Corman's work, thanks in part to Sean Connery's preposterous Oscar win. But it's still an immensely flawed beast which is watchable and empty in equal measure.\n\nPart of the reason for the lack of a definitive on-screen Capone may because he has become the clich\u00e9 of the Hollywood gangster. When Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat were creating Sherlock, they deliberately steered away from making their version of Moriarty identical to those in the original stories; they reasoned that, since he was the first supervillain, to whom every subsequent supervillain owes a debt, he had become the clich\u00e9 and wouldn't scare audiences as he originally had done. Capone, the argument goes, has become a caricature, a parody of what American gangsterism means, so that any attempt to present him seriously could be unintentionally risible.\n\nIf we buy this line of reasoning, one of the greatest failings of The Untouchables is that it fails to deal with this problem. Casting Robert de Niro may have seemed like a no-brainer, given his brilliance in The Godfather Part II as the younger Don Corleone.  But the part came at a time when de Niro was tired of playing gangsters, and had sought to diversify his portfolio through roles in Brazil and The Mission. What we get feels like a bizarre self-parody of de Niro's past roles, complete with his trademark repetition of lines - the 'I wan' 'im dead!\" rant after the border raid stands in for the famous \"are you talkin' to me?\" speech in Taxi Driver.\n\nDe Niro's creative decisions aside, this is also partially down to David Mamet's screenplay, which is muddled and conflicted. The film cannot decide whether it wants to be a style-over-substance, silly gangster film, with all the stock characters and plenty of shoot-outs, or a serious drama about having to go above and beyond the law to bring someone to justice. De Niro is indulged during his scenes and comes across as more comical than threatening, with the score telegraphing to the audience how to feel in the baseball bat scene. When he's not on screen, Mamet tries to make things more macho, but here he is undone by another bad performance: Kevin Costner.\n\nWhile de Niro is coasting (and Connery is largely playing himself), Costner is the dictionary definition of trying too hard. His critics like to assume that he became overly serious as a result of the Oscar success of Dances with Wolves, but the truth is that he's always been a wooden and limited actor. His performance as Eliot Ness is drab and dreary, having neither the presence nor the moral ambiguity of, say, Gene Hackman in The French Connection, which is what the role calls for. He spends the whole film with one facial expression (somewhere between bored and \"but my Dad thinks I'm good\"), and his line readings are flat and unconvincing. In the words of Sheila Benson, writing in The Los Angeles Times, \"to Mamet and De Palma, goodness and dullness seem inseparable.\"\n\nAdmittedly, however, not all of The Untouchables' failings can be pinned on Mamet, Costner or de Niro. Some of the blame must lie with Brian De Palma, whose work from Scarface onwards is an emphatic case of style over substance. Where Martin Scorsese or William Friedkin would have properly marshalled their actors, building an intensity with the characters first and foremost, De Palma always seems more concerned with constructing incredibly stylish death scenes or paying homage to his favourite directors. Tipping one's hat to Battleship Potemkin does not in itself make the train station showdown exciting, and the use of slow-motion is less effective at building tension than the quiet minutes leading up to it.\n\nThroughout his career, De Palma has always been fascinated by death; he likes putting his characters through the mill, as his idol Alfred Hitchcock did before him, and staging beautiful demises for them complete with razor blades, guns and plenty of stage blood. The train station offers a lot in this regard, with carefully positioned squibs, broken glass and blood practically oozing from henchman's mouths.\n\nBut the ne plus ultra of this is the gunning down of Malone, which is every bit as drawn out and ridiculous as Alan Rickman's pantomime death scene in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves four years later. We start with a protracted nod to Hallowe'en in the use of first-person steadicam, and end with one of the most contrived farewells of two characters in Hollywood history; no man, riddled with that many machine gun bullets, could have survived that long, let alone been in a position to relay such a vital detail.\n\nIn amongst all this indulgence and over-abundance of style, there are a number of qualities which make The Untouchables watchable. The first and biggest of these is the historical quirk of how Capone was caught, through tax evasion. The film does lose focus from time to time, particularly in the scenes with a high body count, but we do keep coming back to the theme of how the smallest error or indiscretion can lead to a person's downfall - something that's as true of Capone as it is of the police officers who allowed Frank Nitti to infiltrate their ranks.\n\nThe most interesting characters in The Untouchables are the minor players on both sides of the divide. Charles Martin Smith (who was very good in Starman) deftly conveys someone who is out of his depth but driven by the need to do good, turning his own skills to the advantage of the team. Andy Garcia's character is a little underwritten, but he takes what chances he can to portray a hot-head trying to turn his life around - ample preparation for his later role in The Godfather Part III. And Billy Drago, as a heavily fictionalised Frank Nitti, is one of the coolest, most underrated villains of the 1980s. Not only does he look tremendous, but his icy demeanour and playful sense of humour make his evildoing for Capone resonate all the more (his death, on the other hand, is riddled with disappointing wire work).\n\nThe Untouchables is a watchable but ultimately empty experience which has neither the substance nor the discipline of De Palma at his best. Lumbered by a problematic script and unintentionally silly performances by its main leads, it provides just enough drama to keep an audience interested while never getting to grips with its subject matter in a sufficiently deep manner. There are many Oscar-winning films which are far, far worse, but there's very little about this film which is truly untouchable.",

He finds a friend who helps him form a smaller more effective team; but Ness quickly discovers as he gets closer to Capone, more and more lives become at risk.\n\n\"It's nice to be married.\"\n\"If you can stand the pain.\"\n\nBrian De Palma, director of Scarface, Carlito's Way, Mission: Impossible, Black Dahlia, Mission to Mars, Snake Eyes, Femme Fatale, and Carrie (1976), delivers The Untouchables.  The storyline for this seems a bit fabricated but entertaining and well done similar to Tombstone.  The action and script is very well written and the cast delivers solid performances.  The cast includes Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Sean Connery, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith, and Billy Drago.\n\n\"Make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.\"\n\nI came across this on HBOGO and decided to watch it again for the first time in a long time.  I always adored this movie and how the character interactions unfold and the great shootouts.  The film also has the perfect \"feel\" to it like Tombstone or Hoodlum.  This is an underrated classic that is a must see.\n\n\"And don't let him clean himself until after he talks.\"\n\nGrade: A",

It's a big cartoon. Lots of giant set pieces and big men in high pants trying to eat up all of the scenery. Kevin Costner pulls it off really well. Sean Connery is the film's star. He's just fantastic as that bad-ass irishman, the right one to combat with the ruthless gangsters. Then, there's Robert DeNiro as Al Capone. Oh my goodness, he is absolutely frightening. This  rivals Jake LaMotta as his best role EVER in a film. What's so tragic about it, however, is that he barely gets enough screen-time. The film opens with DeNiro, in a genius, menacing monologue, and then we have such a long stretch before he returns. It just seemed inconsistent, and why this movie isn't perfect. We needed more Capone. Then again, Capone is such a huge figure in American history, he needs his own biopic.. but these days, it's too little, too late. I think the film also suffers a little with it's tongue-in-cheek humor. That big jumpy soundtrack, and theatrical sets mixed in with the great dramatic story by Mamet and the bloody shootouts.. perhaps I missed the point? Slick, funny and piercingly dramatic, could this have been the precursor to Inglorious Basterds? You know what? I've gotta see this movie again.",

            "content": "The first few scenes of \"The Untouchables\" show off director Brian de Palma's skill at creating expectations, subverting them, and manipulating the audience, three modes that he uses to good effect and bad over the course of the film. It is important that we like Treasury Department investigator Elliott Ness, the man who brings down Al Capone, because this is his story. But as the stiff, humorless enforcer of two deeply unpopular laws, Prohibition and the U.S. tax code, sympathy for him is hardly automatic. De Palma creates that sympathy in short order through a series of carefully crafted moments. First, he makes Ness's foe a larger-than-life villain. Robert de Niro's Capone is a grotesque monster, cocky and immature as a school bully, but incalculably more frightening. His first on-screen victim is a 10-year-old girl, and just like that the audience is out of his corner. The camera is always markedly above or below de Niro so that his face and body, swollen by decadence, bulge out in unnatural and off-putting ways. By contrast, Kevin Costner's Ness is quiet, steady, unassuming, and life-size. The camera looks straight at him as he keeps his composure in the face of a news crew's cynical heckling. Their faceless taunting, and his defenselessness, puts the audience on Ness's side even though Costner has far less natural charismatic than de Niro. But de Palma is not through crafting his protagonist: instead of being truly untouchable, a flawless Superman, the first major set piece sees Ness engage in farcical vainglory. He shouts \"Let's do some good!\" as he drives a truck through a warehouse wall, only to find that his first big bust is a big bust. Seeing Ness humbled is the final piece of de Palma's masterful opening arc. By humanizing him, by refusing to make him simply pure in counterpoise to Capone's simple evil, de Palma makes a killjoy Fed into a hero worth rooting for.\n\nUnfortunately, de Palma's deftness at audience manipulation and his penchant for highly-manufactured staging have their downsides. The plot unfolds in a series of violent vignettes, and while these are exciting and memorable entries in the long tradition of shoot-em-up cinema, de Palma does not always know how much is too much and where to draw the line. The first big showdown takes place on a bridge, and the visuals are great. We see the plan unfold clearly. But the music is all wrong for the moment. It sounds almost comical, and is the kind of music that can only be played after the fact because its tension-killing jauntiness indicates that none of the principles are going to die. The film is scored by universally-acknowledged genius Ennio Morricone, so the fault must lie with de Palma for putting the music in the wrong place. In the next major bloodbath, which involves Sean Connery's quotable Irish cop Malone and a pair of assassins, de Palma switches to first-person view for an extended shot that moves seamlessly through a window and up and down a hallway. This technique is often used in schlock horror, but it works just as well to build tension in a period piece drama. As a bonus, it showcases the movie's excellent set dressing; the 1930-ish furniture and fixtures are museum-display perfect, yet feel authentic and lived-in. The end of this sequence has enough bullets that it really must result in an immediate death, but for the sake of melodrama de Palma stretches out the victim's life in a way that is unforgivably unbelievable. The loss of believability is only compounded in the movie's final act, in which de Palma detaches the film from the realm of physical probability in order to indulge in a slow-motion massacre on a staircase. It is an obvious homage to the famous Odessa Staircase scene in Sergei Eisenstein's \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925), which popularized the telescoping of time as a way to tell several small stories that occur in the same place at the same moment. It looks great, and it's gripping, but when it ends we can feel that we've been played.\n\nThe conclusion of the film is too easy, even corny, completing de Palma's drift away from stylized reality and into pure fantasy. Stray elements of the movie-the wife, the determined photographer, the corrupt police chief-never reach their full potential. \"The Untouchables\" can't be considered a flawless film by a long shot, but as a playground for big, bold personalities like de Niro, Connery, and de Palma, it's absolutely a fun one.",

However this piece, although extremely entertaining and well executed misses the mark, one too many times to make it a classic. During prohabition, in 1930's Chicago, Crime lord Al Capone, sweeps under the radar, illegally exporting alcohol and weapons, while tax dodging. The Bureau send in new boy Elliot Ness, in order to bring Capone to justice, however he quickly learns that even his own department are in on Capone's regime. Elliot is then forced to create his own gung ho team nicknamed The Untouchables, in order to finally bring Capone to justice. Its a strong cast, lead by Costner, who gives a heart warming and likable performance as Ness, De Niro is superb as crime lord Capone, the only fault is we dont quite get enough of him on screen to really enjoy him chomping his way through the dialogue. Sean Connery and Andy Garcia also make worthwhile appearances, however the problem is it just doesnt seem to work properly. Everything seems to clean cut and efficent, tonally there are times when this movie gets it all wrong, playing out more like a spagetti western than an American gangster flick. Brian De Palma does a wonderful job of creating some excellent set pieces, most notably the train station stair case sequence, where a shoot out entangles the lives of innocent people, gangsters, cops and a baby in a buggy, its a notorious scene, executed well but on further inspection of it, everything just fits together to easily. Bodies just happen to be in front of the buggy every time a shot is fired anywhere near, Costner happens to have an invisable shield round him, as he in involved in a sea of bullets. Its times like this that show the double edged angle of this film, it wants to be more but just cant seem to get over the hurdle. The look and feel is excellent, even in Ennio Moricone's score can some times feel dated and hammy at points, the costume and locations are all lush and fantastic, the cinematography for the most part is innovative and well executed. There is however just not enough strong cement to hold it together and in parts the film has no idea what it truely wants to be. That being said, with slick pacing, decent character actors and a wealth of tense set pieces, this film is extremely enjoyable, if not quite the gritty crime drama you would expect.",

Ness's main priority is to ensure the people of Chicago that he will do his outmost, in the line of duty, to bring evil mobster Al Capone to justice, whatever the cost. He approaches an elderly and well-experienced police officer, played by Sean Connery. He's called Malone and Malone decides to use his talents to assist Ness with the best advantage he could possibly gain, to overthrow Capone and restore justice. They recruit two other reliable members called Oscar Wallace and George Stone, they're played by Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia. Robert De Niro makes brief appearances as Capone.\n\nThe Untouchables is a great movie, with great actors. Connery stole the show with his mismatched performance as Malone. Brian De Palma's directing in the movie was fair, but I think his direction needed a bit of effort. The writing is ok as well, but still it needed a bit of effort.

Sean Connery is memorable in his Oscar-winning performance. He helps build a character lively that is full of fire. It is not perfect though, for all the strong points, it has it still fails to develop a potentially interesting set of characters. Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro are not as lucky as Connery with their characters. They do not develop the depth or personality, and the writing does not give them same opportunity to spread their wings. I want more from Elliot Ness and his family life; maybe get into his back-story to understand what drives him.

The acting is all great, it's full if good actors, and I was suprised to see Kevin Costner in this film, as he usually isn't in this type of movie.  The movie itself was well done, it was exciting, had some good action scenes, and some quoteable moments.  The action is good, although Capones men never seem to have the ability to hit anything unless their right in front of them, if they even pull the trigger before being killed.  But the movie is on the more gory bloody side compared to the movies of the day.  The films often suspenseful and sad at the right moments, however often predictable as well.  How much the movie follows what actually happened, I don't really know, but I can say that the idea of the four misfits taking down Al Capone in their own isn't the most believable.  However it does make for a great film, and it proves that nobody is untouchable.  Great movie about the mob in Chicago, and is a lot like an older Gangster Squad movie.",

            "content": "With a great cast lined up and Brian De Palma directing, The Unthouchable sounded like an entertaining gangster film.\n\nThe Untouchables ended up as a somewhat entertaining film, but I found that it was rather faulty in many retrospects.\nThe general tone of The Untouchables may faze viewers. Although it should be a gritty and tense film, the nature of the film feels a bit too lighthearted to be truly intense and thrilling. I felt like I was reading a Dick Tracy comic book when watching The Untouchables becuase while the film was entertaining, the fast pace of the project and heavy focus on style gave the film a certain unprecendented artificiality. The Untouchables was a stylish film, but sometimes it felt as if is a comic book film which intends to be a crime drama but ends up feeling more like a Dick Tracy inspired film with elements of western cinema and crime drama instead of staying singularly as a gritty crime drama like it should for a story about Al Capone. I guess what I'm saying is that Brian De Palma clearly had an eye for great imagery when he directed The Untouchables, but he is really so focused on style that it even feels a bit like some kind of superhero adventure at times due to the visual style and the musical score.\nEnnio Morricone's musical score evokes a mixed response from me. I am a fan of the man and have loved his music for many years, and in The Untouchables it was not an exception as it was beauitifully crafted. But a lot of the time it does not seem to fit the mood of the scene that it is in. Occasionally in some of the very emotional moments, the music is great, but in many of the others the nature of the music is too lighthearted by nature to really have the correct mood of the moments. One example is the scene in which the titular untouchables make a bust at a bridge. The nature of the scene looks like it is straight from a western film while the music sounds as if it is from an adventure movie. The mix between adventure and western in this scene does not honestly grasp the intended gritty nature of The Untouchables, and in other scenes it is similarly strange. So the style of the film has some issues to it, and Brian De Palma's direction does not echo the same gritty nature that he executed on the gangster masterpiece Scarface. If you mixed the original 1932 Scarface with Warren Beatty's 1990 film adaptation of Dick Tracy, you would end up with something along the lines of The Untouchables, and I guess I was not prepared for Brian De Palma's approach to the subject matter and the way that he took on a style over substance approach to the film. In short, The Untouchables is a lot more about glamour over grit and so it lacks the dramatic impact of the more powerful gangster films that proceed it, and as Roger Ebert put it \" the movie seems more interested in the era than in the war\", and there is so much focus on style that the entire time watching The Untouchables I was very aware that a film was playing.\nLastly, Robert De Niro's portrayal of Al Capone is an issue. It is not so much because of his performance which is routine yet effective, but becuase of the fact that the structure of the plotting makes it feel cut off from the rest of the film. He comes and goes with  various moments in the film which do not last all that long, and he never really gets tied into the story. Despite being the man behind the war, he feels distant from it as if his actual relevance to the war is not that key. It seems that the filmmakers forgot him to be the cause of the Prohibition war and never really display his relavance to the story all that directly. The scenes with Robert De Niro do not really display the harsh reality of Al Capone as a gangster and therefore do not reveal the volatile nature of him as a criminal, resorting to focusing more on the thugs that he hid behind than the role he actually played in it all. The Untouchables is a story about Eliot Ness and his war on bringing down Al Capone, but the lack of focus on Al Capone ends up leaving The Untouchables feeling like a movie more focused on the idea of gangsters than on the gansters themselves.\nSo The Untouchables is not the best example of storytelling. It has the appeal of its visual elements such as the fact that it has thoroughly detailed production design and great scenery to echo the look of Chicago during its prohibition era, and it has old fashioned cars cruising down the streets and fancy costumes to deck its characters out in. It is all captured with great cinematography which follows a style which feels like a mix of classical and western camera techniques to capture the scale of the events. Visually, The Untouchables has problems but it really looks good. And the visual style of the film plays over well into the action scenes which are very entertaining. They play out like western shootouts, and althoughit isn't the right mood for the film, it is still entertaining. The action in The Untouchables is crafted greatly, filmed and edited well without skimping on the blood.\nAnd the script doesn't have perfect story focus, but it does have a lot of snappy dialogue for the actors to work with. Though the cast tends to be a bit hit and miss in the end.\nKevin Costner's performance is lacking in charisma. Although he fits the role well physically and is convincing decked up in his suit as well as the fact that he has a tense stare in him, his performance has the issue of feeling rather thinly sketched which means that he can only act it out as such from there. I watched his performance closely in The Untouchables and found that it seemed like somebody forget to tell Kevin Costner that he was not in a western movie. You wouldn't be able to tell based on certain elements of the film's style, but yeah, THe Untouchables is not a cowboy movie. Kevin Costner acts like it is, and although his western archetype has a certain extent of appeal to it, it is just not one of his better performances. Kevin Costner does the job just barely, but he really does not put much energetic spirit into his line delivery which makes his appeal as the lead limited. Kevin Costner cannot branch out all that much for his leading performance in The Untouchables. Kevin Costner stands, but delivering is a challenge for him.\nRobert De Niro has a similar problem with his performance as Al Capone. As well as being stuck with a character that does not connect to the story well, Robert De Niro portrays Al Capone in such a generic way that it is familiar of essentially all his performances in any other crime film ever made, especially ones when he worked with Martin Scorsese. He looks the part well, but he plays it out in a way that has been seen too many times before. If Bob Hoskins had taken the role, who knows what might have happened. But I can tell you for certain that I would have enjoyed it more as it would show him branching out. Robert De Niro on the other hand is as familiar at playing a Gangster as John Wayne is at playing a cowboy. So The Untouchables was not ideal as a front for Robert De Niro because there is little spirit in the role, and since the character is damaged by the structure of the film's plotting, there is reLly not much he can do to save it.\nAs viewers will have learned from literally every film where Sean Connery was meant to portray someone that was not Scottish, the man has no talent for accents. When Andy Garcia refers to Sean Connery as an \"Irish Pig\", all I was thinking was \"there is no way that he could be any less Irish.\" Yet as usual, it is hard to be bothered by it, although it is pretty funny that he ended up winning an Academy Award for the role. I'm not saying he didn't deserve it, I'm jsut saying that the Academy rewarding a man who cannot do an accent is actually pretty funny. Still, his performance is the best of the film. He has a humane spirit to him which he combines with his  natural heroism that  delivers a firm spirit to the character. He is able to just build his performance up from there because he incorporates in a tense line delivery which suffers only slightly from his inability to do a good Irish accent. Sean Connery succeeds at holding the grit of the film right in his palm with a burning tenacity and he brings his distinct charm to the role without problem which makes him a genial presence in the film. Sean Connery is spot on in The Untouchables, and if the other actors were as dedicated to the film as he was then maybe it would have turned out better. At least he got some recognition for the part.\nAndy Garcia makes a powerful supporting effort because he shows off some of the natural crime-themed charisma which would later score him an Academy Award nomination in The Godfather Part III where he was one of the best aspects of the film, and Charles Martin Smith has an entertaining heroism to him.\n\nSo The Untouchables looks good and boasts an Academy Award winning performance from Sean Connery, but the lack of grit in the film in favour of directional approach which is heavy in style but light in nature ends up making it a film which has visual appeal but not storytelling strength.",

The movie has a sense of sophistication and class to it with its subtle use of comedy and the Armani suits donned by the characters. The star of this movie is Sean Connery as Jim Malone, who delivers some very iconic dialogues. He knows how to get around the law and with his unorthodox technique he plays a vital part in trying to arrest Capone. He calls it the \"Chicago way.\" \n \t\tThe movie is full of ups and downs and the background score really accentuates the suspense and thrill of this vastly engaging movie. The film captures the spirit of Chicago in the 1920s. Robert De Niro makes a fantastic villain and he has a sense of pride and arrogance about him, which can be associated with Capone. The cinematography in certain scenes gives the viewer a sense of anticipation, such as the scene when the man is peering into Jim Malone's house. \n\t\t\"The Untouchables\" is an engaging movie, which will have everyone at the edge of their seats for two hours.",

Now, I'm aware this is based off of a true story but films always like to stretch the truth but if this is how the real people acted, then I'm not to argue. Connery was great however, I can see why he got an Oscar and I'm glad he did, although out of his impressive body of work he got it for this? At least he got it! Like I said, I also didnt like the group or felt it to be a little unbelievable, again, I'm aware this is based on a true story but even in real life a group of four with a nerdy guy as one of them it seemed like the whole thing was just going to be a failure.

In the process he must watch his, his companions and his family's backs or suffer the harsh reality of the Chicago streets.\n\nThe first main problem that lead to cheesiness is the score. It's so bloody terrible. With booming orchestras that remind you of a western followed by an electric synth/horn jazz remix, the music is horribly distracting and overwhelms a good chunk of the scenes. I could have taken it more seriously if it had the subtlety (yes subtlety) of Goodfellas, but with the cacophonous score I just can't.\n\nThe cheesiness doesn't end there. Some of the speeches characters give don't come off as effective as the writer would like, not because of the actors, but because of the stupid analogies or catchphrases. It's hard to take Capone seriously when he's rambling about prize fighting for no reason. While there are genuinely intense and suspenseful scenes, there are plenty of outrageous scenes that leave you with tonal whiplash. From the intensity of a baby and mass shooting to Kevin Costner catching a gun and Andy Garcia stopping the carriage with his leg, it's not a smooth transition.\n\nSpeaking of shitty transitions, the editing in this movie is all over the place. I know this is a snob complaint, but there are many rough cuts and inconsistencies in the editing. The dubbing is absolute shit too, which is a pet peeve of mine. To be fair, the second half of the movie got better (probably because of the second editor).\n\nNow that I've complained, lets talk about the good stuff (which we all know isn't as fun). If you can get past the cheesiness that may or may not be there, then there is an engaging story to be had. The story develops at a good pace and even though we all know how it ends, the journey is still an exciting one. The acting is stupendous, Shaun Connery being his usual big badass (although I don't know if it was Oscar worthy). DeNiro does an okay Capone, but he still is very DeNiro. It's not an intense emotional drama like Goodfellas or The Godfather, since it's from the police perspective, but it does have it's fair share of character drama.\n\nThe Untouchables is a fun and engaging cops and robbers movie, but it's \"classic\" status is up to question. That's not to say you shouldn't watch it, just that I'm too much of a snob. For the first movie I've seen since moving to Chicago, it's a pretty good one. The Untouchables is available on Netflix, Amazon Instant, Google Play, itunes and Blockbuster (OH WAIT!).\nRead more reviews at mentalmultiverse.wordpress.com",

De Palma invokes Hitchock, as he usually does, and it pays him back ten fold. The film is tight, tense, and entertaining, and even Costner does a pretty good job. \n\nFor more movie reviews visit: www.reelfive.com",

            "content": "The Untouchables- 4.5/5\n\nBrian De Palma's The Untouchables is unlike any other suspense thriller movie I've ever seen, and having the story based upon a dangerous Mafia head it also adds the extra bit of excitement to it which makes it one of the most realistic yet entertaining suspense movie's I've seen which keeps the audience glued to there seats throughout the course of the movie. The Untouchables is pacy, enthralling, entertaining and full of suspense which keeps you at the edge of you're seat and constently wondering about what the next sequence will be and the brilliance from all around, especially the cast who have all done a sublime job especially the superb Connery who was the best supporting actor one could ever wish for, a unique yet realistic story about how good prevails over evil and some amazing presentation by Director Brian De Palma who has detailed the movie perfectly and made it in a subtle yet entertaining manner which ensures that The Untouchables remains as one of the best suspense-thriller's ever made.\n\nThe Story is based upon the novel written by Oscar Fraley and Eliot Ness is showing the year 1930 Chicago where dangerous mafia leader Al Capone(Robert De Niro) has made Chicago almost like his own city and dominates the drug/ illegal products dealing scene and Treasury Officer Eliot Ness takes it on his own to bring him down and send him to jail for his innumerous crimes. But after finding out that most of his allies are all corrupted by Capone, he decides to make a team of his own in his accountant-friend Agent Oscar Wallace(Charles Smith Martin Smith), an anti-corrupt officer who turns out to be his greatest asset named Jim Malone( Sean Connery) and a young up-and coming officer George Stone( Andy Garcia) and makes it his task to put Capone in jail, but his journey towards it is a very difficult one as he finds out how much corrupted the people he knows can get.\n\nThe Acting Cast in the movie was chosen very wisely and perfectly by Brian De Palma, because all the actor's who portray there character's are almost like made for these kind of characters. Kevin Costner was the main protagonist in the movie as the Treasury Officer Elliot Ness who is adamant on putting Al Capone behind bars, and he did the role quite perfectly and he is a quite perfect choice for a good cop, because he excels in these kinds of roles and he imperfected the role of Ness. Sean Connery was possible more influencial in the movie than Costner portraying the anti-corruptible Jim Malone, and he portrays the character of an old justical policeman so well that he is more of a protagonist than Costner and with sublime dialogues with a bit of sarcasm at times, he almosts guides Costner in the movie. He was a brilliant support for Costner in the movie and excelled Costner's performance as well as perfected his, and he probably deserved his Oscar that year. Robert De Niro is almost meant for roles such of the mafia head, and he again excels so easily portraying the ruthless Al Capone, and his ability to dish out brilliant and sarcastic dialogues at one point and then kill a man on another is so marvelous that you think that he really is Al Capone and he again shows why he is given so many roles of Mafia Leaders in numerous movies. The Rest of the cast also did a great job in portraying there respective characters and I especially loved the acting of Andy Garcia and Billy Drago, one who is a brash young-cop and another who is ruthless right hand man of Capone.\n\nNow Brian De Palma really deserves A Lot Of credit for his presentation of The Untouchables, because not only has he made a brilliant suspense-thriller which shows the victory of the good guys against the corrupted one's( a thing which Is shown in a subtle yet entertaining way), it is also very influencial for film-makers deciding to make movies in this type of genre in the future because The Untouchables is not only brilliant in the acting and story aspect but the technical aspects of it are also very sound and quite futuristic. He showed the dark side of Chicago at that time brilliantly and some of the action scene including a slow-motion action scene really mesmerized me by thinking how much devotion he gave to create such brilliant action scenes. He made sure that the technical aspects of the movie we're also spot on and chose a brilliant crew which in turn repaid with an amazing movie.\n\nThe Story which I presume is about the events which happened in 1930, Chicago in which the real Eliott Ness took down Al Capone is written by Eliott Ness and Oscar Fraley is a brilliant look at the level of domination and power Al Capone had at the time and how he corrupted any one he wanted except for the Untouchables. The Screenplay is also a brilliant one, containing some really amazing and sarcastic dialogues which are quite pleasing to hear and the dialogues throughout the movies were brilliant, and the screenplay was very well scripted and shown which was duely delivered by the cast. Credit goes to David Marmet for writing the screenplay and dialogues for the movie which really well showed the brilliant and realistic story written by Ness and Fraley.\n\nThe Cinematography in this movie is quite brilliant and the camerawork throughout the course of the movie was superbly handled. Some of the camerawork in the movie are really well shown in an almost futuristic way with some of those action scenes and the credit goes to Cinematographer Stephen H.Burum for presenting some really good camerawork in the movie. Although there isn't much special effects shown in this film, some of the scenes(specially the action scenes) are really well detailed with some special effects such as slow-motion which really took me aback seeing it in a movie which was made in the 1980's! Even the costume design and makeup in this movie is so spot on and its visible that De Palma has used the best of what was available, because of the costume's my rating went from 8.5 to 9. Even the Art direction team has done an amazing job in showing the 1930 Chicago and it's surrounding in a dark time, so credit goes to them too. Credit goes to the visual effects team and costume design team who have contributed a lot to the movie and made sure that it's a hit on the technical aspects as well.\n\nThe Background Music throughout the course of the movie was quite fantastic as the different type's of music used such as classical music as well as music from other genre's was really well synchronized with the sequences and it really brought that right kind of tone to the atmosphere of each scene, and the music used in the action sequences was really good. Credit goes to music director Ennio Morricone for delivering such sublime different types of music throughout the course of the movie which really up-ed the level of the sequences.\n\nThe Untouchables was a real delight to watch because of the way it was presented, that kind of subtle yet entertaining and enthralling presentation of this suspense-thriller regarding the downfall of one of the most dangerous mafia criminals of all time was presented superbly by Director Brian De Palma who was supported superbly by his acting cast and remaining staff and in turn made one of the best suspense-thrillers of all time which has that realism and uniqueness to it and The Untouchables is definitely a movie which can be entertaining for all kind of public.",

            "content": "The Untouchables is a powerful, entertaining classic cops vs criminals drama. Kevin Costner, who plays as an officer named Eliot Ness, brings together a small group of agents to take down the gangster Al Capone in the Prohibition-era Chicago. Sure, it's historically inaccurate, and it's an exaggerated retelling of the events that actually happened, but all is forgiven thanks to its great performances from everyone (Particularly Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro), its stylized but entertaining action sequences, and Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. I was glued to the screen for nearly every moment of the movie, and the way the suspense was handled was great, and never kept me anywhere less than engaged to the story. \n\nThe acting from everyone is great too, and Kevin Costner does his role well, Sean Connery gives a strong, likable performance, and De Niro plays Al Capone pretty much flawlessly, with multiple breathtaking scenes. The amount of action is not little nor excessive, and perfectly fits into the plot without disrupting anything or making it feel over the top. Ennio's score really adds to the film because it gives the film a great 1930s feel to it, and sets the mood and intensity of scenes that wouldn't be anywhere as good without it. It has enough substance so it's not completely devoid of intellect, and the characters are developed enough to the point where you at least care about the characters. It has many memorable scenes, especially one regarding a staircase (which I won't spoil).\n\n It doesn't boast incredible depth or anything extraordinary, so don't expect something like The Godfather, but has a satisfying and entertaining enough plot along with a great cast that helps make what could've been a somewhat sprawling drama, into a very good, classic cops vs Al Capone thriller from the amazing Brian DePalma, with its great (if inaccurate) look at the Prohibition-era.",

Interestingly, despite Connery delivering an Oscar-winning performance, Empire voted his accent the worst in film history. There is some consensus that the film drags out slightly in the second half, but with a couple of twists and turns later on, the viewer is left satisfied, and therefore I gave it 83 out of 100 (4 stars here).\r\n\r\nhttp://toptwofifty.wordpress.com",

Unfortunately, over the top performances (Robert De Niro) and cheesy dialouge ruin what could have been a great addition to the genre. The movie is undoubtedly entertaining but not too much else. Brian De Palma isn't exactly a great director, but he manages to make a pretty enjoyable film. What could have been terrific ends up being average with 2 good performances from Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. Other than that, I never understood the hype towards this film. Sure some action scenes were cool, however The Untouchables is a film that is built on clich\u00c3 (C)s and relies solely on entertainment to make up for it. If your looking for a great gangster flick, check out The Godfather Trilogy and/or Goodfellas. The Untouchables isn't the best in the genre, but nonetheless enjoyable for what it is.",

The Untouchables would have benefited from showing more perspective from Capone and inside his organisation. The soundtrack was peculiar as well, the best example being when they go to bust a deal on the Canadian border and there is a constant western hero theme playing throughout. More things like cops and gangsters shooting without taking cover and never getting hit certainly removes a sense of realism. \n\nIt didn't get lower because I never got bored and the setting of prohibition and Al Capone is strong enough to carry it through. Even though I have started to expect the unexpected through watching so many Mafia/gangster films and TV shows, there are still some scenes in here that create good shock value. \n\nA better cast and director could have created a classic here.

The horribly uninspiring/corny soundtrack does not help. However some aspects of the film are masterfully done. Connery is outstanding as a supporting role. The main issue I have though is The Untouchables feels more like a broadway play that was recorded than an actual film, at least by the style of acting and script the cast was directed to perform. The cinematography is also nothing special for the most part. Mediocre angles. The Untouchables will either be seen as a classic that was made with the intention of feeling very dated or a decent gangster flick released in the shadowing and intimidating post era of 70's greatness.",

While the film did take some liberties with what really happened, that's irrelevant, De Palma creates a stunning piece of screen entertainment that will never age. In 1930, Al Capone (Robert De Niro) has control of Chicago, bring in liqour and alcohol from Canada during the Prohibition. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) comes to Chicago to bring down Capone, but he finds it difficult because of corrupt policemen, but Ness finds one honest cop, Jim Malone (Sean Connery) to work with, he convinces Ness to get a team from the police academy, who haven't been influenced by Capone, and they go with George Smith (Andy Garc\u00eda) and accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). They declare war on Capone's empire, but Capone fights back and makes it personal. It's a great piece of entertainment, and it's brilliantly filmed and has an unusual yet fitting score by Ennio Morricone. It's got some brilliant performances, and Mamet's script has some brilliant dialogue, and it's cast act it out superbly. It's a great crime thriller.",

A very slick telling of the story of Eliot Ness; his team of \u00e2~Untouchables\u00e2(TM) and their fight to bring down 1930\u00e2(TM)s Chicago gangland leader, Al Capone. I have the impression an awful lot of poetic licence was used here, but then I guess the idea is to make it entertaining after all! Here\u00e2(TM)s a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nIt\u00e2(TM)s 1930 and Chicago is virtually the property of gangsters like Al Capone (Robert De Niro). They have the police, the courts and all the city officials in their pocket giving them free reign to peddle illicit booze and drugs (prohibition was still in force then). Enter Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) who has vowed to rid the city of these parasites, and in particular Capone. He soon finds that a corrupt police force is no help and so recruits a small group who are incorruptible (or Untouchable as the title suggests). The group members are Ness (of course), Jim Malone (Sean Connery), Treasury Agent Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and Agent George Stone (Andy Garcia). They begin a violent campaign, taking down Capone\u00e2(TM)s empire piece by piece but there is never any evidence linking Capone directly to anything illegal. They eventually come across a ledger that may give them the break they need, but it\u00e2(TM)s encoded and the guy that wrote it is heavily guarded\u00e2\u00a6 I\u00e2(TM)ll leave it there or I may say too much.\n\nAll the performance are excellent, I think Sean Connery got an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone. I thought Robert De Niro was particularly good as Capone and Kevin Costner did a very decent job as Ness. I hadn\u00e2(TM)t realised that the score was written by Ennio Morricone, and now I know that I also know why I like it so much. The film itself is very well made with some quite memorable set pieces and some nicely phrased dialogue. It\u00e2(TM)s quite an adventure although I\u00e2(TM)m not entirely sure about its historical accuracy. As a piece of entertainment though, it does a very good job and I found it well worth a viewing.\n\nSteelMonster\u00e2(TM)s verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.0/10",

There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.That isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.Overall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol Bad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie. From the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene. The elevator scene is pretty good. Not the train station scene, here bad guy's aim just sucks. 2) BAD MUSIC 3) BAD DIRECTION,4) LAZY WRITING.... That's it !",

Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction forThis film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement \u200b\u200bhad to arrest Al Capone, Chicago's biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was \"Scarface\"), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (\"The Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people.",

Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.The Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.But what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think \"The Untouchables\" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.The issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.It would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.The end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.The Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.(8.5/10)",

DeNiro as Al Capone is really quite sinister and its certainly a pretty gripping film in general. I was aware of the general story but not all the details and so I found this, I suppose, an insightful watch, although I can't be sure how accurate it is. There was one long scene set in I think Grand Central station, feautring a mother and a pram, that really did have me right at the edge of my seat. I thought the use of incidental music was quite well judged too - not too little and not too over the top. There are some nice settings/locations too. I would definitely recommend this film, yes.",
