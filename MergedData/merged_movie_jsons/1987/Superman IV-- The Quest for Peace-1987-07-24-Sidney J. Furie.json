            "content": "In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale.",

            "content": "Superman Turns \"Peacenik\" could be another title to this film. Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most \"important\" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal \"peacenik,\" he was the kind you'd see out with a big \"peace sign\" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain \"Dr. Luthor\" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with \"Lois Lane\" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable. Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much \"bombed\" at the box office, at least compared to the others.It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. \"Superman\" deserved better.",

This is easily the worst of the SUPERMAN movies, and it was doomed to fail right from the start.  Cut from its original 134-minute version, it is full of plot holes resulting in a movie with some scenes that just don't make any sense, but even with the extra 45 minutes intact, the movie still wouldn't work because the special effects are cheap and ridiculous, and it shows. Unless you are a diehard fan of the Superman genre, this movie should be avoided.1 out of 5",

            "content": "Despite its reputation as the worst of the Superman movies, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is not. Despite the horrendous special effects and rushed ending, the film manages to still present itself with some respect.Christopher Reeves had proved in the three previous films his ability to convincingly play the role of Superman. With this film, he not only proves his abilities but this is, in many respects, his best performance in the role. His speeches during the film are a sign of this and his chemistry with all the other actors helps also. Reeves also does his best to sell the special effects sequences it is a shame he couldn't. Reeves is the films biggest saving grace and it's a shame this would be his last time in the role.Gene Hackman also returns in the role of Lex Luthor and with brings him that character's with, charm, and silent menace. But somehow he seems to be out of place most of the time and serves as a drawback in many of his scenes. Mark McClure, Jackie Cooper and Margot Kidder all return in their roles. But unfortunately they are all under used and their appearances might as well be cameos.The rest of the cast does a decent job. Mark Pillow does excellent in the role of Nuclear Man, Luthor's super powered creation. Pillow does the role so well that one wonders how much better eh might have been in the special effects had been better. Mariel Hemingway is a welcomed addition to the cast as a heiress who serves as an additional love interest for Clark Kent. The only major addition that doesn't fit is Jon Cryer who could easily be the single most annoying character to ever appear in a Superman movie.The film's real drawback is its low budget values. While this doesn't affect the majority of sets, the Fortress of Solitude set in particular looks cheap when compared to the one found in previous films. The same can also be said of the Daily Planet set. The low budget would also hurt the film in the area a budget was needed most: special effects.The previous films, for all their flaws, at least had decent special effects and mostly convincing flying sequences and this film has neither. The special effects are sub-par by virtually any standard and despite being made nearly a decade after the first movie the effects from the first movie are still more convincing. The truly horrific nature of this films effect sequences can be seen during the climactic battles between Superman and Nuclear Man. The added addition of new powers with bad special effects doesn't help either.The other major problem is the pacing of the film. The first 50 minutes or so is sheer entertainment that's the set up the story of both Superman riding the world of nukes and Luthor's evil plan. The set up, however, is better then the execution of the ending, which is both rushed and disjointed. The subplots of Mariel Hemingway's character and the boy who inspired Superman's quest are both left unfinished for example. Whole scenes feel incomplete and the final battle is over far too quickly to be effective.But the film does have a saving grace in its concept. The idea of taking Superman, the ultimate hero of America, and placing him into the timely situation of Cold War disarmament is a stroke of utter brilliance. The concept of Luthor and Nuclear Man added to it also serve as an interesting addition to the story and it makes for good entertainment when viewed in this context. But this concept is ruined by the rushed feeling of the ending. But one still has to give high marks to Christopher Reeves and the screenwriters for their concept.The films does have another saving grace: its musical score. Like the Ken Thorne scores for II and III, Alexander Courage's score makes heavy use of the John Williams themes composed for the first film and is highly effective. The Courage adaptation never fails to use the Williams music to maximum effect and it's a shame that, at Courage's own request, it has yet to see release.Despite its flaws in special effects and editing, Superman IV has saving graces in Christopher Reeves, the rest of the cast, the music, and the timely nature of the story. While nowhere near as good as Superman The Movie or Superman II and while not as bad as Superman III, the film still serves its purpose and is your average Superman adventure.",

            "content": "I recently watched \"Superman IV\" for the first time since...well, 1987, I guess. How time flies.I thought the first half-hour was actually pretty good - not luminous, but fine. The hostile takeover of the Daily Planet is interesting, and I enjoyed Superman's moral dilemma about the nuclear missile situation (some reviews suggest that Superman is all gung-ho about disarming the world; in fact, he's initially quite reluctant to do so).But after that decent first half hour, the movie pretty much falls apart. The Daily Planet storyline is resolved abruptly and unconvincingly - I simply can't accept that Muriel Hemingway's character undergoes a total conversion from yellow journalist to an editor with integrity. What exactly inspires this change of heart, besides the fact that she's hot for stumbling, stupid Clark Kent? The nuclear missile plot is also glossed over. I'm not exactly sure why Superman decides to abandon his disarmament mission; just because Lex Luthor's given him some trouble, suddenly he's not in favor of world peace? The movie simply doesn't explore his decision-making processes thoroughly enough.Another strangely underdeveloped plot line is the sale of the Kent farm. In an early scene, we find out that a \"big developer\" is interested in buying the farm, but Clark would prefer to sell it to a small-time farmer. This is actually a pretty nice segment, pleasingly reminiscent of the first film, but it comes to absolutely nothing, as the sale of the farm is never mentioned again. Huh? Some of these plotting problems doubtless arise from the fact that about 40 minutes were chopped out of the film before its release. However, I've heard that a lot of the missing footage is devoted to action, so it probably plugs relatively few of the aforementioned plot gaps. Anyway, what really matters is that the theatrical release is semi-incomprehensible.The special effects are another big minus for the film. For example, the same terrible \"green screen\" shot of Superman flying toward the audience is reused about eight times, and it's so bad that you didn't even want to see it once. I know this film had a limited $17 million budget, but for goodness' sake, I've seen better special effects done on much smaller TV budgets.And yet...and yet...I can't bring myself to hate this movie. At a mere 90 minutes, it's much pacier (and more sincere) than the plodding, dreadful \"Superman III.\" Also, it's nice to see Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman back in substantial roles after they were basically ignored in the previous film. Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor is always pretty funny, even if he's playing it on auto-pilot; I particularly enjoy the moment when he lights his cigar using Nuclear Man's radioactive aura.I don't even object to the presence of Mariel Hemingway, who is strangely sexy in this movie - though somehow I feel obliged to point out that an actress with a one-scene cameo as a teacher is actually the prettiest woman in the whole thing.Even the much-maligned special effects have a certain campy charm. And, you know, Nuclear Man is cool in certain dumb ways; he gives Superman a tough fight, which makes him at least somewhat interesting. He looks ridiculous, of course, but I don't really sweat his mullet as much as everyone else does. (When are we going to get over this whole childish mullet obsession, anyway?) Despite this praise, I should note that, toward the ending of the movie, Nuclear Man flies into space carrying Hemingway...and she survives, despite the fact that she's not wearing a space suit. That complete lack of realism, attention to detail, whatever you want to call it - I guess that's typical of the whole movie. But I still get a laugh out of it.",

            "content": "\"Superman IV: Quest for Peace\" should have been renamed \"Superman IV: Quest for a Plot\" as the film's script is pure garbage...full of schmaltz, preachiness and so many things that simply are dumb and make little sense. It's also a film that clearly shows the limits of special effects, as even with 1980s technology the film should have looked so much better--especially since it's about the most effects-laden Superman film up to that time.The story is full of saccharine when the entire planet stops to take notice of some little boy who writes to Superman to request that he bring about world peace! Superman, never wanting to disappoint any child, responds by destroying the world's nuclear stockpile. However, Lex Luthor disguises one of the nuclear missiles as just a garden variety nuclear bomb when really it's infused with some Superman DNA. So, when the missile is tossed into the sun, it naturally produces an evil Krytonian who is bent on killing Superman and working for Luthor. Can our incredibly plastic hero destroy this evil menace AND balance two women...one who is beautiful and loves Clark and another who's an idiot who STILL can't understand that Clark and Superman are the same freaking guy!!While the story is saccharine and stupid and the special effects quite bad, the film team do manage to also make the acting terrible- -even by Superman standards. The standout in this department is Jon Cryer-- who really can act. But given the bilge the writers (a room full of baboons, I think), he comes off as simply annoying and hateful. The rest, by the way, aren't much better.So do I recommend this film? Yes and no. No if you want to see a decent film. Yes if you are either using it to torture someone or if you are a glutton for punishment, like me, and occasionally enjoy laughing at Hollywood stars destroying themselves. A little schadenfreude is what's needed to enjoy this picture, that's for sure.",

The movie has obviously been cut from its original length make it incoherent at times.

Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.The movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... \"The less said about Superman IV the better.\"Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.The effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.There are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!When I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.I will give this film 5 out of 10.It's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career.

            "content": "Superman 1 was such a classic movie, and 2 was almost as great - Superman 3 is not a great Superman movie, but as a piece of '80s American comedy / spoof it succeeds and has some very memorable scenes (notably Chris Reeve as the evil Superman). But Part 4 is just an awful film overall with few redeeming qualities. Reeve's admirable storyline works well, and the double date scene with Superman & Clark is very entertaining (similar to the style of Superman III). But it's when Superman IV tries to get serious and exciting in its action sequences that it fails miserably and becomes a cheesey, ridiculous farce that only succeeds in showing how pointless it was to make the film on such a small budget. The story's not bad and if Donner was directing and you had 100 million dollars you could do it now and create a great adventure movie with some classic comedy scenes and some exciting action sequences. But anyway, it's too late. For all its failings, every time you see it, it's still fairly watchable, mainly because you're always expecting it to magically be better this time around. It's not as bad as everyone makes out and far more creative and original on a 16 million budget than what Batman and Robin did with 100 million! If Batman and Robin's a 3 out of 10, then Superman IV's a 6 out of 10.",

With major budget cuts (from $28 to $16m) and story problems, the moviemakers suddenly found themselves cutting corners in all areas. And it shows. Completely lacking in awe, fun and excitement, Superman IV most of all feels like a bad joke. The fact that it comes across more cartoonish than the previous three is hardly intentional, as everything - from effects to dialogue - just seems oddly rushed and second-rate.The only highlight is Gene Hackman - who returns in high spirits as Lex Luthor. Christopher Reeve co-scripted this time and he again personifies the Man of Steel. But most of his co-stars are either wasted (Mariel Hemingway) or hysterical (John Cryer). The new villian, Nuclear Man (as played by Mark Pillow), looks like a Swedish showwrestler in a home-made Halloween suit, complete with mullet hair and horrendous over-acting mannerisms. Director Sidney J. Furie (the man behind the otherwise taut thriller The Entity) seems unable to create any sparks and Superman IV falls completely flat, head first. Game over.Note: Certain scenes had to be borrowed from the previous movies, most notably Superman and Lois on their romantic evening flight above the Manhattan skyline. How they even managed to make this scene look worse than in the original is really mind-boggling.",

            "content": "After an absence of four years, along with Christopher Reeve's initial determination he was done with the blue and red tights after Superman III, the Superman franchise was brought back to life for one more entry, but after the release of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, it's unfortunate that everyone involved hadn't just decided to let things alone. Superman IV is a complete disaster on almost every level, a silly, cheesy and downright cheap looking poor excuse for a film that manages to rank among the worst comic book adaptation films of all time, bested only by such \"winners\" as The Return of Swamp Thing and the direct-to-video Captain America.Superman IV finds our hero, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve), selling off his family farm after his mother has died between performing his normal super duties. He returns to Metropolis to discover that the Daily Planet has been taken over by tabloid king David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemmingway) and are turning it into a salacious rag sheet. Shortly after the takeover, a young boy writes Superman a letter, via the Daily Planet, and asks him for assistance in solving the arms crisis by removing all nuclear weapons from the Earth. Superman initially refuses, taking the stance that he cannot interfere in human affairs (although how this relates to his other helping of humanity is a puzzler). Eventually, Superman changes his mind and begins ridding the world of all nuclear weapons by tossing them into the sun.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has escaped from prison with the assistance of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer), and hatched a devious scheme: to create a new super villain to defeat Superman by taking a sample of Superman's DNA recovered from a museum exhibit featuring a single hair from Superman's head and attaching it and a computer to the side of one of the missiles that are hurled into the sun by Superman and thus creating Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman), a being with the power of Superman, the voice of Lex Luthor, plus more abilities, powered by the sun. The two match off, but has Superman finally met his rival? It's not really surprising that Superman IV is terrible movie, considering it was produced by The Canon Group, who may never have released what you could label a \"good\" movie when they existed in the '80s. And Superman IV is not a good movie. It has an intriguing concept at it's heart, Superman ridding the world of nuclear devices, but everything around that central idea is just a complete mess. The script by Laurence Konner and Mark Rosenthal is borderline insipid, featuring some extreme gaps in logic that cause the audience to have to accept some absolutely ridiculous contrivances and just asinine ideas. Superman tosses a missile containing Nuclear Man's basic building blocks into the sun. And how is that not all fried by the sun? Okay, maybe the Superman genetic material may not be (although I don't know if it was ever stated he is able to withstand even the sun), but the computer that will supposedly give Nuclear Man form, along with the barest shreds of material that suddenly grow into clothes to cover his body? Please. And how does he get Lex's voice? Late in the film, a human character is carried into space by Nuclear Man with no oxygen or protective suit, and survives. The complete contempt for the audience the script shows is inexcusable.With Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) still pulling a mostly supporting role, the writers attempt to inject Lacy as a new love interest, with her eye on Clark instead of Superman. They also try to generate a triangle between them, but none of it works. There is no chemistry between Lacy and Clark, and much of what was there between Superman and Lois seems to be gone or on life support. Yeah, Lex Luthor is back, but he is nowhere near as engaging as he was in Superman and Superman II. Hackman does the best he can with his questionable material, but there is no saving it.Many of the outstanding aspects of the previous films are just shoddy this time around. The special effects are abysmal, with many generic elements of Superman flying reused over and over again and almost none of it is believable. The action sequences, what few there are, are unspectacular and barely raise your pulse. The film, on the whole, has a rushed and half-complete feeling to it, and you get the impression you are watching a movie made on the cheap, not the latest sequel to a successful, multi-million dollar grossing franchise.So, after close to ten years and three sequels, Supeman IV is able to do what Lex Luthor could never accomplish: it brought the Man of Steel down, and left him tattered. It would take almost two decades for Superman to fly again, and we can only hope that the next entry is worth your time, because this one wasn't.",

This is not true. Yes, for a human to fly in space, they would have to survive being burned up leaving Earth's atmosphere, then survive the vacuum of space (in other words, two people would have been dead by the end of the movie). However, let's revisit the 1978 original, in which the Man of Steel flies around the world, making it spin backwards, which also makes time reverse. If that really happened, every living thing and object on the planet's face would be flung off into the cold depths of space.I won't linger on this anymore. Yes, \"The Quest for Peace\" has unbearable dialogue (in places), but it's classic Superman-- the cheese, the cheap effects, and the general cartoon feel. Plus, it does have Jon Cryer, in what is oddly his best performance of all time (you'd better believe it), and a solid message people still need to think about. In other words, come to believe a man can fly, stay for the inherent message of the movie: we would have to be very stupid to nuke our own planet.",

The 1978 original is one of my all time favorite films, while sitting through this one at the movies was like getting a root canal without the novocain. Special effects were horrible as well as character development and plot line. How could any studio head or those involved with the final print of this film feel comfortable with the finished project?Talk about a film that rode on the popularity of its predecessors and failed to live up to any expectations that fans of the earlier films had. This movie certainly was the nail in the coffin as far as the Christopher Reeve Superman films go. And for what it's worth I fall in the category that feels Superman 3 was better than this mess.

            "content": "If you've read my reviews of the previous Superman films you'll know that I have nothing but praise for them. Well, I have praise for this film as well.Firstly, Nuclear Man is an awesome villain and probably the scariest supervillain I've ever seen. And it was good to see Gene Hackman back as the evil but likeable Lex Luthor.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) This is a movie with an interesting theme. A young boy asks Superman to rid the world of nuclear weapons which Superman does. However, at the end of the film Superman attends a press conference and tells the press that world peace is not a gift that he can give-humanity will have to work for it. He also pinches a quote from an American president (I don't know which one) by telling the world that, \"There will be world peace one day because the people of the world are going to want it so badly that their governments are going to have no choice but to give it to them.\" True words eh? Anyway, I thought Superman's speech at the press conference was a nice touch to the film and it gave out a strong message-that peace must be worked for.Back to the film now-the battles between Superman and Nuclear Man were great. Does Superman beat Nuclear Man with his fists? No he doesn't. Once again he uses his brain to defeat Nuclear Man.This was a great movie which I had the pleasure of seeing at the cinema in 1987 and I really can't understand why it has been criticized so badly over the years. It was a great movie. I wish there would have been a Superman V and there probably would have been if the excellant Christopher Reeve hadn't suffered his awful accident in 1995.Chris Reeve is the definitive Superman",

Otherwise, I would have to rank it as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Superman III was an unmitigated disaster but still had some decent moments. It's successor, however, is completely and utterly irredeemable. The storyline is recycled and lethargic, and you can feel the lack of interest from the cast. Even at just 90 minutes long, the film is painfully slow-moving and feels like its never going to end.The coup de grace of Superman IV is the introduction of Nuclear Man, who is, by some distance, the single worst villain I have ever seen in a movie. I simply don't have words to describe how awful this character is. Mark Pillow is either a comic genius or literally the worst actor of all-time.Christopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and one of my personal heroes. His book 'Still Me' is one of the most powerful things I have ever read and I have given copies to almost everyone I know. It pains me deeply to award one of his films the dreaded 1/10 but I have no choice. This movie is truly horrific and a blight on the reputation of everyone involved.",

And that girl Lucy, somehow could breathe in space, not to mention, is it a good idea to hurl nuclear missiles at the sun? Well, Superman is still struggling to keep his identity, which miraculously no one has still caught onto yet, and they even changed how he makes people forget if they've seen the real him. Well, Lucy, the big time Daddy's girl is now the publisher at the newspaper company that Louis and Clark are at. When they receive a letter from a little boy asking Superman to destroy all nuclear missiles to save the world, but Superman has a bigger problem when Lex Luther escapes and makes Nuclear Man, a man who is as equally strong, with one flaw, he needs the sun to keep up.Superman IV isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't made too well, and it didn't seem too well thought out. Christopher Reeve also just seemed tired of doing Superman, it just wasn't his best. But if you are looking to finish the Superman series, then be my guest, but otherwise, I'd recommend to stay away, because it's not that well thought out.4/10",

A nicely-toned return to the Lois-Clark-Superman relationship also could have rooted the film back to its glorious predecessors - bar number three - but once Nuclear Man shows up and the film's story is cut in half, all promise and potential disappears from the project and the audience is left with a strictly mediocre re-tread of Superman II.",

Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is back to his nefariously hilarious ways, Christopher Reeve (Clark/Superman) is again the stoic, righteous hero he is meant to be, and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) is back in her enthusiastic mode. -Also, the storyline is, in all actuality, probably the closest in form to the old Superman comics than any of the other films. In trying to rid the world of nuclear warfare, Superman takes the type of moral and ethical stand he is known for in his legacy. A very moving politically-charged plot along the lines of Rocky IV and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.The Bad:-The special effects in this film were terrible. The flights, although I didn't notice any stray wires, were not as majestic as the first two films, while it was often much too easy to distinguish the matte background (like in space with no stars!). Plus, instead of really cool effects, the FX crew instead goes hokey, epitomized by Superman's \"visual rebuilding\" of the Great Wall of China that is just plain stupid. -However, the pacing of the film is really what bogs the movie down. Many scenes were cut from the film in post-production, making the plot a bit herky-jerky and confusing. Halfway through the film, the plot is steadily progressing. Then, suddenly, Superman begins his fight with Nuclear Man, which essentially lasts the entire second half of the movie.So, despite a more inspiring plot and much better acting, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is dragged down by cop-out special effects and directorial issues that never really allowed the film to inspire awe or hold the viewers' interest. Thus, this second straight sub-par Superman film effectively killed the Superman franchise for nearly two decades.",

It is a pretty predictable movie with big plot holes and bad acting but that doesn't mean we can still enjoy it. This film is ten times better than part three and is almost as good as the original.

Furie (The Ipcress File). Basically Clark Kent aka Superman (Christopher Reeve) returns home to Smallville, and to the space capsule that brought him to Earth, and instructed by the voice of his mother Lara (Susannah York) he removes the luminescent green Kryptonian energy module, its power can only be used once, and refusing to sell his farm he returns to Metropolis. At the Daily Planet the newspaper has been taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Razzie nominated Mariel Hemingway) is the new editor, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) is fired, and Clark realises nuclear threat increasing between the United States and the Soviet Union he knows as Superman he must intervene, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) gives him support and advice. At the United Nations a meeting is called by Superman, he promises that he will collect and get rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, he manages to collect them in a gigantic net in space, and with his super strength he hurls it into the sun to explode. Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has been broken out of prison by his slow- witted teenage Lenny (Two and a Half Men's Jon Cryer), and returning to the city he has a plan to steal a strand of Superman's strong hair from a museum and with DNA genetics technology on a missile fire it into the sun and create a develop a new super-human. This plan works, and from the explosion of the weapon flies out Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Hackman), a super-human with all the powers of Superman, as well as electrical solar charges, but he is only active in sunlight, and eventually he fights with his rival. Scratched by Nuclear Man's radioactive claws Superman is infected with radiation sickness, and this is when he is forced the use the Kryptonian energy module to cure himself, and meanwhile the solar charged villain has a crush on Lacy and wants to be introduced, or he will hurt people. Superman manages to trap him in an elevator when the sunlight disappears, but Nuclear Man breaks out again when the light returns, forces the hero into the surface of the moon and kidnaps Lacy, but the superhero returns and the two rivals fight in space, Nuclear Man is defeated when Superman forces an eclipse, deactivating him, and he is destroyed in a nuclear plant core. Perry White returns as chief at the Daily Planet and Warfield is lessened in position, Luthor and his nephew are returned to prison, and Superman knows that nuclear weapons cannot be stopped entirely, but in a speech to the nations he assures them that one day governments will come together and make peace, and he flies away to continue to save people and have other adventures. Also starring Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Damian McLawhorn as Jeremy, William Hootkins as Harry Howler, Jim Broadbent as Jean Pierre Dubois, Stanley Lebor as General Romoff and Robert Beatty as U.S. President. Reeve is alright in his blue tights saving the world and in spectacles being awkward, Hackman looks to be having fun as a bit more pantomime villain, and Pillow is silly with the dubbed voice of Hackman as the anti-superhero in gold and black tights. The story is filled with ridiculous ideas and terrible moral or whatever messages, the acting is lame, the special effects for the flying and fighting sequences, even explosions and city destruction, look like hardly any money went into them, and overall it is clunky, and ultimately killed off the series, thank goodness things have improved somewhat in recent incarnations, a crap and worthless fantasy adventure.

The movie could had certainly used some more humor and comical situations and characters.The movie had still quite some potential to be honest but the weak directing and storytelling makes this a movie filled with holes and loose ends. Some moments are just completely unbelievable and there are more than a few obvious goofs in the movie and the story.It's surprising to see that Gene Hackman actually agreed to return in this movie after his absence in \"Superman III\". Not even he can give the movie a fun and light feeling. His character is terribly underused in the movie and the real main villain of the movie (Nuclear Man) is only introduced towards the ending of the movie. Nuclear Man is a pretty decent villain but he is simply introduced too late in the movie to leave a lasting impression.Not even Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder seem to feel at ease in this movie. They were both great in the previous 3 Superman movies but they really don't seem to feel comfortable with this movie its script and dialog.The special effects look absolutely horrible and are by far the worst of any of the Superman movies.Yes, the movie does still have some entertainment value and it still has some good superhero elements in the movie but overall it's a movie not really worth watching. The directing and the script are weak and not even the normally fine actors can make the movie fun or believable enough.

Yet even in this time, the DC comics were simple fun escapism and the artwork of Curt Swan made it palatable to the eye. The same could be said of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.  The budget was obviously lower and the platitudes higher (due to Christopher Reeve's need to make a statement about nuclear proliferation) but the film as its moments of excitement, particularly in the scene between Superman and the manufactured super-villain of Lex Luthor, a sort of Sun-Man.

Total disarmament of nuclear weapons may not be feasible in the real world, but Superman's quest for peace among all countries is well-intended in the film. Reeve is great as Superman and Gene Hackman gave us another thrilling performance as super villain Lex Luther.

There are good things floating around but executed in the poorest manner. And what's more the special effects are terrible, I can't believe they saved money on that front. The film moves along too fast, clocking in at under 90 minutes and some interesting angles are not explored nearly well enough.So what's good here? Well, Reeve of course. He IS Superman and once again delivers a fantastic performance and shows all too well that he's way too good for this film. Margot Kidder is good as well but her role is minimal and Jackie Cooper appears all too briefly. So that leaves Hackman. Of course it's good to see him, he's a very good actor, but one can't help but think he got a big paycheck and simply did what he had to and nothing more.

            "content": "I have watched this recently (early 2011) on the Deluxe DVD \u2013 picked up very cheaply to complete my set \u2013 I think for the first time since it came out. As a teenager, I am sure I enjoyed it as a piece of typical escapism, but I have come back to it now \u2013 screening a season for myself of all five Superman films \u2013 aware that people seem to think it's an all-time turkey. Well I am here to say that this really isn't fair.As with so many things, it's all a matter of context \u2013 yes, alongside a modern equivalent superhero sequel, e.g. The Dark Knight or any of the X-Men follow-ups, it's pretty dire. But then alongside a contemporary equivalent \u2013 say, Highlander II: The Quickening or Ghostbusters 2 \u2013 it's almost sublime! (But then compared to Highlander II, nuclear war sounds like a pleasant diversion.)Anyway, I am prepared to say that this is not even the worst Superman film! It's worthy of re-evaluation and it's genuinely worth seeing as part of the series.Firstly, it's VERY 1980s when you watch it now. Big-hair-tastic and shoulder-pad-mungous. But this is comparable to any other film from that era, such as Robocop or Working Girl. And yes, infamously there are some extremely dodgy effects in the mix \u2013 but some of them are actually very good. This odd contrast is not so different from the previous films in the series, especially the first from 1978. And remember that Ghostbusters \u2013 released the previous year and winning an Oscar for its effects, no less \u2013 has some risible shots when you look at it now.The real problem with Superman IV is that it's clearly been compromised in the making, ultimately put together without all the footage the director had planned to shoot. The infamous budget slashing by the studio is obvious in various scenes. While, jarringly, elsewhere you can see the money up on screen \u2013\u00a0the result being an uneven whole that's sadly less than the sum of its parts.I shall have to check out the deleted scenes some time to see what potential was there. But as it is, there are so many plus points trying to save this film:Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor again, with lots of good lines and villainous charm. he was shamefully wasted in Superman II, as was Kevin Spacey in this role in the turgid and unengaging Superman Returns. Hijacking the airwaves to lure Superman, Luthor signs off with V-for-victory signs and an ironic \"Peace!\" and I love the subsequent scene where he has his say/exercises his ego before our endlessly patient hero, constantly on the move and fixing himself a drink of champagne to toast the demise of his arch-enemy. (It's clear, too, that the film-makers decided to try to top his wonderful subterranean lair from the original film by having his new hideout a big Art Deco set for the top of Metropolis' equivalent of the Empire State Building.)The rest of the returning cast all do a solid job and, of course, Christopher Reeve is excellent. As the clutzy Clark Kent, he mistimes his aerobics (so 80s again!) but slyly gets back at a bully, bumbles around the capable Margot Kidder's Lois Lane and compliments his new love interest on her dress \u2013 badly and only at Lois' prompting. And then, as the earnest Superman, wrestling with his conscience and making then-oh-so-valid points about the Cold War arms race and human frailties, he gives the film a weighty centre. A scene at the now deserted Kent farm is touching and there is even the revelation that, without his parents, he now seems to be in the habit of revealing his identity to Lois for some love and advice, then mind-wiping her (again) with a super-snog! She is not, it is strongly suggested, entirely unaware of this arrangement...Lastly, Sidney J Furie is a very capable director and his work shines in certain scenes... while elsewhere you are left musing sadly on what might (should) have been. The double date is superbly handled \u2013 for example, there's a lovely shot where Clark quick-changes into Superman through a car parked outside revolving doors. And dare I say that the sequences where the 'Nuclear Man' goes on the rampage, around the world and then on the streets of Metropolis, are actually better handled, with more sense of scale and jeopardy than the three Kryptonian villains' not dissimilar activities in Superman II. Then there is the careful way Superman's famed all-American persona is, in this film (only, out of the five), balanced against a sense of him actually being an international figure, fluent in all languages and looking at the planet and the human race as one whole. In the opening scene we are presented with some Soviet cosmonauts who are shown to be 'just like you and me', neatly setting up the film's entire premise \u2013 which is eventually tied up with even the defeated Luthor asking an Eisenhower-quoting Superman if the Earth will be vapourised in WWIII and being told that, as always, the planet is \"on the brink with good fighting evil\".So in conclusion: It's nowhere near as good as the original, epic Superman, nor does it work with anything like the brio of Superman III, which is pure entertainment in my book. But it scores over Superman II, which for me feels like it was too old-fashioned even upon its initial release and seems even more compromised in its mix of what works and what jars. While in last place I am afraid I must put the disappointingly wet and unimaginative Superman Returns.",

In the time, when the nuclear war might still happen between the American and the Russians. The world is still never safe and people still lives in fear. But when a young boy named Jeremy (Damian McLawhorn) thinks that Superman could disarmed the whole entire nuclear war by writing an personal letter to the Daily Planet. Superman sees in the boy's point of the letter, he decides to talk to the United Nations for peace on earth. But things are slowly changing, when Superman's number one enemy Lux Luthor (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is having plans to kill Superman once and for all with the help of Luthor's nephew (Jon Cryer) by using a piece of Superman's hair by creating an super-clone named Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). A super-clone so powerful that is radiation charged. Now Superman has to find ways to destroy Nuclear Man before he gets Lux Luthor.Directed by Sidney J. Furie (The Entity, Iron Eagle) made an amusing, intentionally campy if extremely cheap sequel to \"Superman\" films. This fourth movie was produced (sadly) by the king of low-budget pictures of the 1980's Cannon Films. Which Cannon Films were going down, when \"Superman 4\" was produced after they were involved with box office disappointments like \"Lifeforce\", \"Invaders from Mars remake\" and \"Over the Top\". Originally Warner Bros give Cannon Films $40 million to produced the fourth picture but they only used $17 million to make it. They used the rest of the $23 million by producing other movies sadly. Special Visual Effects of this one truly did hurter the movie, there's only a very few F/X sequences were good but not many to make it memorable like the first two films. Also \"Superman 4\" feels choppy at times, not everything is logical in the story. While many scenes hit the cutting room floor before it was release. If the producers or the director kept some of the scenes that make some sense in the story. The premise could have been much more.But on the plus side, what i feel make \"Superman 4\" watchable is the good performances from the cast. Reeve is terrific as always in the title role. Hackman is a joy seeing him playing the villain. Margot Kidder as Lois Lane is also fun as well. I did like the new characters in the film played by Cryer as Luthor's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lucy Warfield. Which Hemingway plays the daughter of a billionaire tycoon who bought The Daily Planet and she also finds herself attractive to Clark character. Pillow isn't bad in his only film as the villain but when he speaks, it is unintentionally funny most of the time.DVD Version from the recent Deluxe Edition. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an decent Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fascinating commentary by Mark Rosenthal (Star Trek 6:The Undiscovered Country, The Beverly Hillbilles, Stephen King's Sometimes They Come Back). Which the co-screenwriter of the film talks about how Cannon treated the production badly, why the special effects looks so lame comparing to the previous films, character developments and the scenes were deleted from the picture. DVD also includes Deleted Scenes from the work-print (Which some are fascinating) but they don't including some of the deleted footage what Rosenthal mention in the commentary and the original theatrical trailer.\"Superman 4:The Quest for Peace\" was a major box office flop in the summer of 1987. But it somehow find life on video and it's great entertainment for the kids. Reeve came up with the premise of this feature along with Rosenthal and Co-Screenwriter Lawerence Konner (The Jewel of the Nile, Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, Mercury Rising). Which Reeve wasn't sure if he wanted to do another Superman film if Cannon Films will help produced one of Reeve's personal project called \"Street Smart\". Which that film was notable for Oscar-Nominated Supporting Performance by Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman as the violent pimp. But Reeve at the time, he felt he could make it up for the Superman 3. For his career at that time, it seems to make it much worse. But i think for me anyway, i felt \"Superman 4\" was improvement story-wise from the third film. Also nothing could top the villain Luthor as well, no matter what the screenwriter could come up with. Die Hard fans of the comic-books or the films might be more forgiving with this one.

            "content": "The way \"Superman IV - The Quest for Peace\" is referred by critics and conventional wisdom is absolutely unfair. It is accused of killing Superman series, quitting Christopher Reeve's portrayals of the man of steel and delaying in two decades a new Superman film. Blame Cannon Films' budget constraints, not all the movie. Off course, \"Superman IV\" has flaws. Due to Cannon Films's bankruptcy, there was not enough money to resume properly an expensive movie like that (budget shrank from US$ 36 million to US$ 17 million). Therefore, special effects are much worse than the ones used in its prequels, and scenes have been filmed without appropriate conditions (scenario, extras etc). To summarize, the film has been released \"unfinished\", as one of the actors, Jon Cryer (yes, Alan from \"Two and a half men\"), stated. Besides that, they invented some powers which are not this superhero's traditional ones, such as telekinesis (though, a power General Zod had in \"Superman II\") or creating bricks with the X-ray (indeed, the Great Wall scene is particularly amateur). The super-villain Nuclear Man, although not visually bad, suffered with poor text and bad acting. I also disliked campy Lenny (22 years old Jon Cryer), Lex Luthor's nephew. Though, \"Superman IV\" also has merits, which should be acknowledged. First of all, its plot is interesting and not less sophisticated than most of superhero movies (not to confuse complexity with mess, as many recent superhero films have bad explained stories disguised as story richness). Besides that, there are many nice jokes, enjoyable situations and good dialogues. Once again, Christopher Reeve does an amazing job as Clark Kent and Superman, and Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder also have great performances in their roles of Luthor and Lois Lane. Instead of pure empty action, \"Superman IV\" also brings an important message of peace and criticizes both USA and USSR for their stupid military over-investments. This trait would have also been reinforced if some very nice deleted scenes had been included in final cut (they are available as special features in DVD, together with horrible footage with the first version of Nuclear Man). Besides that, the movie also reminds how the press is responsible for the outcomes of its reports. The final message is a praiseworthy support for political engagement. The bad fame of \"Superman IV\" has been so often sustained that people do not watch this film anymore, letting no chances for its reputation be reconsidered. That is a shame. It is worse than excellent Superman I and II, off course, and, in my opinion, also than \"Superman Returns\", but I consider it much better than campy \"Superman III\" and much truer to our dear character than revisionist Zack Snyder's \"Man of Steel\".",

I used to watch it only to laugh at it, but it turned out later I wasn't watching it anymore to laugh. I love this movie. It's not as good as the other Superman movies in the series, but it is still good. I also used to say that Mark Pillow was horrible as Nuclear Man because of how corny he was. I was wrong. He is good as Nuclear Man because the way he is you would think you were reading a comic. Christopher Reeve of course is great as Superman and I enjoyed the acting of his co-stars. I complained about the special effects, but I read about how much trouble the filmmakers went through to get this movie finished. One thing though that still stands as something I dislike is one, the mistake in the end of having Nuclear Man fly Lacey Warfield up into space and two, the fight on the moon. There are some good moments in the moon fight, but Superman acts like a wimp in some parts and doesn't know how to fight. He stomps on Nuclear Man's foot, he takes Nuclear Man's head and brings it into his knee and he tries to kick(tap) Nuclear Man and it results in Nuclear Man throwing him. But one last thing about the scene that I love is how Superman walks over to the American flag and stands it back up. Great stuff. There are only plot holes in the movie because a lot of it was cut because of idiots in Orange County that didn't like it. Thanks to them we have a movie second rate to the original version. This could've been one of the best in the series. It is still very good though. If you want to collect Superman movies don't leave this one out.",

            "content": "My rating - 3/5 stars CONTAINS SPOILERS Released in 1987, Superman did very poorly in the box office, because of bad reviews and because of some people's experiences with Superman III. John Williams replaced Ken Thorne - He and Alexander Courage made terrific music, possibly the greatest in the entire series, but unfortunately not on CD. Superman IV, a Cannon Group Inc./Golan-Globus Production, directed by Sidney J. Furie, and featuring the return of Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Jackie Cooper, and Marc McClure, a story by Christopher Reeve, Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal -Christopher Reeve returned as the Man of Steel, on the condition that he could help write the story. He came up with a very sensitive theme - nuclear disarmament.After receiving a letter from a boy wishing that Superman would rid the world of nuclear weapons, Superman decides to put the plan into action, and with the approval of the world leaders, he hurles the missiles into space. Unknown to him is the fact that Lex Luthor planted a device on one of the missiles, with DNA from a strand of Superman's hair. A nuclear creation emerges from the sun, and makes his way to Earth. \"Nuclear Man\" proves to be Superman's biggest challenge yet. He destroys everything in reach to \"have fun,\" and gives Superman a nuclear beating. Although Superman proves to be a better fighter, Superman is scratched on the back of his neck by Nuclearman's \"nuclear nails.\" Bleeding for the first time in his life (with his powers) Superman becomes \"sick\" and disappears. He uses the green crystal for the second time (not too original) which returns his powers to him. Suddenly, we see a scene with Nuclearman destroying everything in sight, until Superman will tell him where Lacy Warfield (new publisher of the Daily Planet) is hidden. The scene basically pops out of nowhere, and leaves you staring at the screen with a blank look on your face. Superman pretends that Lacy is in an elevator, shuts the lights off, and hurls it into the moon. Superman forgets to do a double check to see if any cracks are in the elevator, and is attacked by a regenerated Nuclearman. Superman is pummeled into the ground (literally), while Nuclearman flies back to Earth. Nuclearman grabs Lacy, and flies up to space, his reasons unknown. He's a blond, buff, moron - What did you expect? Superman moves the moon (possibly causing tidal waves in the process) to cover up the sun. Nuclearman \"shuts down,\" and Lacy is left struggling to hang on to him, so she doesn't \"fall,\" then Superman comes out of nowhere and brings her back. He takes Nuclearman, and throws him into a nuclear reactor. One would think that this would cause a power surge, but every light in the city turns on, blinding everyone in sight, even though I'm sure many of the buildings didn't have their light switches on.The budget was cut in half, leaving the special effects group helplessly reusing effects. One of these reused effects seems like a cutout of Superman being pushed towards the camera on a stick (great way of describing it, DVDfile).The only thing that saves this film is a great story (the nuclear disarmament idea, DEFINITELY not Nuclearman) and some great performances, as usual, by Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman. Margot Kidder appears as well, but doesn't get a whole lot of screen time.The old wise tale is that there was a screening of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace in Orange County, CA. The viewers didn't like it, so they cut the supposedly 134 minute movie down to a measly 90 minutes. The TV version has 2 extra minutes of footage. It's possible that the extended cut is still out there - many fans have a theory that it was thrown in the fire. I think it may be out there - you never know if that one pimple faced college student had his mini camera handy when he attended the Orange County screening...",

Instead, Menaham Golan and Yoram Globus, the owners of Cannon films, were producing. If you ask me, the Salkinds knew how to make a Superman movie better than those two. In Superman IV, Superman hears the threat of Nuclear War over and over, and so he decides that he will rid the world of every nuclear weapon known to man. At the same time, Lex Luthor has broken out of jail again and this time, his sidekick is his dorky nephew Lenny. The two criminals create a device that they put on one of the nuclear weapons and that ends up creating Nuclear Man. Nuclear Man has the same powers as Superman but, the only difference is that Nuclear Man gets his power from the sun.\nWhile all of this is going on, The Dailey Planet is being controlled by a tycoon and his daughter who has her eye on Clark Kent.\nSo Superman has a big job here: SAVE THE WORLD FROM NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!I'm going to say that, anyone who has seen the first three Superman films, then just go ahead and see IV because it would be a shame to not see the film that is last in the series.

The cheesy look on the movie can be blamed on the budget; it was slashed by more than half just before filming began due to Golan and Globus having financial problems. This results in some special effects being recycled, but even worse is that all the special effects look very cheap and shabby. Why does Superman's cape flap in outer space, for instance?While better special effects would have helped, the movie would have still suffered from its screenplay. It is very juvenile and simple- minded; it reminded me at times of the often goofy nature of Superman comic books in the 1950s. How can a mortal human survive at length in outer space without a space suit, for instance?Is there anything good about the movie? Well, the cast, despite the low budget and the silly screenplay, do manage to make their characters charming and likable.

It is rather obvious and Christopher Reeve's ability to play Superman and John Williams' great score alone can not carry the picture.Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is broken out of jail by his moronic nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) so that he can create his own superhero or supervillain in Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). Once the two face off you should be welcomed to a great cinema fight, but you must undergo and witness some brutal flying scenes and grade Z effects.Reeve, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal wrote the story, Konner & Rosenthal the screenplay, but it is interesting because I can tell there actually is a good movie somewhere inside it, just needed a bigger budget and perhaps more story. Supposedly there were multiple scenes shot that were not included in the final cut. As well Wes Craven was originally set to direct, but he and Reeve did not get along well and then Sidney J.

It began with Superman in 1978, a strong, faithful adaptation of the comic book hero, bright and colorful, fun to watch, exciting in its action, and overall, a serviceable, genuinely entertaining piece of filmmaking. Its sequel was an equally strong film and, thanks to a refreshing but controversial change in directors, welcomed in a more satirical, comedic take on the comic-book character. It was fun and enchanting, if still accentuating the plastic kind-of qualities its predecessor had. By Superman III is when the character started taking a nosedive back to earth. The film lacked the great chemistry that was erected in the first two films, and focused predominately on a lame villain and an uninteresting character ironically played by the very interesting Richard Pryor.And now we have Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, a cinematic disgrace to the character in every regard that could've been prevented if something called source-material-respect was implemented. The production history of Superman IV is heavily noted, with a lot of it being revealed in Reeve's post-paralysis autobiography Still Me. Reeve's participation was made possible by a convincing deal, but even in his heart he knew it wasn't right. The film was made by Canon Films who, at the time, had thirty movies in productions. Superman IV wasn't treated any different than other winners the company had set for release at the time like American Ninja 2: The Confrontation and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. Enormous budget slashing, extreme cutbacks in nearly every film department, and the lack of interest in making a film that would rebound the mediocre response to Superman III all lead to the dismal product that is Superman IV.You can almost see it in the cast's face that they have little enthusiasm for the material they're currently acting in. Even Reeve, whose face gleamed and personality erupted when he did his first big scene in the original film, has seemingly checked out of this franchise. Gene Hackman's return to the franchise, too, feels forced and looks as if he is totally uninteresting with what is happening, and additional talent from Margot Kidder, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, and the lovely, beautiful Mariel Hemingway is all wasted on a third-rate script.The plot involves the \"Daily Planet\" newspaper being bought out by a journalist tycoon who favors sensationalistic titles over real journalism, leading to Clark Kent and Lois Lane's (Margot Kidder) job to be more about catering to the narrow-minded and stretching the truth rather than about honest journalism. Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), the tycoon's daughter, also takes a liking to Clark and his kind ways, as she desperately tries to throw herself onto him at every conceivable opportunity. And if that's not enough, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has returned, this time with his son Lenny (Jon Cryer). They are planning to create \"Nuclear Man,\" a man to battle Superman since they have failed numerous times on their own to destroy him.With a larger budget and maybe a studio that took this material seriously and recognized they needed a colossal rebound after Superman III, these ideas could've worked just as well as in the first two films. But under the stiff, clearly rushed direction of Sidney J. Furie (who already had several films under his belt when this was released, so I'm sure circumstances and time constraints were mostly to blame) and the effortless special effects (again, likely caused by budget constraints), this is an incredibly paltry effort to revitalize a franchise.Not to mention, a trilogy is understandable, but a fourth movie after the third film already seemed that the end was nigh? This seems like an outright joke in itself. Even the subtitle for the film, \"The Quest for Peace,\" leaves a person slightly confused. Wasn't that practically the ultimate goal in the last three films, whether it be peace and silence from Lex Luthor or Ross Webster's exhaustive computer hacking plan? Superman IV: A Quest for Peace is a rather disingenuous ending to a franchise many loved and many adored until lackluster decisions were made in the franchise's latter half. While the series had always maintained sort of this plastic quality I have been talking about, where characters do what is mostly expected of them and there's little deeper, below-the-surface mystery, the first two installments of the series were fun and quite exciting. What it evolved into was something no fan asked for and no fan deserve.I laugh at how one of the opening scenes in the offices of the \"Daily Planet\" show the journalistic tycoon implementing controlling policies and budget cuts to make his vision of the newspaper. Something tells me that's how the production of the film went, with the tycoon being Canon Films and the angry staff the cast.Starring: Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, Margot Kidder, Mariel Hemingway, and Mark Pillow. Directed by: Sidney J. Furie.",

            "content": "Well to say that the final chapter in the Superman series was a big let down is an understatement. I have read many people's opinion on this movie and agree that it could have been a way better film. Though the film's theme does have some merit attached to it.Superman IV is about the man of steel grappling with his emotions of his now home planet, Earth. He is afraid the planet could suffer the same fate as his mother planet Krypton. Superman agrees to rid the planet of the threat of nuclear war. But the mastermind of the greatest criminal in the modern era, Lex Luthor, uses the Superman peace bid to create ciaos. His new creation is a Frankenstein like being, a Nuclear Man. Can Superman stop the Earth from blowing itself up?Actors such as Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman were crazy when they agreed to do this film. I know that Reeve helped to write the story to this film, and the whole nuclear war theme was quite fine. But tell me if I am wrong, the big screen version never turned out the way it was suppose to? Reeve was good again as Clark Kent/Superman (but only when his feet were on the ground). The flying sequences in this Superman were atrocious. Scenes like when Lois Lane and Superman fly around together. These scenes look fake. The original Superman gave me the impression that this bloke really could fly. But this film makes a mockery of the Superman name. I must commend the speech of Superman to the world congress on nuclear war, it was quite touching and when you watch the movie up to this point, I thought hey this might be alright. But how wrong was I?Gene Hackman made the role of Lex Luthor his own. Yet, I am amazed he even wanted anything to do with reprising the Luthor role. Not that he was bad, but the film itself was. Hackman since then, has had to reinvent himself in films like Enemy of the state, which I enjoyed immensely. It is only lucky he didn't ruin his whole career. Another of his better films was the Quick and the Dead, starring alongside Hollywood beauty Sharon Stone. Margot Kidder was back in Superman IV and I did enjoy parts of her in this. Lois' emotions towards Superman were well acted by Kidder. Looking at Kidder's career since this film nothing really stands out to me though. Margot has had bad luck in the last ten years, being in a serious car crash, managing maniac depression and requiring psychiatric care. I do remember that she went through a tough trot.I will tell you which cast members weren't quite that super. First of all, Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). It is fine to have a menacing look about you, but aren't you suppose to able to act a bit also? Pillow was a terrible choice in this role. The other point is that I haven't seen or heard anything of this guy since. The other crappy part to his role was that Gene Hackman supplied the voice of his character. The Nuclear man character was ok, but could have had a better actor playing him. Then you have the attractive actress Mariel Hemingway, who played Lacy Warfield. The daughter of tycoon David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker). As good looking as Hemingway is, her character in this was of no importance at all. Likewise Wanamaker, who just makes up the numbers, plus the whole take over bid of the Daily Planet didn't make much sense to me. Last of all I want to talk about Jon Cryer. He played Luthor's nerdy nephew, Lenny. He was terrible and a complete waste of time being in this film in my view. I also read somewhere, has anyone seen Jon Cryer since Superman IV? My answer to that is yes, in a film titled Holy Man starring would you believe Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum and the gorgeous Kelly Preston.I have mentioned some scenes in Superman IV that I liked and that I disliked. Another favourite was when Lacy and Lois had a double date with Clark and Superman. This scene was well acted and cleverly done. Superman was up and down this tall building for the entire scene. Reeve's talent's again shone through with this. The only problem with this scene was that it totally gives away who Superman's secret identity really is. Anyone in their right mind should know after having a double date with the guy. The worst scene in the film is when Nuclear man takes Lacy Warfield after falling in love with her. Superman discovers that Nuclear man's energy comes from the sun and shifts the moon's orbit to block the sun. Meanwhile Lacy is dragged into outer space. I don't know who got this wrong, but no earthling can breathe in space without help can they? So why didn't Lacy die huh?The other dilemma this film had was that the budget was cut back. After a test screening, it was reduced from 134 to 90 minutes. I say that the edit button destroyed this film. Scenes were deleted or cut. It might (I stress might) have helped if I could have seen the whole film. I read the book to Superman IV and admit that I actually enjoyed reading it. I hope we get to see what was taken out of this film on the DVD of Superman IV.All in all this was a movie which probably never had a chance to succeed. With poor special effects, ordinary cast and a shortened version that really did kill it. I want to wish Christopher Reeve all the best in his recovery from his quadriplegia. I will always remember him as Superman, on the big screen and in real life. I am afraid to say that this film gave Superman a bad name.Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars or 4/10.",

            "content": "Superman III was a definite step down after the first two excellent S-films, but was still watchable. This movie, however, is a turkey from start to finish. No wonder it killed the franchise for 19 years ('til Bryan Singer came to the rescue), it really sucks, sucks, sucks.There's only one thing I enjoyed, and that's the late, great Christopher Reeve, whose incarnation of the Man of Steel was once again pitch-perfect. Sadly, everything else is a 90-minute disaster: from the dire script (it almost screams: \"Hey, nuclear weapons are a bad thing, you know?\", and it has some awful dialogue, such as \"You know what we can do with Superman's hair?\" \"A flying wig?\") to the far from exciting SFX scenes (the same flying shot is reused at least four (!) times), The Quest for Peace is even worse than Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin, which at least tried to be decent (Schumacher himself admitted he wanted to make it less \"clownish\" than it turned out).And let's not (?) forget the villains: Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is sidelined in favor of his obnoxious nephew (Richard Pryor, who was the bad guy in Superman III, had a bit more charm), and the \"frightening\" Nuclear Man (voiced, God knows why, by Hackman) is probably the most throwaway movie character I've seen to date.The premise was interesting, but not even Christopher Reeve could completely prevent this movie from crash-landing rather than flying. Apart from the leading man, Superman IV is about as interesting as a flying wig.3,5/10",

            "content": "There is a sort of stigma that surrounds this film.  Superman fans either love it or hate it, and the general viewer mostly despises it.  Indeed, in comparison to the other Superman films (1 and 2 especially), this entry leaves very much to be desired.  I tend to stand on the middle ground when it comes to an opinion on this movie, and I'll tell you why.Many people know the production history behind Superman IV.  The Salkinds gave up the rights to Superman and low-budget studio Canon Films eagerly snatched them up.  Christopher Reeve had previously stated that he would never don the red cape again, but with the Salkinds out of the picture and and the assurance that he could contribute to the script, he went right back to the role.  The rest of the original cast also came back, also because the Salkinds were out.  With all of this lined up and a great budget provided by Warner Brothers, Superman IV was slated to be a film that went back to serious tone of the original two.  Of course, Canon slashed the budget in mid-production due to bankruptcy and a disastrous screening in Orange County left 45 minutes of footage on the cutting room floor.  When it was finally released, Superman IV had been butchered, beaten, and severely under advertised.  The best intentions went awry, and for many fans, the Superman film legacy had ended on a sad and heart-breaking note.I agree, there is something sad and heart breaking about it, mainly that the movie was probably much more epic than what we were left with.  The 45 minutes left out of the film involved a titanic battle between Superman and a prototype Nuclear Man and established the sub-plots that connected the rest of the film together.  If such footage had been left in, the quality of the film could have been greatly increased.The other gut-wrenching thing about the film is the intentions behind it. Reeve and the people involved had wanted to make a film that spoke to fans and to the world about the evils of nuclear weaponry.  Behind it all, the movie had a heart, and sadly, many people failed to realize it.There is no denying that there are some terrible moments in this film.  Many times can you see the strings of Superman and/or Nuclear Man and the flying is no where nearly as beautiful or inspiring as it was in the other entries. On the moon you can see the folds in the black curtain of space and Superman is \"gifted\" with many powers that do not exist in the Superman mythos (he fixes the Great Wall just by looking at it).  Despite these numerous errors, Superman IV does have some great moments.  Christopher Reeve delivers a flawless performance of Superman and Clark Kent yet again and Gene Hackman is fantastic as Lex Luthor.  The movie should be watched, if anything, for the UN speech.  It is beautiful and carries a meaning in our current world.All in all, Superman IV is a technical disappointment in comparison to the other films.  It does, however, provide what the third film sorely lacked, and that was heart.  We should not easily dismiss this movie, however simple it may seem to do so.  May we hope that someday the lost footage will be restored.",

            "content": "Superman (Christopher Reeve) continues his life of costumed superhero and Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent. As the Daily Planet is taken over by tabloid magnate David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker), Clark and fellow reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) find themselves uneasy with the more sensationalist route taken by the paper's new owner and editor/David's daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway) who also has a crush on Clark. Meanwhile the failure of a summit between the United States and Soviet Union causes both nations to increase production of their nuclear stockpiles. A young boy, Jeremy (Damian McLawhorn), writes a letter to Superman asking why Superman can't dispose of the nuclear weapons himself, and while he's uncertain about whether he should get involved following public pressure Superman makes an announcement that he will rid the world of nuclear weapons singlehandedly. While Superman's words and actions are met with approval by the public and (I think) several public officials, they irk war profiteers, military strategic think tanks, and others whose pocketbooks and political standing is threatened by the new development. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) having escaped from prison with the aid of his dimwitted nephew Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) formulates a plan with the help of those with vested interest in preserving the arms race to create a nuclear clone of Superman which comes in the form of Nuclear Man (physically played by Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman) who has the power to destroy the Superman.Following the disappointing response to Superman III and disastrous response to Supergirl, Ilya and Alexander Salkind scrapped a planned Superman IV and out of financial necessity sold the rights to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group, Inc. For $5 million in 1985. When Christopher Reeve was approached by Cannon to reprise his role he was reluctant, but Cannon offered Reeve $6 million, story input, director approval, and financing and distribution for Reeve's long stalled pet project Street Smart. With Reeve on board, Cannon was able to lure back other veteran members of the Superman cast such as Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder who hated the Salkinds for their abusive treatment (especially of Richard Donner) and underhanded and duplicitous dealings so the change in producers was seen as a fresh start. While Superman IV was a priority for Cannon, the movie beset with production difficulties from day one with the promised $36 million budget slashed to $17 million, which lead to downscaling in the special effects and locations with noticeable results. As a company, Cannon had often kept themselves afloat with foreign presales to upcoming movies as well as sales of TV and home media rights to current films used to keep the cycle afloat with their primary output being action and horror fare of $5 million or less that could continue this endless cycle and in essence \"robbing Peter to pay paul\". With movies above that $5 million threshold the company didn't have that windfall hence why Superman IV was so troubled. Superman IV is considered the worst film in the Superman series and often labeled one of the worst of all time, and it's hard to disagree because not only is it a stupid story, but unlike the previous films it's not even technically competent.Superman IV is an anti-war movie with Reeve credited with a story credit. Reeve was apparently inspired based on his personally reaction to the failure of the 1986 Reykjavik Summit as well as then President Reagan's military buildup and skepticism towards arms control. Now on the surface that's not an awful idea, but when you have Superman making declarations he will singlehandedly remove all Nuclear Weapons from the Earth without consulting with the leaders it feels like it goes contrary to his character. Now as much as I don't like this direction....it does unfortunately have comic book precedent. In stories that Marv Wolfman wrote for the comic Adventures of Superman that ran concurrently with John Byrne's run in the main series that reintroduced the character \"post crisis\", Superman did undertake a one man crusade against the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Qurac destroying all their weapons and artillery so as dumb as this plot is, it's not the first time this route has been taken with the character. The movie is a disjointed mess with a number of dangling unresolved subplots and jumps due to the fact that the movie's 110 minute runtime was trimmed to 89 minutes making it the shortest Superman film by a considerable margin. Not that the footage being put back in would've helped because the script is not only stupid with its very reductive look at the arms race and the nature thereof, but the comedy present in these movies has reached the worst of hackneyed writing with Superman now utilizing the dreaded \"two dates to the prom\" setup that doesn't even have a proper payoff to that tired clich\u00e9. In fact many of the \"jokes\" feel like they're missing punchlines or reactions which is probably a tell tale sign of things that were cut.Reeve remains good as Superman (his poorly thought out story notwithstanding) and Gene Hackman looks like he's at least having fun despite his knowledge of how bad he movie is. But most of the other performances, effects, and set pieces feel passable at best or unfinished at worst. The Superman films have always had competent work at minimum at minimum and you do not get that here. Editing is often shoddy, characters have knowledge of things they shouldn't, things explode despite a lack of projectiles, it wouldn't surprise me if not only was the budget slashed in half, but the post and foley work also felt the wrath of Cannon's budget scissors.Superman IV is bad, but it is at least fascinatingly bad. The same goofy optimism that began this series is on full display, except without the brain that added substance to the silliness. Even at their lowest point the Salkind Superman movies gave us at least ONE scene that we could say \"that's impressive\" like the Clark Kent vs. Superman fight in Superman III, or Supergirl being stranded on The Phantom Zone in Supergirl. Here however, I can't name one scene that even approaches good. If you watch this movie you'll watch it all the way to the end, and you'll even laugh, but only in the manner most befitting watching a trainwreck.",

But the thing is unnatural matters, especially in the third act, interrupted and somewhat ruled.First you must know that before making it, the first 3 movie's producer, Ilya Salkind, sold the Superman franchise to Golan & Globus of Cannon Films which was having many financial disasters back then. So the $36 million dollars budget had been cut down to $17 million, the already shot 134 minutes to 90 minutes, and Superman movie to not super!Although the story was promising, but some naive points were more than noticeable: Superman declares his real character \"again\" to Lois Lane, then flies with her \"again\" over the city, then makes her forget all about it \"AGAIN!\". So what was the point?? How Lex Luthor knew the place of Superman to send him a sonic AND visual message?!, or does he know about the lead's alter-ego?! A human girl who can go into outer space unharmed, with no science fiction to explain how she didn't die out of the lack of Oxygen. Suddenly, all the world's nations, without exception, abandon their entire nuclear warheads (America did?? Now that's a wild science fiction!). Then look at this equation; put together Superman's genetics + Lex Luthor + nuclear missile + the sun = an evil super MAN (????).Side matters bothered too, like how the directing handled the battles artlessly. How Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man acted like a star in low grade Italian gladiator movie (with even the dubbed voice as well!). And how Jon Cryer was wasted.The collapse of Cannon Films was felt in the movie like it was out of it. The special effects went back in time to the old cheap B-movies and the worst, most primitive, TV shows. We can see the wires so visible over Superman's shoulders carrying him on the fake moon. Now the man of steel can rebuilt the Great Wall of China by only his eyes, or rescue some flying victims by just gazing at them?! Saying that these were \"new super powers\" is nothing but \"the stowaway's excuses\". Because they were problems made by the shrunken budget, not ideas made by *creative* writing; which is a claim that pushes me to laugh bitterly!Then the highest infamous matter. (Superman IV: The Quest For Peace - 1987) had what could make it an original example for an incomplete movie that had been boldly released internationally though. At one point, the lead gets real sick, then at another he becomes so healthy?? Nuclear Man sees a photo of Lacey, the new editor-in-chief's daughter, to be madly deeply desperately in love with her?? However, nothing can outmatch what I see as the ultimate random scene ever made; in which Nuclear Man screams in the street, asking the suddenly healthy Superman: \"WHERE IS THE WOMAN?!\", and the latter answers him knowing what woman he was asking about??? No, it's not a flaw from the projector's worker. No, it's not the censor. And No, it's not Superman getting a new superpower of reading minds. It is Cannon Films getting poorer and poorer. Nevertheless, that produced one of the most purely surreal moments in film history!This is the forth in the series. The third best for me after the first 2.

Also lets not forget when Mariel Hemingway is brought into space she dosen't die. Ya it's bad quality and is definitely the poorest film of the 4. But I have to say,the story wasn't that bad though a bit corny. Superman clearing the world of nuclear weapons and Lex Luthor creating a being named Nuclear Man to kill the Man of Steel. The concept of Nuclear Man was pretty cool but he could have been portrayed a lot better instead of....well an idiot, especially since he was created from Superman's DNA. It was entertaining when Superman and him duke it out across the world with Superman repairing the world as Nuclear Man destroys it (ignoring the fact that it was daytime in America, China and Russia at the same time another error thanks to the poor production) and of course the battle on the moon. It was a good storyline turned into a not so good movie. We all know it could have been much much better but thanks to the cheap production of Golan/Globus this is all we got.

            "content": "Fourth instalment of the late Christopher Reeve version of the Superman films.Okay this film has been slated in most quarters. Lauded as one of the worst films of all time.....It would be easy for me to jump on that bandwagon for this review.The film suffers from budgetary constraints obviously. The production values are there on screen for all to see. The special effects are laughable comparable to the 1950s television version never mind the 1978 movie original.Some scenes are simply stolen from the predecessor films to save money it would appear. The reason being the involvement of Cannon films in the production instead of it being a solely Warner Bros film.Cannon were renowned in the 1980s for producing trashy B films. Video stores at that time had shelves full of their rubbish Chuck Norris starring films. I've had to revisit some of the Cannon cannon out of some cinematic torture!The budget was apparently halved just prior to production and that explains this films problems really.The story does actually have potential. I believe that the late Superman star Christopher Reeve has a storyline credit on the film. Given a proper Hollywood budget it could have worked.Instead the film attempts to be Pinewood/Hollywood quality at the old Elstree film studio/Milton Keynes!The plot centres on nuclear weapon proliferation. Superman single handedly rids the world of nuclear warheads by collecting them in outer space in a giant net before throwing them at the Sun!It is not explored if Israel/Iran/North Korea are involved in the worldwide venture!The running time of the film was slashed in post - production to 90 minutes from just over 120 minutes. More cost cutting measures or a way to erase boring Social messages from Reeve?The cast of the 1978 first film return minus the cameo from Marlon Brando.The bad guy is some genetically produced 'Nuclear Man' who in reality is a dubbed cheap Jean Claude Van Damme lookalike.I was saddened to see so many great UK based filmakers involved in this production besmerching their reputations!",

            "content": "As much as I hate to go with popular consensus, I must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film... it blows. It blows with the power of its title character's super-breath. Oh golly me, how it blows. Nuclear Man looks and sounds(apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in Gene Hackman's voice, for no apparent reason) like something out of one of the Conan movies. Superman defies logic and science(yes, I know... but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together), as does the film. And worst is the moralizing. The plot is quite poor. This is most definitely a sequel... and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back(right after the first, some would say). The writing displays a general lack of creativity. Luthor is brought back... slightly louder and less charismatic this time. We are introduced to Lenny, portrayed by Jon Cryer. I, for one, did *not* need to see this man playing a teenager. He's much funnier in Hot Shots and on Two and a Half Men. And what was with the complete and utter waste of Jim Broadbent? The man hardly utters a word in this film, and his screen-time is so small, he could have been an extra. I haven't seen much of him, but even from that(BlackAdder and Moulin Rouge), I would gladly sign(or perhaps even start) a petition to legally change his name to Funny Man. The humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort, but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed. The film is hardly dramatic... the action sequences dire and unengaging. The writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through, with no stop in sight. How many different similarly-abled beings is Supes gonna fight before actually facing a villain we *know*(from the comics), other than Luthor? I realize that Lex is his arch-nemesis, but it's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy(simply hand-picking a villain already known), but also what the real fans want. How many decades of history does this character have? It shouldn't be difficult to find someone suitable. The writers of the old series of Batman films managed... four times, no less. Granted, they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first, but they did have the assistance of Joel Schumacher, a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film. Back to this failure, sorry, film... the effects are worse than ever before. The budget is quite clearly to blame. The attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy... as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages. It just winds up sounding incredibly preachy. Yes, we get it... nuclear power is dangerous, newspapers should be about news, not making money. Now stop trying to be morally superior... that, incidentally, is *not* what movies are about. The acting is fine. All in all, this just really doesn't have anything to offer. If you want food for thought on either message, read up on it or watch a documentary about it. If you want to see a good(or even passable) superhero film, look elsewhere. Consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better, or go with another hero(or check out Singer's vision, and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first). I recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies, as that is the only way this has any value at all, and as a lesson in what *not* to do when making a good film, for directors-to-be. 1/10",

OK your probably thinking I'm mental for liking a film thats got a review of 3.3...but bear with it as I will explain why I like it.OK first off when I was younger I watched a film that had superman in it and a superman in a black costume....but I could never remember what superman it was, I knew it wasn't the first one or the third because I had them on video, so it was bound to be the second.When superman two was on sky movies I watched it and to my shock it didn't have that bit of cinema and action that I remembered watching as a child. After countless google searches I finally found out there was a superman four so quickly got hold of a copy and watched it...this is where the review begins.To begin with it has almost all the original cast back for the final film of the series, which is nice on its own, the opening sequence is (I will admit) abit poor compared to the previous films but when you hear the music you know your watching a superman film. Anyway the film goes on and superman starts to deal with issues that are important, a child writes to him and asks him to take all the nuclear weapons off earth and destroy them, to begin with superman isn't too sure on the idea. Anyway in the end he does destroy them, mean while Lex Luthor steals one of superman's hairs from a museum and uses it to create Nuclear Man, basically an evil superman...well it's almost exactly like superman except hes blonde and needs the sun to get energy on a more extreme level than superman.Still the movie has some great action sequences and fits in well to the other superman films, though you do have to take this for what it is \"a comic book movie\" it is good at what it is, you have to watch it and forget everything you where ever taught or believe...OK some of the stuff like the fight on the moon is abit extreme but it's a SUPERman movie. I can only suggest you watch this movie but just don't take it seriously it is a nice movie to watch and it is memorable which I hope is the message you got from the beginning of this review.",

I think Reeves is okay as Superman (a character I have no fondness for), but the humour that permeates this series is asinine and childish. So while I would admit that this film is astonishingly shoddy and stupid compared to the previous entries (or at least the first two films), I can't say that I like it any less than any of the other films. In fact, I probably enjoyed it a bit more, but that's not really to the film's credit. A lot can be made of the fact that this film's budget was cut by about 2/3 due to Cannon's financial difficulties, but although that really shows in the film's insanely shoddy effects work and poor subbing of London for New York City, you can't really argue that this would be a good film if the effects were better. This is a film where Superman seems surprised that an elevator won't hold someone with strength similar to his. This is a film where Superman pushes the moon out of orbit with no repercussions. To be fair, it's also a film where the comedic elements are just as idiotic if not worse that the previous films. I grant all that ... but somehow the fact that this film is clearly junk makes it's stupidity less egregious than the stupidity of the earlier big budget studio films.",

            "content": "The final adventure of Superman is by far his worst.  Granted Superman III isn't much better, but at least it was not as contrived as this one. \nFirst of all, let's look at the good parts of this movie, it is a short list.  Christopher Reeve came up with an excellent story for this film and it reflected the times that the world was facing.  Riding the world of nuclear weapons was a good start, a nice foundation to build on; unfortunately there was not enough money to finish the film and it was released unfinished.  The other nice things about this film are the return of Lex Luthor,and the return to seriousness in the film series.  One can only wonder how this movie would have turned out had all the necessary funding been there. \nThe special effects are just plain horrible, and the audience winces as Superman makes his 'dramatic entrance' by saving a space capsule from spinning into the Earth's atmosphere and rescuing a man falling into space. Everytime Reeve is in flight, the animated Superman is obvious to everyone, and it is sad to see this; for the audience no longer believes a man can fly, but that a cartoon can instead.  So many scenes are deleted from this movie that it is confusing to understand just how certain key elements of the film are executed, or worse yet, why!The only scene which holds interest for a little while is the climatic battle between Superman and Nuclear Man, at best the scene gets a mediocre. \nSo far this has been the final entry of the Superman series, and although the film is exceptionally weak.  Christopher Reeve once again sparkles as the Man of Steel.  He always gave an excellent performance as Superman even when the movies where sub-par, and that speaks plenty. \nAt least the ending to this movie is done well with Superman flying out of the Earth and smiling at us as he flies off into space, protecting the world; that alone will always inspire some kind of hope to people.",

But it's ridiculous. He takes the half-pennies from co-workers' accounts and adds them together. How does he become a millionaire overnight?

The plot just had catalysts and moments that didn't make sense.The film completely abandoned any character development from the previous films. Though I am not a fan of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, the treatment of her character is ridiculous. The filmmakers took anything positive from the original two films and either forgot about them (Lois and Clark's relationship) or hyper-focused to the point of being distracting (Lex's scheming, the score, Superman's honesty).From the bag of missiles in space to the movement of the moon, you can't go 5 minutes without a laughable moment.

            "content": "Sadly, the entire Christopher Reeve Superman franchise has dated very badly since first release. I never saw the movies as a kid, so thus have no nostalgic affections for them; I watched them all recently, and was shocked by the naivety of the plotting and inexcusably poor special effects work.I know the first two films are regarded by some as classics, but I find them twee and dated. The third film is indescribably bad, and indeed the nadir of the series; THE QUEST FOR PEACE is thankfully the final of the Superman movies, and the good news is that it's not as bad as the last one. It's still incredibly lame, though, and I have to say that I only found it mildly entertaining because I treated it as a comedy throughout.The first half is dull, saddled with Reeve's grating slapstick as Clark Kent and Margot Kidder's own brand of screechy histrionics as Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is back and slumming it, although he's in it so infrequently that he doesn't fare as badly as the rest of the actors.The second half is where it gets slightly amusing, presenting large scenes of mindless destruction perpetrated by the movie's erstwhile villain, Nuclear Man (possibly the cheesiest, campest villain in film history). Cue the Great Wall of China exploding and a mini disaster scenario involving an erupting volcano. The effects are awful, but it's all quite funny, although nobody in their right mind could describe this as a \"good\" film. Add in some heavy-handed lefty politicising (of the same variety as Seagal's ON DEADLY GROUND) and you have a film that's memorable for all the wrong reasons.",

            "content": "I saw this movie when I was about 11 and liked it. Later I learned of all the scorn heaped upon it, and figured it was one of those shabby films that only seems entertaining when you're not old enough to scrutinize it in the least (e.g. the \"Ninja Turtles\" live-action movies). But I rented it today for curiosity's sake, and I still like it. I honestly don't understand why it's gone down in history as one of the worst films ever made. If any of them deserve scorn, it's \"Superman III.\" But that's a different review for a different day.I'm not going to claim this is a great film. It does have problems. Except for a few nicely-constructed models (particularly the Russian space station), the special effects are bargain basement. It doesn't have as many nice character moments as the first movies or \"Superman Returns.\" The plot doesn't flow naturally. The green crystal is an unsatisfying Deus ex machina (and really confusing in light of the first movie, although I think we're supposed to believe this is a separate crystal piece of the spaceship that we didn't see before \u2013 maybe they should've made it purple to avoid confusion). A number of things come up only to be dropped. And, perhaps most unfortunately, the real issues of the Cold War and nuclear disarmament aren't fully explored. But \"Superman IV\" is not a bad piece of entertainment, and it's refreshing to see a movie that depicts the world as a place where people can rise above all the hatred and evil and forge a better future.I could criticize this movie for being scientific nonsense, but the \"Superman\" movies have always been closer to fantasy than science fiction, and this isn't really any worse than the others. We have Superman talking in the vacuum of space and being heard by astronauts, but that happened in \"II\" with Ursa. And a lot has been made about how he telekinetically moves things in this movie by looking at them, but Zod did the same thing in \"II\" and that didn't seem to bother anyone. Him ringing the doorbell from the balcony to appear as Clark Kent once Lois turns her head is stretching credibility, and the part where Lacy is taken into space is stupid, but little things like that aren't what ruin a film in a series where heavy suspension of disbelief is par for the course. Lastly, none of the \"plot holes\" are that serious, and most of them are just a byproduct of the (admittedly clumsy) editing job done to improve the film's pacing and remove a braindead subplot.Now I'll focus on the positive things. The part where Clark playfully reveals himself as Superman to Lois, consults her for advice, then reinstates the mental block, is great. It was pretty much the only thing I remembered from watching the movie as a kid, and there's a reason. It's beautiful, funny, and provides insight into the Man of Steel's mind. The subplot with Lacy and her father is good for some laughs. The humor and drama are in a ratio that I consider good, as in \"Superman Returns\" and the Donner Cut of \"Superman II.\" Probably the biggest highlight is Lex Luthor. He may have natural hair for no apparent reason, but he's the same magnificent bastard he was in the two \"Superman\" films I love. The lines written for him and Gene Hackman's performance are both top notch. And, while I'm on the subject, Christopher Reeve does a great job too, although there isn't a whole lot to his role in this film (excepting the scene described above). On the minus side, Margot Kidder phones it in, and the rest of the supporting cast is so-so. Jon Cryer is wasted as Lex Luthor's teenage nephew.There is one thing that really annoys me about \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,\" mainly because it baffles the hell out of me. Holograms of Kryptonian elders appear to Kal-El in the Fortress of Solitude, and none of them are the same elders who appeared in the first two movies. Makes sense, couldn't get the actors, y'know. Except John Hollis, who played one of the Kryptonian elders in those movies, is in this movie in a totally different role (Soviet general). I mean, seriously, what's up with that? The bottom line: This isn't a bad movie. I don't know if I'd recommend buying it, but you should rent it if you like \"Superman,\" or if you want to show the kids something fun that isn't violent or obscene. It's a pleasant, optimistic, fairly engaging action-fantasy story, and it has lots to offer those who look to the '80s with nostalgia. And be sure to watch the deleted scenes, because one is better than anything in the feature. It's a clever bit of political commentary that depicts the Cold War arms race as an '80s arcade game, with all the quarters going to Lex Luthor and his fellow war profiteers.",

I remember when this came out on VHS in Australia in 1989 I was really excited and I also really enjoyed it. But the Video Ezy in the Lithgow Valley Shopping Centre lost their copy in 1990 and so I was never able to see it again. Believing that I was missing some magical piece from my child hood, I went out to buy the 2006 Collector' Edition box set, with the 5 theatrical Superman films, and Supergirl. Knowing this film's reputation, I watched it first to find out whether it was the treasure I remember it being. Not only did I sit through one of the most atrociously made movies I've ever seen, but I also realized that when I was 8 and loved this, I must have been a moron.There's a famous story from on the set of this movie that Reeve walked up to one of his co-stars on their first day filming and said something along the lines of \"this is going to be rough, but just grin and get through it.\" Reeve, like so many of the people working on this, knew it was a dead movie walking before they got there. I've no idea of the budget, but I'm guessing it wasn't much, and most of what was there was probably spent getting Reeve and Hackman to appear. The most distressing thing about watching this is the deteriorated condition of Margot Kidder (Lois Lane), who we now know was suffering severe mental issues at the time.Hackman returns, and gives his usual solid performance as Lex Luthor, who in this one makes Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow. Yes. Pillow. And after sitting through this, his only film credit, you'll need one), a hair metal reject with long fingernails, to fight Superman, a clever idea seeings as Superman has become obsessed with ridding the world of Nuclear weapons. My understanding of this part of the story is that Reeve was anti-nuclear and so wanted the message in the film and this may have been the main reason he signed up to do it. This may be why Reeve appears to try a lot harder than I would have to make the most of this horrible script. But I can't really talk about the plot. I was overcome by numbness. The greatness of the first two films, Reeve's presence, John Williams' uplifting score: It's all gone. Where had it gone so wrong? How had they squandered a hugely profitable franchise in just 5 or 6 years? It would be 18 years before anyone got another Superman movie off the ground. This is a cheaply made 83 minute funeral dirge. Reeve was right, this was rough, and all he and the cast and crew could do was grin and get through it. Fortunately, as viewers we have another option: turn the damned thing off and never watch it again.",

Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight...I think it was a ton, but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters.

The film is fast-moving, agreeable and amusing, including overwhelming action scenes apart from the expendable romantic interludes when Superman falls again for his old flame, being a charming piece of first-class entertainment , but sometimes downright dull third sequel . Funny and well-intentioned screenplay by Christopher Reeeve himself with a promising satiric start that is uneven developed through the movie, though providing a good sprinkly of sympathetic lines. The film contains thrills, abundant special effects, and noisy action that benefits from a wickest sense of humour and a joyous zing. However , special effects are dime-store quality and it appears that someone may have walked off with parts of the script . Fine cast with Christopher Reeve who is pretty good and excels in his fight against The Nuclear Man . As well as Gene Hackman in his usual role as ironical Lex Luthor , accompanied by his nephew John Cryer who's a true showman playing a crook and roguish boy , at his best. There are enough traditional as well as modern digital effects to satisfy the most avid Science Fiction and Fantasy fans . Along with two main starring : Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman , there are other secondaries delivering attractive interpretations, such as : William Hootkins , Jim Broadbent , Jackie Cooper , Robert Beatty , Marc McClure , Jon Cryer , Sam Wanamaker , Mark Pillow, Don Fellows and many others. Sparkling technicolor cinematography by Ernest Day lends the top-dressing to the proceedings . And, of course, catching soundtrack by Alexander Courage based on the great and prolific composer John Williams, including the classic leitmotif . The picture was regularly directed by Sidney J Furie , giving a lousy approach , only outstanding Reeve's characterization as Superman , but he cannot save this overwrought , overlong and embarrassing sequel .This high-flying series about Superman produced by Alexander, Yla Salkind are as follows : Superman 1978 by Richard Donner with Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marlon Brando, Terence Stamp, Maria Schell, Marc McClure . Superman 2 , 1980, by Richard Lester with Reeve, Kidder, Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas . Superman III by Richard Lester with Reeve, Richard Pryor , Annie Ross , Pamela Stephenson , Margot Kidder , Gene Hackman , Annette O'Toole . And in similar style Supergirl 1984 by Jeannot Szwarc with Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow.",

However, I can't help but feel for them just a little when it comes to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.  Sure they may have bank-rolled Three, which was a bit of a turkey in its own right, but then they had to sit back and see Supe's fourth incarnation absolutely butchered by the God-awful Cannon films.  In fact, they were probably laughing.  'Ha ha, even we could have done better than that!'Superman IV really, really needs a major overhaul.  It'll never happen of course, but it would be fun to see it.  The forty-five odd minutes of cut footage could be judiciously re-integrated into the film, whilst removing or re-editing existing stuff. (get rid of Nuclear Man taking Lacy out for a quick spin in space for a start - she would have been dead long before she could see the stars!!!) Then get hold of the original source prints for all the effects footage and digitally re-composite them to eliminate all the horrendous matte-lines. Remove the wires from the flying shots, and re-film the opening credits, which are, let's be honest, lame in the extreme. Then re-master the entire print, and upgrade the sound to 5.1 (hell, even DTS), add a load of extras and release the thing on DVD.  I'd buy it!!!Okay, okay, I know I'm dreaming.  It'll never happen, just as we're pretty unlikely to see a Donner re-cut of Superman II.  But the way I see it, if Anchor Bay can do such a bang-up job on Supergirl, with a Special Director's Cut well over two hours long, Warners could at least treat the Superman-loving public to longer cuts of their favourite films.  Even if the deleted scenes were just that: deleted scenes as a DVD extra.What do you think?End of rant - move along people, just go on back to your lives!",

The production values are so poor here that it is barely enjoyable. NOT a '1' movie, as 20% of voters seem to think, but I rate it '4'.Some SPOILERS are contained below, please do not read...* In the opening sequence, two satellites in the same orbit are moving a vastly different speeds, which is impossible. Also, Superman's voice cannot be heard in space.* The blue screen flying shots look very artificial.* We can clearly see pleats of a black curtain background for scenes on the moon.* Cables are clearly visible whenever people are lowered or pulled up.Sometimes I visit the 'goofs' board on IMDb, and laugh at some of the ridiculously nit-picking things people spot. But in this movie, they are not nit-picking. They are so obvious that they draw unnecessary attention to themselves, enough so that we wonder if they are purposeful. Regardless, it is still mostly entertaining, a worthwhile tribute to the comic book, but not a very well done movie in total.",

            "content": "The fourth film of the Superman(Christopher Reeve) saga has Superman pursuing a greater goal besides fighting for justice and romancing Lois Lane:eliminate the threat of Nuclear Arms on the World. This movie is one of my favorite Superman installments(after Superman 2).It has it all: a original plot( Superman's quest for peace), the return of Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor(played remarkably by Gene Hackman), a super villain just as powerful as Superman, Nuclear Man( the fighting scenes between them are outstanding), and new changes like the Daily Planet becoming a tabloid news paper. I was surprised to hear that this movie flopped at the box office and it was very criticized by fans, critics and viewers.In my opinion this film sunk because its message was very controversial.Even more Superman ceased to be an American exclusivity and look forward to every nations interests. The opening scene when Superman help a group of Russian cosmonauts in space , wow in 1987, i can only assume the thoughts of many viewers back then.The movie even suggested that there was an economical angle concerning the nuclear arms race(mainly through Lex Luthor).From my point of view, the reason this film flopped is because it meddled in to Politics.For many people super heroes belong in comic books, facing fictional problems( like for instance, an alien invasion).However it's very illogic to assume that Superman with all that power wouldn't take a stand on serious issues like nuclear arms and relegate to minor issues like saving a cat stuck on a tree.Many people expressed their dislike on this movie by focusing on the special effects.But not the entire movie has lower grade special effects, in fact there are only a few scenes.My favorite scenes like Superman worldwide chase of nuclear man, Superman missile round up in space, birth of nuclear man, metropolis show down have very good special effects. Nevertheless this movie didn't make it and it could be added to the list of films that flopped because of the audiences subjectivity.Botton line, yeah i like Superman 4 and i recommend it to anyone that haven't seeing it. In the other hand if anyone wants to see a Superman movie that's really Bad, see Superman Returns, this movie really sucks, and the irony is that it has great special effects.As anyone can't see, special effects are just one of several elements to analyze in a movie.",

            "content": "Much like part four of Star Trek was about saving the whales, part four of Superman also had its PSA: rid the world of nukes. That's what Superman did.I remember when I was a kid in the 80's there were bumper stickers that read: \"You can't hug a child with nuclear arms.\" That was state of affairs. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were in a fierce arms race and everyone was nervous. Little did we know that the Cold War was close to being over.Superman decided he'd had enough of the Cold War himself and he made an executive decision to destroy the planet's nukes. As I watched that scenario unfold I couldn't help but think: \"Superman, you may be doing the right thing, but you've just pissed off a lot of people.\"Think about it. If Superman were to arbitrarily decide to destroy all of the world's nukes--including America's--he would become public enemy number one. Sure, there would be some third world nations that love him for that being that they were probably already nuke-less, but his place of residence--that being the U.S.A.--would have a fit.They would be powerless to stop him or even to punish him by traditional means, but they would launch an anti-Superman campaign like nothing you've ever seen. Superman would be labeled a terrorist anti-American illegal alien enemy of the state. Kids would kick him and call him names. Adults would sneer, jeer, and boo him. Fox News and other networks would be dedicating multiple shows to castigating Superman. His name would be mud in the States. I think he'd leave.Because as noble of a gesture as it is to eliminate nuclear bombs, you can't just take peoples' bombs. That's like taking their guns. There will be a fight. Yet, surprisingly, Superman took the world's nuclear weapons with little to no resistance.Moving past the social issue I thought this was the worst of the four Supermans. The nemesis (Nuclear Man I think) was weak. Yes, he was powerful but he offered nothing else. Plus, he should have been called Solarman because he absolutely needed the sun's light to operate. He would shutdown instantly with the absence of sunlight. How pathetic is that?Imagine if your solar panels worked like that. The moment the sunset you would be out of power. Nuclear Man couldn't reserve any of that energy? Not even to pass through the shade of a tree?Between Superman's daft move and Nuclear Man being powerless in the dark (which they weren't consistent with), I didn't like this episode at all.",

As far as I'm concerned none of these problems can resolve its own.The film is so much different from the previous installments, and I felt a little alienated and lost while watching it. However I liked some moments, the best ones were with the campy Nuclear Man who shouted more than he spoke (he looks more like an extravagant wrestler than a clone of Superman) The final line was very prophetic while being ironic, and I'm glad that Superman returns is far more better than this monumental farce...Steve Baillargeon",

What is on screen looks cheap with poor story telling and rotten special effects and the nuclear man story carries no punch it is simply tame and lame. As a fan of the original I remember well taking in the movie at my old local cinema and leaving bitterly disappointed I had not seen the movie since until I watched this blue ray and time had not improved any of it.

Instead I will focus on the few good aspects of the movie. Chris Reeve is once again great in being superman and Gene Hackman is an absolute joy to watch as the menacing Luthor with only one thing on his mind \"Destroy superman\". The references to the first two movies e.g.flying sequence with Lois Lane and the well known score remind us of why they were so successful.I agree with the nonsensical space sequence but not so much with superman moving the moon. It's a comic book movie after all and in the first film he managed to get the earth out of orbit! You know the whole idea of a man flying and being invincible is quite impossible so why don't you pick on that too? In superman's world anything can happen.However what is painful for me personally is Warner Bros not being bothered to refurbish superman 4 just like Lucas did with the original star wars trilogy(added better sound, new scenes e.g. Hayden Christensen at the end of the return of the Jedi). They could use modern technology and hide the visible wires and improve the flying sequences. I am sure it won't be expensive. Plus why not even restore the 45 minutes of deleted footage? Dick Donner did so in the first film and also later this year a new restored cut of superman 2 is coming out with all the deleted Donner footage. Why not patch up a low budget effort and restore superman's former glory?For the performances of Reeve, Hackman and the rest of the common superman characters I chose to give this film 5 out of 10 and I hope that one day we will see it patched up.",

            "content": "The release of Superman 4 had many negative repercussions on those involved. Firstly it bombed at the box office, making only 15 million of its already low 17 million budget back. Secondly, it is recognised as causing the death of the live action superman franchise until Bryan Singers Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Reeve even recognised this film as the greatest failure of his career. Unfortunately all this is well founded as Superman 4 is amongst the worst superhero films due to the film getting almost everything wrong, short of having Super nipples. It tried to steer away from the comedy of the Lester Superman, but unfortunately had neither the drama nor action needed to do so. Reeve had credit in this film as writing the story. However there is good reason why this was Reeves only film writing credit as with a story this poor there was never any chance of the film being a success. The films title is very literal in that Superman is on a quest for peace by attempting to get rid of all the nuclear weapons on earth by gathering them all up and hurling them in to the sun. Yes, the film uses the logic that nuclear weapons are the real cause of war and it has little to do with those who have the weapons.Throughout it really tries to rub it in the viewers face that nuclear weapons are bad, as demonstrated by the villain named Nuclear Man. He's created by Luthor when he puts Supermans DNA to one of the missiles that Superman is hurling into the sun. Through this Luthor harnesses the sun's nuclear energy to create him and attempts to destroy Superman. Why the film didn't just use one of the many already existing villains in the Superman Roster like Bizarro is simply to reflect the message of nuclear weapons. The problem is by trying to simplify the concept of nuclear war, the message isn't being fed to us as much as it's being forced down our throats. Beyond this I suspect that in the 80's people already had the knowledge that nuclear weapons were dangerous without the guidance of Superman. Mixed with this are a lot of pointless subplots which get no focus and many of which don't even get a conclusion. For example a girl named Lacy falls in love with Clark Kent for no other reason than the script demands it. A lot of time is devoted to antics such as Clark having to juggle a double date with both Lois and her by switching between Clark and Superman. But at the end of the film then it just feels like the film forgets entirely about the sub plot. Partly this could be because there are many scenes in the original that were either cut or unreleased due to budget being cut from 36 million dollars to 17 million just before filming was about to begin. This meant they could not film some scenes and others were unusable leading to a gaping number of plot holes in the films.These budget cuts also led to the film having awful special effects which are comparable to the special effects of films like Shark Attack 3. This is why throughout the film you'll see the same shot of superman flying several times as a way of cutting costs. These terrible effects lead to what I would have to call one of the worst fights in a superhero film with a mixture of the worst effects and the worst fight choreography I've seen in film. All they seem to do is throw each other and fly away. Mixed with this are some ridiculously over the top moments such as Superman repairing the Great Wall of China or putting back the statue of liberty. All of this goes together to making this into the worst Superman movie. I can see why this film ended the franchise for so long as failed in almost every way from the script filled with plot holes, awful special effects and the lack of humour making it the worst of the Superman franchise by a long shot. Saying that, this film does fall under the \"so bad it's funny\" category as it's funny to see just how many major plot holes there are ranging from a woman breathing in space to Superman going from near dead to one scene to alive and well in the next. But based on the political message this film was trying to be it was most certainly a failure.",

I can't even put a finger on what is the #1 worst aspect of this movie.It blatantly steals scenes from the first 3 chapters, mimicking whole chapters in mere seconds. It has literally some of the worst special effects that make the rubber Godzilla look frightening. (If I saw a very fake-looking Superman fly directly into the screen one more time, after the first 23 shots like this, I was going to vomit.) It has absolutely no sense of logic. Superman's hair can hold a 1000 pound ball, but is easily clipped with pliers. Apparently no one needs a oxygen in space. Superman can simply rebuild the Great Wall of China by merely looking at it, in addition to plugging up a volcano. The law of gravity doesn't apply here \u2013 so fly, Lois, fly! Nuclear Man's one weakness (shade) is only used when the plot needs it.The extremely basic plot (as this movie seems to be directed to kids 2 and under) is: Superman decides after reading a \"Dear Superman\" letter to rid the world of nuclear weapons, so Lex jumps on the bandwagon to make a profit while cloning Superman in the form of Nuclear Man.I can say there's one positive to the hell that is 'Superman IV': this could have been even worse \u2013 take an extra 30 minutes and watch all the deleted scenes.

I saw the third movie many, many years ago and enjoyed it a lot, mainly because of Richard Pryor. \"Lois and Clark\" was my favorite version of the story, and then there were some George Reeves reruns many years ago. I've never seen the first two movies. When they were on broadcast TV, I just wasn't interested. The first was on Ion, but I don't have it.This movie, though, was the first one where I saw nerdy, clumsy Clark and really enjoyed what I saw. The third movie had the character but I didn't pay attention.I especially liked Clark's efforts to keep Lois and Lacy from finding out he was Superman. I didn't care for this Lois, and her near-absence from the third movie was a positive. I wanted Clark to have a relationship with the beautiful Lacy, who sort of reminded me of Erica Durance.It was interesting to see Clark given advice by a female voice. I'm used to his mentor being male. These scenes where he learns the great truths he must know are always enjoyable.Gene Hackman made a great cartoonish Lex. I'm used to the darker, complicated portrayal by the excellent Michael Rosenbaum, but I normally prefer comedy. I can't say one is better than the other. And with the always enjoyable buffoon Jon Cryer as his sidekick, that's even better.I've missed seeing the morally upright hero in the blue and red suit who is known by all, and I enjoyed seeing him use his powers, even if some of the special effects were obviously just that. Right now, I mostly see a flawed hero in training who moves too fast to be seen, but whose deeds are known. There's something more satisfying about seeing this perfect person who, for reasons no one will explain, no one recognizes as looking just like Clark Kent if Clark just took off those glasses.I was disappointed with the portrayal of Perry White. I've seen much better acting.No, it wasn't one of the greatest movies of all time, and it can't compare to what I've heard about the first two. It was just a fun and silly adventure, one where no one gets hurt except Superman (who can heal himself), so the whole family can watch. Maybe some younger kids shouldn't see some of the implied violence, but even with incidents where people would die in real life, they come out all right, as if Tom Bergeron were narrating.",

            "content": "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)** (out of 4) The death nail in the series finds Superman (Christopher Reeve) having to once again go up against Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) who has now wants to use Nuclear Man for his wild schemes. SUPERMAN IV turned out to be a huge bomb with critics, fans and the box office and it's really easy to see why. The first three movies were \"A\" productions and even though the third movie was awful, it at least was a \"Superman movie.\" This film here is in no way, shape or form an \"A\" production and in fact it's closer to a \"C.\" With that in mind, I think the film can be slightly entertaining as long as you don't take it too serious and are willing to laugh a bit. I say laugh because there's no question that Cannon slashed the budget as there are some pretty laughable effects throughout this thing. The \"C\" production also meant that this thing really did feel like those silly and campy sci-fi movies from the 1950s that people would be watching at a drive-in. I think on this level the movie can be somewhat entertaining but again, I realize that fans of the series don't want this type of movie and that's why they continue to hate it and probably just pretend that it was never made. The film's story is incredibly sloppy and bounces all over the place but I'm going to guess that this here is mainly due to thirty-plus minutes being cut off the running time. While that certainly hurt the story I must think that most viewers are happy they didn't have to sit through more than 90-minutes. The shorter running time certainly helps because the campy charm would be gone had this been longer. Reeve is still good in the lead roles but there's no question that everyone else seems bored. This includes Hackman who believe it or not was just coming off HOOSIERS. Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure and Margot Kidder are all just collecting paychecks but Mariel Hemingway does come off pretty good. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man is a real hoot if you know what I mean. SUPERMAN IV will always be remembered as a complete and utter disaster but one really shouldn't take it too serious today.",

Although for my money, this wasn't the worst of the Superman movie franchise. That would have been the third installment with Richard Pryor creating a new low in the annals of sequel history. But that's not to say they didn't try here (for a new low that is). Nuclear Man? Seriously? As outlandish as some of the concepts introduced by the comic books might have been, at least they maintained a semblance of continuity and consistency. Clark Kent would NEVER reveal his secret identity to anyone back in the day, until it came time to marry Lois Lane, but that was later on in 1995 (in the comics). And that business with Luthor cutting a strand of Superman's hair? You know, the hair that could support a thousand pound weight - very poor.For all intents and purposes, the franchise would have been well served to deliver the first two films and call it a day. Even \"Superman Returns\" managed to bother me with it's revisionist history, but at least it scored considerably better with it's story line and special effects. A more fitting send off for this one would have been 'Superman IV - Rest in Peace'.",

            "content": "I have seen recently a lot of arguments about Superman 4, mainly from people who argue that the film's message of nuclear disarmament should trump any problems with effects and story development. No movie, however noble it tries to be, is above criticism if it fails to capture the viewer. And Superman 4's problems completely overshadow any of its noble stances.Let's start with the most obvious flaw, the special (used loosely) effects. Anyone (like those I mention above) who say effects are unimportant to the movie's message need more bran in their diets. Great effects are most important in films such as these to create the illusion that the man we see on screen is really doing what he's doing. The first two Superman films did this, and are classics. Superman 4 fails at even the most basic effects. The flying scenes are the worst; you can see the wires in several shots, and the one particular shot of Superman (and Nuclear Man) coming straight at the camera is seen over and over again. In addition, the effects for space (black curtains) are visible, and there are many examples of bad green screening (the scene where Clark and Lois fall from his balcony being the most blatant).The story is also choppy in its execution. The basic premise is that Superman (Chris Reeve) is trying to destroy all nuclear weapons to protect Earth, but Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) to destroy him. On paper, it's a good start. However, the story is littered with subplots that do little to nothing to advance the story (a direct result of editing 45 minutes out of what was released to theaters). Where did Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) come from? Why does Lacy Warfield (played uninspiredly by Mariel Hemingway) have the hots for Clark? How does the computer in the missile with the DNA for Nuclear Man know how to create him AND a costume from simple black material? None of these are explained, and it leaves you confused as to why these characters are important.The actors try their best with the material they have; Reeve turns in as good a performance as you could expect (though he isn't as svelte as he was previously, a minor quibble) as Hackman is good. As I stated, though, Hemingway is a bore as Lacy, and Nuclear Man will forever be identified with the 80s (not to mention Pillow never gets to actually be heard, since Hackman's voice is dubbed over his). That said, if the material was better, the performances would've stood out more.Then there are scenes which leave you simply scratching your head. How does Clark find another green crystal in the spaceship on his farm (didn't he take it out in Superman 1)? Another one is the scene where Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with...Super Repair Vision? I've never heard of him using that in the comics! Of course, the ultimate silly scene is near the end of the movie, when Nuclear Man takes Lacy into space...and she can breathe normally!!! Isn't that physically impossible??? Not to mention it's immediately followed by Superman moving the moon out of orbit to block the sun and take Nuclear Man's power away. Watch out for tidal waves, Earth!In conclusion, Superman 4 will be remembered as a cinematic failure in spite of its intentions to educate the world about the dangers of nuclear weapons. While the actors try hard, they can't overcome the obvious lack of care from the producers about developing the story and making the film look good. And when the producers don't care, why should the viewing public care?",

The rest of the regular cast turn in okay performances, and the newcomers are mixed.

Lenny should have been in a cage, not acting in a movie. Mariel Hemingway? I admire her acting talents and truly believe she is a very under-rated and under-appreciated actress, but she belonged less in this movie than Arnold Schwarzenegger at a baby shower. What was she thinking? And what happened to the budget? Where are those effects? Why does Superman fly like he no longer knows how? They couldn't afford another wire for his feet? And speaking of wires, when he lands on the moon, WHY didn't they edit out the wires?! Appalling!And what happened to Clark Kent? He was bumbling, but lovable. Now he's this dork who trips over his own two feet and can't carry on a coherent or half-way intelligent conversation? What happened? This has every aspect of a poorly-made \"B\" movie. How very disappointing.Did they put everything they had into \"Masters of the Universe\" and just say to h3LL with Superman? What? I do not know what anyone who was involved with this was thinking , but everyone should have just taken a breather, found a reality check, and done something else for 8 months instead. Margot Kidder, though still and always a bright beacon in every performance which I have ever had the pleasure to witness, looks drawn and tired; as though she is still in shock at having been drawn into yet another of these movies. And Mark Pillow?! WTF?! Look him up here on IMDb. He's done a grand total of....TWO things!! Nuclear Man in this and an appearance in some obscure TV show. Go figure. Again, with the low budget.The budget for this movie was obviously a paltry sum compared to the other three installments. A cheap and petty thing to do to Reeve. He deserved so much more from the producers of this travesty. And so did the fans.Do yourself a favor and just forget they made this one. Love 1, 3, and yes, even 2, but skip this one. Keep your love of Reeve and Superman intact.Premise In the face of the end of the cold war, America has decided to strive to be \"second to none\" in their stockpiling of nuclear arms. Superman has been enlisted to help save the world from itself, by a young student. Meanwhile, the Daily Planet has been taken over by the tabloid king from H3LL, and Editor Perry White (veteran actor Jackie Cooper) is chomping at the bit to knock the new owner cold.Furthermore, Lacy Warfield (Hemingway), the new owner's daughter, is after Clark, or Superman..or Clark?..or Superman?..so on a double date with Lois, Lacy and Clark and Superman...all have a really tragic time. Confused yet? So were the actors, apparently, as this scene was about the most ludicrous thing I've ever had to witness. This is where Clark Kent becomes an incoherent boob, instead of the lovable absent-minded, mild-mannered man we all admired./PremiseThis production attempts to be political, but it just does not manage to pull it off. The whole lack of budget and lack of quality throughout does not manage to do anything but damage the franchise, in my opinion, and was a bitter disappointment.However, do let me state, that the flaw was not in the writing, but in the direction. The premise was a good one. It could have worked. They just had their minds on \"MotU,\" rather than on Superman, where it belonged. MotU, while it does carry with it some cult following, was a total bomb in the mainstream audience. Not even Billy Barty could save it.I LOVE Margot Kidder's acting. But WHY has she never grown accustomed to those dentures? Or is that some kind of anomaly? Just a question.Additionally, there are a number of irregularities in this film. Did anyone notice the fact that they had it daytime in the US, Italy, and in China at the same time? Or that the capes billow even with no atmosphere on the moon? Or that the whole fight scene on the moon was slow motion to imply 0 gravity, even though gravity would affect neither Superman nor Nuclear Man? Or that the flag pole was irreparably bent when Superman was knocked onto it and yet it's straight as an arrow after the fight? Or that Mark Pillow was about the worst excuse for an actor since Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan? Or that by moving the moon as he did, Superman would have destroyed Earth and everyone on it? Or that Lacy would not have survived outside our atmosphere with or without Nuclear Man's being conscious? Or that she would have burned up on re-entry, regardless of Superman's having her in his arms? Or that Superman now has the ability to hover in the air, rather than fly? When did that happen? Or that Superman can move fast as a speeding bullet, yet when he's fighting or trying to save someone, he's about as slow as an 80 year old Alzheimer's patient on gin? Wow what a disgrace.This sad attempt rates a 1.3/10 from...the Fiend :.",

As trivia has it, this script came from sincere environmentalist intentions and that the slashed budget was this movie's death sentence. Ehhh, I dunno about that (double the budget, and I still think the script had tanker- sized holes). But here's the thing: I like this movie. It's not well-made by any stretch, but it really boils down to nostalgia; and a powerful drug, that. I was a young'un in 1987, making this the first Superman movie I saw on the big screen. Even with poor execution, it was still Christopher Reeve, and the mere presence of Superman personified is enough to paper over pretty much everything this movie does badly. And just the sight of him donning the cape and putting on a brave face despite certain box office travesty just taps right into the joy of seeing the character come to life before my very eyes at a young age. My wife groans at the mention of this movie, and she's right. But if there's anything to be said for an actor owning his role and convincing children that this isn't really a turkey, it's \"The Quest for Peace\". And I stand by that. 6/10",

            "content": "1983's 'Superman 3' seemed to be the end for the money-spinning franchise based on the long-running D.C. comic. Christopher Reeve said at the London premiere: \"We don't want to flog it to death like they do on television!\". After attempting ( and failing ) to get a 'Supergirl' franchise launched, Alexander and Ilya Salkind sold the 'Superman' rights to the Cannon Group - Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus - the team responsible for tatty, forgettable movies such as Chuck Norris' 'The Delta Force' and Richard Chamberlain's 'King Solomon's Mines'.They lured back Reeve by offering him a bigger role in the new film's production. He promised a return to the epic style of the first movie, directed some second unit work and was responsible for the basic storyline - concerned at the escalating insanity of the Cold War, Superman breaks his vow of non-interference in other cultures by collecting every nuclear missile he can find and hurling it into the sun.In the meantime, The Daily Planet has been bought by David Warfield ( Sam Wanamaker ), a Rupert Murdoch-like figure who wants to drive it down market. His attractive daughter Lacy ( Mariel Hemingway ) has her eyes set on nerdy Clark. The newly-escaped Lex Luthor ( Gene Hackman ) creates a superhero of his own - Nuclear Man ( Mark Pillow ) - using D,N.A, contained in a lock of Superman's hair. N.M. looks like an extra from 'The Robe' and glows with the power of the Sun. With Reeve back in the cape, Hackman and Margot Kidder returning as 'Lois Lane' ( she was barely on screen in the previous film ) despite her earlier threat to quit, the new film looked to be a surefire winner. It was brave to make a film with a strong pacifist message at the time Reagan was in The White House.What went wrong? For one thing, the cheapness of the production is evident in almost every scene. 'Superman' movies should never look cheap. This is no more noticeable than the sequences where Superman destroys the warheads and where Nuclear Man is created - they are the same. Where did Superman find a fishing net big enough to take every warhead on Earth? The fight with Nuclear Man lacks thrills, resembling as it does a bargain basement remake of the scrap with the Kryptonian villains in the second film. Pillow is laughable as N.M., coming across like a Las Vegas male stripper with ideas above his station.The weak script shamelessly recycles ideas such as the 'can you read my mind?' scene from the first film. The lapses of logic are such a three year old year could spot them - how does Lacy survive being in outer space without oxygen? 'Peace' flopped and it would be 2006 before Superman was seen again, by which time Reeve had sadly passed on. The actor later attacked the movie on the B.B.C.'s 'Wogan' show, without referring to the producers by name. A heartbreaking finale to what had started out as a wonderful comic-book series. We can only give thanks that Golan and Globus never got round to making 'Spider-Man'!",

Released in 1987 it's by no means a good film, it received universal hate upon release for cheap looking special effects, inconsistencies and plot holes. But over the years the film has gained cult status due to its cheesy dialogue, poor acting and far fetched plot making it enjoyable for all of the wrong reasons. It set the standard for bad superhero movies long before Batman & Robin was released.Superman/Clark Kent still works for The Daily Planet newspaper but it has gone bankrupt and tabloid tycoon Petty White takes over. His seductive daughter becomes the new editor and takes a liking to the bumbling clumsy Clark Kent. Lois Lane gets jealous and it becomes a pointless love triangle which (like everything else) leads nowhere.Anyway, Superman wants to rid the world of it's nuclear weapons and so every country (including Russia...) decide to help him gather all of these weapons so he can launch them into the sun. Meanwhile with the help of his annoying punk nephew, Lex Luther escapes prison and in the most far fetched plan you'll ever see, he creates his own super villain known as Nuclear Man, complete with spandex and an 80's mullet.Logic is thrown out of the window with this one, Nuclear Man takes a human being into outer space and she survives just fine.... We know it's about an alien who can fly etc but a human in space... It's like a 3 year old wrote the script. There isn't an ounce of respect for the previous films or the comics, Superman IV feels like a spoof. The first two films had their goofy moments and they were never 100% grounded in reality but at least they made sense. This one is just a jumbled mess and it's like they made it up as they went along.It would have been interesting to see Superman go up against these nuclear weapon obsessed countries. But instead they wanted to have multiple/unnecessary plot lines involving Lois Lane, Lex Luther and Nuclear Man all of which just ruin whatever potential the film ever had. There are a few tiny moments in the film which they could have further developed, but clearly the makers of this film were less concerned about quality and more concerned in milking this franchise for some easy money. Overall there is about 10 minutes of decent stuff in the movie, the rest is just a joke.The film was doomed from day one, with budget cuts and numerous other production troubles making the final product laughably awful. Reeve and Kidder both did good jobs but it eventually ruined their careers. Gene Hackman clearly had the most fun, but most likely because he received a big pay cheque for his return. There were also so many scenes left on the cutting room floor and it's very noticeable, they basically released an incomplete film. It's stupid, illogical and just plain dumb.",

Worst bluescreen effects ever: superman just seems like a blueish/greenish/reddish cardboard cutout sliding over the screen sideways much like the Terry Gilliam cutouts from Monty Python but here it's not meant to be funny (I think). Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is nothing more then a clownesque nobody assisted by his 'slick' greaser highschool nephew. Superman's nemesis 'Nuclear Man' -created from superman's DNA- turns out to be a 80s hair-metal Neanderthal in spandex who's lines of dialogue consist mainly of 'Arrrghh'. Compared to modern day superman this one looks like a pyjama wearing nerd with his over-sized red underwear on the outside with matching plastic boots. I'm sure he wouldn't draw any attention in a gay bar. They always say films are made in the cutting room but here the editor must have shaken his head and thought there was nothing to be saved. Don't get me started on the plot: christopher reeve co-wrote the story...probably when he was high on LSD or something. (Spoiler) At a certain point in the film superman gets rid of all the nukes in the world by plucking them out of the sky, gathering them in a giant ball and swinging them into the sun. Also people can breathe in space. This film is just a disaster of epic proportions and you really have to see it to believe it. I'm sure this is used in Film Schools around the world as reference material on how NOT to make a film.",

(Too expensive and ambitious) There were a lot of great ideas they couldn't afford to film. The special effects look \"2D\" and you can see the \"flying\" wires. A shimmering black \"space\" curtain from \"Lost in Space.\" Plot exposition would have explained why \"Lacy\" didn't die in space while flying with Nuclear Man: Is there an air bubble surrounding super heroes? A comment like this would have make it more believable as to why she could breathe in space and didn't freeze to death.2nd Plot error: There is no sun (or sunrise) on the dark side of the moon. The villain would not have revived. This short movie would have been ever shorter.Major plot error: No one can cut Superman's hair except Superman, with his own laser-heat vision.If you think the edited movie is bad, just watch the deleted scenes on the DVD. The scenes with Lex Luthor and the prototype before Nuclear Man are just horrible. The film editors saved a very bad movie and made it at least passable. It plays better on the small screen.If you dislike this movie, don't even think of watching \"Supergirl\" which was another waste of a good franchise.",

            "content": "Isn't the entire basis of this film utter rubbish? The Ace Nuclear Treaty had already been signed in reality by Reagan & Gorbechov so the nuclear arms race was slowing down, not speeding up.The start is pretty dire. Again Lex Luthor has hair and how his nephew got anywhere near the quarry full of prisoners isn't addressed at all. That place would be crawling with armed guards. And the 2 cops in the car should have been killed in the blast as well.For someone so hot on law and order, Clark Kent certainly jaywalks a lot doesn't he? In both this and Superman II, he crosses the street illegally.And since when did London Underground trains start running in America? And Lois still hasn't learned her lesson? Superman never notices her unless he's rescuing her. She needs to stop trying to attract his attention at rescues. Makes you think she gets into trouble on purpose.Since when have newspapers been in the market of making money? They report the news.Superman's hair is only any good for DNA if it had a root, which they most likely didn't know back then. Oh, and if it can hold a 1000 pound weight, why can't it stand a pair of bolt-cutters? Funny how by this movie Lois seems to remember everything that he made her forget with the kiss in Superman II, so he has to make her forget with that kiss again. What is on his lips that does that? Jeremy with Superman was obviously filmed in New York, you could see the NYPD mounted officer and the square they were stood in was obviously near the World Trade Centre - The then HQ of the UN.The mistake of labeling a delegate ENGLAND, (We would be labeled United Kingdom, NOT England - that would be an insult to the Welsh, The Scottish, The Irish and The Manx).The missiles that the submarines fire would be useless to Superman in his attempt to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Test fires are never armed and normally don't carry warheads either.Does Superman know what damage he would do to the Solar System by throwing all those nuclear weapons into the sun? All that extra radiation that would be showered down onto the Earth. IDIOT! Jim Broadbent playing a Russian is very amusing. As well as the other arms dealer with the mustache who is very English, he appeared in Ever Decreasing Circles as Richard Briars' neighbor.The Sgt. York joke (when Lex is planting the device on the missile) is so quick it's missed by most people watching. No-one asked Luthor or any of his party for ID (highly unlikely in an area launching nuclear missiles. He'd be asked for ID then shot on sight for not having any, the military don't screw around with live nuclear weapons).How is it that Nuclear Man is a fully grown adult? And how did he learn to speak? Or fly? Plus he seems to know what his mission is \"Destroy Superman now!\", without anyone having told him that vital information.Lois says to Lacey in THAT dress that \"Clark's not going to notice, no matter what you wear\". Clark isn't gay, he's got eyes. And Lois had already described her as \"illegal\". Jealous, Lois? Why Clark didn't change into Superman in the hotel's revolving doors instead of getting in the back of a car (Superman breaks into cars, yet more lawlessness by Clark Kent) I don't know.Oh, and how did Clark ring the door bell when Superman was still inside the room? If Nuclear Man is a clone from Superman's DNA, why doesn't he look like Superman? I don't see how Superman can stop a Volcano by plugging it up. Pressure builds up and the plug would just be ejected, it'd be a matter of time. Why not just do freezing breath inside the Volcano to cool it. Still plugging it but in a more natural way how real Volcano's become dormant.Why is The Statue Of Liberty in Metropolis? Just another sign this was filmed in New York. Oh, and I don't care how strong Nuclear Man is supposed to be or how sharp his nails are but he wouldn't cut Superman's skin.This attempt to show Superman with a human side had already been done in Superman II when he gave up his powers to live with Lois and got beaten up in the diner by the trucker. Try and come up with some new ideas? I like the very bad cut when Lex was holding the money that Nuclear Man set fire to then they cut and his hand was by his side, no longer up by his face. And we're always told glowing green crystals are Kryptonite but the one at the farm seems to help the very sick looking Clark? The fight in Metropolis between Superman and Nuclear Man is basically a rip-off of the fight between him, Zod, Non & Ursa in Superman II. He even uses that \"don't do it, the people\" line that he said back then.Exactly WHICH woman does Nuclear Man want? He's never met Stacey or Lois so exactly who did he mean? He knows nothing about either woman or what possible use they could be to him as hostages.They even copy fighting on The Moon which had also already been done in Superman II, basically this film recycled a lot of ideas from Superman II. As well as the ideas of a bad self and the duality ideas used creating an \"Evil Superman\" in the original motion picture.Can anyone tell me why Nuclear Man roars exactly like old style Godzilla from the Japanese films? For such a tough villain, Nuclear Man is defeated FAR too easily in my eyes. The film just ran out of ideas I guess.",

This is one of the most underrated films I've liked since I was a kid. Reeve had a decent story, but Cannon screwed up the film with cheesy effects and too many scenes were cut.

            "content": "The late Christopher Reeve is still widely remembered for his very famous portrayal of Superman, and \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" was the fourth and final film in which he played the comic book character on the silver screen. This movie was released eight years before the actor was sadly paralyzed by a horseback riding accident, after which he lived nine years as a quadriplegic and then died at the age of 52. The final film starring Reeve as the Caped Wonder unfortunately turned out to be a very poorly received one, and knowing that, I obviously didn't have high expectations before I watched it, even though the third film of the four turned out to be better than I thought. While I certainly don't think \"Superman IV\" is quite as bad all around as many others do, I still think it was not a good one for Reeve to finish with.Lex Luthor, Superman's old foe, is now in a prison chain gang, but his nephew, Lenny, helps him escape! The criminal plans to find a way to kill Superman so Earth's hero from Krypton won't be around to stop his evil deeds! He goes to a Metropolis museum with his nephew, where they steal a strand of hair from the Caped Wonder's head which is on display there. The United States and the Soviet Union could soon be engaging in a nuclear war, and Superman decides to prevent this by ridding the planet of all nuclear weapons, gathering up missiles and throwing them to the sun. Meanwhile, Luthor intends to use solar energy and the strand of hair he has acquired to create a very powerful, evil being that can rival Superman. He launches a missile into space with the new genetic compound attached to it, and the Caped Wonder throws this one to the sun as well, not realizing that this will complete Luthor's task! A creature named Nuclear Man then comes to Earth and soon begins to destroy! This fourth installment in the franchise doesn't start out so bad, with Superman saving a Russian astronaut, though this part already shows what the movie's special effects are like, which is one of the things \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is highly criticized for. As the film progresses, more severe flaws start to show. I saw Jon Cryer in \"Pretty in Pink\" this month, and found that he could be very annoying in that high school dramedy, so I wasn't surprised when I saw that his performance in this film as Lenny was weak. In both films, he tries to be funny, but fails. The way his character here tricks the guards in order to get his uncle out of the chain gang is ridiculous! Another rather weak performance here is from Mariel Hemingway as Lacy Warfield, who has a number of lousy lines, such as, \"All men like me. I'm very, very rich.\" This character trying to win over Clark Kent, in such scenes as her lying on a desk in a flirtatious manner as she sees him coming, is another ridiculous aspect of the movie, and sadly, so is Nuclear Man, an unsurprisingly badly crafted villain. If there's supposed to be humour in this film, it also fails, as I kept a straight face throughout. Nuclear Man saying, \"If you will not tell me, I will hurt people,\" is the only part that ALMOST made me smile, and I don't even know if this is supposed to be funny! Another thing, how does the Lacy character, a human mortal, still breathe when she is taken into space?! As a superhero franchise movie, this fourth installment in the \"Superman\" franchise is not as bad as \"Batman & Robin\", but obviously, that's not saying much. Many viewers might say that this final film starring Christopher Reeve as the DC Comics character is horrendous from start to finish, and if so, I disagree with that, as I would certainly be lying if I said I didn't find any tension in the film. I have to admit that I didn't find every single moment and every single cast performance to be poor (I didn't find anything wrong with Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor here, even though this time he had to work with Jon Cryer doing a bad job playing Lenny Luthor), and feel that I could rate the film five out of ten instead of four, even if many would think I'm crazy for that! Still, I would say \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is a pretty lacklustre effort overall, with some memorably severe flaws. I'm sure it could have turned out a lot better if it had been more focused, and Reeve could have gone out with a bang.",

But it inspired so many comic book stuff, like Doomsday and Cat Grant were inspired from Nuclear Man and Lacy Warfield. Which those actors don't deserve the hate they get for this film. I thought Mariel Hemingway did a lovely job as Lacy, and despite his cheesy role, Mark Pillow did what he could.\nI think this movie deserves a second chance because it's message was about peace, which is what modern Superman movies like Man of Steel ignore greatly.

Instead of just foiling super villains and saving the world as usual, the clowns at Golan-Globus decided to use the comic medium as a diatribe against nuclear weapons...for in Superman IV it's not dastardly super villains or cunning plots that are the real danger...it's just nukes. Nukes, and Lex Luthor.I shouldn't have to remind you that there's probably nobody on earth who isn't afraid of nuclear war. It's one of the scariest threats to modern civilisation. That said, the way this film simplifies the ideas of war and international relations is completely ridiculous. Forget that the threat of mutually assured destruction may have actually helped to prevent conventional wars, and forget that without nuclear arsenals many nations on this planet would probably be under serious threat, Superman IV takes the approach that things would just be peachy if all the nukes were just destroyed. Who's going to make sure nobody builds more, and who is going to stop nations like Israel from being utterly squashed after Superman takes all the nukes away? Who really cares? The movies approach to this very serious issue is completely absurd, and serves as a lesson on what NOT to do with your super hero movie. It's morals are as confused as the idiots who green lighted this idea.With that out of the way, there's plenty of other reasons to hate this film. The writing is laughable, the characters (namely Lenny Luthor) are annoying, and the special effects are horrendous. Unlike the first films, Superman IV over uses the same practical and green screen effects countless times. The movie's 'dumb' in the sense that science, once again, does anything the script demands. Humans breathing in space and Superman moving the moon out of orbit to fight nuclear man are just a couple examples of how childish this film gets. I can buy Superman's 'mind erasing kiss' or even him flying back in time if it's only happening once and a while, but in Superman IV every time I hear Luthor talk about how the sun is just a 'big bomb' or anything like this I just want to cringe.'Nuclear Man' seems like an interesting idea for a villain, but the way he's created and just about everything about him is hilariously bad. This villain looks like a surfer-dude in a bad, chopped up, power rangers costume. Thanks to bad special effects and terrible fighting choreography, the action sequences are about as boring as everything else about this film.If you enjoyed Reeves' other Superman films but haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favour and don't. It's shlock with very little redeeming value outside of it's own hilarious absurdity.",

            "content": "I remember when I first heard about \"Superman 4\" being produced, and the names Golan/Globus were uttered. My first thought: The guys who do the Chuck Norris movies? And, second: It's going to be bad! When my roommate and I went to see \"S4\" the week it came out, my thoughts unfortunately came true. From the glittery opening credits (glitter?), to (spolier alert!) Lex Luthor bring put back into his prison rock quarry (I didn't know they still had those), \"Superman 4: The Quest For Peace\" is simply a well-intentioned idea executed badly. Christopher Reeve's basic idea was a good one, but Cannon simply dropped the ball due to greed (using not only the original budget, but even MORE money given to them by Warner Bros., to shore up other failures, including \"He-Man and The Masters Of The Universe\") and incompetence. Margot Kidder looks pale, with EXTREMELY mascaraed eyes, but she does manage to convey her love for Superman. Mariel Hemmingway had nothing to work with as Lacy Warfield, but she serves her purpose of being pretty (despite the odd costume designs that she, and everyone else, sports). Gene Hackman is sleep-acting through his role, but he still manages to make Lex snidely evil. The less said about Jon Cryer's performance, the better (\"The Dude of Steel? Boy, are you gonna get it!\") As for Mark Pillow? You can't fault him too much- it was his first film, and he was picked to be the sex-appeal villain (plus, his cheesy costume does him no favors.) His lines mainly consist of mouthing roars that are post-dubbed by Gene Hackman. Chris Reeve is still Superman, and his performance is his usual best. The effects are amusingly bad- flying strings abound unremoved, the models look like just what they are-models- and some of them are just bizarre. Who knew Supes had a spare mesh bag put away if she should just happen to gather all the worlds' nuclear missiles and toss them into the sun? And, who knew the Earth's countries had THAT many missiles? Who knew you could move the moon out of its orbit without causing massive problems on Earth? FINALLY, who knew you could breathe in space? Lacy Warfield has no problems doing it while hanging onto the unconscious Nuclear Man! I could go on, but if you're reading this you've most likely seen \"S4\", and understand about the effects completely. As bad as this film is, though, I find myself watching it again and again, maybe hoping that a Happy Film Fairy worked their magic and changed the film, making it better. Reeve and Kidder (as well as the rest of the film series' cast) do their best with what they have to work with. Once Chris Reeve had his accident and ended up in a wheelchair, my heart sank knowing he'd never be able to do another Superman film, and possibly end the series on a higher note than \"S4\" did. But, \"Superman 4\" is what it is, and (Spolier alert?) the Deluxe Edition DVD offers a bunch of deleted scenes(with stock music and unfinished effects)that show what \"S4\" could have been if the premiere screening hadn't been so negative as to cause massive re-editing. The film would've made a lot more sense in certain parts, and (in my opinion), a lot more fun. \"S4\" is bad, yes, but not repulsively so. Just to be able to see Chris Reeve and Lois Lane fly around the world again (albeit badly!) makes \"Superman 4: The Quest For Peace\" worth another viewing. It''d be nice to see the complete cut used for the aforementioned secret screening, but until that happens, we have this version. Which, for entertainment and nostalgia, is alright. Chris Reeve's heart was in the right place, but Cannon Films' heart was not. A shame.P.S.: If you can find a copy of the\"International Version\" somehow (I recorded it on VHS from Superstation TBS several years ago), you'll see two scenes featured in the DVD Deleted Scenes section, but fully integrated into the film (full music and effects): Superman saves a little girl (actually, Chris Reeve's young daughter) from a tornado in what looks like Kansas (or possibly, Smallville): and, Superman saves Russian politicians from a nuclearmissle that Nuclear Man aims at them.",

Christopher Reeve goes above and beyond yet again, despite a mediocre script. The plot is fairly decent, with the exception of Nuclear Man. Good sweet Jesus, this has got to be one of the worst villains in comic book movie history, and by far the worst Superman villain. He does a hell of a job of eerily sucking the hope out of any scene he's in. Superman III, while bad as well, is better than this. This is easily the worst Superman movie (And one of the worst comic book/superhero movies as a whole), and I don't understand how people can say Superman Returns is worse than this, or even compare the two. The plot holes are impossible to ignore. For example, how in the hell is Lacy Warfield breathing in space? Sorry, but I can't suspend my disbelief that much.Getting back to the title of my review, it could have been worse. The performances could have been worse, the CGI could have looked even more fake, and the plot could have stunk even more. So keep that in mind.It's no surprise at all that it took 19 years for Superman to reappear on the big screen. 3/10.",

            "content": "The Salkinds had made three Superman movies and planned a fourth if Superman III made at least $40 million. It made $80 million even if people absolutely hated it. As for star Christopher Reeve, he was pretty unenthused about coming back to the role one more time and skipped being in Supergirl, which bombed, as did the Salkind's Santa Claus: The Movie.You know how much Golan and Globus loved Cannes, right?Well, that's where they made a deal with the Salkinds to buy the rights to Superman movies for $5 million.They then got Reeve for $6 million, approval over story and director, a focus on ending nuclear weapons and financing his movie Street Smart.Cannon was already $11 million down and the movie hadn't even started filming.Reeve wanted to direct, but other than some second unit, he wasn't ready for a full film. Wes Craven was supposed to be the director, but he and Reeve didn't work well together. Reeve asked for Ron Howard and got Sydney J. Furie, the maker of The Entity, Iron Eagle, The Taking of Beverly Hills and two Rodney Dangerfield movies, Ladybugs and My 5 Wives.Consider that at one point, Cannon was almost the studio that made a Superman and a Spider-Man movie at the same time.In his book Still Me, Reeve noted that Cannon was cutting budget anywhere they could, even shooting scenes set on 42nd Street in England. He said, \"We were also hampered by budget constraints and cutbacks in all departments. Cannon Films had nearly thirty projects in the works at the time, and Superman IV received no special consideration.\"In fact, Cannon reduced the budget from $36 million to $17 million, but would still lose money, as their strategy of selling TV and video rights before the movie was made worked with smaller movies, but not with this budget, even as cut down as it was, even with the crew replaced by cheaper crews, even with shooting Smallville in England.There was also a really bad test screening that caused 45 minutes of the film was cut, including another nuclear man that Superman destroys. Also by cutting the movie from two hours to ninety minutes, theater owners could get two more showing a day and make more money.That said, while the movie made $36.7 million worldwide - and still made money on its cut budget - people hated it. It was the last Superman movie for 19 years and Reeves said, \"Superman IV was a catastrophe from start to finish.\"At one point, the more monstrous Nuclear Man footage was considered for use as a sequel in which Superman would die at the hands of that creature and would be resurrected in the bottled city Kandor. This was years before the death of Superman story and somewhat close to what happened in the comics.Anyways...Somehow, Cannon was able to get Reeve (Superman/Clark Kent), Margot Kidder (Lois Lane), Jackie Cooper (Perry White) and Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) to return. It starts with a big downer, as both of Superman's Earth parents are now dead and there's no way Marlon Brando is going to be in this movie.Meanwhile, the Daily Planet has been taken over by David Warfield, a tabloid tycoon who fires Perry White and replaces him with his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway). Also, the world is on the brink of nuclear war - which seemed quaint for a few years right? - and Superman grabs all the nukes, puts them in a giant net and throws it into the sun, which seems kind of dangerous.Lenny Luthor (Jon Cryer) breaks his uncle out of jail and they meet with the military industrial complex who wants to kill Superman like they did Kennedy, so they all make a Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow) who can infect the Man of Steel with radiation and kill him. Also, there was a reason why Superman looked at that Kryptonian energy module in the beginning because it heals him.What follows is the best kind of dumb: Superman pushes the moon and causes an eclipse, which shuts off Nuclear Man but does not cause giant waves that destroy Earth. Lacy is left in space, floating around with no oxygen but she's fine while Superman activates a nuclear power plant by dropping Nuclear Man into it and powering the entire world and that should be no danger either, before bringing Lacy back and saving the Daily Planet.Comic book movies wouldn't recover until Tim Burton's Batman.Cannon wouldn't live much longer.Reeve would be paralyzed eight years later.Superman IV was finally redeemed by just how bad Batman and Robin was.",

That is a valuable point to make, but a successful franchise where the majority of the fanbase are kids IS NOT the place to make it. Older comic book fans were disgusted, and maybe I would be if I were to rewatch the film today. The point is, at six years old you don't tend to question or notice this blatant propaganda. However, even at six I remember thinking that \"Nuclear Man\" had a fantastic presence. I obviously didn't pay much heed to his acting...It is sad that the \"Superman\" franchise makes up the highest profile hits of Christopher Reeve's career. The first couple of movies were great, the last two less than, but I sense he was capable of achieving much more in his field; especially when 'integrity' looked to be one of the lowest creative priorities by the time it came to this outing. Stick any kid under the age of, say, 8, in front of this and they MIGHT be entertained.

            "content": "The years have conferred cruel nicknames upon it, Superman 4 F*ck's sake!, Superman IV: Rest In Peace, The one I didn't see and so on. In fact part 3's Annette O'Toole (Lana Lang) delivered its most devastating critique, remarking simply \"they made a forth one?\" Yes, these cine-bullies have rounded on the third Super-sequel like a whore to a City Trader's wallet and though the criticism should be immense, it isn't the horror some would tell you it is\u0085though it's pretty close.So how did a movie that made $350M in domestic adjusted dollars do a Jaws, and spawn such a miserable third sequel? What was it about the year 1987, did someone kill all the best filmmakers that year? The Quest for Peace plays like a bloody knife in your husband's raincoat, suggesting we should be looking for bodies rather than apportioning blame. Blame is the game though so here we go \u2013 Having killed the secret of their success by firing Richard Donner and his script doctor Tom Mankewitcz, the Salkinds, those Icelandic imbeciles with next to no understanding of what made Superman work, had cocked up Superman III by turning it into a camp escapade with Richard Lester throwing the custard pies. Imagining that the audience had lost interest in Supes rather than hating what they'd done to him in the 1983 instalment, they soiled the suite further by inflicting Supergirl on an audience still licking its wounds. When that failed the sultans of Santa Clause: the Movie decided to get out of the super-business and sold the rights to Golan and Golbus, Hollywood moguls from, er, Israel, with all the creative zeal of a lobotomised organutang.1987 was a big year for the GG's as no-one referred to them on account of Golbus' rumoured resemblance to a horse. They were also making Masters of the Universe, another 'hot property' but the gruesome twosome were spreading themselves a little thin \u2013 in short, the money wasn't quite pouring in as they might like. With other projects requiring life support, these geniuses took much of the $40M Warners had given them for Superman and spent it\u0085on something else!!! Possibly on air fares to Israel. The logic is obvious \u2013 why would you need to spend money on a Superman movie? Its total lack of visual effects or international locations would make it ripe for downsizing. Thus as the Reeve was lured back in exchange for amongst other things, story input, the budget was halved and the result speaks for itself \u2013 on a shoestring? The crew on this one couldn't afford string\u0085or shoes.The total and soul destroying shame of Superman IV is that it could and should have been a wonderful swansong for Reeve in the title role. His nuclear disarmament theme, much derided, was in fact an honourable stab at giving the man of steel a meaty, real world problem to solve as well as returning the series to the more serious tone of the first two films. Unfortunately the script has no intention of doing serious, generally veering from infantile to ridiculous. It's the kind of screenplay that says 'we're not getting paid enough here' (which they probably weren't) but worse, 'we don't give a stuff'. But poor though it is \u2013 little wit or character development to be found here, what really kills Superman IV is the aforementioned budget. Even at a truncated 86 minutes it's embarrassing to watch a movie which feels so amateurishly produced and poorly made. The visual effects are, for the most part, atrocious. They would have dated instantly; in fact much of the work could be bettered today using the most basic effects software available. Unfair perhaps but given the quality of SFX at this time, the lack of money spent on them is unforgivable. If anything is going to pull you out of a movie, no matter how good the story or likable the characters, its seeing the strings \u2013 in this case literally. Reeve as ever is impossible to dislike and makes the worst of it bearable but the sheer thriftiness of it, Milton Keanes doubling for New York for example (!), is enough to incite you to crush Golan's Globus' with extreme prejudice. From the rubble there's also a fairly decent score by John Williams and Star Trek's Alexander Courage but even there it sounds as though the budget didn't stretch to an orchestra, the music having a tinny, synthesised quality to it in places. Brutalised in production, murdered in the editing suite with over 40 minutes excised (but in sympathy to the editor he must have had plenty of unusable footage, much of which he'd reluctantly have to have locked into the final cut) this last Superman (not counting Returns as it doesn't count this) is an abject lesson in poor production management and how to slay a cash cow with utter unmitigated contempt. Christ, Reeve probably laughed harder on the day he was paralysed.",

To that end, he fiendishly combines Superman's DNA and nuclear fusion to create a superhuman being he calls \"Nuclear Man\" (Mark Pillow). Meanwhile, the newspaper known as the Daily Planet has been bought by a wealthy tabloid publisher named \"David Warfield\" (Sam Wanamaker) who promptly changes the journalistic format of the newspaper to one that specializes in cheap sensationalism. He also replaces the editor \"Perry White\" (Jackie Cooper) with his daughter \"Lacy Warfield\" (Mariel Hemingway) to solidify the new format. Interestingly enough, while \"Lois Lane\" (Margot Kidder) continues to harbor a deep infatuation for \"Superman\" (Christopher Reeve) Lacy develops a romantic interest in \"Clark Kent\" (also played by Christopher Reeve) instead. And this creates a unique problem in itself when Lois and Lacy agree have a double-date with both Superman and Clark Kent. Now, rather than reveal any more let me just state that I am perfectly aware that this particular film has been roundly condemned by a vast majority of critics and even had the dubious distinction of garnering two Golden Raspberry nominations: \"Worst Supporting Actress\" (Mariel Hemingway) and \"Worst Visual Effects\". Additionally, Esquire magazine ranked it at #40 of the worst 50 movies ever made. That's pretty bad. Even so, while I agree that the special effects could have used significant improvement, I disagree with the assessment concerning Mariel Hemingway's performance. For starters, I didn't think her performance was that bad and I certainly don't think it merited a Raspberry Award nomination. If anything, I thought her presence actually helped liven up the picture to a certain degree. Likewise, I also disagree with the overall evaluation of the film by Esquire magazine. Case in point, it was nominated for an International Fantasy Film Award in the category for \"Best Film\" and ranked #4 at the box office upon its release. So there you have it. In any case--and not that it means anything--I personally thought this movie was better than its predecessor. So, for all of the reasons just mentioned, I have rated this film accordingly.

I was surprised at how this movie was only 90 minutes long. It felt more like hours because of how bad it was! Maybe it would have worked better if it actually was longer. Then again, I have seen deleted scenes that are incredibly stupid.Anyway, there are so many of these scenes that are entirely pointless. We get some parts in the beginning that show Clark Kent trying to sell his house. This adds up to nothing and is stupid. Then there's really big subplot where this new woman falls in love with Clark Kent. We later get scenes of him changing personas while getting an interview with Lois Lane. Again, all of this means nothing. It seems like every scene is just taken from the other movies. We see Lois find out his true identity and then he erases her memory. This is lifted directly from \"Superman II\" and has no meaning. We see Lex Luthor communicate directly to Superman in the same way as the first movie.The plot is that Superman is trying to get rid of the world's nuclear weapons, but Lex Luthor creates a villain named Nuclear Man. We literally see him being born as in we actually briefly see this guy as a fetus that turns into a grown man. What? There's another scene where Luthor is with this woman in a dress from the French Revolution. What does any of this mean?! The special effects are downright terrible. They literally had nine years to improve and the blue screen effects are among the worst I've ever seen.The pacing in the film is terrible. So many pointless scenes and then a bunch of dragged out action scenes. Nuclear Man kidnaps a woman and takes her into space even though she can't breathe in space. Were the people working on this even trying? This movie was so awful there wasn't another Superman film released in theaters until 19 years later with \"Superman Returns\". Watching the movie, you can see why the production on these films went through so much trouble. While I didn't like \"Batman Vs. Superman\", I'd still take it over this! *",

For me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen: history is a jumble of ideas with no logical connection or clear sense, predictable, boring. It begins with an escalation in the nuclear arms race, deftly and promptly resolved by the hero in an absolutely unbelievable way, and then revolves into a rivalry between him and a villain that Lex Luthor creates virtually out of nowhere, since the bombs were destroyed. There are holes almost the size of houses in this silly plot, and the movie really does look like it was made of pieces from various stories sewn together like a patchwork quilt. It's better not to mention the romantic subplot in the film...The cast's performance doesn't help to save it. There is virtually not a single actor or actress who deserves a positive standout. It's not just their fault, but also the hideous script, the undignified material they were given and the atrocious incompetence of director Sidney Furie, who turned out to be so good that it would have been better to make the film without a director at all. Christopher Reeve also deserves a negative note, with a smug, pompous and irritating performance that is an indelible stain on his acting career.Technically, the movie is more than just old... it's archaic, primitive and has aged terribly. The visual and special effects used are so unacceptably far-fetched that they simply shouldn't have been used. They almost turned it into a B-movie. And is it really worth talking about a cinematography without any depth, with bad light and washed-out colors? Perhaps the best thing, really, is to forget about this movie and use the VHS to patch up a limp table.",

What's sad is that we've seen other film-makers, like James Cameron, make great films out of shoe-string budgets (just look at 1984's \"The Terminator\"), and yet these guys totally dropped the ball. Even star Christopher Reeve admitted that this one came out \"ersatz\". But at least Reeve stayed with the series to the end, he didn't turn his back on it because he wanted more money or anything like that. And, for what it's worth, Reeve still manages to show some passion as the Man of Steel, which is a lot more than you can say for some other actors in superhero films, like the cast of Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace and Episode II Attack of the Clones...",

Once Superman decides to destroy all the nuclear weapons in the world, Luthor sees any opportunity.I'll get what I don't like out of the way first. The plot, whilst a good idea in principal is a mess, the special effects are cheap and are often reused over and over again. Mark Pillow makes a poor villain. It's no surprise to see his career went nowhere. Clearly Milton Keynes is no substitute for New York (which usually doubles as Metropolis) Everything about it looks very cheap (costumes, set design, special effects)and apparently Lois Lane can now fly unaided and humans can breath in space. Now that's out the way, the movie has something's going for it, Christopher Reeve gives us one last performance as Superman, and is as brilliant as always. Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder is given more to do than in the last movie, Jon Cryer is fun as Lenny and the attractive Mariel Hemingway is a welcome addition to the cast too. I really liked her as a love interest for Clark, Jim Broadbent pops up here too, but he is not given as much to do as one would hope. The brilliant John Williams is back composing too!! Given the movies problems I'm going to count the running time as a good thing too.A sad end to the Christopher Reeve as Superman Franchise.

It is based on a kids comic after all.It has a political message, which isn't a bad thing and which comic books in themselves have repeatedly tried to get across. Why wouldn't Superman speak out about nuclear disarmament? He can't just keep fighting Lex's schemes all of the time?Maybe it's not delivered in the most believable way and the bad guy is a bit weak character-wise. I might have liked it more if Supe had managed to make friends with him to unite and save the world together as a better final message, but I was only 7 when this was released, so my opinion didn't count and probably still doesn't.I would also have liked to have seen more in the beginning to establish Clark and Superman's characters and situation. It's just assumed that the audience has seen at least one of the previous films or read the stories and knows what's going on.The backwards and forwards between the characters at the dinner party, which obviously inspired a similar scene in 'Mrs Doubtfire' (1993) did not impress me at all.Gene Hackman's (I've never been a fan) character is not comic book enough for me, but instead he is farcical and his side of the story is the full Ham, Cheese and Corn special, not helped by the nephew character.Nuclear Man is also a terrible actor, but at least he's a comic bad. His ending was also very badly handled and explained. I actually did blink and miss it, finding myself at the epilogue without a clue how he had been defeated or if he really had been.He did help me to realise what 'Family Guy' were taking the Mickey out of when they gave Meg long finger nails in the nuclear waste episode though (Series 3/Episode 21).I'm sure the nerds would claim that it's riddled with inaccuracies, but I've never been in to DC enough to care.

What resulted was a bad fun-house of special effects, a chopped up poorly edited movie, with a plot that went nowhere and fell flat on it's face. The rights to Superman were sold to the now non-existent, Cannon studio by Alexander and Ilya Salkind, (Producers of Superman 1-3) Chris Reeve after the disappointment of Superman 3, initially swore off reprising the role of Superman but after a sweet deal including story input was offered to him by Cannon, he signed on for the 4th. Reeve's idea was to construct a story where Superman felt obligated to try and rid the world of Nuclear Weapons and bring about peace.\" Not a bad concept but the screenplay that was written did little to flush out the details in an engaging fashion. Superman 4 centers around the return of Lex Luthor, who is broken out of prison by his incredibly annoying and less than bright, nephew Lenny. Once escaped he plans on ridding the world of Superman by creating a Supervillain, partially from Superman's DNA and once Superman is gone, he'll become something of a war profiteer. The result of this Supervillain is the corny and terribly conceived Nuclear Man. A being who looks like he stepped out of a bad 70's Disco movie, with his long teased blonde hair, big muscles and hokey costume. So Superman must defeat Nucler Man, foil Lex and save the day while preserving peace. The biggest problem with Superman 4 is how cheaply it was made. Cannon ran out of money during pre-production thanks to other films they were producing that were in need of funding so Superman 4's budget got reportedly cut in half. This results in wires showing, lifeless flying backgrounds, re-used flying shots and poorly constructed action sequences. Also reportedly, thanks to a failed test screening, roughly 40 min was cut from Superman 4, so there are many aspects of the plot, that feel rushed with questions unanswered. At the end of the day the movie is a massive letdown. Chris Reeve is the only real saving grace here, as he is always a joy to watch portraying the Man of Steel but the movie lets Reeve and the fans down, on nearly every level.2/10",

            "content": "The Salkinds sold their ownership of the film rights to the Superman character to Cannon after the dual financial failures of Superman III and Supergirl, and Cannon pushed out a rushed, incomplete, overlong mess of a vanity project for Christopher Reeve to keep him in the title role that got cut down to a brisk 90-minutes, probably sacrificing any semblance of narrative cohesion in the process of trying to save the disaster of a film. The effort to placate Reeve's anti-nuclear views ends up clashing horribly with the actual thematic point of the film (what little there is, to be honest), and you've just got a dying whimper of a franchise that was pretty much derailed from the get go.Clark Kent (Reeve) returns to Metropolis after trying to sell his parents farm in Smallville (something that never comes up again) to discover that the Daily Planet has been purchased by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) who has made his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway) publisher. This is angering everyone because the Warfield plan is to turn, essentially, The New York Times into The New York Post. This is of a view of journalism brought up on All the President's Men, essentially (though that was The Washington Post), but whatever. It's bad, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) is not happy about it. They are going to run sensationalist material, up to and including a campaign to get Superman to rid the world of nuclear weapons, which is a bad thing but also a good thing? This movie has no idea what it's trying to say.Anyway, Superman eventually gives into the pressure and starts throwing all of the nuclear missiles that nations are just launching all of the time (um...really?), packing them into a comically giant net, and throwing them into the sun. Sure. Whatever. Into this comes Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman). Serving his prison sentence on a chain gang (what is this? The 30s?), he's freed when his uber-90s nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer) tricks the two guards into his car and remote controls it over a cliff. Luthor has a plan to steal a thread of Superman's hair that's on display in a museum, mix it with some dirt, and attach it to the top of a nuclear warhead that Superman will then throw into the sun to create Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow), because this is nonsense and nobody cares.It works, obviously, and we've got our potential for a showdown. Now, let me talk about this for a second. The point of the film seems to be anti-nuclear proliferation. Superman throws everything into the sun, but it doesn't work. Luthor gets filthy rich as part of the nuclear arms black market selling new weapons to countries to replace the ones that Superman threw into the sun (why the US government would need to buy from black marketers to build their own nuclear weapons is never made clear), but it effectively just creates a void in which Luthor is able to come up with his own nuclear weapon in the form of Nuclear Man, giving him an effective monopoly on nuclear power. Getting rid of the nuclear weapons didn't work because there will always be someone around trying to make a bigger bomb. Plus, Superman is effectively a nuclear weapon himself. He can't explode, but if he wanted to level cities, he could do it. Did I expect thematic cohesion from Superman IV? No, but I think it's healthy to point out how it doesn't make a lick of sense anyway.So, meanwhile, Superman ends up in a Cheers episode where he has a double date with Lois and Lacy as both Superman and Clark Kent, even though Lois apparently never forgot that Clark was Superman and Superman reveals himself as Clark to her anyway? The scene could be cute if it weren't so obviously laborious, and completely ungermane to the actual story of the film. It's filler.The whole thing ends in a big fight between Superman and Nuclear Man whose weakness is...*checks notes*...the shade. Also, it's wildly inconsistent, of course. It gets to the moon where Superman has Nuclear Man shut up in an elevator, losing power, and instead of, you know, burying the guy under the soil of the moon, he just walks away, allowing a sliver of sunlight to peek through, giving Nuclear Man power again. Even the action in this movie is incompetent.Nothing matters. It's a cheap exercise in exercising the rights by Cannon to try and squeeze some quick dollars from the name before the franchise fell into cinematic dormancy for two decades. It's not even really worth making fun of. It's kind of just sad.",

            "content": "You've heard from many different reviews how bad this movie is. But this is no ordinary bad movie. This was a Superman movie about one of the greatest superheroes of all time. This was the fourth in the series and expectations were high. Everyone involved in making this movie failed and let everyone down. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace had a lot of potential to be a good movie, but it was put in the wrong hands.One thing that I must point out is how they ruined the film's villain. Nuclear Man could've been a great villain, but like I said, this movie was put into the wrong hands. What a lot of people don't know is that in the original cut, there were two Nuclear Men. The first was the inferior one that resembled Bizarro from the comics. Nuclear Man came from one of Superman's hairs. The deleted scenes of the first Nuclear Man were pretty good. The fight scene between Superman and the first Nuclear Man was very good. He gives Superman a rough time for a little while, but Superman is able to dispose of him quickly.This forces Lex Luthor to go back to the drawing board and create a new Nuclear Man. But rather than create him in the lab, Luthor creates the new one in the sun. The special effects were pretty lame, but for me, one of their brightest moments has to be the birth of Nuclear Man from the sun. When we first see his face there is fire in his eyes and it looks pretty cool. This is the new and improved Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. This is a handsome Nuclear Man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He is big and strong and all he wants to do is \"destroy Superman.\" Nobody will ever know how good an actor Mark Pillow could've been. Nuclear Man's voice is dubbed by Gene Hackman's. The first voice that Nuclear Man hears when he arrives on earth is the voice of Lex Luthor. He ends up taking Luthor's voice. I could understand them dubbing Pillow because if you've ever heard his voice, he sounds too nice to be a big mean villain. But I don't know why they had to dub his voice with Gene Hackman's. Giving him the stupid roar didn't help either. Sometimes Mark Pillow overacts with his facial expressions. I swear, I think this is the new man of a thousand faces. He has how many different faces throughout the movie. You would think it was all different actors playing the part. Mark Pillow has some good moments, but some of the best scenes of Superman chasing Nuclear Man around the world ended up on the cutting room floor. They also cut out good scenes involving Lacy and Nuclear Man. These deleted scenes in the original cut explained what \"woman\" Nuclear Man was after and why. Cutting out all of those scenes that they did, destroyed any last chance they ever had of this being a good movie. The Lacy and Nuclear Man scenes also added a lot more to the character of Nuclear Man.They didn't know what they were doing. If you're going to create your own Superman foe, make sure you do it right. Nuclear Man's costume is all right. But they had to go and give him these stupid long nails to attack Superman with. The point of giving him the nails was to pierce Superman's skin and give him radiation sickness. But nobody wants a villain with long radioactive nails.Another thing they really screwed up with were the fight scenes between Superman and Nuclear Man. The fights just came off looking gay. They have their final fight on the moon and you're expecting this titanic struggle. What a let down. I'll admit, the fight has a few good moments, but whoever did the choreography is an idiot.The greatest sin of this movie is what they did to Superman. Superman was completely ruined. I blame the producers, the director, the writers, and I'm sorry to say, I blame Christopher Reeve. The last time we saw Christopher Reeve in Superman III he looked great. He looked more muscular and he was better than ever. In Superman IV he is skinny and doesn't even come close to the way he looked in Superman III. If you don't want to see them turn Superman into a big sissy then stay away from this movie. In the fights with Nuclear Man, Superman fights like a girl and looks like the biggest wimp when he's moaning and yelling while Nuclear Man's murdering him. It's painful to watch the Man of Steel act this way. It's especially painful to watch Nuclear Man end the moon fight by hammering Superman into the ground. Did anybody realize how stupid that looked? Didn't Christopher Reeve realize how stupid he looked? Someone once said that the saddest thing in life is wasted talent. A great score here by Alexander Courage is wasted. Every actor was wasted. In John Cryer's case, he had no business in this movie. He ruined it with his stupid annoying act. In the Mark Pillow case, I'd have to say that his good looks were wasted. Mark Pillow was a handsome strapping young actor. I could've seen him playing He-Man or even Flash Gordon. He definitely had the look. As far as his acting, we will never know. This movie destroyed his career before it even began. I wish people could've shut down this project before it even began. They ruined a promising movie, they ruined the characters, and they ruined the series.",

This being the ground floor of that descent, it bears little similarity to the original film beyond several key casting choices and a spit curl. Christopher Reeve returns as the title character, of course, with Margot Kidder suffering an expanded role and Gene Hackman back from a one-film exile to ham it up once again as a clueless, underwhelming Lex Luthor. Filling the Richard Pryor \"why?!\" role from the previous film is Jon Cryer, better known as Duckie in Pretty in Pink, who plays some sort of pointless, meandering male twist on the Valley Girl stereotype that was rolling through culture at the time. I'm still not entirely sure why he was elbowed into the plot. This isn't aggressively bad like Superman III, it's just hopelessly inept. In fact, the core of the story has a lot of potential: Superman, inspired by a letter from a young boy, destroys the world's nuclear armaments and discovers that some problems can't be solved quite so easily. It sputters and fails right on the launchpad, though, and soon falls back on a muscle-flexing brawl with some generic evil menace to solve the problem. Its grasp on physics, and reality as a whole, is so loose it's almost adorable. I'd pat my four-year-old son on the head and smile if he suggested we move the moon around to keep the sun out of his eyes, but for this film that's a legitimate solution. To say its answers make any sense would be an insult to sense itself. The whole thing plays like an easy answer to a complex problem, from the story to the editing to the acting to the effects work. These older superhero movies don't hold up to the rigors of time as a whole, but Superman IV looks particularly bad in a modern setting. Even the hero's indistinguishable costume seems cut-rate and fake, like they'd forgotten to commission a wardrobe department until the night before production. Head-shakingly pointless and dull, this film only seems to exist to kill time. Which, thankfully, it doesn't demand in great quantities. While the original cut came in at over two hours, some greedy last-minute cuts trimmed it down to a slim ninety minutes. Why the late edits?

            "content": "(This review contains potential spoilers)I'm probably being generous with 3 stars, but for the first 45 minutes or so, Superman IV isn't a bad little film. Granted, it's instantly obvious the budget is a fraction of what had been used for the first 3 films, and Luthor's nephew is a terrible 80s teen \"dude!\" stereotype. But the opening sequences with Clark visiting the old farm in Smallville and the return of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane are both welcome. Mariel Hemingway provides a sexy third side to the film's romantic triangle ... but it could be argued a film like this didn't need that.It had been 10 years since the first Superman was filmed, and this gives the regular actors added depth as they played their familiar roles. Gene Hackman is an exception, playing Luthor a bit too low key for the character's own good. At about the 45-50 minutes mark, things start to collapse as the close-to-an-hour's worth of deleted scenes begin to take their toll on the film -- for example, suddenly Clark looks all grey-haired and dying with no real reason given. And while the battle between Superman and Nuclear Man is clearly inspired by the comic books -- and would have worked well in the comics -- in live action, it just comes off as silly. And when the filmmakers abandon any pretense to reality (by, among other things, having a human character survive hanging around in the vacuum of space) the film just falls apart.The film is worth seeing, though, for the byplay between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. It's a pity the opportunity was lost in Superman III to expand on this more when Kidder was written out of the film. But, as the fourth entry in a franchise that began with the spectacular Superman I and Superman II, this film is an extreme disappointment -- though, at the same time, it's one of those films that seems ripe for the remastering/directors edition/upgrading routine that has been done with other films.",

After the first movie established a monumental myth, including the tragedy of Superman losing his fathers (both of them), the second and third movie were passable continuations with a lot of action. Jolly good fun, but not outstanding in any way. By the time of the fourth movie, there are still the same actors, but along the way all the depth was lost. Superman tries to hide that with a pretentious 'destroy all nukes' mission imposed on him by a little boy. Hackman, who was a brilliant villain still in part 2, audaciously trying to use the 3 powerful criminals from outer space for his own purposes, is now just clowning around with Nuclear Man, basically keeping up the 'I want to kill Superman' routine due to lack of other hobbies. Nuclear Man is one of the most ridiculous baddies one could possibly imagine, acting like the four year old son of Hercules in kindergarten. I enjoyed watching part I-III again after many years, but part IV really is a disaster, no wonder they stopped making further (cinema) sequels for the rest of the century.",

I have to say Superman: The Movie is as great now as it was then, nearly brought tears to my eyes and made me nostalgic for the good old days.Then there was Superman II (the Lester version). I remember liking it as a child, but as an adult I scratched my head and wondered exactly what had gone wrong. The... what is the word? The verisimilitude was gone along with the thrill. And was that recycled footage at the end? I wanted for it it to be the same or better than the first one. It wasn't.Then there was Superman III. Lester in all his glory. All I can say is: skiing down the side of a skyscraper? Superman can get drunk? You can make oil go back into an oil rig like that? And was that recycled footage at the end? Are you kidding me?But Superman IV. Dear God, Superman IV. Well, that is an atrocity of epic proportions. At its heart, somewhere deep, deep down (very deep) it had a somewhat good concept. Superman rids the world of nuclear weapons. Apparently, the whole \"it is forbidden for you to interfere with their destiny\" is right out the window. Superman says \"hand 'em over\" and the world goes \"no problem\". Then Lex Luthor, in his brilliance, comes up with an idea no one else would have in the whole world. He's going to get better than nuclear weapons. In his genius he has come up with a nuclear man. Guess what the \"greatest criminal mind of all time\" comes up with for a name? Nuclear Man! And Nuclear Man has bizarre abilities the script doesn't have time to explain like electric fire eyes that sparkle and... I guess that's all. Plus, even though he is made up of Superman's DNA, he has Lex Luthor's voice (Lex must have used his \"criminal intellect\" to do that). Also he can fly and break stuff and, for no apparent reason, he likes Clark Kent's love interest (?). Perhaps his reason is that she can go into space and not die! Seriously, man. Then there's the mysterious scratch that Nuclear Man gives Superman, which makes him have the flu. To which he reacts like a complete wimp. This movie also reveals the secret to Superman's flying: wires! The special effects people must have been saying, \"Slash my budget, will you? Well, I'll kill the Superman franchise good, that'll learn you to mess with me.\" And kill it they did because it took nineteen years for Superman to Return. There's so much more to rank on with this cautionary tale of How Not To Make A Movie but I'm sure I made my point.And was that recycled footage at the end?",

            "content": "When franchise movies get long on the tooth, it become disheartening to see how far it can go with such bad qualities. Among all the films related to the man of steel up until this film, this entry was considered by far the worst in the filmography. The fact that some actually considered Supergirl (1984) to be better than this film spoke to many that something was not right with the direction of the films. However, when revisiting the film, it turns out what people may not like may not make this sequel as terrible as some other films go. Sure, it still doesn't match up to the original or the second film, but it is definitely not unwatchable. Surprisingly, as much as the cast was not getting along, it's very hard to tell that people were not enjoying themselves in the making of this feature.The plot revolving around this feature takes place when the arms race continues to escalate between super powered countries. Feeling a need to do something after a young boy sends him a letter, Superman AKA Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) looks to find a solution. Seeing the opportunity in Superman's involvement, the ever scheming Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) breaks out of prison with the help of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer). Luthor's plan is to create a being just as strong as Superman. Meanwhile the daily planet is being taken over by David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemingway), who ends up developing feelings for Clark.The script was written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal who both wrote for The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) and The Jewel of the Nile (1985) prior to this. Seeing that part of the film's production problems came from the budget, it could be said that they both had to work with whatever they could. However, there are parts to the story that don't make any sense in continuity. Such as people breathing in space aside from Superman or Luthor having the know-how of creating another superhuman. There's also meaningless supporting characters such as Lenny and Lacy. Both of them do not contribute anything to the overall story and neither of them have a purpose other than hijinks.If anything, the worst offender is the big baddie, Nuclear Man played by Mark Pillow. Not only does Pillow give a rather goofy over the top performance, but his weapon of choice is very lame. Fingernails,....that's right fingernails. This not only makes the action between him and Superman laughable but almost embarrassing. Forget all the mediocre special effects the production used,...they could have at least thrown their fists at one another. That's one thing Superman III (1983) got right. Thankfully, most of the other fun characters return like Perry White (Jackie Cooper), Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure), Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and even William Hootkins as an arms dealer.While the effects are not always on par with prior films, at least they feel closer to the first two superman films than that of the third film. Director Sidney J. Furie did his best to keep it that way along with his cinematographer Ernest Day. Furie was the director of Iron Eagle (1986), while Day had worked on Running Scared (1972). All shots are kept steady and have a good number of shots that capture the large scope of the setting. The best component to this feature though was the score composed by Alexander Courage. While not having the same grab as John Williams, Courage uses Williams' theme for Superman to a great extent making it sound almost like Williams was there. Not only is the score fully fleshed out but matches in tone as well to the rest of the films.Saying this is the worst film in the series is a bit hard to say. Superman III (1983) got several things wrong as well. At least here it felt more like the first two. Yes the effects are not as polished and continuity issues are vast, however the music, camerawork and returning actors put in one more performance that still retains the Superman feel.",

So it is that we get a real contrived plot of the man of steel ridding world of nukes. Eh, well, okay, but if you were a military with a stockpile of ICBMs and there was this all powerful flying guy hanging around, how would you go about guarding your weapons? That's a major plot hole.The film is respectfully well shot, but the psychiatric story needed to bring in someone that Reeve's character could fight. So we get this very contrived villain who is very wooden and melodramatic, even for a comic book villain. And that's pretty much the gist of Superman 4. It's an awful film for many reasons, and one of them being to make sure any Superman would- be heroes in the audience have their psychology put to rest in terms of Kal El like heroics or aspirations thereof. And this is the thing that gets me, here the usual suspects who produced these films have a real chance to create something that people'll like, and instead decide to close the chapter on the series with a lackluster installment. Just once can't producers end a series on a high note? Lucas and Spielberg both showed it can be done. And yet we gets films like Superman 4.Oh well.So that's Supes-4. Take that for what it's worth. Just as with Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy or Woody Allen's \"earlier funny ones\" (movies), so it is that the consensus of the Superman films with Chris Reeves is that the first two are good, the two followups are less than lackluster.Personally I think this thing and the previous film with Richard Pryor are an abysmal joke.

The film may have had honourable intentions, this I don't doubt. Sadly, a fairly interesting story was defeated by an exceptionally poor script. It was great to see Gene Hackman return as Lex Luthor (the character belongs to him) and at least he has some more scenes with Christopher Reeve. I don't particularly care for the villain Nuclear Man. He is laughable rather than menacing. The only scene I thought was any good, is the one where Superman returns to his home farm in Smallville. He is in his disguise as Clark Kent as he takes a walk around the house and the barn, alone. He thinks back to the days when he was raised on that farm by Jonathan and Martha Kent. How time has elapsed since then, now that his earth parents are deceased. With no one else around, Superman feels he can be more like his real self and not acting as the clumsy oaf. Then a stranger pulls up at the Kent farm and Superman reverts to his bumbling persona. Bring shot mainly in England, can only mean that the producers were a bit strapped for hard cash. It hardly mattered in the end. Box office takings were disappointing and panned by the critics.",

We learn, in the course of the film, that Nuclear Man has no power at all when the sun doesn't shine on him, so, he obviously doesn't come across as being very intimidating, unless one gets radiation poisoning from him. Or, scratched by his manicured talons.The effects are rock bottom, bottom of the barrel, and they are reused multiple times throughout, which only reiterates their ineptitude. Colour shifts, and changes in tone only make the poor film stock (due to the film's slashed budget) even more obvious. The photography itself is flat, centred, and dull, it never rises above looking like a television commercial.A problem this series had was coming up with worthwhile villains. Lex Luthor, and especially General Zod, were wonderful, worthy opponents in the first two films. In part 3, we had Robert Vaughn and Richard Pryor fumbling about. Here in part 4, we have a reject from a bad hair metal band, with Gene Hackman's dubbed voice, fumbling through poorly choreographed fight scenes with Superman.I give this film a 2/ 10, just for the fact that Christopher Reeve still puts in a good performance, unlike some other actors who, by the fourth go round, would just be phoning it in.",

Following this box office bomb, the series would go on to rest in embarrassed peace until Bryan Singer would come along with a spiked baseball bat to beat this dead horse back to life in 2006. This movie is bad. Real bad. It's a miracle we still enjoy comic book movies after SUPERMAN IV did everything in its power to scare us away from them. It's hard to believe Tim Burton would come along a mere two years later and amaze movie crowds with BATMAN. Even Richard Lester, the man who pit Superman against Richard Pryor and a \"computer\", would have nothing to do with this movie and the task of directing was turned over to a man named Sidney J. Furie, whose only other directing effort I'm familiar with is that lame soccer movie LADYBUGS with Rodney Dangerfield. SUPERMAN IV is a terrifying blend of poor special effects, hokey messages, and Jon Cryer as the most aggravating 80's stereotype to ever poison the big screen. This all about the nuclear crisis (or as Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor would call it\u0085\"nucular\") facing the world during the Cold War with all the major world superpowers on the brink of nuclear annihilation. A young boy's heartfelt letter convinces Superman to break his vow of non- involvement in the fate of Earth by disposing of all the world's nuclear weapons. Once that's out of the way, we get an hour of Superman doing battle with Lex Luthor's latest scheme: Nuclear Man, a walking atomic weapon with a period-appropriate mullet.There's just so much wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to start. It's just bafflingly stupid. It can't all be bad, though\u0085right? There's got to be some good stuff here. Let's start with that: Gene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor and Mariel Hemingway is decently attractive as Clark Kent's new shoehorned-in love interest, Lacy Warfield. Well, now that we've got that out of the way\u0085One thing that really annoyed me here is the same problem I've had with previous Superman movies. We get one plot for the first portion of the movie (in this case, the first 35 minutes is all about Superman ridding the world of nuclear missiles) and then the movie just decides to shift gears for the rest of the show (battling Nuclear Man). The movie has no real flow whatsoever. The whole nuclear disarmament angle, while relevant to the period in which the movie was released, is just too cheesy to be taken seriously. A wide-eyed youngster is asked how he would solve the world's nuclear threat: \"Well, gee golly, I'd just ask Superman to do it.\" If that's not enough cheese for you, we have Jon Cryer (pre-TV fame) as Lex Luthor's nephew Lenny. Luthor has a history of surrounding himself with fools in the movies and Lenny is the most offensively bad of them all. With his bizarre 80's style and his surfer speech, you wish Superman would grab him by the collar, fly him out into space, and leave him on an asteroid somewhere. If that seems harsh, don't worry: you find out near the end of the movie that anyone, not just Superman, can survive the cold, airless, empty vacuum of space. Isn't that right, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal? I've accepted some pretty far-out concepts from the previous Superman movies, but that was only because they were fun movies (well, not so much with SUPERMAN III). This film doesn't get that liberty because it's nowhere near the level of its predecessors.There's just so much stupid about this movie that it'd take more than this comment section to go over it all. Thankfully, it's been covered ad nauseum in countless online reviews that tear this movie to shreds. Despite being released almost ten years after the original film, SUPERMAN IV actually has worse special effects than when it started. They're just horrible. The flying effects are the worst of the series. There's also the matter of the rehashed elements from previous films: Lois and Superman go on yet another \"romantic\" flight over Metropolis (except the background images never quite match the flight movement of the two and it looks terrible) and we get another amnesia kiss to wipe Lois's memory of the event. The audience isn't nearly as lucky. We're left with the memory of Nuclear Man: a creature mutated by Lex Luthor from a strand of Superman's hair, some fabric, one of those magical computers, and the sun. Nuclear Man generates an internal heat at the temperature of the sun without cooking those around him, goes inert when not in direct sunlight, and has radioactive fingernails. Still, I suppose it's better than Richard Pryor's supercomputer in SUPERMAN III. But not by much. The last 45 minutes or so of the movie are Superman and Nuclear Man battling back and forth a bit while Nuclear Man flies around the world creating messes for Superman to clean up with more arbitrarily created superpowers (i.e. his new Super-Rebuild-Walls-from-Scratch-o-Vision). It's all just embarrassing. And that's coming from me, a viewer. I can't imagine having my name forever seared into the end credits and having to admit I helped create it.SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE is a comedy. It doesn't know it, but it is. It's laughably stupid with a plot the barely holds together and enough cheese to feed an entire third world nation. I enjoyed the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and I even found some high points in the much-maligned third film. But this movie has no real redeeming qualities and, worst of all, ended the Christopher Reeve/Superman saga on it's lowest note ever.",

He is one of the biggest elements that make this movie worth watching. This movie is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It's still much better than any live-action DC film made after \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy! This movie has a great story, great acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The special effects are not too bad, but they don't go without their flaws in this movie of course. Probably the most glaring one is the same shot of Superman flying toward the camera over and over and over again. They use the same flying shot 11 times throughout this whole movie! Now, it honestly doesn't anger me like it does for most people lacking a sense of humor. I actually laugh at it and it's fun to watch! The only other glaring special effect issue are the wire shots, which don't really appear until the second half of the movie. Other than that, the special effects are actually decent and utilized to the max given the small budget! The story is interesting, Superman trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons and preventing our global destruction. There are a few subplots, but they all add up and tie the movie together in the end. The acting is great, again, especially from Christopher Reeve. He gives it his all and even with a small budget, you will still believe that a man can fly! Margot Kidder is stellar as Lois Lane as usual, Marc McClure is great as Jimmy Olsen, Jackie Cooper is perfect as Perry White, and Gene Hackman is once again the best Lex Luthor. There are a few new characters introduced into this franchise, and they all do an excellent job as well! Mark Pillow is great as Nuclear Man, Jon Cryer is hilarious as Lenny Luthor, Sam Wanamaker is excellent as David Warfield, and Mariel Hemingway is funny and charming as Lacy Warfield. All of the actors do a great job! They realize that a low budget can't replace the quality of acting. The sets/locations are nice, they look like part of a comic book, which is a neat change of pace in this series. It really gives the movie a nice atmosphere! The soundtrack is excellent. It takes the original brilliant film score of the one and only John Williams, and gives it a different level of depth. Alexander Courage did a fantastic job adapting John Williams' original \"Superman\" musical score! Overall, this movie is a lot of fun and is definitely worth watching. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 stars. Remember, just because a movie has a low budget, does not mean it can't be entertaining. \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is entertaining in every sense of the word, and always will be. To end my review, let us have a moment of silence for the late, but always phenomenal, Christopher Reeve. He has really helped bring this character to life, Christopher Reeve is Superman and he will always be Superman. Rest in Peace, Christopher Reeve.

Now what line springs to mind, ah yes, \"What's he going to say?\" \"Something wonderful\"Pure cheese.Very strange that superman suddenley becomes a tad stronger than in the second installment of the series, where he struggles to stop a bus full of people thrown at him by Ursa and Nom under the guidance of General Zod. Then, in this final trash film, he is able with ease to move a planet. Highly unrealistic.The most amusing part of this flick for me is when Nuclear man is using Superman as a nail, knocking him into a planet. He takes a big swing and then gently taps Reeve. It's so fake it's funny.Don't bother watching, hiring/renting or buying this film, it's garbage. Watch Superman II instead if you really must see a flapping cape. Enjoy some classic quotes from II........\"Throw it!, Throw iiiiiiitttttttttt!!!!!\" \"Luthor you poisonous snake!\" \"So you are a General, and who is your superior....?\" \"Come, come and kneel before Zod............ZOD!!!!!!!\" \"In return for your obedience, you will enjoy my generous protection, in other words, you will be allowed to live\" \"These humans are beginning to bore me\"R.I.P. to Christopher Reeve.Rating for Superman IV, 2/10.

            "content": "Going into SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE, I was totally prepared for this to be an unwatchable mess. To my surprise, this was a Superman film that actually dared to be about something. Yes, the special effects are cheesy and the worst of the series. Yes, Lex Luthor is back as the villain of the week, and Nuclear Man is one of the stupidest villains I've ever seen. But, one thing sets this apart from the other entries in the series: this is a Cannon film, with all that implies. Cannon Films are best known to me as the home of several of Chuck Norris' early titles, and they're known for schlocky, low-budget stinkers that are \"so bad they're good.\" While I wouldn't quite put SUPERMAN IV in that category, there are a number of elements that, given a bigger budget, could have made this an awesome film. Even still, it's very watchable and certainly more entertaining than SUPERMAN III.The basic plot has Superman campaigning for worldwide nuclear disarmament. There's also trouble at the Daily Planet as a rich businessman tries to take it over and turn it into a vehicle for sensationalism as opposed to real journalism. However, Lex Luthor is back on the scene and isn't about to let Superman eliminate a lucrative business and creates Nuclear Man to take him on.First, the good, which is actually more than you would think. The story this time is a marked improvement over the silly one in SUPERMAN III. Christopher Reeve has a story credit on SUPERMAN IV, and I have a feeling that he was instrumental in the direction the film took. Addressing nuclear disarmament and war profiteering (to a lesser degree) was/is a timely subject, and particularly so in 1987 when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse. Granted, the bulk of this message is contained in two speeches that come off as straight-faced moralizing, but the fact that they tackled the issue at all is commendable. I also liked how Superman is treated as a more international hero than a purely American icon. Here we get to see Superman rescue people (who aren't Lois) in other countries besides the US. In terms of technical details, despite being a Cannon film the production values aren't too bad. Even the acting is perfectly fine (with one huge exception). In fact, most aspects of the production are acceptable except...The special effects, due to the low budget, are pretty awful. In particular, the flying sequences and fighting in space were very bad. Still, all of this is understandable when you consider who produced this film. What I didn't care for at all was Nuclear Man and Jon Cryer, who plays Lex Luthor's nephew. While he played a fun, quirky character in PRETTY IN PINK, Jon Cryer was absolutely risible here, and his character was annoyingly stupid. He also affects this accent which just adds to how much I hated the character. His presence made me long for Otis and Mrs. Teshmacher. Then there's Lex Luthor's latest creation, Nuclear Man, who his birthed when a missile carrying a strand of Superman's hair explodes in the sun. If that origin wasn't bad enough, his appearance was also ridiculous. Fortunately they had the foresight to dub Gene Hackman's voice over the muscle-bound non-actor who played Nuclear Man. The last thing I'll comment on is the length of the film. Basically, it could have stood to be a little longer and develop the high-minded themes that it dared to address.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how watchable SUPERMAN IV turned out to be. By no means would I consider this a \"good\" movie, but its heart is in the right place. It might have been hampered by a reduced budget, rendering the special effects more dated and cheesy than its predecessors, but the story and themes are an improvement from the overly silly SUPERMAN III. It also has a certain B-movie charm that allows you to overlook the sub-par production values. Bottom line, I'd sooner rewatch SUPERMAN IV than SUPERMAN III, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the first two.",

            "content": "The late 1980s. Shoulder pads were higher than the hairdos, a movie star was the president, and it was a toss-up between whether nuclear apocalypse, some newfangled disease, or a real-life Star Wars would kill you. Who could possibly save us but Superman? And, in 1987, save us he did - from the monotony of movies obeying outdated notions like physics, logic, or quality. Found 2016's Doctor Strange an insufficiently brain-bending super-flick? Look - up in the sky! Decided Superman could use more half-baked politics? It's a bird, it's a plane! Thought Batman and Robin was an offensively garish fourth instalment to a comic book franchise already on the decline? Well, you're right. But also - it's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace! A film that, defying all expectations, manages to be even more bone-headed than its title! Okay - but to give the film what scraps of credit it's due: its conceit of Superman, following suit from his 1940s WWII self (or perhaps Mark Millar's Red Son...), using his powers to intervene on a global sociopolitical scale by making the executive decision to rid the world of its nuclear weapons, IS interesting. Interesting in that the film could perilously easily teeter into a condescending dogmatic diatribe, or a risible, earnest portrayal of a messianic utopia, with humanity joining hands and singing like the Whos at the end of Dr. Seuss' The Grinch. Amazingly, director Sidney J. Furie achieves the worst of both and still manages to lower the bar, with scores of vacuous, patronizingly chirpy speeches (written in response to, and, hilariously, seemingly by, a 10 year old), and political engagement peaking with a shot of a giant net full of nuclear missiles being slung into the sun, so flamboyantly daft you can practically feel your eyes bleed. Oh, and the UN does cheer once Superman announces he will de-nuke them. Fah Who Forres, Dah Who Dorres. Superman IV's production is far more amusing than ridiculing the final product itself (which is saying something), with legends abound of the film's already threadbare budget being cut nearly in half. Rest assured: every absent penny is painfully present in every frame. If the first half's brain- melting speeches weren't enough, the second half, exclusively relying on cutting-edge special effects (for the 1950s), is enough to sink the nail in the kryptonite coffin. In this surreal, metaphysical Mr. Mxyzptlk world, everything moves in slow motion, all gravity is drunk or on vacation, Lois Lane can breathe in space, and Superman has accrued the formidable power of...time-reversing vision...? The plot isn't as plagued with holes as gaping space/time vacuums (here, Clark Kent changes into Superman literally in front of Lois, and she immediately, inexplicably, forgets, as if disturbingly super-roofied). And poor (but exquisitely named) Mark Pillow, as arch-foe Nuclear Man, looking like he's walked off the set of a Flash Gordon porn parody, spends the film either nonsensically battling Superman by running away, bellowing like a demented buffalo, or scratching at him with nails to make Sex in the City envious. Why does he speak with Gene Hackman's voice? Why not ask how his spandex is born with him when cloned in...the sun. Did I mention he's defeated by the power of the mighty elevator? Hey - at least he can have a sympathetic beer with Spider- Man's Sandman, who was vanquished by a vacuum cleaner. Back in 1963. Naturally, Furie's execution manages to make the film even more impossibly awful than the sum of its parts, with such agonizingly slow, clumsy editing, the film promises a second calling as an interrogation torture device. The single kernel of redemption: even this sort of torpid embarrassment can't help but be elevated by John Williams' incomparably soaring score. Still, he's never employed his talents so sheepishly, with each reprise of the Superman theme feeling more apologetic than triumphant. All this, and Superman pauses, mid-fight scene, to barely refrain from making out with the American flag on the moon? Suddenly the raving \"False God\" animosity he incurs in Zack Snyder's fellow campsterpiece Batman v. Superman makes so much sense. You'd expect an ounce of enjoyment to come from the returning cast, but...no, you wouldn't expect much of anything after all this. Granted, even if his Superman is unbearably smug, Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is as endearingly nebbish as ever. So, just when he threatens to allow an ounce of promise, his oblivious posturing in a romantic triangle subplot with Lois and the even more irritating Mariel Hemingway is enough to knead out any pesky lumps of enjoyment amidst the quagmire of inadequacy (phew!). Margot Kidder's Lois is so astronomically vacant that she, at times, nearly passes as an overly made up mannequin, while Gene Hackman, grins like a Cheshire Cat throughout, looking like he spent his (assuredly mighty) salary on the menagerie of prop giraffes that nonsensically populate Luthor's lair. And yes, that is Jon Cryer from Two and a Half Men as Luthor's cringeworthy, MTV-addled nephew. Duuuuuude. Almost commendable in just how audaciously lazy and terrible it is, Superman: The Quest for Peace proudly takes its place in the annals of 'ill-advised part IVs turned worst films ever made,' alongside Jaws IV, and, yep, Batman and Robin. It's prime mock-watching/drinking game territory, but beware: the film is so insidiously dumb it nearly qualifies as a controlled substance unto itself. It's a shame Superman used up all his energy stopping the train in the film's opening act, or perhaps he could have broken the fourth wall and stopped the train wreck of his own cinematic epitaph. -2/10",

The success of the first two Superman films and a few success of the third gave the guys at Cannon Film group and low-budget film producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus a chance to cash in to the craze. Well, they put everything they had, and made it look gimmicky and even spawned stuff from the original. Well, their \"high-flying success\" eventually turns into a disappointment for most fans and moviegoers. Only Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman can possibly save it, maybe even not. The weaker plot and low-budget special-effects totally turn it into a dull sequel. It even \"borrowed\" stuff from the original and even the first sequel, like the romantic flying scene with Lois Lane from the original (instead of flying through dazzling moonlight, they fly over smelly fields of cattle!) If you expect something new in this sequel, don't. It absolutely has none. The plot is preachy, the performances are awful (Though Reeve still has enough strength to save himself) and the special effects are the most especially atrocious. Though it is debatable whether BATMAN & ROBIN, which was also the awful fourth entry of the BATMAN franchise, is any better. Rating: * out of 5.",

The thing with Superman IV : The Quest For Peace, is that never a truer word has been said. It COULD be better, and iam sure that in its entirety with the previously unseen footage in the 134 minute cut of the movie, it would be good. As it is i must judge a patchwork movie. That is the main problem, the movie is badly operated on. Forget the special effects, they work nicely and arent as bad as people and critics will have you believe, we have seen worse. The direction by Sidney J Furie and presumably Christopher Reeve is at best good. The acting by the regulars and fun performances from John Cryer as Lex's nephew and Mariel Hemingway as Lacey Warfield [the love interest] are acceptable [certainly no worse than in any other sci=fi/action movie. And the plot, which has Superman fending off Nuclear arms from the worlds powers and defeating Luthors evil Nuclearman in the process is quite an exciting tale. The problem is that the movie is cut to ribbons. We see about fifteen minutes of what looks like Gene Hackmans best performance as Lex Luther, and Christopher Reeve's character comes over as vey wooden because we miss out alot of his characters development. As an 89 minute movie, Superman : The Quest For Peace is very lukewarm. As a 134minute movie, it looks to be alot better. Those of you who can get the extended version released, you know who you are.

Also aboard is Jon Cryer, the idiot nephew (Who is an even more obnoxious version of Ned Beatty's character) who ultimately makes this a painful venture. The problem with this lame duck sequel, is that Superman starts getting political. Now I can't speak for everyone but I prefer my superheroes heroic and willing to kick ass and save the world at a moment's notice, I don't want to see them go to congress to lobby against Nukes. What also kills Superman IV is the budget. The low budget kills what little credibility to be found, the villain Nuclear Man is awesome in his colossal stupidity. He certainly brings little menace to Supes and it's ridiculous that the climax involves Superman chucking plastic rocks at him. A low budget and a comic book hero is a deadly combo, the best that can ever happen is guilty pleasure fun. (1989's The Punisher and The Incredible Hulk TV movies) However in most cases they just hinder any enjoyment to be had. Also 1989's Punisher and Hulk movies, never tried to preach politics. All in all a sad way to see Christopher Reeve's last role as Superman.

Seriously, I am truly in disbelief that two full-grown adults wrote this horrendous crap-hole. Now, I am fully aware that there are deleted scenes that make this movie make more sense for the viewer. 45-minutes in which the test-audience people scored the film extremely low that the people behind the movie had to do major editing changes leaving out loose ends and plot holes. Even though, if you combined the movie and the deleted scenes, it would still suck.Christopher Reeves and the supporting strong actors were absolutely wasted, and they did the best they can. I feel so bad for Christopher Reeve's regret being involved in the film.\"Superman 4 was a catastrophe from start to finish. That failure was a huge blow to my career.\" and was absolutely certain he wouldn't return.Once again, Lex Luthor has to be the villain for the damn fourth time. BUT HIS COUSIN IS HELPING HIM WHO HAS A SUFFERABLE PERSONALITY? Look, I get that Lex Luthor is supposed to be the main villain of Superman, but there's a thing as overuse. Nuclear Man had so much potential, but Nah. Make him forgettable and not menacing, an absolute joke, be a slave for Lex. \"and not menacing\" This pretty much can explain the poor performance. His outfit is completely ridiculous, and the super long fingernails are way TOO MUCH. Hell, he would be the only villain I wouldn't mind meeting down a dark alley.As the first two Superman movies were absolutely stellar at doing romance, the subplot of Clark Kent and Lacy Warfield is a god damn nightmarish mess. Speaking of romance, CLARK ACCIDENTALLY MADE LOIS FORGET ERASING ALL OF HER CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT DEVOLVING TO AN ANNOYING CHARACTER. WHAT THE HELL MAN. WHAT. THE. HELL. I can't stand the unbearable dialogue, the cheese, the cartoon feel, and the fast pacing.The action isn't on the same level as Superman II. It's too long, painfully slow, doesn't get you excited nor raise your heartbeat. It's laughably embarrassing with Superman lifting buildings in NYC that had god-awful special effects and the part where he manages to capture all missiles in some \"space net\" and throw it to the Sun. Talking about realism to stop the threat of nuclear weapons during the Cold War. The Moon Fight. Oh, my bloody god, I get that there's no gravity. But the fight is slow-mo instead of the duration of moving in the Moon's gravity. It's on the same level as the Kirk & Gorn fight from the OG ST series, LMFAO. AND HOW THE HELL CAN MAYFIELD BREATHE IN DEEP SPACE? Of course, the first Superman movie didn't have realism in it. But, somehow her condition is fine when she's on the Moon? SUPERMAN REBUILDING THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA WITH HIS EYES? I know that it was an unfinished scene, but still.The last two movies are so horrid to the point where people rarely talk about them and praise the first two movies. If you didn't know, there was supposed to be a fifth film that would feature Brainiac. Any big Superman fan like me would love the idea of Superman and Brainiac fighting and wished it had happened. But, I'm not so sure how the fivequel could recover from the fourth installment. Of course, Superman IV flopped at the box office and was panned by critics, audiences and fans, the rest of the cast all refused to work on another Superman film after working on this. Warner Bros. Didn't want to get into another budget dispute with Cannon Pictures which followed a string of other failures. Their company was losing money and went out of business in 1994. If you wish to have more info, I highly recommend you watch Supervoid Cinema's video on it.I don't plan on re-watching this any time soon but probably will do when I watch all of the Superman films whenever there is a new one that we won't see for a very long time. This has to be the worst Superman film, too. Absolute disgrace is how I would put it.1/10.",

I mean at the end when Supes pushes the moon(and forgets to push it back!) in order to block out the sun's rays.  Duh!  After all, he has had all Kryton's knowledge instilled into him before he was four and at 18 had the total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies presented to him and was asked to study and learn them. So why not use a blanket instead? The special effects were shoddy and at times the script was corny.  \"I'm always here for you, you know that and you'll do the right thing no matter what, you always have!\" But I found this film not as bad as others have made out.  It's a very light film and at the end of the day it is science fiction.  In the comic world, Lex Luthor had a brain transplant and came back as his own son!  Why not let outlandish plots such as these live in the movies too?  If you guys are so into realism then simply look out of the window.  See, that's boring! Reeve is great as usual though I couldn't help noticing his Kent character has changed a little.  Gone is the higher voice and akwardness.  He and Lois have developed a bond and have more respect for each other.  Can you see her asking  if there's anything she can do to help in the first 2 movies?  The characters relationship  have(I feel) unintentionally matured and in Superman II Clark was supposed to be very jealous of Superman and when Lois mentioned that 'when a girl's seen Superman in action, Niagra Falls kinda leaves you cold' to where clark gets jealous and Lois apologises and admits she has a one track mind.  Now in this movie Lois actually tells Clark that she loves him  which isn't what Clark really wants to hear.  By the way, how old is Jimmy Olsen supposed to be?  He looks a bit to old to be a cub photographer. The music was good, if a little weak. Alexander Courage did a better job than Ken Thorne, who in his defense, had a small orchestra to play with.  I especially liked the music where Supes takes Lois out for a fly.  In surroundasound this sounds marvellous and the quality is better than in the 1st 2 superman movies(typical). It is too obvious that there were loads of of scenes cut out and the movie is severely handicapped as a result.   If the original cut was boring - so what?  at least it would of made more sense.  Wouldn't that of looked better and gotton more respect?Personally I thought superman III was more boring than this, that film had to much footage of the bad guys and was to heavy handed.  This film tried harder and had more heart.  Leonard Maltin wrote that the sincere performances helped and I agree. Mark Pillow and the guy who plays Lenny fail of course.  The casting associate obviously picked the wrong guy's name out of the hat but I guess that's life.  I can think of lots of films worse than this which include just about every other film Gonan-Globus produced. My conclusion?  A simple harmless film which should keep the kids quiet for 90 minutes, and for the Adults?  Well isn't that obvious?  Go watch the 1st movie instead.",

Again, the high school love from the previous episode was forgotten and returned to Lois. The film begins with the question of whether the farmhouse where Klark first fell to Earth should be sold, and there is no turning back to this issue. Lex Luthor' this time steals 250 pounds of Superman hair tied at the end from a museum. Meanwhile, a businessman bought the Daily Planet Newspaper and turned it into a boulevard newspaper with lots of asparagas. Her daughter is also an executive at the newspaper, and she also began to fall in love with Klarrk. Lex creates Nuclear Man, who gets his power from the sun, from a strand of hair. Superman has been making speeches against nuclear weapons. Lex calls Superman again and confronts Nuclear Man with Nuclear Man screaming just like a bear. They punch a lot again. They run away and go to space. Then Supeeman closes this elevator with a trap and throws it on the dark side of the moon. But the sun appears from here, and the Nuclear Man comes to life. It will hurt Superman. While Superman is sitting at home wrapped in a blanket, he recovers with the stone his mother gave him. Meanwhile, the Nuclear Man likes the daughter of the boss of the newspaper. He'll come get her. Superman won't let me. The nuke sets the place on fire, and Superman is forced to accept. The Nuclear Man takes the girl and escapes into outer space. A miracle happens here. The girl is breathing comfortably in the vacuum of space. Superman is determined to put an end to this nonsense and beats up the Nuclear Man and saves the girl. He also assigns the Nuclear Man to the Nuclear Power Plant. Lois now knows that Klark is Superman. Until they kissed again.",

            "content": "This review contains major spoilers on the deleted scenes so if you don't want to know before you watch them, stop reading now!This movie is every bit as terrible as they say. The tiny production budget from a studio that churned out cheap junk in the mid-to-late eighties really shows, especially in the special effects. Christopher Reeve really got cheated in the deal, as has been documented in several places. One of the few bright spots is Gene Hackman, who can't act poorly if he tried.Having grown up with Superman, I watch this movie every five years or so and enjoy it both for the nostalgia and the extreme awfulness, but tonight I watched the deleted scenes for the first time and they actually would have greatly improved this movie -- although it would still have been pretty bad.The scenes would fill in some gaping plot holes (for instance when Nuclear Man decides he wants Lacy Warfield, how does Superman know who he wants, versus, \"What lady?\". Also, how does Superman know the dark will rob him of his power?). They also add a lot of depth to the story, such as Lex Luther meeting with the Russians and telling them peace is a capitalist plot, and banging his shoe on the table, followed by him meeting with the American military, telling them peace is a communist plot. We also get explanations as to why the characters are doing what they're doing. There are still emotional moments with Lacy Warfield's development as a person and even a tender moment and kiss with Clark Kent.The deleted scenes still have real weaknesses, such as Superman being a painfully obvious stunt double when being thrown by Nuclear Man One. The scenes with Nuclear Man are intended to be humorous, but they're a little over-the-top with silliness.I think the deleted scenes add the most where they make us give a damn about the characters and events, with some of the more tender cues from the original John Williams score.This movie is a real shame all the way around. It's a shame that it was a disappointment for fans and Christopher Reeve, and that it absolutely killed the franchise. It's even sadder since this was the last Superman film, followed by Christopher Reeve's awful fate.",

            "content": "There's a moment early in Superman IV that eludes to what the film was supposed to be: Clark Kent returns to Smallville to talk to a real estate agent about the farm where he grew up, and it's actually a very touching nostalgic scene that invokes the spirit of the original Superman film. It's a simple conversation where Clark holds out to sell the land to a farmer and not a developer, and the agent (being friends with the Kent family) pitches a baseball for old times sake. Kent swings the bat and misses horribly as per usual with the alter ego, and no sooner as the real estate agent starts to drive away, Clark hits the ball into orbit.That scene (and it's underlying score by Alexander Courage) is the only indication of what Superman IV could have been and what it was supposed to be: a return to its original cinematic roots. The return of the Man of Steel.Unfortunately, this scene is trapped at the beginning of a film that fails miserably. The scriptwriters may have had good intentions; however, their first mistake was turning Superman into their own propaganda vehicle. The Quest for Peace, clearly, is an anti-war message. There's nothing wrong with being an anti-war parable. The problem is that's all the film accomplishes. It attempts to show the impact of the decision Superman faces as he briefly receives counsel in the Fortress of Solitude, but the scene carries the weight of an afterthought which is a serious problem juxtaposed to the heavy handed safety awareness video that is the bulk of Superman IV \u0096 \"Hey kids, just say 'No' to drugs and Nukes.\" The focal point rests with disarming the world, while the weight of such a decision on Superman's part remains in our peripheral vision. In another scene, Clark Kent steps off a balcony with Lois Lane, transforming into Superman as they fall. Afterwards he consults with her about disarming the world; however, it comes across as an awkward excuse to get in another romantic flying sequence between the two. A poor retread of the first film, one that's severely out of place in this film. Oh yes, and let's not forget the reprise of the magic kiss from Superman II.But wait, it gets worse. In addition to the anti-war parable, there's also a stern anti-corporation warning. The Daily Planet falls into the hands of a new corrupt owner, David Warfield, the billionaire tycoon who pushes sensationalism to the point of smut. This introduces the character of Lacy Warfield who starts out in daddy's footsteps, but almost immediately (and near inexplicably) falls for Clark and sees the error of her father's ways. This leads to the double date between Lois/Superman and Clark/Lacy. And with Lacy established, now she can fall into danger's way for the finale (although why exactly Nuclear Man develops a spontaneous obsession with her inexplicably remains on the cutting room floor.) Speaking of Nuclear Man, Lex Luthor's creation lacks any trace of menace. He roars, he snarls, he says \"kill Superman\" and \"I will hurt people\", and he gives Superman a mean scratch, but he never really convinces anyone he poses a real threat. Their battle consists of flying around the world, Nuclear Man causing destruction and Superman routinely rescuing the bystanders \u0096 where's the adrenaline? We basically have two Gods fighting it out across the face of the earth and into outer-space, and yet the whole encounter lacks any thrills \u0096 that epic punch this fight deserves. Routine destruction, routine saving-the-day via boring, mundane cinematography, effects, and editing (thank Cannon for that one.) According to screenwriter, Mark Rosenthal, Cannon cut the budget down to a crippling level, and the proof is on the screen immediately with Superman IV's \"power point\" credits sequence, and let's not forget the one shot of Superman flying right at the camera that gets recycled no less than three times throughout the film. The loving attention to detail that sold the effects in previous entries? Richard Donner's \"Versimilitude\"? Gone. Sold out to Cannon's low-budget economy. And what about the epic disasters that Superman averts? In the first film he fixes the San Andreas fault, keeps Air Force One in the air, chases a rocket across the US, catches a helicopter, and reverses Earth's orbit. Here, in Superman IV, the man of steel stops a train by stepping on the subway track.Is it any surprise that in Superman IV, we no longer believe a man can fly?",

            "content": "When Superman IV comes to mind, one often thinks of the pain associated with its viewing. My friend and I, after being stranded on a remote island in Papua New Guinea decided to search for entertainment. Instead, we found the Superman Series.To add a new effect we decided to view them in the opposite order (4,3,2,1). Strangely enough, special effects (which I will assume are supposed to evolve over time) improved (And Reeve's pot-belly appeared to vanish)! (By the way, to avoid embarrassment we watched them *very* late at night with curtains closed!)One also finds themselves asking where are the \"actors\" now?Perhaps Gene Hackman managed to resurrect his career after his potentially career-crippling experience in this movie. However, that big angry man that would occasionally growl (I am still debating with a friend whether the growling was also dubbed!), yes, the man they call Mark Pillow.Where is Mark Pillow now? After looking at his \"impressive\" filmography (QFP and some TV series (Alaska Kid)) one does seem to believe that QFP was in fact Career-Crippling.I have also had many a debate with a friend of mine regarding whether Pillow is constantly tormented by fellow workmates (don't try to tell me he is making his money by \"acting\"), friends (if he still has any!) and family (I won't be that cruel!) with infamous lines such as \"Where is the woman!\" and \"If you don't tell me, I will hurt people!\" (I know I would!)  It is often debated as to whether he was proud of his role in such a pitiful film. We believe that he was thrown out of a bar and landed at the feet of the casting crew who felt sorry for this drunken nobody. I will assume that these people (like Margot Kidder) have been committed.Unfortunately Reeve dared fate with a second shot of the line \"Don't do it, the people.\" after his ear-to-ear smile in Superman II (My friend and I believe that he was daring the phantom zone villains to beat up the innocent citizens of Metropolis with the dangerous irregular movement of a bus!), however while not smiling (this time anyway!) My friend and I were forced to declare the line as a \"Poor Reeve Call\". Lines that we have always found useful in day-to-day life include \"Excuse me, I think your sitting in my seat!\" (II) ,\"Don't thank me, we're all part of the same team!\" (I),\"I won't let you down again!\" (II), \"Stop, that's enough, that's enough. You win, I'll take you to her!\" (IV), \"Give it up you'll never find her\" (IV) and \"Father, I failed!\" (II). If by now you think that we are the ones that should be committed, you are obviously taking these comments far too seriously. While being very accurate, they are humourous as well!So far we haven't really commented on perhaps the most atrocious element of the movie (the special effects)! Ok, I will even accept Lacy Warfield's survival in outer space (and yes, even falling relatively downward!) I know perfectly well that these things can't possibly happen (but then again, \"Superman\" couldn't possibly exist either (sorry!)) It is fiction. However, they could have at least made it look as if it were happening. Even the special effects in the first Superman Movie were better and it was made nearly 10 years ago! I may be picky, but I would expect the effects to at least be on par with those in Superman I.My friend and I were thinking of a wonderful parallel universe where an alternate ending to the second movie involves Superman being humanized again at the end of the movie so that he can pursue his relationship with Lois. This universe would be spared of the peril of a fourth Superman movie.However, perhaps it is advisable to look at why this \"movie\" was ever made. Reeve was not in the greatest financial position of his life and needed a movie that he would be guaranteed a lead role. Perhaps this was one of the infamous Tax write-off's. Needless to say, it was a mistake.Doomsday didn't kill Superman, this movie (Superman IV) did!",

            "content": "Superman: The Movie and Superman II were decent (if not a little dated and cheesy) adaptations of the classic comic-book hero. Then, Superman III came along, with so much absurdity and camp; I didn't think it could get any sillier or dumber than that. Then I saw Superman IV.Suffering from massive budget cuts, this film was cut down to a short, cheap, silly affair. Given the story, I doubt this movie would have been that much better with a bigger budget anyway. The film starts off with a few pointless character-building points and bits of Daily Planet drama (a subplot that ultimately could have been cut out completely without sacrificing much). For the last half or so, however, the film's real meat is in a long, epic, and rather silly clash between Superman and Nuclear Man. Oh, it's pretty cool to see a guy with claws shooting red lightning bolts everywhere, but all the encounters between this villain and the hero are made pretty short and stupidly. Among the absurdities in the film, one of the most defining testaments to this film's weaknesses has to be the scene where Superman rebuilds the Great Wall of China simply by staring at it.The best that can be said is that the film skirts along the \"so bad it's good\" threshold. It's not terribly boring or dull, just poorly executed. It is to Superman what Batman and Robin is to Batman (although I always found B&R a little more endearing).The plot for Superman IV gets a little pushy (and rather one-sided) with its themes of nuclear disarmament. It is ultimately a weak plot, with barely any characterization involved. As daft as most scenes are, it all comes off as shallow and forgettable.This film has its share of okay photography and editing. Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and Jackie Cooper all reprise their roles admirably; Mark Pillow is deliciously over-the-top as the villain. Writing is not terribly great. This production has a rather weak array of sets, props, and costumes. Special effects vary from scene to scene; some look cool, others look terrible. The music score continues to repeat the themes already established by John Williams.Fun, maybe, but definitely the weakest and silliest film in the Superman franchise. Unless you're looking for something to make fun of, you best avoid.2/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Awful | Film: Poor)",

Those overseas geniuses who brought us captivating stuff like \"American Ninja\" and \"Death Wish 4\". Not to mention discovering Jean Claude Van Damme so he could poison the history of movies with his low-grade schlock.  Don't get me wrong, I am a connessiour of film cheese.  \"American Ninja\" and \"Invasion USA\" (another Canon laugher) are a couple of my favorite guilty pleasures.  But in no waydo I want the great Superman lumped together in that category!  What the hell was Warner Bros. thinking?  I and a zillion other 10-year-olds idolized this flying God and jam-packed the theater that July weekend in 1987. Adults, too!  Proving that there was still a big audience for the series despite a four year hiatus.  And we're supposed to believe Warner Bros. wasn't expecting this!  Thus letting Canon and their piggy bank budget take over and crank out a truly sorry addition to any movie series ever?!! Unbelievable.  I could just see the big wigs in the screening room yelling at each other: \"I can't get it to look any better!  You slashed the budget, man!  Of course it's going to look like a cardboard cut-out being superimposed over outer space!\"  And it's this faded-blue shot of Reeve we actually see repeated a few times.  Sad.  Which is not to say all shots came off amatuer.  The landing are ok and some of the take-offs.  But mostly it makes you wince.  Or you're distracted from the abysmal effect because it's occuring to you that if Mariel Hemingway was taken into outer space just in her business suit her head would explode.  Or you're growing increasingly tired of 'Nuclear Man' groaning like a werewolf over and over.  Or the stupid and silly looking dub-job they do of his voice.  Or his Freddy Krueger nails.  Even Reeve at times seems to be going through the motions with old stand-by lines like \"Don't do it!  The people!\", only kind of half yelled.  You're bound to love his WWF moves on the moon, stepping on the bad guy's foot and then driving his knee upwards into his leaned-over head. Ah, geez.  Long gone are those days of donning a red towel around your neck and soaring around the living room.  If this had been the first film in the series?  Yikes.  Oh, the plot.  It has to do with Hackman creating this new nemesis thinking it will finally get him world dominance, riches, whatever. So as Reeve is busy ridding the world of nukes, he inadvertently lobs one into the sun with the bad guy's DNA inside of it.  Once it hits the sun, the guy is born and comes to earth to bug his eyes and talk like Gene Hackman. The cast is decent enough, as Reeve is still winning in both roles, Kidder returns and is adequate, and Hemingway is gorgeous.  But you don't come for that.  You want action and awe inspiring shots.  They nearly had one, where Supes and Lois fly alongside a train through some picture-esque mountains. But when you're distracted by the horridness of the blue-screened actors, it really takes away from the moment.  The only good shot is the final one....which they lift from the original, as they did with all the movies final shots!  It just adds to how embarrassing it is to have your first movie from nine years earlier actually boast better special effects than your newer movie.  I'd love to see a part five, with today's advances in movie making.  But now the trouble lies in who to suit up in the blue and the red, with the unfortunate loss of Mr. Reeve.  \"Superman V: The Quest For A New Actor\".",

The biggest problem this movie had was that it was way too preachy. The cast might as well have held their hands to their hearts and sang \"God Bless America\".The acting is ridiculously bad. Christopher Reeve seems fed up in the role that made him famous, because he doesn't seem to try anymore. Gene Hackman plays the role of Lex Luthor the same as always, so I'll blame the script for his inadequacies.

One of these was \"Jaws: The Revenge\" which saw a bloodthirsty shark chasing Lorraine Gary into the Bahamas.  The other was \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\", which saw the popular comic book hero become the lead character in a politically correct and strangely topical tale.It was only a couple of years after the end of the Cold War, and people were discussing how to rid the world of the leftover nuclear weapons.  In this film, Superman (essayed for the final time by Christopher Reeve) takes a stand and pledges to do exactly that.  At the same time, his old nemesis Lex Luthor (a returning Gene Hackman) is sprung from prison and sets about taking revenge on his old nemesis for past defeats.  When Superman destroys a net-load of nuclear weapons through hurling them into the sun, he inadvertantly (through Luthor's devising) creates Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow), an Aryan blonde terror who sets about being destructive at his scheming master's command...The story lacks the epic scope and wonder that framed the first two \"Superman\" films and even it's topicality doesn't quite save it from being forgettable.  Technically the film is still reasonably well shot but alot of the effects are overly cheesy and cartoonish and have not dated very well at all.  On the dramatic side, many of the film's scenes are strangely void of the vitality that marked the earlier films, especially scenes in the Daily Planet, which nevertheless has an interestingly futuristic look to it.Of the actors, Gene Hackman makes the most of a wasted return as Lex Luthor. Margot Kidder has some touching scenes in the company of Superman/Clark Kent.  Although they can never be together, the bond between them is still strong.  Other returning players are on form, particularly Jackie Cooper as a visibly aged Perry White, the Daily Planet's editor, who gamely tries to stop a greedy mogul (Sam Wanamaker) turning his beloved newspaper into a downmarket tabloid.However, Jon Cryer is forgettable as Luthor's nephew Lenny, vainly trying to fill the comic relief role that Ned Beatty and then Richard Pryor assumed in the first three films.  Mark Pillow looks fearsome as Nuclear Man but is possessed of so little acting ability it is little wonder he has never appeared in a film since.But the film, and indeed the series, belongs to Christopher Reeve, who remains the definitive Superman.  Whether flying through the air with Lois, preaching world peace, or in bed snuffling after getting a hiding from Nuclear Man, Reeve will always be the yardstick by which measure his successors in the part (including Dean Cain in the bland Nineties TV series which turned the comic book story into a soap opera).It's just a pity he ended his tenure as the hero with a whimper and not the deserved bang.",

This is the only one of the 4 Superman movies where you can actually see his cables holding him up.the only thing worst than the special effects was the laughable script. C'mon...I could not believe my eyes when superman and Nuclear man were carrying Mariel Hemmingway around in outer space with no space suit on her (and yet she is okay)...not to mention the cartoonish action sequences (like the one where Superman stops a volcano by cutting a mountain in half with his X-ray/heat vision and plugs the top half of the mountain into volcano's mouth....which in reality would have only created more volcanic back pressure and would have only caused a much larger more violent eruption)how did this franchise get here. the first 2 films were standard setters..true classics in their own time, and although the 3rd film isn't in the same class as the first 2, the 3rd film is still very good..but Superman 4 leaves you scratching you head and asking yourself WHAT HAPPENED?",

Which means it's guaranteed to suck! Now, Superman is faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. To describe this installment in his film franchise accurately, it's dumber than Paris Hilton without a brain, more laughable than Tara Reid trying to play a scientist (it doesn't matter what kind), and is able to induce mass audience confusion with a single plot hole!The Positives: -Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman are both in it, but in all honesty that doesn't save this film in any way whatsoever. -The plot's main premise (Superman tries to rid the world of all nuclear weapons) is interesting, yet completely wasted.The Negatives: -Nuclear Man (who must be the lamest, most laughable villain I've ever seen), Jon Cryer (who somehow managed to not get burnt at a stake by angry fanboys), Mariel Hemmingway (did I spell that right? Oh yeah, I remember, NO ONE CARES!), the terrible visual effects (damn you, Golan Globus!), the terrible visual effects, the laughably bad logic (how can Mariel Hemmingway breathe in space when Nuclear Man takes her up there? And how do Superman and Nuclear Man's hair and cape flutter in nonexistent space wind?), the subplots that are brought up early on and are forgotten about until the movie's almost over and concluded abruptly even though they never went anywhere, the little boy who convinces Superman to get rid of all the warheads suddenly disappearing from the film entirely... do you want more? Well too bad, I've got better things to do!My 3 choice words: -Extortion, shameful, torturous",

Let's see what people are talking about because they say bad things for Superman III but it is a decent movie in my opinion. Wait so these astronauts have an accident and Clark happens to be in space to save them? A bit too convinient. Jon Cryer is in this? Lol, I didn't know, that's awesome. Glad to see Lois is in this because she has like 2 minutes of screen time in Superman 3. In this one Clark's hair looks good, it looks right, while in Superman 3 it was a weird mix of black and brown. It's kind of funny when you hear Clark saying that being a reporter is about truth, he should see modern reporters, it's all about the money and clicks.So Lex wants to use Clark's hair to create some kind of monster-clone of Superman, that's definitely an interesting idea but im curious, if Superman's hair is so strong how was Lex able to cut it, and then take it? Love that the kid sent a letter to Superman asking him to prevent nuclear war. Also the way they used the kid to sell more newspapers is sick but very realistic too. Love Clark's struggle to decide what he should do. I think Reeve is more skinny in this compared to the previous films. The first 30 minutes of the movie? A solid 7.6/10 for me. Loved Superman's speech. Something is off about Lois and Clark. In Superman 3 it was obvious that they weren't together so is it the same situation in this? Ok, 1st hour is a solid 7.7/10.Let's see where this goes. How was Superman able to rebuild that wall with some weird blue heat vision?, doesn't make sense to me. So the Nuclear Man went inside a volcano but after that his suit didn't burn and start melting? How? Wait Lois doesn't know that Clark is Superman? Am I missing something? Didnt see learn in Superman 2 that Clark and Superman are the same person? Im confused. Im trying to understand why Nuclear Man took the woman to space, like what was the point? While some of the special effects were bad and certain things didn't make any sense the movie was pretty entertaining, I don't understand why people hate it so much. It's not a masterpiece but it's a good movie in my opinion and I enjoyed it.The last 30 minutes weren't as good as the 1st hour and that's why I will give it a lower rating. My rating is 7.3/10. I suggest anyone who loves Superman to watch it.",

            "content": "This is definitely not what the Superman Saga should be remembered for. However, it is a decent idea and it does bring back Hackman as Lex Luther which is good to see.  However, his sidekick, Otisburg, must have read the script and opted not to audition!  The movie is inspired by Iran-Contra (Oliver North 80s) and the Cold War of the middle and late 80s.  Nuclear war is something that Superman opposes and he decides to rid the planet of all nuclear warheads.  As he is tossing the missiles into the sun like they are toothpicks, Luther has been secretely formulating a plan to use Superman's own DNA against him.  He steals a piece of Superman's hair (over his ears) from a museum and makes a potion that will react with solar energy to form Nuclear Man.  The concoction is fastened to a missile and when Superman throws it into the sun, Nuclear Man pops out and heads over to the moon (where Superman happens to be) and they have a brief battle.  Nuclear Man, controlled by Luther, decides to hit up earth and goes to visit his master.  Luther can control Nuclear Man by shutting the curtains and blocking the sun.  He gets his energy from the sun, not from eating hot dogs and Doritos in a bowl like humans.  Anyways, they have their usual battles and Superman almost is carved to death, but returns and throws Nuclear Man into a nuclear power plant which gives unlimited energy for 1,000 years.  Great ending!This is all, I seriously doubt there will be another sequel given Superman's (Reeve's) current condition of handicapped circus sideshow!",

            "review_title": "A very bad film yet not as bad as the abomination that is, Superman III",
            "content": "Superman III is not considered to be the worst of the Superman films but now that I've seen Superman III and the abomination that is Superman IV, I can happily say that Superman III is simply far worse than Superman IV which is by no means a good film apart from the fact that it has a few good factors to it such as the returning cast, the character of Superman and the Superman like moments and the overall short duration of the film that ensures us that this film isn't as horrid and stinky as Superman IIISuperman agrees to stop the launch and use of nuclear weapons and begins to put an end to it but by a complete accident, he creates a man of nuclear referred to as NuclearMan whose one task is to kill Superman, under orders from a returned Lex Luthor.Superman is an iconic movie character, respected and even worshipped by some and often labelled the greatest superhero ever made and one of the all time great movie characters. Thanks to Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner, Superman is a worshipped character from the magic of the first two Superman films which portrayed him as an honest, courageous, courteous, brave and determined fighter whereas Superman III didn't really take the character anywhere and explore his sudden evil side. Whilst potential, terrible overuse of slapstick humor and a horrendous story destroyed the film to a point beyond repair. Thankfully, Superman IV got two things perfectly right about the film and that is the character of Superman and how is loyalty to Metropolis as well as Reeves' portrayal who absolutely nails it once more! It was almost a joy to see everything about Superman recovering since Superman III and this is quite simply, the only good aspect of the filmI've never criticized special effects in films and normally, I don't intend to. When you consider how great the effects in the first three Superman films are and how Superman II had a budget of over 50 million and that the latest instalment, which was produced seven years later, has less than $25 million, it is so definitely clear that this film was not to ever be made considering the box office and critical failure of Superman III. The effects in this film look beyond horrendous, even unwatchable especially sequences involving Superman or Nuclearman flying through space or Metropolis. It looks like a terribly edited version on Photoshop where nothing looks realistic enough to take seriously. Sequences involving flying around in Metropolis, especially a scene that ruins Superman in two ways involving Superman taking Lois for yet another fly around Metropolis is not only hard to take seriously, it completely destroys the magical moment from the first film and makes Superman a rather hard character to understand. I guess it's time to get used to him in Superman Returns but thankfully, this is the only instance where Superman is portrayed as a douche. Having taken her for a tour, he gives her a mind erasing kiss (which still makes no sense) in order for her to forget that he is Superman. Simply, the special effects looked horrendous. Even Monty Python and the Holy Grail, being a 1975 picture, had better effects of God!Whilst Christopher Reeve is outstanding as Superman and Gene Hackman is as usual, good as Lex Luthor, the rest of the cast simply aren't interesting even Marc Maclure as Lois Lane, who simply doesn't show the same enthusiasm and passion as she did in the first two. Clearly a bad sign! The acting comes off rather horrendous especially the voice of Nuclearman done by Hackman, who completely makes it truly ridiculous to take seriously. The new characters in this film aren't interesting. The entire story evolving around the Daily Planet is simply stupid and how the story unfolds there is completely ridiculous and to top it off, more and more annoying and one dimensional Superman characters are introduced. Even Lux Luthor himself is uninteresting throughout the film and Nuclearman is a complete waste of some potential.The story, whilst having potential, simply doesn't turn out to be anything special or even remotely, interesting. Much of the film is simply boring and thankfully, clich\u00e9d slapstick is not thrown into the film to make it worse! It definitely has a Superman feel to it and in some ways, had some great sequences such as the scene involving Kal-El's Kryptonian ancestors where they warn him to stay away from human affairs. However, this scene is completely betrayed later in the film and much of the individual scenes taking place in the film are completely unnecessary and are rip offs from the first two films.Overall, in some ways I cannot understand how loathed this film is yet Superman III is allowed a free pass. It just shocks me to see how this film is the most hated of them all but honestly, whilst a terrible film is made to be a great film when watching immediately after Superman III. A lack of stupid slapstick and a computer villain make this a better film than its predecessor but still not a good film by any means.",

Unfortunately, this isn't the case with the fourth (and what we thought was the final) in the Superman series. First off, the \"special\" effects. One word: FAKE! We have Warner Bros. to thank for that for selling the rights to Cannon Films who, instead of using the $40 million Warner Bros. gave them to produce the film, used only $17 million and used the rest of the money on their other projects. Next up we have (drumroll)... the numerous plot holes e.g. people being able to breathe in space without space suits. Did I miss something here? Thirdly, the editing. Oh my, that poor, poor editing. The cuts were so noticeable, I was wondering if I was watching a Daytime TV edit of a Horror movie. And finally, the acting. Wow. It was like something out of a school play (and a bad one at that). But, I suppose the actors did the best they could with the (truly atrocious) script.Superman IV doesn't even classify as a \"so bad, it's good\" movie. At least not when you compare it to the highly superior first two.Some people have said that this movie is worse than Batman & Robin. Trust me, it is not. Not even close.

            "content": "Dear Superman Superman, Superman, how could you have sunk this low? Look mate, you had two brilliant films before. Superman, a huge achievement for all involved and the film that more or less kick started the superhero genre and Superman 2, a brilliant sequel that, while not a huge landmark like the first, can still stand on it's own in terms of story and acting.But then it started falling apart.When the Newmans were bought in to write Superman 3, that's when I started dreading the future of your franchise. They wanted to make your first movie campy and all that nonsense, but luckily they got kicked out. Sadly with Richard Donner truly out of the action, the Salkinds bought them in and Superman 3 became the film I was dreading it to be, a silly and stupid film with constant mugging from Richard Pryor and really terrible and dated gags.Then they tried to give Supergirl a film of her own and it even that wasn't a hit with the critics.Afterwards the Salkinds said \"Enough is enough\" and thus they sold you off to Cannon Films.That's when the cracks was really starting to show.Cannon are a rather cheap company and I knew a studio as cheap as Cannon certainly can't do justice to a superhero like you.And they tried.... they really did...and it was all for nothing.I really hate to say this to ya Superman, but man oh man was your fourth film a huge disaster all round. In fact even more than the third one.The plot sounded rather interesting, I mean you trying to stop a nuclear war from happening. That is a perfect concept for a fourth film... but then Nuclear Man walks in, and the only way from there is downhill.Reeeaaalllyyy downhill.Soon the film starts to really take a nose dive, everything from the dialogue to the incredibly cheesy and horrifically awful special effects start taking over.We're not taking this seriously, we're laughing.Laughing at the fact that the tornado scene is so laughably fake (fake as in it was all done on green screen.Laughing at the fact that the final battle between you and Nuclear Man is really just an excuse to show off incredibly cartoony looking effects.Laughing at the fact that Gene Hackman sounds unintentionally funny as Nuclear Man (played by a rather wooden looking Mark Pillow by the way).But at the same time, we're thinking... why... why are we being subjected to torture like this? Look I'll give some of the actors credit, it was nice to see Gene Hackman back as Lex Luthor (even though the horrible dialogue didn't do much)and Christopher Reeve was alright as of course you, Superman.But all of it still feels like it was done for nothing.It feels like it was just done to keep your franchise alive and made for a quick penny so that Cannon can make more cheesy films.Well the joke was on them... The film ended up bombing and it was panned by critics and fans alike.Yet I still feel disappointed at you Superman, I feel disappointed that instead of a film that would rub away all those horrid memories of Superman 3, we instead got a film that made that look like Citizen Kane.Honestly Superman, you're a super hero. And you should know better than to put your name on low budget guff like this? Well at least you got Man Of Steel afterwards though that still isn't saying much...Here's hoping someone actually does you justice in the near future...From RetroMagFan",

The movie was way too short, it feels very hasty, especially when you compare it to the first two films. I've seen the deleted scenes and i really have to say it's a good thing they were left out. Nuclear Man #1 is horrible. He's not menacing or scary, he looks stupid. Like a failed incarnation of some silly Frankenstein film.One of the biggest mistakes i have ever seen in a movie is one made in this film. Nuclear man 2 takes Lacy (a human with no superpowers whatsoever) into space. She doesn't freeze, hell she even breathes!! I don't know what the director was thinking.. This is careless film-making.But let's not just focus on the negative side. The movie also has a few good things. The original cast returned (Margot Kidder as Lois, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Gene Hackman once again as Lex Luthor and of course, our hero, Christopher Reeve returning as Superman). The fight scenes were very cool but looked bad because of the horrible special effects. If you can ignore the bad stuff i mentioned above, it's still a fun film to watch.5/10",

This is a good idea, but of course there are numerous problems with this:  1) what happens if a country abstains?  Does superman beat that country up? 2) every nuclear country STILL has nuclear weapon technology and knows how to make ISBMs, so what is the point of throwing nukes into the sun when any country can make more ISBMs?Anyway, after Reeve's pretty good speech, he goes and throws all the nukes into the sun - but this produces a stupid and very dumb bad guy called Nuclear Guy or something with solar energy.Superman and Nuclear Guy then fight on the moon - whilst BREATHING very loudly - this one scene is so bad it becomes funny.  But all this doesn't matter because all superman has to do is block the sun.Unfortuently it takes 50 minutes before we actually get to see Superman do this and throw Nuclear guy into a nuclear reactor.  This for some reason causes EVERY light to switch on.Huh - I thought this film was suppos'd to be ANTI-nuclear, now its pro?This film has NO good story, for an 1980s film, the sfx are the WORST I've ever seen.

Most people know now that Cannon slashed the budget for this film just before it was to be filmed and it is impossible to make a Superman movie on the cheap. These films are very reliant on their special effects, we must believe Superman is flying and using all his various Super powers and this film just didn't have the budget to convince the audience. The same awful effect of a greenish Superman flying towards the screen is used over and over again, every special effect looks cheap and nasty. If thats not bad enough the story is very poor and makes little sense. I felt sorry for the actors and the director as they were on a loser from the start. Christopher Reeve looks like he knows he is making a bad film and gives easily his worst performance as Superman and even more so as Clark Kent, also he must take some of the blame as he came up with the dodgy \"rid the world of nuclear missiles story\". Funny thing is even though the whole world knows Superman is going to pluck all the missiles out of the air and throw them into the sun they continue to launch them! Why not just say OK fair enough just take them all Superman, oh and by the way what exactly is going to stop the Red Army from marching across Europe now Supes? The UK for instance would have had no Nuclear Detterent??? But I don't really want to get bogged down in the whole Political side of this film, neither did Reeve's either as his story seems just an excuse for Lex Luthor to release the worst villain in any Superhero movie, Nuclear Man, or maybe Mulletman... whatever, he looks more like the lead singer of Whitesnake than a credible villain. Also on the acting side even Gene Hackman who is nearly always fantastic doesn't look in the mood to put the effort in. The less said about Jon Cryer and Marc Pillow the better, they are poor substitutes for Ned Beattie and Terence Stamp from the first two Superman films.

            "content": "After going through the painful territory for \"Superman III,\" I have now gone myself to the stupidity territory of \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\" This is the end of the franchise, and for Christopher Reeve for playing both Clark Kent and Superman. The plot of the movie is pretty much lame, because it is really about Superman who is going to rigged the world of all nuclear weapons while Lex Luthor escapes from prison with the help of his nephew as they create their own Superman as he was born from the sun with all the nuclear solar powers to become Nuclear Man or something like that. Sorry for not giving you much detail about the plot, because the movie itself actually goes completely nowhere. Its amazing how this franchise went completely downhill, where you start off something amazing to a travesty. If this movie didn't killed the franchise, then the Salkinds didn't have to fire Richard Donner for \"Superman II\" so that he can finish the movie 100 percent, and have Tom Mankiewicz (on IMDb trivia for \"Superman III\") direct \"Superman III;\" if it stays like, then it would be either a great trilogy or make four or five \"Superman\" movies so that this franchise would stay strong, and very much ended on a satisfactory note. But no, Donner got fired so the Salkinds would bring Richard Lester to direct \"Superman II\" (which I still enjoy, but Donner's cut is better) and \"Superman III\" so they would go into camp factor, and have Richard Pryor in the third movie. Now, for the fourth movie, the Salkinds gave up and sold it to Golan-Globus' Cannon Films to produce the movie, which it definitely makes matters worse. The special effects in this movie are just awful. How awful? The budget was originally 36 million dollars, but as Cannon Films was into financial problems, they slashed the budget to 17 million dollars as they kept reusing effects like Superman flying right into the camera and have it poorly composite. I wish if they hadn't slashed its original budget, so that effects wouldn't look like this. The only good effect is the same footage from the first three movies that ends with Superman flying into space, and smiles at the camera. You really if the effects for this movie are just as good as the first three, and maybe keep getting better at it. The movie is directed by Sidney J. Furie, who is a director that I am not familiar with has not done a great job on making this movie, and I wonder if he wasn't satisfied the way how the movie is presented; if he admitted it, then I would forgive him. The story itself isn't that well told, but it comes to a shocked that Christopher Reeve co-wrote the screenplay. I remember watching videos of him on YouTube, where he said that he wasn't satisfied with the third one so he can make a \"Superman\" movie that he want to see so it can be as good as the first two, and pretty much forget about three. I'll give him credit for that for at least trying to come up with a better story, but sadly it was not well executed as Reeve himself isn't satisfied with this movie as he hoped for the way he envisioned. The action isn't really that good either, and I really don't have much comment on the music so its really just there. This movie is filled with a bunch of errors like the child actor that plays Jeremy disappears out of nowhere, Nuclear Man kidnaps Lacy as he takes her to space as she can breath perfectly fine, Superman moving the moon, fixing the great wall of China and Superman getting sick as we never see how is able to recover, when he has that darn green crystal in his hands. Wow, movie! I mean, wow! Now, after my issues with this movie, is there anything that I liked? I hate to admit, but the movie is filled with great actors who very much wasted on such great talents. Most of the actors and actresses gave their all, but pretty much ended up by going into a bad direction. I don't have much comments on either Mariel Hemingway or Mark Pillow as Lacy and Nuclear Man, because they're just there and don't care whether they did good or bad. However, it is nice to see Gene Hackman returning as Lex Luthor as he did his best with a bad script, but don't think he did good as the voice of Nuclear Man which I find it pretty silly. I really don't care for his nephew as he is played by Jon Cryer. Margot Kidder does her best to as Lois Lane, and I really wish if there was more romance between her character and Superman. Oh, I forgot to mention that she does remember that Superman's real name is Kal-El as that erased memory kissed didn't help from the second one, and now Superman erases her memories again. Well, gee, that was pretty pointless. As for Christopher Reeve, it is sad that this was the last time that we ever seen him to play both Clark Kent and Superman, until his passing on October 10, 2004; he still is giving a great performance and whenever he is on screen you know that he will always be Superman as his legacy will live on forever. We surely do miss him, and I know many fans will still remember him. Even me. With that said, \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" hits the nail of the coffin for killing the franchise as he returns to the big screen in \"Superman Return,\" then he disappears, and reappears again in \"Man of Steel.\" I give this movie a 2 out of 10.",

Why was a lot of the scenes for the daily planet recorded in Milton Keynes instead of New York City?! NO NO NO! Superman should be treated like its first film, in-depth smart and funny. Excellent cast and a big budget to make it real. This could have been so good if it had the budget. Some aspects were good such as the visit to smallville, the love interest with Clarke and Lacy Warfield,the take over of the daily planet, and the films theme of nuclear disarmament, and most of the original cast...

There are sub-plots that come in, take up screen-time and don't really have a proper pay-off. The way in which the villain Nuclear Man is established is weirdly convoluted and takes up so much time that he when he finally arrives about two thirds through the film, the conflict with him feels rushed, like they had a series of superhero cliches they needed to tick off a list in the shortest amount of time. In the midst of all this, there's meant to be some commentary on peace, but it's completely lost in the producers' quest for a generic hero versus villain superhero film. This film is a mess. It might not be as bad as some comic book fans like to make out, but it is not a good film. Fortunately, nowadays there are good superhero films that have tackled the question of peace far more effectively. 3/10",

            "content": "My film knowledge is clearly wanting, because I found out only yesterday that Milton Keynes doubled Metropolis during the making of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace - a fact which alone sums up the scope, ambition and grandeur of Sidney J Furies's nail in the Man of Steel's cinematic coffin for almost twenty years. Looking back, it's so apparent what different an age these Superman movies lived in, a 1980's where comic-book movies were seen as disposable fluff, certainly not keeping up with the tide of seminal graphic novels that only now is cinema truly catching up with. The Quest for Peace is very close to being an outright abomination, saved primarily by the goodwill radiating from the whole thing... saved not enough, mind you, to prevent rendering it as possibly the worst comic-book movie ever made, or certainly close to its pure nadir.You could cite a million problems. Story. Script. Production. Casting. It's pretty much got the lot, which in itself is an achievement. The low budget means Furie has to shoot in wholly unrepresentative locations that are so far away from the classy glamour of the first movie it's unreal, while ironically given Hollywood was on the verge of CGI breakthroughs around this time, the effects are the shoddiest of all four movies; the story starts in earnest fashion, with the interesting notion of Superman being called upon to interject in a nuclear arms race (though given, at this point, America & Russia were practically bowling buddies, it's not exactly razor sharp political commentary) utterly shattered when it descends (after a bizarre sequence where Supes throws ALL the nukes INTO THE SUN - surely that's a terrible idea, scientists?) into yet another dumb Lex Luthor farce of a plan and introduces the most laughable antagonist in comic-book history... NUCLEAR MAN! Oooooh! Run from his poodle perm! Hide from the daft lycra suit somehow created by the mad Frankenstein physics that creates him! Duck when he swipes you with his long, trimmed nails! I genuinely am not exaggerating about this guy... seriously, if he'd been accompanied throughout by Pepsi & Shirley, they would not have seemed out of place. In a way, he's brilliant for comedy - you try and fathom WHY he picks up the Statue of Liberty and decides to lob it down on a New York street. Good luck with that. He's just... amazingly awful, and once he turns up it just descends into the worst battle for supremacy you're ever likely to see on film. Poor Gene Hackman - he should have carved a comic-book legacy as Luthor, sadly he may just be remembered for all the wrong reasons when it comes to these films... I just hope he got paid well, frankly.Is it all bad? Well... yes. Almost. I feel most sorry for Christopher Reeve - what a way to exit his most iconic role, though admittedly he didn't necessarily know it'd be his last, but he must have known this was garbage. He does gamely well, in fairness, as charming and effortless as ever, and way above the material. Ditto Margot Kidder, reinstated properly here as Lois Lane, who gives possibly her sleekest & most assured performance in the role, again despite working with detritus (and having to share too much screen time with Mariel Hemingway's wet lettuce love rival). Those two just--just--make watching this worthwhile but only, truly, if you are a Superman completest. No, really.Superman IV has a lot to answer for, really. It--and the preceeding movie--meant very few movie makers in Hollywood took the superhero genre seriously for a long, long time and though Tim Burton's Batman would level the playing field a little more soon after, The Quest for Peace truly showed how not to treat Superman or his genre.",

I guess it was true that Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (and what a joke that title is) was the final nail in the coffin for the Superman films, at least until it was rebooted with \"Superman Returns\". While the first film could make you believe that a man could fly, here, you'd probably think he was sailing along on wires behind a green screen. So what was so bad about this film? For those of you who haven't seen the film, basically, it's about Superman stopping nuclear arms conflict and beating up a guy who was created from a strand of his hair. Oh, and there's some other stuff about Clark going on a date and some old guy trying to take over the Daily Planet. That's about it.Where do I begin? The lame storyline? The truly atrocious acting? The god-awful special effects? It honestly boggles my mind to see how the franchise went from a blockbuster starring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve, to a piece of tripe starring Reeve and Hackman as caricatures of themselves. It feels like everyone is just hamming it up in this picture, which is a shame because the actors could have done so much more with their roles.The \"plot\" is a total waste of time and space. Who cares about ever being in danger, because no matter who you are around the world, Superman will save you! Whether it's Russian cosmonauts in space or conveniently-timed subway train problems, it seems that Superman can actually sense problems in advance! That's...really stupid. And apparently, Superman is all-knowing enough that he can just ask every single world leader to disarm their nuclear arsenals, and that they will comply WITHOUT HESITATION. I mean, it's not like some of those countries based their entire economies on the development of nuclear power, right? Right? There are some really terrible special effects shots in this film. It's plainly obvious to see, because there is footage recycled from the earlier entries in the series, bizarre effect shots (most notably, one instance where Superman flies through space with his cape flapping (???), and another instance in which he flies through a subway station, and the extras don't even bother turning to look at him!), some truly horrid green screen work (in the Fortress Of Solitude with the elders and the 1/3'rd size Superman flying through the subway!), and just plain strange visual effects (Superman repairing the Great Wall Of China with some random green beam that came out of his eyes!). Needless to say, this is not the shining hallmark of glory in the FX department.Character development? Ha! Forget it! Superman still acts like a bumbling fool, Lex Luthor is STILL a conniving clown, and it actually looks like Lois Lane has regressed in intelligence and thought from the first film. Then again, there is Nuclear Man, who barely even has a vocabulary, so I guess we should be thankful for that development.Bottom Line: It's terrible, no doubt about that. I give this film a 1 out of 10, the lowest rating. Seriously, ANYTHING is better than this. Go watch the first one to see how the character was done right.",

I know for a fact that orginally there was supposed to be 2 nuclear monsters, one created from a nuclear bomb and the second created from the nuclear furance of the sun. But the producers decided to to use only the solar nuclear villian. So we have Superman fighting a villian dressed in red sequins and gold polyester.

Didn't the producers know that fans wanted to see a worthy movie, not a cheap imitation?The real problem was that the Salkinds left after #3, leaving the filmmakers with cheap producers, and not choosing a better director than Sydney J.

While making a point to get rid of nuclear weapons is terrific, the movie is an absolute mess. Ok, let's see. First, the special effects. You think that special effects would get better in 1987, WRONG. When Superman and Nuclearman fly, they look like paper dolls pasted onto the screen, the only thing that moves are the capes. I never knew special effects can be THAT shoddy. Worst f/x, when Superman rebuilds the Great Wall of China. Second, acting, with the exception of Chris Reeve, Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder, the acting is horrendous, especially by Jon Cryer, who plays Lenny Luthor and Mark Pillow, the infamous Nuclearman. I mean, you just have to laugh when Mark Pillow growls and howls up in the air. Third, the situations. Why doesn't Mariel Hemmingway explode when she is taken up into space? What happened to her after she is taken back to Earth by Superman? She is never seen again after that. Why doesn't Superman put the moon back in place? Why does Lex Luthor have hair?

Superman tries to save humanity from itself! Perry White looses the Daily Planet to a competitor! Superman fights a villain created from his own DNA! If the filmmakers had anywhere near the passion for this material that went into the first two films then it would have been a very entertaining Superman movie! and it may have been the first Superman film to break 200 Million at the Box Office! But, it was not to be! I was hoping that there would be five Christopher Reeve Superman films and this film, sealed that fate! I have seen the new Brandon Routh Superman and I feel that the new filmmakers have a passion for the material, but the films story is weak! The special effects were top-notch and the cast is great! But I think the story ideas for Superman IV are actually better then the story ideas that went into Superman Returns! (However, it's good to see a Superman film in the hot 100 selling films of all time again). I would like to get all the film shot for Superman IV and find the special effects team for Superman Returns and get them to take out the bad special effects and re-do the Special Effects through CGI! How much would this cost anyway?",

I recently went out and purchased the first two movies and I enjoy the first three moves (Sure the third one isn't the best, but it's watchable, plus the whole computer thing was cool). However this movie isn't watchable. It's bad. Someone else has commented that we shouldn't expect something deep and meaningful and he's right, but we should expect something entertaining. There was nothing entertaining in this movie.\nI caught this movie on WGN last weekend (It was Movies for guys who can do the MST3K thing on Movies) and I was at least expecting better special FX or Lex Luthor to be as good as he was in the first two movies, or Superman to be in shape, or a some-what intelligent villan in Nuclear Man and I expected the Fortress of Sollitude to look like it did in the first two. I could go on.There is talk of a 5th Superman movie. If you read the interviews with Kevin Smith, you will read that the WB execs are probably gonna continue the tradition as there was in this film, sadly.",

This was to be their final outings in their respective roles in this iteration of Superman.Unfortunately, their presence alone was not enough to boost this movie both in story and at the box office. The Salkinds were no longer in charge. Instead, Golan-Globus and the Cannon Group were brought on to get this off the ground.The premise of this movie was a worthy one for our beloved hero: Superman wants to rid the world of nukes and his traditional arch-nemesis Lex Luthor had other plans to prevent that. Unfortunately, the Cannon Group and their writers couldn't make it interesting enough to draw audiences.While I enjoyed many of the flicks put on by the (now defunct) Cannon Group, it was apparent that superheroes and the Superman franchise were not their forte'. \"Low budget\" doesn't always equal low quality, but for this movie, unfortunately, the results were less-than-stellar.From what I gather, the Cannon Group was already in financial trouble when they took on the reins of the Superman series. This was a chance for them to start the road to recovery and make up for Superman III's dismal performance. They failed. Cannon continued their downward spiral and Superman IV did much worse than III.This was truly the end of the an era for Christopher Reeve's iteration of Superman, his fellow players who started in it and the original production company. While it was inevitable that the players for this iteration would no longer be playing those roles (as the years went by), it was sad to see their finale in these roles in this less- than-desirable chapter.",

Both began with two great movies that changed the genre in different ways, both had a third installment with a different director which ended up having its moments but ultimately being a silly, hollow mess and both ending with a car crash of a fourth installment which ruined the credibility of the superhero genre.Yes, Superman IV: The Quest For Peace is the 'Batman and Robin' of the Superman film series, except I can at least laugh at how bad that was. Superman IV is just....I'm not sure what I feel while watching it. Anger? No. It's too silly for that. At the end of the day, it's just a completely inept movie on the same level as Jaws: The Revenge, and that's a fitting comparison as both are some of the worst movies of all time.The visual effects are staggeringly awful, with terrible green screen shots and the same shot of Superman flying towards the camera being used over and over and over again, there are dozens of plot holes (the UN are just.....OK with Superman disarming all their nuclear weapons? The Justice League animated show, a show far more intelligent than this by the way, handled that better), there are dozens of subplots that go nowhere like the integrity of the Daily Planets new owner of the girl who fancies Clark, Lois does nothing of note despite her expanded role except one lazy scene where they redo the plot of Superman II (with the same end result) in about two minutes (f**k this movie), Nuclear Man is the worst villain ever put on screen as not only does he look unconvincing but sounds it too, with his voice by Hackman (also playing Lex Luthor again in this movie) being a dodgy match for the actor and the awful, awful dialogue. The movies problems are literally endless, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't such an assault on the eyes as well as the brain.This is not only one of the worst comic book movies ever made, it's one of the worst movies ever made. A lazy, cheap, badly edited, badly written, insulting, torturous, unbearable, corny pile of garbage.Want to know why Bryan Singer ignored Superman III and IV when making Superman Returns in 2006?

For example there's a scene in which a human being is taken into outer space without any astronaut gear.  Along with that, the dialog at times gets corny e.g. the line \"If you don't tell me were she is, I'll hurt people!\"  And seeing the charcater Nuclear Man growl like a wild animal and mug are perhaps things that could garner in some unintended laughs.  Things could have been fleshed out better with the plot which gets to the fact that the movie contains various plot holes.  The action scenes in Superman IV often seems rushed and sloppy (this is very appearent in a around the world battle sequence which itself feels like padding for a film that's already lacking in the plot department).  The special effects in Superman IV are shoody on a regular basis.  The flying sequences lack in grace and there are about two things that stand out about the flying sequences.  When there's a head on shot, the only thing that appears to move are the cape and the fact the a blue screen was used looks too obvious (not to mention that the lighting looks unbalanced and there's occasional static during the flying sequences).  When there's a wide angle shot, it looks like dolls were used.  Another effect that are worth pointing out are shots that look like stock footage (which is recycled throughout this film), among others.  I can't point out every effect that I felt was below average, but you got the idea.",

Until Christopher Reeve decided he didn't want the part about Superman to end with the horrible aftertaste of the third film, so he co-wrote this one, about nuclear missles and such. Said to be the best Superman ever, this film would add new characters to the great old, and classic, while new troubles and excitement would abound.Thus, Lex Luthor, one of the greatest criminal minds of all time was brought back. But...something went wrong. Warner Brothers agreed to distribute, but not produce. So Reeve and co. went to a small pciture company, Cannon pictures and set up a deal for a 36 million dollar project. However, the stakes were high, and Cannon wanted more money to do other projects, so they slashed the budget of Superman IV, leaving only a puney 17 million to work with. Finally, after the project went underway, special effects and blue screen shots were re used, opticals were used shy of wires, and thus the wires were exposed. The blue screen looks terrible, blue outlines around everything on screen, and furthermore, the film was cut by 34 minutes to ensure it would do good. It didn't.Though it had great morals of no more violence and weapons, and had a few good moments with Lois and Superman, the REAL chemistry was just not there for alot of the returning cast. And Mariel Hemingway is as carboard as it gets. Furie's directing could use a better take as well. All in all, if Superman IV had a better director, better supporting cast(nuclear man was a terrible actor!), and bigger budget, then this film would have done about as good as Superman, Superman II, and Supergirl. But alas, Superman IV was a failure and the franchise ended. But what a wonderful franchise it was. The world is blessed that such a series could grace and soar the silver screen!",

I really don't know if the filmmakers were serious about this, but if they were, that's just sad. \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" is not as bad as (almost) everyone says. It's not a series film.

You can still see wires holding actor's up, the blue screen work was crap and cheap and you can even see the background curtain when Superman is walking and fighting on the moon. (Superman 3 wasn't the best either but it still had decent effects)Its was only released as a 90 minute feature, maybe the 136 minute Director's Cut would have been a lot better. Considering the another three movies run easy over 2 hours. Also the movie has a few flaws in it, (The girl in space at the end, Superman taking in space) That's a few of them. If they didn't rush this movie, I think it would have been better then Superman 3. This one killed the series! Just hope that Superman Returns re borns the Man Of Steel!Overall this movie is a popcorn Friday night movie and only worth watching once. 3 out of 10",

What also didn't help was the deletion of 45 minutes of footage, which left severe plot holes. However two of those deleted scenes were completely finished and included in the international release of the film. Even though most of that footage was located in 2006, there was still a mystery concerning a print that was shown at a test screening in Southern California. I'm not sure if that print still exists, but I'm not qualified to go on that kind of scavenger hunt. But there was one thing that Superman said in the film that holds relevance even today. \"There will be peace when the people of the world want it so badly, their governments will have no choice but to give it to them.

All the time all sorts of people in girl scouts passed in and out of my hotel room  and made a loud remark how much Superman 4 stunk. I've stayed away from the rest of the Superman movies for many years. Now many years later I'm marrying a man who's a even bigger comic book nerd than myself at 13. So I've seen just about every superhero movie ever made. Yes out all the four superman movies this one does stink. The first half of the movie is corny, but it does have the general sweetness of the first two movies. It's good to see Margo Kidder back as Lois. The film is VERY 80's, but in a warped way it's adds to the cartoonish appeal. I enjoyed Lex Luther's nephew. He's wouldn't be out of place in the Bill and Ted movies. As silly as this sounds I like The whole plot of having the cute little kid wanting Superman to get rid of nuclear arms.It is silly, but likable. Then Nuclear Man shows up and the movie goes down the toilet. Well, okay it's not totally the character's fault. Chris Reeve's performance through out the movie you can tell he doesn't want to be there. The special effects are cheesy. No,no, calling the special effects cheesy would be a compliment. But Nuclear Man does deserve to take the blame for the awful second half. He looks like a wrestler reject, can't act, has one of the worst costumes I've ever seen. Face it when a male bad guy has a better nail job than most of the women you know and that's suppost to be scary. Well something's wrong with the movie.

Reeve does his best, but every other aspect of the movie is a complete failure (the original version was 134 minutes, proving so bad at test screenings they cut it to less than 90 minutes - big improvement!).

I can only assume that they watched the movie believing it would be any good.Superman movies have always been campy (yes, even *before* that lovable hack Richard Lester threw his half-baked lot into Superman II), but people thought Superman III was the ultimate, the final, the only possible depth to which the Superman series could sink. It was unabashedly a comedy and it performed poorly, so the Salkinds left the series forever and handed the producing duties over to Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, two wild and crazy guys from Israel who *just* wanted to illegally funnel funds from Superman IV and cut corners everywhere. They did so, and the film bombed at the box office.But it shouldn't have. The problem wasn't at all with the script, the acting or the movie itself; the problem was with the people who saw it. They were expecting a serious Superman movie. What they got was the most unintentionally hilarious movies of all time, an understated classic of bad cinema.There is only one way to watch this movie, and that is to watch it with friends and mock it endlessly. Despite the large-ish budget and well-known character, Superman IV would do very well as an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (a 90s TV show dedicated to mocking B-movies). It has everything: bad eighties hairstyles, completely illogical plot lines and more failed special effects than an episode of the old Doctor Who. Strings are easily visible, a police car magically appears out of thin air, Superman is referred to as \"The Dude of Steel\" and people seem to be oddly capable of breathing in space, not to mention the dialogue: \"You know what I can do with a single strand of Superman's hair?\" \"You can make a toupee that flies!\" If you're not as immature nor as odd as I am, the effect may be replicated by making a drinking game of the movie or inhaling illicit substances, but how it happens is not important. What is important is that this movie should not be condemned as a horrible serious movie, but be respected as a fantastic, if unintentional, comedy.See you in twenty, indeed.",

There's almost nothing worthwhile here.The awareness of the cast about just how poor the film was is both a good and bad thing. On the one hand, a little self-deprication and honesty goes a long way to redemption, but on the other, if they knew how bad it was, why commit to the starring roles? They weren't contractually obligated to do so (like Avengers actors are nowadays).The notion of Superman bringing about an end to nuclear war was kind of neat, so that initial premise had some promise, but unfortunately the whole thing takes a back seat and everything in the front row is just...

And I like Richard Pryor.And when it's not being rediculous, it's contrived and pedestrian, like the Superman/Clark/Lacey/Lois fiasco in the middle.

My comments will go towards the original theatrical/vhs release, the stuff before that attempt to clean it up on dvd.  That crap don't fly with me (no pun intended).  Where do I begin to complain?After watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that Superman's ability to propel himself at near limitless speeds (which look oddly slow in the bad bluescreen of this film) lies in his super-flatulence.  I say that because of the smell I noticed while watching it.  Where the hell did Superman get \"rebuild-the-great-wall-of-China-vision\"?!?  When did he develop telekinetic ray beams (when he lowered the citizens held aloft by Nuclear...ugh....Man). When did Lois Lane become a crack whore?  When did Perry White die, only to be reanimated?  When did Jimmy Olsen turn 45?  When did Christopher Reeve lose all the muscle from his previous 3 movies, only to show up at 135 lbs soaking wet for this one?  When did human beings learn to talk in space? Why didn't Mariel Hemingway implode when Nuclear...ugh...Man dropped her in space?!? When did Gene Hackman's career go so wrong?  Why didn't Mariel burn up in earth's atmosphere when she was carried in and out of it?  How the hell could Superman push THE MOON (a plot device stolen from a cartoon episode of He-Man)?!?  Why would a clone of Christopher Reeve look like a gay 1980s aerobics instructor?  Why did they reference a first Nuclear...ugh...Man when those scenes were cut?  Why did Superman's cape's S-shield peel apart?  Why did the wires show at all times?  Why did Superman go flying in front of bad bluescreen with a crack-addicted skeleton?  Why were a large portion of the flying shots stock shots from Superman II or III?  When did Superman become a fascist dictator, spitting on the sovereignty of not only the United States, but the United Nations (the mecca of all you commies out there)?  When did Nuclear War have ANYTHING to do with Krypton's sun blowing up the planet?  There are more questions, mostly relating to continuity of the movies, but I don't wanna go into them. This movie made me ashamed to be a SuperFreak--even at 12 years of age (when I first saw it).  The wires have been cut out of the dvd, the color's been enhanced (the original blue screen shots looked 30 years old, even in 1987), and the blue screen's been digitally 'repaired.'  If you want to see how this movie REALLY looked, get an old VHS tape of it.  They're everywhere. But, you'll see all the crap I'm talking about.

It was a great deal more hokey than the first two, clearly intended to be more of a comedy than anything else. But it's watchable.But Superman IV was where they lost it. This was the Superman series' attempt to make a relevant social point about nuclear weapons. Not the best way to build a Superman story. Add to that the fact that the budget was slashed, the writers sub-par, the special effects lacking, and the movie chopped down from its original running time to barely 90 minutes, leave this film to stand as a dismal failure.

They were right to do so; he's an awful character with an awful haircut (Crowded House called: they want their bassist's hair back!).

Granted, the one in II is also a deux ex machina, but it's nowhere near as blatant: when Kal-El lost his powers in that episode, you had no idea how he would get them back.

It kinda seemed like Christopher Reeve and Margaret Kidder were just having fun with this one.Truthfully I don't really like any of the old Superman's for various reasons, but I can at least respect them. In this one, they just made up super powers that Superman doesn't have, which I could even go with if they explained it.My main beef with this one is, the bad guy, this Radiation Man, is supposed to be powered by the sun, and his powers are basically the sun's energy...and Superman get's his power from the yellow sun...therefore when this guy hits Superman with the energy then it should actually make Superman more powerful, but instead it gives him the flu???? If you're a Superman fan at all, you can watch this just to say you have seen it, but you probably won't like it. If you don't know much about Superman or his story and background, you may actually like it OK.",

            "content": "This film is a contender with Batman & Robin, claiming the title for the worst comic book movie of all time. Batman & Robin arguably did significantly more damage to the source material, ruining the legacy of Batman for 8 years. However Batman was gradually redeemed with The Dark Knight trilogy, the Superman franchise has been unable to recover from all previous bad instalments. Superman Returns was abysmal, Man of Steel was incoherent and unstructured and from a recent viewing of Batman v Superman, I can honestly say it wasn't a particularly good film, inheriting the same problems that made Man of Steel dull.The elaborate production phase and budget constraints are what made this movie to the gradual process of a colossal failure. The first 3 films, with the third instalment being the film that took the franchise downhill, featured revolutionary visual effects that were outstanding for its time period. This film however, the reduced budget is so evident with a notable deterioration in quality with the effects, as they look absolutely appalling. The same archive footage of Superman flying is recycled with every shot and flying sequences are in a straight line as opposed to the cinematography they were able to achieve in the first 3 films. Christopher Reeve continues to give a good performance as Superman, arguably being the only positive aspect of the film. With 40 minutes deleted from the theatrical version, the movie feels choppy, poorly edited and nonsensical. There were attempts to make a good film, but the premise did not pay off, and the film is devoid of any redeeming qualities. Final verdict, even rating it based on its genre, in general it is one of the worst movies ever made.",

Good intentions seem to permeate the entire film, perhaps in a desperate attempt to erase the bad taste that Superman III left as a result of its rampant sexual innuendo and low brow humor.  Christopher Reeve is, of course, superb as the Man of Steel and in many ways is the only thing that makes the film watchable.  The rest of the cast seems bored and a little desperate at the same time, and the extremely poor quality of the visual effects make for plenty of wincing.  It really is a shame, because although the story is fairly campy, it could have been made into a real special effects extravaganza, as well as making a good (albeit belabored)point about the destructive nature of nuclear weapons.  This film has plenty of heart, but sadly misses the mark on so many important levels that make the first and second movies so wonderful.  In the end, it is an improvement on the third film, but not by much.",

Poor visual effects aside, this movie is just hastily cobbled together from a few half-baked ideas that aren't fully realised, with the character motivations and the way certain plot points come to fruition not making a lick of sense.I understand that 45 or so minutes of this film were left on the cutting room floor, but having both watched the deleted scenes and read the original script for the movie, I have to say that even if all of the footage had been left in this movie would still have been a mess. I appreciate the idea of a scenario where an omnipotent superhero is put against a real world crisis but the way it plays out here doesn't do the premise justice, I would have much preferred it if the world authorities were resistant to Superman's plan for worldwide disarmament and were inadvertently united in the cause to prevent his interference, but instead there is no challenge, no moral panic, no humanity, it is just bear bones bad writing. Even so I have to say that Christopher Reeve's decision to focus the film on an overt anti-nuclear war message was a mistake from the start, not to mention it instantly dates the film and makes it come across as pretentious and trying too hard to educate rather than entertain.Yes the effects are terrible, yes the lack of money shows in almost every frame, yes the film would have been better if certain scenes were left in, but despite this every problem with the film boils down to the script. A competent writer would adapt a script to better suit a reduced budget, and while it may make sense to keep the original scale of the story if the budget was cut shortly before filming but in this case the budget was cut over a year before production started! And when that happens it is the responsibility of the writer to change the story so that the scale is less important, but rather the characters and morals are the focus. This happened with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the budget was severely reduced and so the director rewrote it to focus more on the characters and less on the action, and that film turned out wonderfully, why didn't that happen here?! The film is a sad end to an otherwise classic (or half classic) movie saga and unfortunately leaves Christopher Reeve, the definitive man of steel, in a bad light. While the film perhaps tops Superman III for good intentions and being a guilty pleasure, it's far from the film it should have been.",

The great thing about the first two films (other than a couple of minor things) is that its pretty well timeless. The guy who played the Nuclear Man was the worst bit of acting I'd ever seen. It was like watching Arnold buying a happy meal at McDonald's.Honestly the whole idea of the bad Superman was touched in Superman III. If they wanted to do something different, they should have just went with the whole bizzaro thing. Which could have been interesting. The characters all lacked substance. Even Superman.

It's not THAT bad\". Oh but alas it is; it's horrendous and watching it for the full duration was painful. And no, not even the usually reliable Gene Hackman could save it.The acting, direction, editing, script and special effects are all poor. There are plot holes the size of craters and bloopers including clearly visible wires suspending Superman as he lands on the moon near the end and a human being alive and breathing outside the earth's atmosphere (the actress in question showing no sign of shock or surprise as if this is a daily occurrence!). Other things of note, Superman failing to arrest/grab Lex Luthor for being an escaped convict; a completely unbelievable and pointless love interest sub plot involving a very bored looking Clark Kent and Lacy Warfield; And probably the worst villain ever conceived in Nuclear Man.But what I dislike the most is the message/premise of this film which is that Superman has decided \"to make the world a safer place\" by destroying all nuclear weapons. Forgive me for asking, as noble act as you may think this is, but did Superman consult the elected leaders of the world about this? We, in the civilised world, possess nuclear weapons to protect our people from the bad despots and dictators of the world. How can it be a good thing but leaving the civilised world defenseless (even in a world where there's Superman)? In summary I hated this film, even die hard Superman fans will hate it.

Basic errors are made all over the place in terms of editing and shooting and how the story hangs together. There are also parts to the story that simply are not plausible. They should definitely have left the film at full length just to make sense of it. Towards the end of the film we see a shot of Nuclearman looking at a picture of Lacey on the front cover of 'The Daily Planet' proclaiming the 'new publisher' (talk about slow news day). Then Nukes flies off to see Superman in the street and greets him with \"Where is the woman?!\" How does Superman know who he's talking about? Apparently he does though; \"Give it up, you'll never find her.\" Another problem is defining Superman's strength. Whenever he fights Nuclearman, particularly on the Moon, he gets beaten senseless. This doesn't make him look very heroic. Also, he struggles to hold up the statue of liberty when it gets dropped by Nuclearman, yet he can push the Moon around with great ease! Add this to Lacey breathing and having her hair blown in the space wind and it's none too clever. Superman's flying scenes are all the same shot over and over just pasted on different backgrounds, and his hair always gets magically combed after brief scuffles. There is also another shot of the Earth from space and it's back to front! The Arabian peninsula is west of Africa, this is very sloppy. I could go on, but what for?

But I digress, anyhow, Reeve would not come back, until Warners gave him a barrel of cash (Superman was the only thing he did that would pay anyway) and he had to have total control over the storyline. Yeah, Chris Reeve in charge of the story! Talk about handing the keys to the asylum over to the patients! Under what circumstance would Reeve do the story? Only if it had an anti-nuke story line. He was a big no-nuke guy at the time. So there. Wondering why part 4 stank? Reeve and his silly story line, and also no Ilya Salkind to produce.

The Alexander Courage score is wonderful, dramatic and sweeping and really lifts the movie during the action sequences. Mariel Hemingway's character, the lovely Lacy Warfield is a fresh character that adds much to the production. She's very pretty too. Gene Hackman makes a welcome return as the camp Lex Luthor and he has some funny moments with his nephew, Lenny Luthor. The story has some good themes and messages but they seem to get lost within the incoherent nature of the structure.

Christopher Reeve put forth a bit of effort, but that doesn't compensate for Muriel Hemmingway's woodenness, and Dolph Lungren's annoyingness (or whoever played Nuclear Man).  The special effects were particularly awful, and it's obvious that the budget for that aspect of the movie ran out as some of the effects are apparently hand-drawn and laughably unconvincing.Do not bother watching this movie.

It wasn't, though. I know everyone has already pointed out the ridiculousness of the scene where Lacy Warfield (ugh - crap name) is taken into space, but what really got me is that when the Nuclear Man stopped being able to fly, she started to fall downwards. Not downwards as in towards Earth (which was behind here in the frame) but downwards as in towards the bottom of the screen. That's inexcusable really.When I watch the first film now, I love every minute of it, and the 'Can You Read My Mind' scene chokes me up every time.

Meanwhile Lex creates  \"Nuclearman\" who just wants to kick Supermans butt, Most of the Crew from Superman 1-3 where hired for this one but the lack of money forced the producers to fire them and get cheapear workers,and that shows, The flightscenes are horrible ,just Bluescreen none of the great front projection shots-that made us believe that a man can fly in the earlier movies. And the wires are visible many times during the film, that destroys the illusion. Chris Reeve is still as great as ever as Clark Kent/Superman and Gene Hackman still a great Lex Luthor.And the music is still  nice to listen to. The orginal version is about 125 min long but WB didn't like it and asked for a edited version, Cannon edited it to 89 minutes, and cut out most of the plot(there was 2  Nuclearmen originally)and that makes the movie even stranger to watch, some scenes just don't make any sense!, Still you should  watch the movie to see Chris Reeve doing a superb job again as Superman.",

The acting in this film is at best decent, Gene Hackman returns and does a great job at Lex Luthor, and extra credit is given here considering the dreadful script. Christopher Reeves again does his job as superman but lacks the charm he gave in the first to films, again this could have been due to the poor script. The rest of the cast was pretty much average or under-average, very forgettable Now onto what made this film the worst film I have ever seen, when watching this film I couldn't help notice that the writers obviously were either drunk or just monkeys as there were some major oversights, for instance in one scene, the main villain flies into outer space with Lois Lane, with Lois somehow scream, even though there is a lack of oxygen in space. Other such oversights were a fight on the moon with throwing a rock hurts superman, somehow and the main villain being created from the sun with already dressed?? I could go on and mention more but well there are literally to many to mention The music was uninspiring, John Williams opted not to score this film and instead Alexander Courage was chosen. Don't get me wrong Courage was a great composer, but he seemed to to a half-***** job and I never got the feeling of something truly evil this film is an easy miss, I watched it just out of sheer interest of how bad a film can be, There is no need to watch it, take it from me you will never see a worse film and there is no need to see it.",

What convinced Reeves to do this film?  It has a well-intentioned story, but it has no follow-through whatsoever.  The actors look bored with very little energy in their performances.  The Nuclear man is the lamest, repeat, lamest villian in this series, if not in any comic book movie. Other things that I noticed:1.  They used the same flying shot of Superman (flying directly towards the camera) over NINE TIMES in the film (with different backdrops) 2.  Horrible continuity and editing.  Superman appears to fly away from the Great Wall of China and the next shot has him on the ground using some sort of reorganizing vision (some sort of unknown super power?) to fix the wall.  Embarrasing. 3.  WORST PART OF ALL!!!  During the fight on the moon, if you look closely enough (at least on the DVD copy) you can actually make out a black curtain in the background - obviously this was supposed to be a black, sky background.  Look closely and you'll see the curtain!!  Obviously, the producers were strapped for cash!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.  LONG HAIL SUPERMAN 1, 2, and a partial cheer for SUPERMAN 3.",

            "content": "I know everyone it seems just absolutely loves to criticize Superman 4 to death but actually if one realistically looks at all of what makes up the movie and everyone which acts in it and the effort they all put in then the Movie undead deserves some respect responsibility. First let's start with the villains. Lex Luther's original actor was Oscar Award winner Hackman and in this movie he did play that part and extremely well and helped to lift up the movie very much. Then you have the main villain Nuclear Man! To me one of the most AWESOME and INCREDIBLE Super Villains of all time. There was no flaw here whatsoever! Could NOT of found a greater actor for the part and ever was about muscles at that time and indeed he had plenty and his powers was more than awesome. Nearly identical to that of Superman other that the cold breathe he displayed which was the only big flaw. Replacing original comedy relief from previous Superman movies to Luther's Nephew Lenny and I thought was a fabulous choice and much much funnier and better choice that the old fuddy duddy guy. Now like I said, what really makes up a movie and makes it desirable the most is the choice of actors and actresses in it and in this it was ALL the BIG original main names with no replacing actors or actresses. Then how can you not respect the fact that Christopher Reeves played as Superman cause everyone knew he would do an outstanding job regardless. Of course I hated many of the down right stupid mistakes but there was still plenty of incredible action, violence, chilling moments, comedy (in which I tend to love the most!) and even some romantic moments. So because of the fact that all the main big name actors was in there especially Christopher Reeves and Gene Hackman in it and in which they both did outstanding acting so in no way shape or form this could NOT of been a bust and the fact that Nuclear Man was to \"ME\" one of the most awesome Super Villains ever in history and so one more thing to be included is the fact that when Superman 4 came out I was just 7 years old and since then I have actually watched Superman 4 many times more than the other previous Superman movies so I must therefore give this a perfect rating respectively. I absolutely don't care about what others say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.",
