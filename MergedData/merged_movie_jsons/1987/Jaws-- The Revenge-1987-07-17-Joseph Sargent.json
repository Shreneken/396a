            "content": "If there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the Jaws series is it. The original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors. By comparison, Michael Caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. Lance Guest and Mario Van Peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while Lorraine Gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening.Clearly, the budget spent on this film didn't go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. Exactly why Michael Brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. Perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. An alternate explanation of why Michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. The true Ed Wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at Elaine. This is the first time I've heard of sharks having vocal cords. Given the box office draw this stinker had, I suspect it will be the last.The shark takes a real beating here, too. The reason the shark wasn't seen often in the original was because Spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesn't move like a real shark. In this edition of the Jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the model's flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. There are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. There is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the shark's main fin.To its credit, Jaws: The Revenge is well-photographed. While the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. The fact that even frames with one character in them won't make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. If only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film.Another area where Jaws: The Revenge deserves due credit is the score music. While the score is very much inspired by that which John Williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. In fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. The music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of film-making, really shouldn't have any.When all is said and done, I gave Jaws: The Revenge a one out of ten. It works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. As a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. It's not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible.",

            "content": "A great white shark stalks a woman to the Bahamas to kill the remaining members of her family...I'm fond of Jaws the Revenge, there I admit it. Although it may be a bad movie, also an incompetent one, to its credit it ignores Jaws 3- D and stars Lorraine Gary of Jaws and Jaws 2. Yes, Ellen Brody returns, the wife of chief Martin Brody. Director Joseph Sargent opening is probably the strongest segment of the film. We return to an atmospheric Martha's Vineyard but this time it's Christmas time where Ellen's youngest son has his dad's old job and after a call is eaten by a shark while a choir drowns out his screams. There's some good to come out of this event as we get some cameos at the funeral by the actors of the original. Grief stricken Ellen flees the Bahamas to stay with her eldest son Michael played by Lance Guest (of fricking Starfighter) - but, get this, the shark has somehow followed her, it wants to eat her entire family possibly as revenge for its parent sharks being killed by Brody in part one and two, who knows?! Yes it's a paper thin plot with a series of shark attacks but if you can look beyond that and the shoddy shark models there's something quite endearing about 1987's Jaws: The Revenge.At the time criticized for its jumping shark (no Henry Winkler pun intended) it has since been established that sharks in fact do propel themselves out of the water (although in the critic's defence I'm sure the filmmaker had no idea of their over 15 feet leaps at the time). That said, to date no shark has been heard roaring like Bruce 4 does in this film. Guest's performance is excellent, he really is likable (honestly) as the marine biologist and over protective son. Mario Van Peebles' Jake with a terrible accent and an unlikable attitude makes you secretly glad he gets eaten, depending on which version you watched, you still feel sorry for his wife.There's a handful of imaginative scenes which makes this instalment worthwhile. At one point Jake attaches a device to the shark so that he can track it through its heartbeat. These heart beat noises build up some tension akin to the barrels in the 1975 Jaws. Interestingly, there's set up where Michael is chased through a wreck and escapes using his air tank - James Bond style! In addition there's also banana boat scene where Jaws (Bruce 4) tries to chow down on Ellen's granddaughter. Another positive is that Gary really shines as the credible paranoid grandmother and mother. It's refreshing to see (albeit cringe worthy) the older lady falling in love with a local pilot Hoagie (Michael 'Get Carter' Caine). Oddly writer Michael de Guzman injects an overbearing amount of sexual dialogue. With every adult character in the film acting at times like a frisky teenager under Sargent's supervision.For tradition and impact Sargent wisely uses John Williams classic theme and unsurprisingly Michael Small fills in the rest delivering a near on perfect score. In the closing Caine's Hoagie is so Dirty Rotten Scoundrels cool he crash-lands his aeroplane in to the sea and when he emerges onto the boat he's completely dry, \"Blood 'ell, the breath on that thing\". So long as you're watching the version where Jake dies and shark gets stabbed, sinking breaking the boat up and not the one where Jaws inexplicably explodes (recycling footage from the original Jaws) it's a more fitting closure. Either way both versions are choppily edited and you can't help feel that with more care or a different director even with the preposterous, yet, novel premise it could have been better.Overall, hugely flawed but somewhat entertaining.",

            "content": "Jaws: The Revenge is the final entry into the Jaws series, and thank God for that. Ellen Brody is now living in the Bahamas after her youngest son Sean, who has followed in the footsteps of his father and become Chief of the Amity police, is killed by another Great White Shark. In what is the most ridiculous plots of all time, we find out that one specific shark is holding a grudge against the Brody family, and after it kills Sean, it swims against the Gulf Stream down to the Bahamas so it can kill Ellen and Michael as well. Jaws: The Revenge is an embarrassment to anyone who knows anything about sharks, and is the worst of the series.The plot is completely wrong in this movie. The whole plot is built off of bs. I can't even allow suspension of disbelief to let me ignore that the shark is hunting the Brody family. It's ridiculous! Aside from that is that the film contains any number of factual errors about sharks ranging from having the shark swim backwards, roar like a lion, stand on its tail, and devour a helicopter. The shark in the first film did unusual things, but nothing that would make a shark lover cry.The acting in this movie is so bad that...You know what? I don't even want to discuss it. It's bad. Terrible. Loathsome. Repugnant. What else is there? Lorraine Gray played Ellen just fine in the first film, but for some reason in this film she let all of her acting skill slip away. Even Michael Caine, who is a vastly talented actor, shows absolutely no skill at all.Every copy of Jaws: The Revenge should be swallowed by the shark from the first film.1/10",

            "content": "So many people use Jaws: The Revenge as an instantly recognizable reference point for bad movies. If you watch any of those top ten worst films lists on YouTube, inevitably it's right there on the top of every one of them. But can it really be that bad of a movie?It's certainly made by people with talent. Producer/director Joseph Sargent won four Emmys throughout his storied career, as well as helming such well-thought of movies like The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Night That Panicked America, Nightmares, MacArthur and Colossus: The Forbin Project. He even won his the Directors Guild of America Award for The Marcus-Nelson Murders, the TV movie pilot for Kojak. In fact, he still leads all DGA members for most nominations for the TV movie category.Sir Michael Caine is certainly a talented actor. He's been nominated for an Academy Award in every decade from the 1960s to 2000s, winning two for Hannah and Her Sisters and The Cider House Rules, with his performance in Educating Rita earning him the BAFTA and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.So what happened? How can a movie - that one assumes was made with good intentions - turn out to be the touchstone for what constitutes a bomb?In interviews before the film was even released, Sargent referred to it as \"a ticking bomb waiting to go off\" and noting that MCA Inc. President - and husband of star Lorraine Gary - Sid Sheinberg \"expects a miracle.\" There was no script when Sargent was asked to direct. Years later, he'd say that the movie was made out of desperation and that he tried a mystical take in an attempt to give audiences \"something interesting enough to sit through.\"Even though this film was to center on Gray's Ellen Brody character, Roy Scheider was offered a cameo where his Martin Brody character, rather than Sean Brody, would have been killed by the shark in the beginning. This was a wise choice to avoid this opening - murdering the center of the first two films would have put such a bad taste in audiences' mouths that they may have hated this movie even more than they already did. To his credit, Scheider said, \"\"Satan himself could not get me to do Jaws Part 4.\"Lee Fierro also returned as Mrs. Kintner, the mother of Alex in Jaws, along with Amity Town Council member Mrs. Taft, who is again played by Fritzi Jane Courtney. Amity Selectman Mr. Posner (Cyprian R. Dube) is now the mayor, probably because the actor who played Larry Vaughan (Murray Hamilton) is dead.Otherwise, forget all you knew about Jaws and the previous sequels. Mike no longer works for SeaWorld and he's no longer played by Dennis Quaid. Instead, Halloween 2 hunk Lance Guest fills in. Following the heart attack death of her husband and great white murder of her son Sean - to the strains of holiday carols no less - Ellen Brody forgets all that she knew as well and leaves for the Bahamas.There, she falls for Hoagie (Caine), who is a degenerate gambler by night and a pilot by day, but we all know that he runs cocaine. It's just never said, but we can read between the lines that he's done some shady things. In fact, scenes involving him being a smuggler were shot, then deleted during post-production, because it took away from the shark scenes.Right now, Hoagie is having a September September romance with Ellen, trying to get her to forget the past - keep in my her husband died a few months ago and her son a few days hence - with some airplane riding, slow dancing and carnival attending.Some moments of the film definitely make me understand why people dislike it so - the sepia toned callbacks to the first film, Mario Van Peebles' forced accent, a shark that is somehow able to swim from an island in New York to the Bahamas in three days, which means he'd had to swim at nearly its full speed of 25 mph non-stop to make it. I mean, sharks never sleep, but that's ridiculous.Also, when you watch the ending, you may notice that the shark roars. Underwater, no less. The sound effects guy thought that this was so stupid that he used a sound effect from a Tom and Jerry cartoon.Speaking of the ending, the one that gets aired on TV and home video isn't the original. When the film was first released, it ended with JJakebeing devoured, Ellen ramming the shark with Mike's boat and the shark's death throes nearly killing everyone. Audiences hated that, so the ending with her stabbing the shark with the bow of the ship was added. Because they didn't have much budget left, the film ends with the footage of the dying shark from the original.These reshoots kept Caine from accepting his Oscar. Imagine that.It could have been much worse. Or better, if you're someone like me that loves movies packed with inanity and insanity in equal measure.That's because in the novelization of the film by Hank Searls, Hoagie is a government agent transporting laundered money. Jake is killed by the shark. And the reason for all this mayhem is because a voodoo witch doctor has a score to settle with the Brody family - which also explains, I guess, why Ellen and the shark have a psychic connection.While the movie ignores the third film, the book combines all the movies with the Peter Benchley novel, making a reference to Ellen's affair with Matt Hooper that is eliminated from the Spielberg-directed original film.In truth, I like this movie. It's an interesting take on how years of dealing with shark-related mayhem takes its toll on the various characters' lives. And I really enjoyed how Michael and Carla's marriage is depicted; she initiates lovemaking as much as him and it just seems honest and real.Let's face it. I've seen plenty of worse movies than this one. If there's any tragedy to this movie, it's that the actress who played Thea - Judith Barsi - died not long after it was released, as she and her mother were the victims of a murder/suicide at the hands of her father. Lance Guest served as a pallbearer at her funeral.Perhaps the best review of the film comes from Sir Michael Caine himself, who said, \"I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific. Won an Oscar, built a house, and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie.\"",

            "content": "In Jaws 2 a person told sheriff Brody that sharks don't take things personally...in this one they apparently not only do, but they also will hunt you down to the ends of the earth.  This focuses on the most mediocre character of the first two Jaws, Ellen Brody.  It starts with one of her sons being out on a boat and being killed by a shark.  Why he is out on the water is anyone's guess seeing as he was afraid of water in 3, which I do believe this one completely ignores.  This attack is probably the only real good scene in the flick cause we are off to the Caribbean where Ellen goes to visit with her other son who just doesn't seem all to upset by his brother's death.  What is waiting for her here, but the exact same shark that killed her other son.  Michael Caine is in this and this somehow makes me wonder why couldn't they have just forgotten about the Brody's and maybe have it be about Caine in Australia or something as a shark hunter...why do we have to have the same family, you have a better chance of being struck by lightening than you do of being attacked by a shark yet this family is constantly being attacked by sharks.  Maybe they all bath in fish blood before swimming?  Anyway this film is quite bad and was a pretty bad way to end the franchise.",

            "content": "On the island Amity during the Christmas break, Mrs. Ellen Brody's younger son Deputy Sean is taken by a great white shark one night after being called out to move a piece of wood tangled up with a buoy. After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family. Ellen wants Michael to not go near the water, but he convinces her that it's all fine, since great whites don't like the warm water. But hold on as the shark that killed Sean is now stalking the family and has only one thing on mind - to wipe out the Brody family.Leave those Brody's alone! Err, what crud\u0085 yeah reading the outline above you'll be just rolling your eyes at how ridiculous this film does get. The last sequel \"Jaws 3\" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast. While, the rest were simply one-note and Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent was just so dodgy. But what was in need of a life-jacket was the dire script that threw out many awful lines of dialogues. \"I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.\" What?! The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled\u0085 what? I just don't see it. Well, the sprawling beach lines and crystal blue waters were a nice sight. Too bad that the mechanical, but crooked plastic shark slowly got in the way. The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.It's definitely as bad as its reputation. This is one shark that just won't let go!",

But Ellen (Lorraine Gary, the only original cast member) is determined to stop that son of a gun. But she just might lose a few family members along the way...It's really great that Lorraine Gary came back to keep the continuity strong, even as we reach the fourth installment. There is also a large, prominent photo of Roy Scheider in the police station, so he made an appearance here, as well (sort of). After that, it becomes a bit of a stretch.The \"script is lamentable,\" according to Howard Maxford. Apparently he hasn't watch a lot of horror sequels -- this one is something like Shakespeare in comparison. But he is right if he is implying that it makes no sense. What's with the extremely unlikely attacks on the Brody family... what the? Sharks that have picked them out and even (through some magical power) tracked them to the Bahamas?There are some respectable guest stars, including the gambling-addicted Michael Caine, and Mario Van Peebles. Caine alone makes this film a lot more tolerable. His voice soothes me in a way that not even warm milk and a shoulder rub can match.I'm not going to lie to you and say this is on par with \"Jaws\", but I will say this: it's not as bad as other sequels (like \"Leprechaun in da Hood\"), and not even as bad as other shark movies (\"Megalodon\").

The shark eats the Last Starfighter's younger brother in New England, then IT FOLLOWS ELLEN BRODY TO THE BAHAMAS. Apparently, even sharks need a Caribbean getaway now and again. The story is impossible for anyone with even a single connected synapse to believe. I half expected the shark to somehow regurgitate Robert Shaw up onto the deck to help with the navigating of the boat directly into the heart of the beast. About half way through the movie, my right hand jerked up involuntarily and smacked my face. Minutes later, my left hand did the same thing. That's right; this movie was so bad, that my body tried to stop me from watching it.

The effects here make Jaws 3D look like a stellar 21st century blockbuster, the shark looks like a rubber monster from a Pound Shop, the acting is atrocious, Caine himself is shocking.By now I think all behavioural aspects of a shark have vanished, this thing in the sea is not of any known life form.

After Jaws gobbles up the youngest Brody son Mom goes on a holiday to get away from Amity Island and it's history...to the Bahamas! Total change of scenery huh? Jaws follows. How? Don't ask me. And he gets there in a day when it would take any ordinary shark about a week minimum.Her elder son works as a marine biologist (surely being attacked by sharks in the first two movies would put him off going in the ocean) and is studying sea snails (presumably he got fired from Sea World after Jaws 3). By pure coincidence (or contrivance), Jaws shows up and pokes his nose into the sea snail research.The shark looks sooooooooooooo fake. It's very obviously nothing but foam rubber with plastic teeth. And it's incredibly stupid. The shark in the first film (and in the surprisingly good second) seemed to be kind of smart and cunning. But now it's just a big lumbering idiot.Why on earth Michael Caine agreed to be in this is beyond me. He even couldn't get to the Oscars to accept his award for Hannah and her Sisters because he was too busy filming this turkey. And the story with him dating Mom Brody takes up a tremendous amount of the film's running time and ends up turning it into a soap opera.The worst thing tho, isn't the elder Brody son's beard or Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent. It's the ending. Let me explain what happens...Jaws stands on his tail! On the Water!! Roars like a Lion!!! Is stabbed by the broken mast of a ship... ...and explodes!!!!Of course!Where on earth the idea for that ending came from is probably best kept a mystery. The fact that it recycles footage from the first film into this ending is a mockery of the original's genius. It should also be noted that this version includes the happy (alternate) ending in Mario Van Peebles survives being chomped across the belly by the big fish.Universal stained the legacy of a great movie with this turd.",

The widow believes the original Jaws is still out there hunting her family and they're in danger. Could that really be true or has the events of her past caused her to lose her mind? This movie is directed by Joseph Sargent (The Taking of Pelham One Two Threw) and stars Lorraine Gary (Jaws), Mario Van Peebles (Heartbreak Ridge), Lance Guest (Halloween II) and Michael Caine (The Prestige). The storyline for this as a whole is bad but is entertaining to watch unfold. I will say the first kill over the Christmas music was a good start to the film. Michael Caine and Peebles were fun in this and provided good comic relief. The underwater scenes were excellent again as they were in the historic films and the banana boat kill was well done. The shark in this was just okay but better than the previous film. Overall this is a bad but entertaining film. I'd score this a 4.5-5/10 and recommend seeing it once.",

            "content": "I would like anyone to present to me, a greater scale of difference between the greatest film ever made in Jaws, and the worst film ever made in ...the revenge. This film within the opening minutes, commits the ultimate sequel sin-it kills off the youngest Brody boy, Sean- as seen as the the little boy in the first 2films. If Jaws fanatics don't get up and leave at this point- it gets worse- our hero Chief Brody is now deceased!! Apparently by heart-attack. So what a start, this leaves us with two members of the Brody clan remaining- Widow Lorraine Gary, and her son Michael, now a marine biologist in the Bahamas. This event of Sean's death forces her to flee the shores of Amity Island and head for her son 2000 miles away in the Bahamas. The despicable opening to the movie suddenly now takes a bizarre and utterly ludicrous twist. Sharky, revenging the death of it's fellow Sharks by Mr.Brody- wants to eat all Brody's and intends to stop at nothing to do so. This shark obviously catches wind of Ellen's intentions to flee the area, and the Shark sets off to follow her. I mean it. A STALKER SHARK! (He would have been just as well getting out of the water, and knocking on her door.)So as she heads off in the plane, our Shark follows the plane all the way from New England to the Bahamas. The viewer has now realised all common sense behind the movie has been thrown out the window and we are left with a super-shark with powers to follow a plane at maybe 500miles an hour and travels 2000 miles following this plane. How? no idea ask the script writer and the producers. The utterly bizarre becomes a comedy from here on in. Michael Brody, a well meaning kid in the first 2, has turned into an utter idiot. He discovers the shark is in the Bahamas but for some twist of reasoning decides not to let anybody know-putting everyone in his family in jeopardy. He is married but seemingly cares nothing about the wife, as he spends his occupation money and time putting his efforts watching sea snails. His wife announces to her mother-in-law she plans on having an active sex life with him, why does she do that? no idea...ask the writer. Meanwhile we are introduced to Michael Cane whom is furiously trying to woo Ellen Brody.Every so often the episode of Family Affairs, is interrupted by a rubber 'fish'and the attack scenes are minimal, Lorraine Gary gets attacked, but get this-it was all a dream!!So what little of the shark we do see is in fact a dream- uh-huh great...The director really has little interest in the shark, every so often it rears it's rubber head but if you look closely we can actually see at times the railing that follows it along. All this clearly gets too much for Lorraine Gary, as she clearly can't take any more of the film thus she rushes onto a boat to find the shark herself. Cue, the most bizarre and worst ending in cinema history. En route she is intercepted by her incredibly inept son, who plans on sending electric impulses on the shark to electrocute it. Sure mate, whatever just do it so we can end it OK?! Ellen's over 50's love interest Michael Caine gets his plane capsized and attacked underwater by our shark. But good news, he emerges from the water unscathed with a newly pressed shirt, perfectly dry emerging form the water declaring \"that thing had bad breathe\" or something to that effect. Yes, that is the depths this film has reached. We see the shark proceed to bite the boat and the poor Bahamas guy, the only half decent guy in the movie-but he serves a purpose to put the electric thing in its mouth. The next few minutes sees the shark have seizures and leap high in the air balancing on its fins- think 'free Willy' on Ecstasy.Ellen Brody then proceeds to have flash backs of scenes she didn't witness-such as the \"Smile u son of a B...\" scene at the end of the original- At this point the shark leaps up perfectly straight for an extended period (U know for a shark thats meant to to have superpowers, it seems pretty dumb)but regardless it lets out a dinosaur roar-i'm not kidding- and balances on the water like a trapeze artist, long enough to get lampooned by the boat. Inexplicably it um....blows up! Yep, it blows up and Mike's mate the Bahamas guy comes out alive and well. And that my friends is the tale of the most bizarre movie i have ever witnessed. Joseph Sargeant the director clearly took what Spielberg said in an interview about the demise of the shark in the original the wrong way- Spielberg said \"if you can carry the audience for 2hours; 2minutes of the sharks ending won't make a difference.\" Sargeant decided that if he can carry the audience for 2minutes he can throw-the craziest most bizarre things for 2 hours! like a roaring shark who balances on its fins and stalks a family while having psychic connections with the woman. Not only that the shark can blow up when it gets stabbed! Sargeant might need to review his logic!",

            "content": "Although widely regarded as the worst of the series, I found this to be at least as good as JAWS 3, if not possibly better. For a \"bad\" movie, JAWS: THE REVENGE is pretty easy viewing, with crystal-clear photography and a good soundtrack (basically an upbeat riff on the classic John Williams music). The most criminal thing about this film is the first fifty minutes, where we hardly see any \"shark\" at all. Instead, the time consists of people and their relationships, with lots of bonding, moody characters, fights, and the occasional shark attack to keep the plot moving. The film is \"bad\", ie. cheesy, at the opening and close, but ironically these are the most enjoyable parts of the movie; the worst part is the boring middle.Things kick off promisingly with an attack on the younger son of Brody. After much thrashing and screaming the boy resides in his boat...MISSING AN ARM! He proceeds to clutch at the bleeding stump and scream repeatedly, only for his cries to be drowned out by carol singers! After this the shark makes short work of the rest of his body. Well, an opening which contained poor acting and some surprisingly explicit gore bodes well for the rest of the movie, but unfortunately they then forgot about the shark and things become a human drama instead.This time around, Lorraine Gary returns from JAWS and JAWS 2. She's a little wiser and a little older, and basically has developed Scheider's fear of the water. Gary must have needed the money to appear in this, as she had bowed out of the previous instalment. Her surviving son is now played by the bland and bearded Lance Guest. Guest is absolutely boring and his character a ridiculous snob who despises Michael Caine for being a pilot. What a jerk!The further down the cast you go, the more interesting actors you find. One I did like was Mario Van Peebles as Guest's Jamaican partner, who helps him do undersea research. Peebles makes the best of his clich\u00e9d character and is the funniest, most likable person in the movie. Eagle-eyed viewers may well spot Peebles' dad, Melvin, appearing in a cameo. So, the rest of the cast are all no-names, right? Yes, they're all much of a muchness but WAIT! Who's this?Michael Caine? Surely it can't be THE Michael Caine, can it? But yes, Caine is in this film as a hilarious bumbling pilot called Hoagie. Well, much has been surmised of Caine's decision to appear in this movie, the general consensus being that he must have had financial difficulties at the time. All I can say is that I love his performance, no matter how bad it is, and regard him as one of the film's highlights!After much talk and too much sentimentalising, the ending is suddenly upon us and retreads the old \"survivors on a boat vs. the shark\" routine. However, this is so-bad-it's-hilarious stuff, with the shark STANDING in the water at one point on its tail! This is so a pole jutting from the prow of the boat can impale it, thus causing the shark to bleed profusely and fall to bits. The shark is shown in the open far too often in this movie, and looks much more fake than it did previously with a real lack of movement. Due to technical incompetence, it's also possible to spot the machinery controlling the model for much of the film. However, these are all plus points! While not a brilliant film by any means, JAWS: THE REVENGE is unmissable viewing for bad movie fans as a night of cheesy entertainment.",

            "content": "There seems little point in writing a review for such a film as Jaws: The Revenge, as those who have made it past the tagline and still given it an iota of consideration have likely already made up their minds as to whether or not they can stomach such an overwhelming inundation of garbage. With that in mind, as no reader could feasibly read with the intent of deciding whether the film is bad or good, this review will focus on a more comprehensive breakdown of the film's countless flaws. And rest assured that no matter how many innumerable detractions the movie has garnered, its atrocities becoming almost over-hyped, the film still manages to astound by the numerous fronts in which it completely fails to register any vestige of quality whatsoever. Even those seeking the film as an entertainingly terrible comedy will find themselves disappointed, as the film somehow manages to avoid the pitfall of usual B movie melodramatic hysteria, emerging as simply dull and all the more terrible as consequence. The film's complete lack of quality becomes instantly clear from the chaotically choppy cinematography and editing, betraying the film's seemingly near non-existent budget. Similarly, the creative black hole of a script somehow bests its own storyline absurdities by shamelessly stealing elements from Spielberg's classic original through clunky, senseless flashbacks (Ellen Brody recalls her husband killing the shark, despite not having been there to witness it) and in certain cases blatant plundering and rehashing of scenes (the charming interplay between Roy Scheider and his son from the first Jaws is leeringly plagiarized, devoid of any redeeming values whatsoever). All of which goes without mentioning the most glaring absurdities of the very premise: a shark seeking vengeance against family members of one who once killed a completely unrelated shark, enough so to track them to the Bahamas shows such a staggering lack of logic that one wonders how the film could possibly have been greenlit in the first place. But in this twisted reality, such qualms are easily explained away, as is the shark's outracing planes, standing on its tail, roaring and spontaneously combusting - it is difficult to imagine anything sealing the film's utter absence of quality any further. While Spielberg masked the clunky falsities of his mechanical shark by mostly obscuring it with subjective point of view camera work, director Joseph Sargent appears to positively revel in his antagonist's foibles, keeping his obviously fake shark in plain view to a comical extent. Similarly, viewers are even denied a high body count of entertainingly poor shark attacks, as the film's near non-existent carnage is devoid of any campy gruesomeness, resorting to extreme close-ups of the absurdly unconvincing attacks, generating less menace than watching a snail crawl. As a secondary character, the relatively poor acting of Lorraine Gary's Ellen Brody was for the most part easy to miss, but thrust into a lead role and her complete lack of a performance is unmistakable. Embarrassingly melodramatic or completely devoid of emotion depending on the scene, the banality of Gary's imbalanced attempted character is one of the film's weaker points, which is saying a lot. As her allegedly heroic son, Lance Guest's height of emotional intensity appears to be a slightly bewildered stare, proving comical at best, but little more. The hilariously ill-advised Michael Caine (the only cast member to escape with his career intact, and must have collected a considerable paycheque) usually appears to be reading his lines from a teleprompter offscreen with the same lack of emotion one would expect, and the absurdity of his sporadic romance with the far older Ellen Brody only furthers the stupidity. Finally, Mario Van Peebles is simply inexcusable; his atrociously bad Jamaican accent is a constant tarnish on the film's already consistently sullied quality, and once again, he fails to be over the top bad enough to prove enjoyable, simply resulting as noisy and pathetic.Astoundingly horrible only scratches the surface of what can be considered no less than a masterpiece of lapsed logic and catastrophic film-making, even failing on the front of being overblown enough to make a suitable unintentional comedy. While the film's atrocious quality is hardly a surprise, it still boggles the mind simply how bad an outcome it was possible to achieve. In fact, the film's laughably ludicrous tagline \"This time it's personal\" could well apply to the audiences watching the film: this time the franchise is not only resoundingly poor, but a personal insult to every last viewer unfortunate enough to find themselves watching it.-1/10",

Her son Sean, now a cop at Amity is killed one night in the water, and Ellen decides to visit Michael, her other son on a Caribbean island. Ellen believes her family is haunted by sharks and wants her son to stop working with them as he now has a family of his own to look after.

Soon though it becomes clear that the shark is after the family. Elle decides to find and destroy the shark as she cannot get on with her life and must protect remaining members of her family, and Mike, Jake and Hoagie follow.There are some good performances here, they hardly are special, but above average especially when you remember the story. Lorraine and Lance are solid as the Brody family, while Van Peebles is good and provides some banter. Caine looks like he is having fun, it is the Bahamas after all, and he probably was paid well. There are a couple of good moments- the banana boat scene and the shark following Mike into the sunken ship. A poor finish to the series, but then again not much new could really be done to spice things up. The cinematography is good, the shark looks OK, but of course some things the shark does are just wrong. The films should have ended after part 2.

It doesn't have the suspense or grit or great cast of that movie. But if you like big sharks, then this is pretty good- the shark is a better one than the models in 1 & 2, and they use a lot of real shark footage. There are some great moments- really great- where the shark comes up out of the water just like in the old Universal Studios ride, and munches folk down. There's even a part where it rears out of the water and ROARS. Apart from that, it's a fairly weak film- Lorraine Gary returns from the first 2 movies as Ellen Brody, and we have yet another two actors playing her sons. There's a lot of backchat and wrangling going on between the characters, which neither informs or entertains. And yes, of course the plot is completely silly, but it'd be churlish to hold that against it. I was moved to shout \"More shark, less talk!\" at a couple of points, but it's far from being the terrible fiasco I thought it would be after reading other reviews.It starts with quite a solid bit of action on Amity Island, where younger Brody son Sean is devoured by a vengeful Jaws- Ellen Brody then goes out to the Bahamas to recover with older son Michael who seems to have changed, not just physical appearance since 1, 2, and 3, but has also swopped his marine expert girlfriend of 3 for a drippy artist chick who whines throughout the whole flick. The shark duly turns up, and chases them around until they finally spear it with the broken-off prow of their boat- which seems to make it explode.

Maybe in retrospect he should had been better off going to LA.Caine got a good pay cheque and spent time in the Bahamas for this film. He must have spent a small amount of time checking the script though.The story is that a shark is so upset that Officer Brody of Amity Island was going around killing Great White sharks in the previous films that this presumed relative of the dead Great White sharks is doing a Charles Bronson and goes on a death wish or death fish!The shark kills one of Brody's son and is now after his wife. Even though she has gone to the Bahamas to be with her other son, the shark has followed her.Roy Scheider who played Officer Brody in Jaws 1 & 2 wisely kept away from this fiasco, so his character has been killed off in a heart attack.The film is rubbish, it is not even hokey fun. Universal Pictures should be ashamed of itself for treating one of its biggest franchises in such an appalling manner.",

Not only did she look terrible (wow, did she age since the first shark attack!!), her scenes with her granddaughter were superfluous and just plain annoying.

The actual shark model is shockingly bad and the films' plot is stupid, murderous shark stalking them or something I don't even know.Acting wise it was pretty poor but I have seen worse, which is saying something. And despite the awful quality a couple of the scenes are fairly well shot and ok the music wasn't that bad but it couldn't have been much worse than the amazing Jaws theme as they basically just copy that with a cheesy 80s spin.2/10: I would not suggest this, stop at Jaws 2 or if you're a big fan 3 may be worth a watch.

The acting was really good. Lorraine Gary really was convincing as a paranoid widow. I understand that the fact that a great white shark following them to Bremuda is a little hard to believe, but this film is basically about how the Brody family for some reason have always been cursed by sharks. It's also about confronting your fears. Michael Cain plays a very likable bloke and Lance Guest and Mario Peebles are solid actors. The special effects aren't the greatest, but I didn't feel they were the worst ever either. Some of my favorite moments include the opening credits sequence set to Michael Small's pulse pounding score. In fact, this theme is an excellent extension of the original theme written by John Williams. It's a soundtrack I listen to often (yes, I even own a very rare promo CD of the score). Speaking of 'Jaws The Revenge' memorabilia, I actually have a framed original one sheet to this film hanging on my door... but back to my favorite scenes...The banana boat sequence was suspenseful and the moment where Michael Caine's plane swoops over the boat just in time to see the shark rise up from the ocean is excellent.There are some great things going on in this film and I think people should back off and take a look at the film and forget about all the vitriol it so undeservedly gets.",

            "content": "Arriving nearly twelve years after the original, and only four years after the dire second sequel, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" may be considerably inept in a number of departments, but it does improve on the last sequel and in absolutely no way does it deserve it's title as \"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made\".  This effort, while not Spielberg, deserves a little more respect than that.The action has returned to Amity Island, where an interesting opening credits sequence has the unseen shark hide itself in the town's harbour. Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) is now heading up the clan following the death of her husband Martin (the Roy Scheider character from the first two). After her youngest son is killed by a shark whilst on harbour patrol, Ellen believes the shark to hold a grudge against the family.  Shortly afterwards, she moves to the Bahamas for Christmas to be with her marine expert son Mike (Lance Guest) and his family.  The shark appears to follow her, though, and mayhem quickly ensues..The script is not actually too bad an effort. It is never an absolute given that the shark Ellen meets in the Bahamas is the same one from Amity, and the script does well to play on the notion that she's really imagining it all.  However, the story falls flat when trying to provide substantial dramatic material to pass time between shark attacks. The Ellen/Mike relationship; her romance with an amoral pilot (Michael Caine); and Mike's own relationships with his family and his best friend (Mario Van Peebles) have potential, but due to the script and the short running time are never given any chance to develop.Performances are of mixed quality.  Gary is excellent as the haunted Ellen Brody, easily conveying the fragile, paranoid nature of her character. Lance Guest isn't too bad as her son Mike, and Mario Van Peebles hams it up with his corny lines as his unflappable, comic relief partner.  Skilled British actor Michael Caine does what he can with his limited material. Karen Young may be attractive, but her performance here is weak, her Boston accent inexplicably turning Cockney in one scene.Technically, the film is interesting in terms of both its merit and flaws. It is essential to have seen the first \"Jaws\" in order to completely understand this one, as sepia-tinted shots from the original have been spliced into this movie.  Whilst this is a little choppy in places, it does enhance the feeling that this is the final movie even if it renders the finale a touch incomprehensible.  Michael Small's score upgrades and speeds up John William's classic theme to good effect.Then there is the shark.  This is a far better-looking replica than the one that appeared in \"Jaws 3\", and much has been made of the various tricks it performs in this movie.  For starters, sharks don't attack boats.  But even the first \"Jaws\" got this one wrong, so that is forgivable.  However, sharks can rise out of the surface in order to attack prey, sometimes taking it's whole body with it.  Sharks have not been known to growl, but reports say South African Great Whites make a roaring sound when they hit they surface, so this is not as implausible as might first appear.The problem is not what the shark does, but how it does it.  Every time the shark attacks, it moves with a mechanical slowness that makes it painfully obvious it is not the real thing.By no means a film classic, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" on a certain level remains overall satisfying viewing and works well as the swansong for the \"Jaws\" series.",

            "content": "There is no explanation for \"Jaws: The Revenge.\" It is just there. You either accept it as it is, or come to love it. I prefer to deny its entire existence, if that is at all possible.If the people who made the film had half the smarts they should have had, not only would they have ended this series three sequels ago, but they would have at least come up with something exciting, much less original, as potential material for this film. I can accept one lousy sequel. I can live with a second. But when a third sequel comes around and it keeps getting lousier every minute in, I have no choice but to fume smoke out my ears and write a review with a grimace on my face.It's been an odd number of years since the original \"Jaws.\" Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), now widowed and living in Martha's Vineyard, a.k.a. the seaside town Amity, has basically forgotten about the shark that she had nothing to do with. Other than the odd occasion when she gets flashbacks of events that she never witnessed, and in most cases no one ever witnessed, she's just dandy.  One night on Christmas, her son, seen as a teenager in \"Jaws 2,\" gets eaten by a shark off the shore of Amity. Ellen remembers the shark, and is convinced that \"this time it's personal.\" So she catches a ride to the Bahamas, to live near her other son, and plead with him to quit his job as a -- whaddaya know -- marine biologist. He assures her that no Great White Sharks have ever been spotted off the Bahamas...but before you can say \"duh-duh-duh-duh,\" a revenge-filled Great White Shark arrives at the Bahamas (in three days, mind you) and proceeds to try and eat Mrs. Brody. I wish it had, so we wouldn't have to sit through the rest of the film.All her friends ignore her pleas for help. Just as is the case with most horror sequels, they pooh-pooh her away until something really awful happens, and then ask her why she never told them about what was going to happen. But Ellen doesn't wait for that to happen, which is at least one thing about this film that breaks away from the horror-sequel mold.Ellen Brody instead rushes into the water to sacrifice herself to the shark, in a last-ditch effort to stop the killing. When she does so, her new boyfriend, Hoagie (Michael Caine) rushes to her side...by crash-landing his airplane at sea, being attacked by the shark, and swimming to the boat, climbing in without any wet clothes, and doing absolutely nothing to help her other than scream a lot and look worried. Hoagie's black friend, Jake (Mario Van Peebles), who was no doubt forced to help Hoagie help his girl by Hoagie himself, helps out just long enough to get eaten by the shark. (But, seeing how this is a \"believe it or not!\" kind of sequel, he comes to the surface five minutes later looking just fine, even though he was just carried underwater by a savage beast moments earlier.) And if you fast-forward the next scene, in which they attempt to defeat the shark, you'll see just how humorous the image of a Great White Shark standing on its fin can be.I go to the beach every year, and that, for me, is part of the fun of the \"Jaws\" series. I've always been squeamish when I think of sharks. The ocean(s) is/are like another universe, occupied by strange creatures, most of which we know nothing about. And sharks are the rulers of this underwater world. \"Jaws\" played right to that idea, showing us all just how powerful and scary these creatures can be. But they also used the idea that these beasts of the depths are mortal. \"Jaws: The Return\" plays with the continuing trend that the shark is now invincible; the creature is no longer something the audience can relate to, but is an invincible monster. \"Jaws\" used to be more than just another invincible-monster-movie. \"Jaws: The Return\" ruins this and ends the series on a low-note, ruining the suspense of the first film. I really hope Steven Spielberg returns some day to end this series on a high-note. Besides, it can't get any more screwed up than it already is.But the film's non-existent suspense is not the only problem. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" isn't good at all. It isn't even fun to watch. It's so awful that it's not humorous the least bit. I've seen my fair share of bad sequels coming off of good movies, but \"Jaws: The Revenge\" takes the cake as one of the worst.The only remotely funny thing I found about this movie is that the shark, Jaws (or is it Jaws no. 4?) eats people. And Michael Caine's name is Hoagie. You put it together.0/5 stars (no stars) -John Ulmer",

She moves to the Bahamas to get away from things but...the shark follows her!Jaws: The Revenge is the third and final sequel to Jaws (1975). It's a film that almost requires no introduction on account of its reputation as such a monumental mess of a movie. It's easy to see why it attracted such scorn to be fair as its story-line about a shark that has the ability to follow someone \u2013 presumably via psychic powers \u2013 hundreds of miles, it's beyond ridiculous; while what the shark is precisely seeking revenge for is never fully explained. The great white itself is notable for having the unusual ability to roar like a lion, which is at the very least an unexpected skill given sharks have no vocal chords. But you know what, I consider all of the above nonsense as positive aspects which go in this film's favour. Its sheer ridiculousness kind of makes it so entertaining. The real drawback to Jaws: The Revenge in my book was the excessive amounts of tedious melodrama which accounted for quite a bit of the run-time of the middle third of the movie. But whenever the shark popped up to play, things got a lot more agreeable and thankfully he appears pretty often throughout. And while it did look fake, the shark sort of still looked quite cool nevertheless. Essentially all the attack scenes are good value in my opinion and, aside from some fast-editing used in the earlier moments, I thought the cinematography was actually more than decent in capturing those moments rather effectively.Famously Michael Caine missed out picking up his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) in order to film one of the re-shot endings for this. The one I saw has Mario Van Peebles character ludicrously survive being pulled down into the depths of the ocean while clamped into the jaws of the shark - he tiresomely re-emerges with a few light scratches and several wise-cracks. The actual destruction of the shark itself was also somewhat unclearly achieved as well but what the hell. It's such a silly film that such issues become relatively moot points by its conclusion. Also of note was the blink-and-you'll-miss-her re-appearance of Lee Fierro reprising her role as Mrs. Kinter, so memorable as the mother of the little boy who was killed on the beach in the first movie, leading to her angry and emotional dockside confrontation with Chief Brody. In this one she now appears to be a friend of the Brody family, so bygones must be bygones.Despite its reputation, I definitely prefer this sequel to the somewhat annoying previous entry, Jaws 3D (1983). It does feel like more of a continuation of the story, even if it takes the characters into an extremely silly direction. But the sharksploitation genre has produced films over the subsequent years that have rarely been known for their understatedness and intelligence. Jaws: The Revenge is no different, it just achieves the same level of daftness on a massively bigger budget. The honest truth is that this is definitely much more enjoyable than the majority of other shark-attack monster movies.",

            "content": "(Possible Spoilers)Try catching this fourth (and final?) chapter of the deteriorating JAWS saga right after being exposed to the super-lousy JAWS 3-D and then try to tell yourself it's not at least a 'little' better than that one was. JAWS: THE REVENGE is one of the most lambasted and skewered sequels ever made, and while I can't defend most of its problems, I think time has been a tad kinder to it. Unlike JAWS 3, this film at least took a stab at some kind of storyline and characterizations.Lorraine Gary returns as Ellen, the wife of Chief Brody, now looking very haggard with all she's had to deal with. Her husband has died from a heart attack brought on by his fear of the shark, and her two sons are now fully grown and involved in nerve-wracking careers that further wear their mother down. Eldest son Mike (Lance Guest) is a marine biologist, and his younger brother Sean is a Deputy. During the Christmas season, Sean is torn to pieces by another shark just off Amity Island. Mom then goes completely nuts and starts to convince herself that the shark has some sort of \"personal vendetta\" against her whole family and is deliberately seeking them out.Looking for some kind of solace, Ellen vacations in the Bahamas with what's left of her kin, including surviving son Mike, his wife Carla, and their little daughter Thea. While there Ellen falls for a friendly pilot named Hoagie (Michael Caine) and starts to relax and laugh a little with him. Meanwhile, Mike and his humorous partner Jake (Mario Van Peebles) come across another Great White (the same one who killed Sean? Who knows for sure?) and try to study it behind Ellen's back. Just as things are starting to look up for Mrs. Brody again, her granddaughter is nearly attacked by the intruding shark and Ellen decides to confront her demon out on the ocean by herself, once and for all.The ending is so dumb and abrupt that it has to be seen to be believed. The Great White even roars with what sounds a lot like a looped growl of Spot from The Munsters! The Jaws premise is very limited to say the least, and the sequels themselves got (arguably) worse with every new chapter. So how did this despised installment fare for me this time around? Strangely, kind of watchable. While JAWS 2 is a much better movie, at least there's something of a plot attempt with #4. One of the biggest criticisms toward JAWS: THE REVENGE is the unlikely notion of the same shark following Mrs. Brody all the way to the Bahamas; but in my view, despite the film's title and tag line (\"this time it's personal\"), this whole \"revenge\" nonsense really exists only in Ellen's troubled mind, and nowhere else. There is nothing in the movie itself to indicate that this isn't a second shark, even. After all she's been through, no wonder Ellen imagines her family's been jinxed!Mario Van Peebles is likable as Mike Brody's sidekick (though his immaculate fate on the currently available release of this is absurdly far-fetched). As Hoagie, Michael Caine hasn't really got a clue, but at least he's on hand to offer a little charm, if not much else. And Lorraine Gary is surprisingly good in this film, better even than she had been in JAWS and JAWS 2. Visually, director Joseph Sargent (COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE) can't do as much with this tired old material as Jeannot Szwarc managed in Part 2, although the look of the ocean is quite picturesque. ** out of ****",

People are so used to shark attacks on Amity Island, when one attacks by the fourth movie, no one even bothers to investigate, look for the great white or even file a report.7. When the script calls for a main character to say they're going \"Nowhere,\" the actor's actually talking about their careers.8. Playing the original music from the original masterpiece in the fourth movie's opening segment does not equate greatness.9.

Sharks are the termites of the sea\u0085they'll chomp on wood, even when they just want to taunt you.15. Mother's intuition is only relevant when four separate sharks attack your family.16. When you've actually survived three shark attacks, working in the ocean has to be a safe occupation. I mean, it couldn't possibly happen\u0085look out!17. Michael Caine's character is a degenerate gambler (not that it's relevant to the script) but it appears Caine, himself, took more of a gamble here.18. Ellen's character never carried one of the Jaws pictures before. There's a reason for that.19. Lorraine Gary likes to smile and wince. Repeatedly. Karen Allen does the same for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That should tell you where I'm going\u008520. Sharks trump Homeland Security with their sonar. Some can obtain a flight itinerary of their \"mark\" when they want revenge on a family, even when they abruptly fly from New York to the Bahamas.21. So\u0085no \"direct to video\" options in 1987?22. I don't understand how a Part Four of a movie series can be so bad. I mean was Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Batman & Robin, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Hellraiser: Bloodline, Fast & Furious, Alien: Resurrection, Rocky IV, Hannibal Rising, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Ernest Scared Stupid, The Final Destination, Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, so bad?23. You know you have problems when Misterjaw is scarier this \"live action\" shark.24. It's one thing to have constant flashbacks/dreams of previous films \u2013 that the characters weren't even involved in, but even more from your own movie?...How was this not the Syfy movie of the week?25. You know there are script problems when there are more scenes of Ellen's insecurities than of the \"terrifying\" shark\u0085in a shark movie.26. The outrageous last 1/3 is worth seeing the whole movie. If you can make it to the beach attack scene\u0085you MUST see the finale. Think Edward (from Twilight) running up the hill. For twenty minutes. Classic.27. Michael Caine appears so uninterested in this project, or perhaps that the terrible film took his opportunity to accept his Oscar\u00ae for Hannah and Her Sisters, that he \"almost\" becomes lunch for Jaws, swims to safety in the water and emerges completely\u0085and stone cold\u0085dry.28. Jaws eats a plane in this sequel. Makes sense; he ate a helicopter for lunch in part 2.29. You know you p!ssed off a shark when he\u0085roars like a dinosaur? Or is a lion? Do sharks even have vocal cords?30. Never have I seen a movie that fell so far apart in the finale that it's a must-see for all movie lovers. For, you have to know evil to know good, right?",

Now I am NOT saying it's a good film...in fact it's a pretty stupid one. But surely there are many, many, many worse movies out there. This isn't exactly a glowing endorsement....I still don't think most sane people would enjoy this movie...unless, of course, they're looking for a laugh!The story begins around Christmas. Yet another great white shark strikes...eating Sean Brody. Apparently, according to his mother, the sharks specifically have it out for the Brody family. And, she's apparently right, as when she moves to the Bahamas to live with her surviving son and his family, a Great White shows up....and looks as if it's ready to eat the son! Talk about carrying a grudge!! After all, Great Whites do not normally inhabit warm waters like those around the various Bahamian islands. And this one, apparently, has GPS...as it manages to find the son again and again and goes to great troubles to chase him! Dumb?! Certainly. It got so ridiculous, I half expected to have a shark waiting for him in his bathroom or in his garage or disguised as the UPS man making a delivery! So, it's up to Grandma (yes, Mrs. Brody is a grandma in this film) to take on the shark...mano y mano (as Ricky Bobby is prone to saying).On the positive side, it was nice seeing the underwater diving footage. I have been diving in the Bahamas and Hawaii (and the film was made in both locales) and it was nice seeing the pretty water. Of course, considering that I am focusing on this and not the plot says a lot!On the negative, the film is just plain dumb. I was especially laughing at the plane crash scene...as it just defied common sense and seemed in the movie just to add to the excitement...though NOT to believability! Very little of the film, actually, made sense and it seemed like they were just squeezing every last ounce they could out of a moribund franchise....one that should have been laid to rest long, long ago.Only of interest to bad movie fans or anyone curious how low Michael Caine was willing to go in order to get a paycheck!",

            "content": "(Minor spoilers)While nowhere near the quality of the original masterpiece of \"Jaws,\" or even it's immediate sequel, \"Jaws 2,\" I still enjoy this film, and like it a it more than \"Jaws 3-D.\" While technically better, \"Jaws 3-D\" feels like a Jaws film in name only. You could change the name of Quaid's character and still have the same film. This couldn't be more clear in the scripting of this film, which basically pretends \"Jaws 3-D\" never happened.Yes, the plot is frequently ridiculous, and save for the really appalling slow moving shark in the finale of Jaws 3-D, this film probably has the weakest of the fake sharks on screen. Apparently the original script had a voodoo subplot which, while also ridiculous, would have \"smoothed the waters,\" as to how the shark not only gets from Amity to the Bahamas in mere days, but also offers an explanation as to why it somehow seems to be \"targeting\" the Brody family personally.One of the things that help make it watchable are the cast. Lorraine Gary gets a rare opportunity to topline a film, and she does well, returning to the role she's most famous for. While Dennis Quaid is a better actor than Lance Guest, I found myself liking Guest more as Mike Brody. For one thing, he looks more like he could be the child of Gary and Roy Scheider, and I could see Mike pursuing a career in the ocean after the events of the earlier \"Jaws\" film. His profession seemed more plausible here than working at Sea World. Again not knocking Quaid, he's an immensely talented actor and gave a good performance in the third film, I just give the edge to Guest, he performs well here and seems to more look the part of someone who could be the Brody's son.Mario Van Peeble's accent is questionable, but Jake is probably my favorite character in the film, and of course, the film also boasts Academy-Award winner Michael Caine. Yes, he's here for the money and the location shooting, but he doesn't phone in his performance at all, and Caine is watchable in anything. He's clearly having fun here, and it shows.Karen Young and Lynn Whitfield are also nicely cast in the smaller supporting roles of Guest and Peeble's significant others, and it also features one of the tragic last performances of Judith Barsi, who does an excellent job as Brody's young daughter.While lacking somewhat in the shark attack sequences, the film does open with an effectively chilling attack, one that results in the death of Sean Brody. I'm not too worried about sharing that detail, as it happens in the film's opening, and basically is the set-up for the rest of the film. While the film's quality lessens after the opening sequence, that first attack still remains highly effective and uncomfortable to watch. It also allows the film to come a bit full-circle afterwards, with Ellen being consoled by none other than original \"Jaws\" actresses Lee Fiero, Mrs. Kintner, who lost her own on-screen son in the original film, and Fritzi Jane Courtney as Mrs. Taft \"(I don't think that's funny. I don't think that's funny at all.\")Personally, I enjoy it. It's not a great film, but it's not as awful as it's reputation would have you believe, in my opinion. I own it as part of a three-movie set with the second and third films, and I've definitely given \"Revenge\" more repeat viewings than the third film.",

            "review_title": "\"I know it's coming. I KNOW it's coming.\" - Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody",
            "content": "I'm convinced of two things after seeing this movie. First, I'm dead certain that Lorraine Gary is terribly under-rated as an actress. Second, I would bet my life that she watched 1986's \"Aliens\" while preparing for this performance. The time-line is appropriate, and there's a quality in Lorraine's character in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" that very much reminds me of some of the great female screen warriors, such as Sigourney Weaver in the \"Alien\" films, and Jamie Lee Curtis in her \"Halloween\" films (I will always consider \"Halloween H2O: Twenty Year Later\" to be the final installment of a trilogy, that being \"Halloween\", \"Halloween II\", and \"H2O\".) Laurie Strode and Ellen Ripley are such strong, enigmatic, and iconic women, and Lorraine Gary in the \"Jaws\" films (excluding \"Jaws 3D\", which she was not a part of) comes close to them as an interesting character whom we get to know and love and root for over a span of many years and many sequels. Gary's Ellen Brody is now wiser, more wounded, and even more beautiful than she was in 1976's \"Jaws\". In \"Jaws: The Revenge\" Ellen loses one of her sons to a shark attack. Her husband, police chief Martin Brody, has died of a heart attack, and Ellen still lives in Amity and now must mourn the passing of another family member. She's convinced that fear of the sharks from the first two films is what truly killed Martin, and now she finds herself plagued by another fatal attack. She travels to the Bahamas to visit her other son, and meets a friendly pilot (Michael Caine) along the way. Once there, she tries to get back to her old self, but instead is haunted by nightmares and fear. This leads to paranoia and an obsession with the idea that her family is predestined for more horrible shark attacks. Her surviving son, Michael, works underwater, and this terrifies her. Everyone thinks Ellen is over-reacting. When Michael does encounter a large Great White, he realizes that his mother's fears might just be justified, but he decides not to tell her about the incident. Meanwhile, Ellen senses the danger in a way that suggests a telepathic link between her and the shark that killed her son. The ocean itself seems to call her name, and at the very moment that Michael encounters the shark Ellen's intuition tells her that something awful is wrong, even though she is miles away at the time. This psychic subplot is one of the most interesting things about the film (John Boorman did the same thing with the character of Regan MacNeil, and to great effect, in \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" - I adore both of these films for trying to do something different than their predecessors) Since she can't explain to anyone what's happening to her, Ellen must bury these strange and scary feelings,and try to go on. Against her better judgment, she then begins an affair with the airplane pilot, and takes small steps towards living a normal life again. But before long, her grand-daughter survives an attack by a Great White, and this is the event that sends Ellen off to face the shark once and for all. She decides to sacrifice herself to the beast, in the hopes that this will satisfy the shark and spare what remains of her family. She takes a boat out to sea and waits for the shark to find her. Ultimately, she is rescued by the pilot and her son, and together the three of them destroy the shark by feeding it a makeshift bomb, in a nicely-done sequence borrowed heavily (and rather touchingly) from the finale of the original \"Jaws\". Gary's characterization in this particular film is lovely. She gets to show her acting range here much more than in the first two films, and maybe more than she's ever done in a film before (sadly, it seems that she is now retired.) She gives Ellen Brody the same warmth that she always does, but here she is such a sympathetic character that you just want to give her a big hug. You can tell that by this time Gary knows who this woman is from the inside out, and she makes every scene believable. It's no surprise to me that she was nominated for a Saturn Award for her performance - and she should have won it. The moments in the film when she is psychically aware of the shark are amazing. The musical cues are perfect in these scenes, and Gary makes it seem like it's really happening. Whether it's a touching scene or one of suspense, she is mesmerizing throughout. She makes this film work very well, in my opinion. (There is a particular scene just before the finale when Ellen takes her jacket off, and it looks just like the scene in \"Aliens\" where Ripley is in the elevator, preparing to rescue Newt, and she removes her jacket in order to wear the artillery bands.) Even the shoulder pads Ellen Brody wears throughout this film suggest a warrior aspect, and with her lean body and determined expressions she seems capable of anything. She is proof that women get stronger, more beautiful, and more commanding of the screen as they age; it is tragic that Hollywood has difficulty realizing this, and giving older actresses like Gary better parts. But \"Jaws: The Revenge\" realizes it, and succeeds, and by the end of it I found Ellen Brody as compelling a heroine as one could hope for. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is not just a horror film; it is also a very human story, one that incorporates emotion and mystery at every opportunity. Lorraine Gary makes it satisfying as no other actress could have done, and Ellen Brody takes her place alongside some of the genre's most notable and enduring female characters.",

            "review_title": "As bad as its notoriety indicates",
            "content": "In 1987, you would be hard-pressed to believe that Universal could unleash another Jaws sequel as dim-witted and underwhelming as Jaws 3-D, but they proved up to the challenge by actually surpassing that spectacle and delivering this piece of unforgivable flotsam.The film opens during the Christmas season in Amity, where Sean Brody is now the sheriff and is called out to remove a piece of floating junk blocking the marina. Not sure why a sheriff would be responsible for this, but whatever. Naturally during this process, a Great White shark comes up and bites off Sean's arm. Sean obliges the shark further by not throwing himself back in the boat, but screaming while continuing to hang over the side, where the shark finishes making a meal of him. At Sean's funeral, mother Ellen Brody (returning Lorraine Gary) insists to her son Mike (Lance Guest) that the Brody's are being targeted and that a shark was responsible for not only Sean, but father Martin's death (apparently Martin succumbed to a heart attack from the fear of his shark encounters). Mike insists that Mom leave Amity to stay with Mike and his family in the Bahamas, where Mike apparently holds some vague job as a marine biologist (what else?). Due to an apparently supernatural element that is never explained or developed, the Great White follows Ellen from Amity to the Bahamas to wreak havoc...There are so many things wrong with this film that a full analysis would take hours. The lunacy that a vengeful Great White would emerge to assassinate the Brody clan is bad enough, but having the determined fish make a dramatic swim from the icy waters of the North Atlantic into the Bahamas in record time is damn near laughable. I am uncertain whether it is a benefit or a detriment that the film offers no legitimate explanation for any of this. It may possibly have been overlooked if the screenplay were any good or one had any rooting interest in anyone onscreen. The film never explains why Ellen and Sean choose to stay in Amity, a place with such negative memories for them. Nor does the film explain why Mike, who has had nothing but problems with sharks throughout his life, would end up in a profession that keeps him in the water. One would think this is one family that would move inland.The film has a blessedly short running time, but it is completely devoid of suspense. Much of the film feels like it is padded with Gary paired off with a slumming Michael Caine as a happy-go-lucky British pilot (not a good one at that). There are times we forget we are watching a shark film and not a personal and badly scripted older person's date. We get at least two badly done dream sequences to further pad things out, as well as numerous scenes of Gary staring out over the water with trepidation or clutching her bosom when she apparently psychically senses the shark is menacing a family member. There are even further scenes that make no darn sense for their inclusion. Ellen has flashbacks to scenes from the original Jaws to which she was not privy to and director Joseph Sargent shamelessly repeats the scene at the kitchen table where Mike's daughter mimics his actions. And, when the shark does decide to attack, it has a bad aim as it seems to hit bystanders rather than the intended targets.Special effects are negligible here with an unconvincing and far from menacing shark. There are no great set pieces and no sense of a real threat. The film oddly seems lethargic. Continuity is also a mess. At one point, Caine barely escapes the shark and climbs aboard a boat to safety wearing an outfit that is bone dry.The characters are still born. Gary was never the strongest actress and owed her career to a husband working in the higher echelons of Universal. She manages to do nothing with her role here - not even making Ellen especially interesting or sympathetic. Odd considering her losses and her terror should naturally place the audience on her side. Lance Guest could be a solid actor and was terrific in The Last Starfighter, but this film seems to have largely finished off his career. His Mike is one-note and boring. Although he has it better than Karen Young and Judith Barsi, who are little more than props as his wife and daughter. Mario Van Peebles is laughably awful as Mike's Rastafarian assistant. Apparently Universal felt the film's lack of popularity was because Van Peebles was \"likable\" and viewers were put off by his death in the final act so there were prints where he survives. Made no difference, both Van Peebles and the film were still bloody awful. Charitable filmgoers will allow that Caine apparently had a lapse in judgement, but then again Caine has been notorious for starring in crap for a quick paycheck, so there is that.Just when you think that the film cannot get any dumber, Gary steals a boat and heads out on the high seas to meet the shark head on. Alas, she forgets to grab any weapons or any means by which to kill the shark. Her son, his friend and the ridiculous Caine, track her down by air, crash the plane on the water near the boat and swim over to keep her company. When Guest asks her what she was doing, she merely shrieks \"I had to do it!\" Weapons prove not to be needed though, since the shark obliges by snarling, standing up on the surface of the water on its tail and dancing threateningly towards the boat long enough that Ellen can ram the front of the boat into it and impale it...and sink the whole damn boat in the process.Sadly, the shark only manages to snag one Brody during the entire running time and it is arguably the only one that has not irritated us beyond reason. One assumes Ellen, Mike and Mr. Caine swim back to shore. Then again, maybe there was a back-up assassin shark to do them in offscreen. They have mercifully not been heard from since 1987.",

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERSAlmost everyone on this board will tell you the worst shark movie is JAWS THE REVENGE. But, believe it or not, it is not. There is a worst JAWS movie, and it is called JAWS 3-D. It is the worst for multiple reasons: 1, a 10-foot in appearance shark is claimed to be 35 feet in length. 2, way too much blood, gore and sickness. 3, crappy 3-d effects. 4, no original cast from 1 or 2. 5, hiring a PRODUCTION DESIGNER to be a director (Joe Alves, production designer of Jaws 1 and 2 is director). 6, taking place in sea world, Florida, about 9 states away from Amity. 7, a dolphin being taken into the shark's mouth and the scene fading with the dolphin squeaking painfully, later to see that same dolphin swimming happily and unharmed. 8, multiple more incidents of continuity. 9, more and more.But enough about JAWS 3. I am here for JAWS THE REVENGE. And I am here to say it is better than the third. I can hardly believe it was nominated for \"worst visual effects\". Did anybody see the effects in JAWS 3? It's like the designer was on his first day of using a computer and they told him to do the effects for JAWS 3. There are almost NO continuity effects in JAWS 4. And another thing, this movie had a believable plot line. Also, an original cast member, Lorraine Gary, returned and did a fairly good job. There is a huge list of things that made this film better than the third, and I don't have time to name it. I know there are some obvious dumb-dumbs in the movie (shark gets to Bahamas at plane speed, shark roaring, etc) but it was overall much more believable and fun than the embarrassment of 3. I would almost say this is better than JAWS 2, if it hadn't been for one factor: the ending. How the hell does a man get in a sharks mouth, taken down into sea by it, than live with a only a ripped shirt and a some blood on him? Maybe it was some kind of joke, like how he said earlier about the shark \"only liking white meat\" or something. And, another factor that hurt the ending: the shark exploding. What the HELL?!!! It isn't possible. But I realized after research that it was Universal's insistence or something and they gave them a small budget to create the explosion. However, I later discovered, while watching the movie on AMC, that the movie had an alternate ending. If they had kept this ending and released on the DVD, I would vote this movie better than 2. In this ending, Jake does not survive (sad but logical) and the shark is speared on the boat, not exploded. When I saw the ending on this channel I flipped out in excitement, then anger. WHY DIDN'T THIS ENDING STAY?!!! WHY?? It made more sense!!Well, you can't always get what you want. In conclusion: JAWS 4: Had it's mistakes but it wasn't like JAWS 3, which was just one big mistake. For the record, here's how I rank the JAWS quadrilogy:(Out of ten stars) JAWS: 10. JAWS 2: 8. JAWS 3: 2. JAWS THE REVENGE: 6.Also: I would like to point out that the creators of JAWS 4 made a good move at ignoring all the events that happened in JAWS 3 and following right from JAWS 2. Way to go!",

The shark then follows the family when the go to the Bahamas & the mum becomes paranoid that the shark has gone out to get vengeance! The film was below mediocre & had way too much time on the story- line clips & less kills & when they did come they were either made to look like kills (when you found out the characters survived) And there were only 2 kills maximum! Pathetic, even Jaws 3-D lacked the kills! The shots were way to up close (same problem with Jaws 3-D) making it harder to know who it was that was getting mauled to death!The shark itself wasn't too bad though abit fake & tacky looking. The ending wasn't that much cop & didn't have as near as much of an epic finale ending like the previous Jaws films (Jaws 2 especially) but was weak in term of how the shark got killed. It was among other things in the film I found were abit dumb, like a shark getting revenge, a shark following someone through a sunken ship like a person! It was laughable at points & the shark roaring like a lion & standing up in such a fake dumb way took the cake by miles! I mean come on really?I Overall found this film to be OK but a little tame, but not the worst film! It was watchable. I have seen worst & this isn't it! This film would be Oscar worthy in comparison to Sharknado & Double Headed Shark!4/10",

It goes without saying that this film comes nowhere near to the standards of the original but it is great entertainment and is always good fun to watch. The direction is poor and Mario Van Peebles as the madcap scientist Jake is the only standout performer in the entire cast. You get to see some seriously nasty Shark Attacks which include arms being ripped off and the clear carribean oceans in which the majority of the action takes place are turned red with blood on more than one occassion which is a big plus. The one thing that stops this from being a really great movie is the ridiculous plot, you cannot seriously believe for one moment that the shark holds a grudge against the Brodie Family. This suggestion of the supernatural is more than a bit stupid and is impossible to overlook. Despite of this Jaws: The Revenge is still a very good film featuring the best Shark Attack scenes and Underwater Footage in the \"Jaws\" Series and the hilarious bonus of getting to see Michael Caine make a fool of himself and for these reasons alone is worth watching. Overall this is a good film that does not deserve the excessive criticism which it has got from so-called fans of the series and know-it-all film critics.",

Jaws follows the Brody's to an island. It's his revenge!! What makes this movie stand out as a loser is the shark itself. It gets too many closeups which exposes it for the prop it is. Shark looking mighty fake. The ending seals the deal. Jaws on his hind legs out of the water and howling like a wounded lion. I'll join him. AAAAAAWWWOOOOO!!!",

            "content": "This movie doesn't receive much love but I think it really deserves some. It's understandable why this movie is regarded as a bad one. It's the third establishment in a series of unneeded \"Jaws\" sequels. Both 2 and 3 were disappointing movies, especially compared to the first of course so how could the third sequel be possibly any better? It's easy to bash a movie like this but I'm not going with the majority here on this one.I'll explain why I feel that this is the second best movie from the \"Jaws\" series. Despite the previous two sequels it actually tries to recapture the atmosphere of the first movie. Also of course the fact that Lorraine Gary reprises her role as Ellen Brody adds to this feeling and atmosphere. The movie has lots of returning character and references to the first \"Jaws\" movie, something that the previous two sequels mostly ignored. This movie is actually the closest to the first \"Jaws\" movie in its atmosphere, story and tension. The only reason why this movie is not as good as the first \"Jaws\" movie is the fact that it hasn't got the characters Quint, Chief Brody and Hooper in it. Also of course Spielbergs skill and subtle touch is missing and so is John Williams' musical score.The use of some archive footage from the first \"Jaws\" movie, in some flashbacks scenes might be a bit cheap but in my opinion it works effective. It perfectly binds the first and last establishment of the \"Jaws\" series. It also explains the 'lame' story better. The story is that a shark wants to take revenge on all the Brody's. It's of course incredibly silly that a shark would ever do such a thing but a story like this was necessary to put an end to the \"Jaws\" series. After this vengeful shark would die, it would be highly unbelievable that any of the Brody's would have a later encounter with a great white. This sort of story was simply needed to put an end to the series and for me it's really satisfying.It is a really great and enjoyable monster movie. It has some well build up and executed sequences and an ending that also doesn't disappoint. In my opinion it's a great way to end the \"Jaws\" series, even though my opinion still is that none of the \"Jaws\" sequels should had ever been made because they are simply pointless.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I can't even give a real introduction this movie is so bad. Everyone should know, but let's take a little history course. In 1975, a movie titled \"Jaws\" (directed by S. Spielberg) hit movie theaters and was an instant success. A sequel was released a few years later, simply titled Jaws 2. That did alright, but wasn't anywhere close to be going good. Around 1982, a 3rd was filmed... in 3-D (titled Jaws 3, sometimes 3-D). The movie sucked (and is ranked somewhere in the worst 75 movies of all time list here), but not enough for someone to say \"Hey! Maybe this should be the last!\" So we get Jaws: The Revenge...(blows flatulence) That is what I think of this movie.First, you have a pretty bad excuse of actors... and Michael Caine (who did the movie thanks to a s**t load of money, a trip to the Bahamas, and a new vacation mansion built with the money). You have Mario Van Peebles playing the worst stereotype Jamaican of all time, and some other douche with a beard as Michael Brody.The plot is even more ridiculous. A Great White Shark TAKES REVENGE ON A FAMILY. Didn't ANYONE watch Jaws 2, where the woman says \"Sharks don't take things personally\"? I would assume not. So, in a MAJOR SPOILER, Sean Brody is killed by a mysterious shark (while getting his limbs ripped off, losing bucket loads of blood) he is still very much conscious, and able to scream for his life with the energy of a 6 year old on crack. Last I checked, people who lose THAT much blood are either passed out or dead, not screaming and clinging on to things the whole time, pretending nothing happened.So, Ellen Brody decides to go on Vacation with her son Michael, and his wife and daughter... TO THE BAHAMAS. Yes, going from an island of the coast of whatever to another Island makes so much f****** sense. Somehow, a shark, mind you ones that cannot survive in the warm waters off the Caribbean, follows them... 5,000 miles in a span of 2 days. Sharks can only travel 30-ish MPH I thought, and if it takes a plane to fly from Eastern United States to Japan 18-20 hours, it will take a s**t load more time than 40 hours for a f****** shark to swim from the Northeastern United States to Carribena Islands.The Shark is also excruciatingly bad. While the first one at least looked SOMEWHAT real, this one looks like a condom painted gray and with eyes, a.k.a a piece of s*** rubber. Not only that, the thing barely has ANY movement, and in many scenes, the contraption DRAGGING the \"shark\" along the ocean floor is clearly visible. I guess filming in such light and warm waters wasn't such a great idea, was it? Also, you can even see the outer working material holding the shark together!!! The less said about how this thing could stand on its fin and roar like a lion... for 30 seconds, the better.I think I've said enough, as right now it's just pissing me off that they went from an All-time Classic in Jaws to this pile of garbage. I would rather watch The Cat in the Hat on a 72 hour loop than watch this crap again.",

And they were left with little.The first 10 or so minutes were alright with the first attack. You are thinking 'oh well its started well.' Now if you take out the next 50 minutes or so and cut straight to the banana boat scene then this film would kick ass.There is way too much talking in this film. People may argue that the first had a lot of talking in, but at least it was separated by some good shark bits. *Spoilers*The banana boat attack scene is truly wonderful, especially when the camera pans back from the view of the people on the boat and they watch as the women being eaten in the water. You can see her kicking and splashing like hell to try and break free but its not use. This attack is my favourite out of all the Jaws films.*End spoiler*Depending on what version of this you get you will be confronted with different endings. The one that makes the most sense is the one where Jake is killed because the shark doesn't explode, simply is spiked with the mast. But the other ending sucks and should be destroyed.The worst point of this film has easily got to be the shark. You would have thought after all of this time they could have made a better shark. At least 'Bruce' from the original didn't have a whopping big thing stuck in his chest. Again depending on what version you have, if you look carefully in the scene where the shark attacks and then chases Michael underwater.....you can see numerous shots of the shark......with its underbelly missing. You can see the insides of it where its been made with wood or whatever!!!! And then there is gigantic 'thing' hanging from it. This will have been the control panel and where the divers moved the shark along. But the camera work clearly shows this. No attempt to hide it is made and this completely undermines the whole film. The best part about the first was that you were guessing to what the shark looked like and only shown it towards the end. You didn't see any cameras or interior design in it. This shark has got to be the worst piece of construction ever. And its mouth is ridiculous. It's gums are gigantic and there is about a 3 inch gap between its gum and its lip. Why? We know that its because they needed to make modifications like this to make it move easier. But it is stupid.There is a big rumour about a possible fifth film. After the recent CGI success of Deep Blue Sea's sharks (even though the film sucked in many people's mind..not mine) please lets get a decent scary looking shark....that will make people afraid to go back into the water. If you had watched this and seen a real life shark, you would have probably laughed in its face and looked underneath it to see if had any wires or mechanics attached.This film had little hints of success in it. Michael Caine does his best to lift the film but even one liners such as 'its probably had a heart attack....humans are full of colesterols' don't save this film from the trash heap.Still better than 3 though.",

IT WASN'T THAT BAD!Okay it is nowhere near the cinematic highs of Jaws but is a decent 4th entry. I mean compare it to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace!Michael Caine makes a career defining appearance that achieved it's objective of paying for a new holiday home!I started by watching the trailer on You Tube. Any trailer that has a Blondie song 'One Way or Another' as the soundtrack is funny.That was how I approached the film. Funny.Not as a major comparative piece of the merits of the first film (which it does allude to with pictures and discussions mentioning Chief Brody (Roy Schieder).The main sticking point regarding this film is the thought of a Great White Shark travelling thousands of nautical miles to the warmer climes of Florida to just get revenge on the Brody family! The sheer thought is preposterous!The film was made super quick in 1986/87 in an era before CGI and it shows. The models of the shark are awful. A primary school student could do as good a job to be fair.The sequence at the start of the film where young (new) Chief Sean Brody is mauled is quite good and bodes well for the rest of the film.Going back to 1987. It was a great year for sequels of major franchises!

However the plot, the shark follows the family from Amity to the Bahamas, is ridiculous.  Michael Caine does not help in his supporting role, but he does try hard.  Don't feel bad for the actors in this movie, though.  They got to work in the Bahamas!!!  I would take any job that would put me in the Bahamas.  Still, the movie has the worst climax of the series and I have to deduct points for that.  5/10 and I am being very generous.

            "content": "I know it was a popular and almost mandatory statement to make around 20-25 years ago, but by now I guess we can all agree that \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is NOT the worst movie ever made! It certainly also isn't the worst shark movie ever made, and I know what I'm talking about because I watched a dud called \"Avalanche Sharks\" just a few days ago. I'll take this even one step further\u0085 Now that I've seen the version with a completely different but far more effective climax sequence \u2013 by coincidence, in fact \u2013 I bluntly daresay that \"Jaws: The Revenge\" isn't even the worst film in the franchise! Part four is better than the awful \"Jaws 3-D\" (1983) and as good as on par with the mediocre \"Jaws 2\" (1978). All this being said, however, please bear in mind that \"Jaws: The Revenge\" still remains an overall weak and silly film with three major defaults, namely (a) an incredibly absurd and preposterous plot, (b) irritating lead characters and (c) too much soap opera instead of shark action! Let's dive a little more into the details of these defaults, shall we? Director Joseph Sargent (\"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\", \"White Lightning\") and writer Michael De Guzman honestly expect us to believe that the fearsome Great White swam all the way down from Amity Island, Massachusetts towards the Bahama's \u2013 approximately 1.250 miles \u2013 just because he/she has a personal vendetta against that annoying Brody family? I usually don't have any issues suspending my disbelief, but this is at least a bridge or two too far. There's not a single likable character in this movie. Mother Ellen and son Michael seem preoccupied with a bizarre type of Oedipus complex, Mario Van Peebles talks with a disgusting fake accident and Michael Caine clearly just joined in order to spend a vacation at the Bahamas. I'm also aware that it's a terrible thing to say, because the poor kid died tragically less than a year after the release, but little Thea (Judith Barsi) is the most irritating kids in a horror movie ever! I secretly hoped the entire time that the shark would pop out and silence her character forever. But, altogether, the shark pops out too few times\u0085 There's too much soap opera guff in the script, like for example the aforementioned and bizarre relationship between mother and son Brody. She hangs around him more than his own wife does, while he gets childishly jealous when she meets a new man. The romantic interludes between Ellen and pilot Hoagie are also overlong and irrelevant. But still I can finalize this review without mentioning a few positive things! After all, anno 2017 there are so many retarded shark movies with exclusively digitized monsters, that it is automatically a relief to watch a good old-fashioned creature- feature with mechanical \u2013 and thus far more menacing \u2013 sharks. The death of Sean Brody, in Amity on Christmas Eve, is quite suspenseful and the infamous banana boat sequence also stands as one of the most impressive scenes of all four Jaws movies combined. (Additional spoiler warning as of here!) As mentioned in the first paragraph, I also must admit that I appreciate \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a lot more now thanks to the alternate ending. I always hated the fact that Mario Van Peebles' character inexplicable survived the attack and that yet another explosion killed the creature. For the first time in nearly 25 years, I now witnessed an ending where Jake remains dead and the shark meets a different but far more imaginative gruesome fate.",

Meanwhile, a huge killing machine in the ocean has its eyes set on her & family. Mario Van Peebles plays Michael's associate while Karen Young plays his wife. Michael Caine appears as a small plane pilot who seems to be interested in Ellen. There's been a critical feeding frenzy over this movie for decades, no pun intended. But it's really a decent nature-runs-amok creature feature laden by dubious filmmaking at the climax. There's a nice build-up and the material is taken seriously by the quality cast. Ellen's developing relationship with the amicable pilot is kinda heartwarming and both Guest & Van Peebles are effective male protagonists. Moreover, the switch to the Bahamas keeps things fresh after the first three movies. Of course, the idea that a vengeful great white shark follows the Brody family to the Bahamas is absurd, but we've all heard of dogs or cats following a family hundreds of miles. This is just an imaginative stretch and we find Michael seriously wondering if that ridiculous premise could be true when just such a creature shows up. So the dramatic build-up is effective, not great, but certainly effective. Unfortunately, there's almost zero female eye candy despite the resort setting and, like I said, the climatic scenes are awkwardly done. It's like the creators really needed to reshoot some scenes and add others, but they lacked the funds so they tried to force the footage they had to \"work\" in the editing room. The four Jaws movies detract in quality chronologically, but \"The Revenge\" is still worthwhile if you enjoyed the first three, just disregard the closing sequences. Beyond that glaring weakness, it's not even close to being as bad as people criticize. THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 29 minutes and was shot in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and Bahamas, with studio work done at Universal City, California. WRITER: Michael De Guzman. GRADE: C+",

Jaws: The Revenge is the fourth and final film in the Jaws franchise and was released in 1987. The film was directed by Joseph Sargent and stars Lorraine Gary, Lance Guest, and Michael Caine. The film still performed fairly decent at the box office but is the lowest performing film in the Jaws franchise. Now, this film was universally panned by critics and audiences. So much so that the film is often considered one of the worst films of all time.We are back in Amity as we see one of the Brody brothers, Sean, gets killed by a shark. Mourning the loss of her husband and son, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) moves to the Bahamas with her son Michael. But the shark wants revenge and this time, it is personal.I have seen this film a total of three times (as of the time that this review is being written) and I have come to the conclusion that this film is bad. The most recent viewing of this film, I decided to just turn my brain off and just let it all happen. It seems to work well that way I suppose but why should I do that? Even if I was to find any good, it seems insignificant because the negative aspects of this film are far, far, far, greater. Let me just put things into perspective here. Superman IV is worse than this film and if I could, would give it zero stars. This film, rightly deserves the one star rating that it will get from me. With Jaws: The Revenge, the only good thing I can truly say is that at least there are returning characters and the continuity seems to be picked right back up because it appears that this film may or may not ignore Jaws 3-D. But it is all still a big slap in the face to viewers who really enjoyed the first film. The film is highly absurd with it's plot that I am certain the film itself is aware of it's utter absurdness. The film likes to have our main character Ellen Brody to have sepia toned flashbacks of events that she never witnessed. Also, apparently there is an unexplained psychological connection between this shark and Ellen Brody. Apparently sharks are aware of the concept of revenge and somehow knows where a family is located by swimming from Amity to the Bahamas in a span of a couple of days. Those are just a few of a whole boatload (pun intended) of absurdities. If one is brave enough to watch this film, you will certainly find more. It is basically a given. The acting is not very good (though I can certainly say it is a minor improvement over the acting in Jaws 3-D). This film spends more time focusing on the characters and not really doing much with them. This film ends up being a sort of melodrama where a shark makes cameos. I feel bad for Michael Caine because this is one of those films that he worked on to just get a paycheck. Michael Caine just seems to be a really friendly person in general and I hate to see someone like him in a film like this. Gone is any sort of suspense. The music is not very good and as you may know, the original film relied on the music to effectively build suspense. This film's music for me, does not help build suspense and just feels off in key scenes. Lastly, the special effects are bad. People who know this film are aware of one infamous effect in this film so I just ask to see it for yourself if you are ever so curious. The shark itself oddly enough spends more time out of the water instead of in the water and looks even more fake.I struggle with whether or not calling Jaws: The Revenge the worst film of all time. It is certainly not the number one worst film, but it certainly is up there.",

That is a mother's natural way. But what's silly about it is Ellen becomes somehow psychically connected to Jaws and that is where I think this film fails. If she was just looked at as an odd woman then I would be fine with that but the psychic connection is silly.The movie is still watchable to me but just a bit, well, silly. Plus I find this movie a wee bit better than 3-D where this group of extra large great white sharks are suppose to live - not way off in Disneyland errr ummm Seaworld.6/10",

And i love the videogame too where you can kill the roaring shark just like in the film.

            "content": "Jaws: The Revenge starts in an extremely familiar way with plenty of underwater point-of-view shots as a man-eating Great White Shark swims around the coast of Amity once more to a slightly remixed version of John Williams classic theme from the original Jaws (1975) while the credits run. It's Christmas time in Amity & Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gray) is spending it with one of her sons Sean (Mitchell Anderson) who is now the Deputy of Amity after his Father & Ellen's Husband Martin (Roy Schneider from Jaws & Jaws 2 (1978)) died of a heart attack. The Amity police department receives a call about a drifting buoy stuck on a channel marker that needs to be cleared before the local fishermen come back, Deputy Brody gets the job. While out in the harbour in his boat Sean is suddenly attacked by a huge Great White Shark & killed. Ellen starts to believe that a Great White Shark has started to specifically target the Brody family as some form of revenge. Ellen's only other son Micheal (Lance Guest), his wife Carla (Karen Young) & their young daughter Thea (Judith Barsi) immediately come for the funeral & afterwards invites Ellen to come back with them to the Bahamas where Micheal is researching for a scientific doctorate with an annoying guy named Jake (Mario Van Peebles) about, yes you guessed it, underwater marine life. Ellen agrees & together they all set off for the Bahamas, sounds good to me. Once there Ellen begins to forget about the Great White Shark & becomes involved with a likable pilot named Hoagie (Micheal Caine, oh dear Micheal, oh dear). While out on their boat one day Micheal is attacked by a huge Great White Shark that at first glance does indeed seem to be following the Brody family around, Jake wants to study it & convinces Micheal it would be good for their research. Along with their two assistants Clarence (Cedric Scott) & William (Charles Bowleg) they set off to find the Shark & study it but this course of action is not without great danger as both Micheal & Jake soon discover...Produced & directed by Joseph Sargent Jaws: The Revenge is conceptually truly one of the worst films you could have the misfortune to watch. The script by Micheal De Guzman is simply awful, the plot holes & the just downright preposterous nature of what occurs really sink Jaws: The Revenge without a trace & good riddance too I say. The notion that a Great White Shark is hunting the Brody family down for revenge is a concept that Jaws: The Revenge never recovers from, in my opinion. How does it know a Brody family member when it comes across one? How did it know to travel from Amity in the United States all the way to the Bahamas? What relationship is this Great White Shark to the Brody family anyway? The Great White Sharks from Jaws & it's sequel Jaws 2 were both killed, as was the Great White Shark from Jaws 3 which Jaws: The Revenge seems to completely ignore, so what has this Shark got to do with anything & why does it have a particular grudge against the Brody family & not just people in general? Why don't the Brody family just stay out of the water, problem solved & this film wouldn't exist, it would have been a blessing for both them & us. As a film Jaws: The Revenge fails miserably too, Sharks do not roar or growl like lions. Sharks can't jump out of the water & hover in mid air for a few seconds, well I don't think they can anyway. The idea that Micheal can out-swim the Shark on at least one occasion under a clear stretch of water is also somewhat debatable. I realise there are two different endings to Jaws: The Revenge & I saw the one where Jake survives with only minor bleeding after being severely mauled by an enormous Great White Shark & even has time to crack some bad jokes & I hated it. The Sharks death is also strange, the boat hits it & it explodes, eh? Director Sargent fails to inject any tension, atmosphere or scares into the Shark attacks which are far too short, have no build up or impact. Jaws: The Revenge sucks out of the water too with boring human characters & relationships. Sargent also films it like a T.V. program with flat, bland & uninteresting photography although the Bahamas look fantastic, maybe that's why Caine agreed to be in this. The bit in the Amity police station was embarrassing as for some reason they have a large framed cheesy photo of Martin Brody hanging up for all to see! The special effects on the Shark are absolutely awful, the worst of the entire series & you can clearly see some of the machinery operating it. The Shark itself also looks fake, stiff, rubbery & just plain unconvincing in appearance. The only gore is when someone has their arm bitten off, the only good scene in the entire film. The acting is bad throughout, Micheal Caine overacts when he pops up on occasion & is the only likable character in the film but Micheal, what on Earth were you thinking? He must have needed the money pretty bad to appear in this or he needs a new agent. I thought that Mario Van Peebles character Jake was one of the most annoying I've ever seen with some of the worst dialogue I've heard in a while, oh & lets not forget his accent which is one of the best ever & not off putting at all is it?! Overall I hated Jaws: The Revenge, like most people who have had the misfortune to sit through it. Don't waste your time & Jaws: The Revenge is most definitely worthy of it's appearance in the IMDb's bottom 100 films. One to avoid.",

I am admittedly a huge Jaws fan and have watched the original movie over 40 times. I have seen Jaws The Revenge possibly 25 times. I know that it isn't a classic by any means, but the movie really is good.First off the acting. It wasn't terrible. Lorraine Gary did a terrific job as the lead. I felt sympathy for her and she does have some ability. Lance Guest as Michael was fantastic also. I am still waiting for him to get his break out role in Hollywood because I think he has potential. Mario Van Peebles brings some Bahamian humor, and it sheds some light onto the movie. And Michael Caine maybe isn't at his finest, but he is decent enough.The cinematography is just beautiful. It just makes me want to go to the Bahamas every time I watch. The music score is better than the original. It has a sort of mystical, on the edge feel to it. It's too bad Michael Small didn't get any recognition for it, and anyone would be hard pressed to find the soundtrack, even though it's one of the finest ever.Joseph Sargent does an okay job directing. I admit that it isn't anything special, but it's not trash. A lot of people have problems with the special effects and some of the things the shark does. Yes, the shark looks fake. That's a given when the film has such a low budget and the studio behind the picture isn't totally committed. There is one scene in particular that many have a problem with and that is when the shark is doing a so called stand on the water. It's obvious to me that the scene is in slow motion, and the shark is leaping from the water, which makes it appear to be standing on its fin. There are many aspects of the film also that are very authentic. An example is when the shark is attacking the boat and it's eyes roll back in its head, which is what a real great white would do.The ending is terrible and totally brings down the film. But once again, I come with my defense. In Michael De Guzman's original script, the ending was much different and rather exciting. As I alluded to earlier, budget constraints kept this film from producing an adequate ending. If you are interested, there are many links on the Net with the original script.Jaws the Revenge is a movie that I guess you have be a really big Jaws fan to enjoy. I know that it isn't perfect by any means and that it never will be considered to be a good movie by anybody other than the \"Jaws Junkies.\" But, for all the people that like to tear it apart and dissect its every mistake, remember that it's only a movie and not real life. 6 Stars",

Oh hell yes it does. Do I like the movie? Yes I do, for some strange reason.The whole premise of a shark carrying a grudge and chasing a family down to exact revenge on a family who killed two of its ancestors is completely ridiculous. And its not even explained. For that you have to read the novelisation. If the novel is to believed, this sharks mother is the shark which met its gruesome and electrifying end at the conclusion of JAWS 2. And get this, this new shark was born as its mother was dying. And its also hinted that the shark from the very first film was its father. Which in itself is a a stretch considering that shark died four years before the events of the second film. Then again everything about the movie and its novel is a stretch. I liked Lance Guest as Michael Brody. I thought he did a fairly good job. Michael Caine is great. Thats not too much to ask as he is great in everything. Lorraine Gary was also good. Whoever was her hair stylist on the film should have been fired however. That was almost as confusing as the plot itself.The movie did not take itself seriously at all. And it shows. We only get to see two death scenes in this one. Its a shark movie for christs sake. We get to see one death at the beginning of the movie, and the second (and last one) towards the end of the film. And thats it. The first death scene is pretty brutal. The best part of the movie is actually at the beginning on Amity Island.Despite all this, this is still not the worst movie I have seen. I do enjoy it. Its not the worst way to spend two hours of your time watching. I just wish that at the end of the day, we had more JAWS films. This pretty much killed the franchise dead in the water. It has been 31 years and there still hasnt been another one. Oh well, one day they may decide to do another sequel or a soft reboot",

I really think the Jaws films sort of took a nose dive after the second film. Though I still stand by my statement when I say that Jaws 3 was still my least favorite. One scene in this film shows very clearly that while they were in the plane, the effects were added in afterwards, meaning they probably weren't even in a plane at all and probably just the front half of one, with video shot from inside a real plane put in the background, though honestly, this was not the first time someone did that in a film.",

Mrs Brody starts knocking boots with Michael \"how did I get here?\" Cain and the shark eats some people. There are two things that make me mad about this flick.

I even saw Billy Crystal signing to Michael Caine in one of the Oscar nights: \"Why did you make Jaws 4\"?! Then finally, and very late I think, I had the chance to watch it..Yes, there are bad points. The shark doesn't look that scary. The storyline of it wasn't that thrilling. Since the shark was killed in the first, then its son was killed in the second; who was revenging in this one?!! Despite how Lorraine Gary is a good actress, she isn't an attractive lead. The reiteration of shots, and scene, from the original was boring and not in this one's sake. They killed the shark by the electricity; exactly like part 2 (!). There were 2 scenes where the shark attacks to turn out to be a dream. There were 2 identical tricks at the climax; where Michael Caine was considered dead, then he's alive, then the same with Mario Van Peebles after few minutes! By the way, I don't know how Peebles was alive at the end? The shark ate him already; so whether it vomited him after a short time, or he got himself released while the shark was exploding?; but even if, how he wasn't killed by the electric power that shocked the shark?? And yes, Caine's shirt was dry while he was getting out of the water!There are love scenes between the pilot and the mother. And maybe they added love scenes between the young son and his wife to compensate the oldness of first couple. But anyhow there is not enough focusing on Jaws. And that's the main big mistake that this movie did.Furthermore, it missed the substance. There is no serious shadow for anything. In fact, anything serious, or supposed to be, ended after the original. So it's a revenge story, and that's it. Sure being in TV-ish condition and less strong than its antecedent; part 3 as well, disappointed the fans very much at the moment.Nevertheless, that doesn't make this movie horrible. It wasn't a shoddy time. I didn't run into many idiot situations, or huge plot holes. In relation to the most hateful matters; I saw that the shark's roar is artistic touch more than scientific error. Strangely, in the super hit (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991), the evil Terminator gave off, during pain, a screaming hiss, and nobody - from the critics or the regular audience - complained though, despite knowing very well that it's a completely insensible machine! The traveling of the shark after the family from New England to the Bahamas wasn't firstly perceptible for me; however, that was to assure the ravenousness of the revenge anyway. This stuff is nearly in every movie, but maybe there was no remnant mercy this time.The special effects were decent. The performance was so good, especially every moment of Caine. I loved some of the dialogue, along with the telepathy factor between the mother and the shark. The directing did it nicely. It's well-edited and well-cinematographed. The locations looked cool. Well, it's not a monster. It's the exploitative sequel and in low tone, but watchable and better than part 2 also.I believe the budget limited everything, defining what character was wanted for this movie from the start. So the script provided simple and harmless 90 minutes to entertain. Clearly, the audience expected more. And with the aforementioned points, they couldn't care less. But I do care.It's not underrated. It's just being cursed more than it deserves.",

Seriously though, I'm surprised they didn't go the Mechagodzilla route and have the shark encased in armor.Along with the Brody bunch subplot being buried in the background, we also get to watch traditional Bahamian life of giant sea snails, welding wives, bad haircuts and watered down Jamaican accents.

Basically Ellen Brody (Razzie nominated Lorraine Gary) is still living in the island resort Amity with her now adult sons Michael (Lance Guest) and Sean (Mitchell Anderson), who left Sea World after the events of the previous film, and their father Martin died some time ago of a heart attack. Sean is now a deputy, and one night, as the Christmas season gets underway, he goes out to sea to solve a buoy problem, he is pulled into the water and gobbled up by a large great white shark. After hearing this, Ellen is obviously devastated and convinced that this shark has come back to terrorise the family, and Michael agrees that they should go away. So along with Michael's wife Carla (Karen Young) and five year old daughter Thea (Judith Barsi), the family go the house in the Bahamas on a plane piloted by Hoagie Newcombe (Razzie nominated Sir Michael Caine). While there Michael's Jamaican marine biologist studying friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) living next door go out to sea to do research, and soon enough the shark shows its face again. Unaware and trying to get over the recent tragedy, Ellen is finding herself falling for Hoagie's charms, he is obviously completely smitten. Secretly Michael and Jake are trying to keep track of the shark, using the special sea heart rate monitor and communication stuff, and soon enough their not telling anyone makes bad happen and the shark attacks on the beach. Carla is angry that Michael knew about the shark and didn't tell anyone, especially with Thea almost hurt, but he and Jake didn't want to upset Ellen. On a single-minded mission to teach the shark a lesson, Ellen takes Michael's boat to go out to sea and kill the monster, while Hoagie, Michael and Jake go after her in the plane. After surviving an attack on the landed plane, Hoagie joins the gang on the near sinking boat, and the plan is to confuse the shark, and then Ellen steers the boat to impale it, and the film ends happily. Also starring Lynn Whitfield as Louisa, Cedric Scott as Clarence, Charles Bowleg as William and Melvin Van Peebles as Mr. Witherspoon. It is obvious that the entire film relies on the rubber shark \"Bruce\", you never see a real life great white shark during the whole film stretch, you see plenty of bloody kills with it though. I know this was a terrible watch, but in honesty I found some of it laughably awful, i.e. funny when it isn't meant to be, that includes the casting of the likable Caine, but it is ultimately a silly action adventure sequel. It won the Razzie for Worst Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Worst Actor for \"Bruce the shark\", Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!",

I knew that I'd heard that roar someone else, and my wife kindly pointed out that it sounded just like Spot, the Munsters' fire-breathing pet dragon who lived under the stairs. Moreover, the shark in \"Jaws: The Revenge\" performed such amazing aquatic feats that certainly it must have been trying out for the Olympic synchronized swimming team.If it's terror and vengeance on the high seas you're thirsting for, take my advice: bypass this last installation in the Jaws saga and curl up with a reliable volume of Melville instead.",

            "content": "After enough horrible shark attacks to fill three movies, it seems that the shark has decided it's going to go after the descendents of the man who killed its ancestors all those years ago. They were its ancestors, right? Or is this the same shark that was killed in the older movies? That would certainly explain why it swims lolling back and forth like its going to roll belly-up. And here I thought that was just jaw-droppingly bad special effects. Normally this would be pretty hard to believe, but the humans in this movie are so monumentally stupid that it's not so bad that they decide to add some extra cognitive ability to the shark. Lorraine Gary plays Ellen Brody, who was the wife of Martin Brody in Jaws 1 and 2. She loses her husband and then her son to the shark, and swears that she'll never have another member of her family going in the water. She heads to the Bahamas and much fighting erupts between her and her son Michael because he happens to be a marine biologist. He loves his job and doesn't want to leave it, but his mother can't have him working on the water anymore.Clearly, it is quite understandable that she would not want members of her family going near the water, since they have been getting eaten by sharks for generations. Which begs the question, of course, of why she gladly allowed her granddaughter to go get towed around behind a boat with her friend. Oh, the girl's mother will be there, so it must be all okay. To make matters worse, after yet another Brody barely escaped being shark food, Ellen decides she better get onto a huge sailboat and go out in search of the shark alone, dressed in street clothes and completely unarmed. What did she plan to do? Scold the shark to death? Maybe smack it around for a little while with those gigantic, gigantic sunglasses? (spoilers) Mario van Peebles, who you might remember from such crapfests as Solo and Sweet Sweetback's Ridiculous Mess, here giving a performance with a ludicrous fake accent that is not even closely rivaled by Don Cheadle in Ocean's 11. The movie is packed with extreme close-ups of the shark, since the one they had to use as a prop was so badly made. This thing is not for a second convincing, and the ending is clearly no exception. It's bad enough that this is a shark that likes to hold its prey above the surface of the water while it eats, but asking us to believe that it will respond to electronic stimulation in the form of flashing lights by standing up vertically and waiting to be stabbed with a boat is entirely too much.Michael Caine does what he can with his terribly written role, which includes the beginnings of a romance with Ellen that disappears from the movie as fast as it was introduced. Maybe they figured people would forget about it anyway when he brilliantly decides to crash land his plane at sea when Ellen's boat is being attacked by the shark. In keeping with the logic with which the rest of the movie is completely devoid, the question that arises is this - why should Ellen sacrifice herself unarmed to the shark when three more people could also sacrifice themselves unarmed to the shark?",

And I do wish I left it alone, this has a reputation on the whole as being one of the worst sequels ever, and as far as I'm concerned that reputation is deserved. Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.Jaws:The Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? Jaws:The Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.The production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use. Don't get me started on Mario Van Peebles, him, his character and his comic lines are annoying and get old fast.Overall, a terrible film and one of the worst sequels I've seen and I have seen a lot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Thats it. If that shark quit dickin' around with the transportation, maybe he could've gotten to the actual eating of the people.

Gotta push through that. Pansy shark. Head blowing off from a wooden mast.What a bitch.)Yeah, i enjoyed laughing it up as the characters delivered their obviously intentionally hammed-up lines, and i was crying with laughter when the Jamaican gets eaten in slow motion.

She thought she had seen the last of the killer shark and wanted to get her innocence back. But she can't.She already had seen enough of that and decides to commandeer a schooner on the beach in the seashore to do what I thought to kill the shark, but later on, I realized that she wanted to be killed by the shark by moving the schooner far away from the beach area.Then, as Jake and Hoakie on a small plane rescue Ellen from suicide, Hoakie gets caught up with the shark as it eats the plane. Ellen thinks that Hoakie was killed by the shark--but they get second life when Hoakie goes up from the water, not bloodied at all, to get on the schooner. Jake and Hoakie go inside the boat and prepare what I call two \"shark shockers\". The things are almost like theatrical light devices you see in theaters. When activated, there is a high-pitched radio-like shriek followed by a flash-bang strobe, which in turn sets off a ultrasonic shock wave that can cripple a shark's heart in its vicinity.Then, the shark goes by surprise and eats up Jake. And you think Jake was going to be gone forever as blood explodes out of his body.Then the shark appears again and tries its attack on the schooner.Hoakie then re-activates the shark shocker as he goes to the bow of the boat, and was able to do two series of a \"high-pitched sounds followed by bangs\", then the shocker fails for 20 seconds. Then it works again...two more high sounds followed by bangs...The shark then reacts to the noises by standing more and more erect and becoming incensed.So this shark shocker is almost like a reverse of a pyrotechnic device that has a whistling sound before the explosion.There were two edited versions of that grand finale that put an end to the last killer shark in \"Jaws The Revenge\" as the bangs caused the shark to be so jolted by the shark shocker that it seemed to stand erect from the water like a dolphin--right into the path of a long, sharp broken front end of a wooden stick of the schooner that would pierce the shark's chest. One of them bleeps out the intercutting of the famous scenes from Jaws and Jaws II, including the famous Chief Brody shooting the shot that meant deadly doom to the last killer shark in the original Jaws, and a few of the scenes of the victims being killed by sharks in Jaws and Jaws II, and instead focused only on the wooden stick that pierces the shark...as the shark goes into the water in its pool of blood for the last time.The longer, unedited version had the intercutting put in. It was purposely done to make Jaws fans remember the killer shark as the main antagonist. Usually, this film technique would be bad for most movies that don't have sequels.And the big twist after the last shark dies was when Hoakie, Ellen and Michael saw Jake re-emerge from the water---alive! Ellen was sighing in relief. It seems like with all of that bad luck by the killer shark, some good can be surprising.",

After the death of Sean Brody from a shark attack, his mother Ellen (Lorraine Gary) goes with her other son Michael (Lance Guest) to the Bahamas where he works. Ellen has a fear that the Great White shark is stalking her family and sure enough soon there's a beast in the Bahamas.If you read enough reviews you'll come away thinking that JAWS: THE REVENGE is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, many people call it one of the worst films of the decade. Heck, the movie isn't nearly that bad and it's certainly much better than the third film in the series. I'm not going to try and pretend that the \"revenge\" of the shark isn't stupid because it really is. I'm sure they were originally meaning for this to be more psychological than anything else but even with the countless flaws I still find an entertaining \"B\" movie here.Roger Ebert's brilliant review points out the countless bad things in the movie but I still think there's quite a bit here to enjoy. For starters, I enjoyed the fact that they try to link this to (at least) the first two films in the series. Usually sequels head off with different and new characters but I always enjoyed that this series stuck with characters we're familiar with. The characters here are certainly ones we like and care for. Another thing that makes the film work is the beautiful underwater photography. Everything under the water looks terrific whether it's the attacks or the stuff dealing with the snails.Finally, I know there aren't too many actual attacks here but I enjoyed how much of the shark we get to see. Again, there are countless logical issues with the shark include how it seems to stand on its tail at times but at the same time I enjoy seeing it. People say the shark looks fake, which is true but then again, it is fake! Most movies hide the monsters for this very reason. If you show it too much people will see that it's fake. I enjoy that this movie didn't care if you knew it was fake and showed it.Gary isn't Oscar-worthy here but she does fine with the role. The same is true for Guest and Karen Young. Mario Van Peebles is fun in his role as are the rest of the supporting players including Michael Caine who skipped the Oscars to make this movie. Of course, there are two versions of the film out there and I prefer the original theatrical cut with the darker ending. Either way, JAWS: THE REVENGE wasn't meant to challenge the original film as it was just meant to be summer entertainment.",

Sean is killed by a shark (who supposedly set up the trap!!!) and his mother Ellen (Lorraine Gary) is positive the shark is targeting the whole family (!!!). Mike brings her to the Bahamas to recover...but the shark follows. Ellen knows this because she has a telepathic link with the shark (!!!!!).Yep, it's as stupid as it sounds. It starts out OK with Sean being attacked and killed--and Anderson was actually very good in his role-- but I'd like to know HOW the shark was able to set it all up. It moves to the Bahamas and falls apart swiftly. First off, two white sharks were killed in the first two movies. What is this one? A cousin of them? Second--Gary having a \"link\" to the shark is just absurd. Third--van Peebles (a good actor) has to use an annoying accent and if he had said \"mon\" one more time I would have screamed; fourth--Michael Caine pops up as \"Hoagie\"--he deserves better; fifth--the shark looks fake; sixth--watch for the scene where Caine is pulled out of the water...and is completely dry and seventh--the ending is annoying stupid and abrupt. Also Gary looks terrible--but it fits the movie I suppose.On the plus side--Guest and Caine are very good and the Bahamas location looks breath-taking. Still that doesn't excuse the ludicrous script and lousy acting from everyone else. And van Peebles \"comic\" lines are painfully unfunny.At least Caine and Guest have excuses for making this--Caine said it was for a free trip to the Bahamas and Guest said he did it to work with Caine. Still, this can safely be skipped completely. A sad ending to what started out as a great series. A 1.",

Yes, despite everything that happens to them, this stupid family just won't stay out of the water. And yes, you guessed it...the *same* shark that ate Sean tracks the Brodys to the Bahamas.The patently absurd script by Michael de Guzman is the worst flaw in this lackluster effort. The filmmakers actually go out of their way to show the shark as often as possible, which only serves to point up how obviously phony it is. There is, for the most part, a sufficient lack of tension, and the main reason why \"Jaws: The Revenge\" would be entertaining at all is because it's so laughable. Gary, sporting a none too flattering hairdo, does take herself pretty seriously, but the other cast members certainly don't look too happy to be there; Mario Van Peebles speaks in a ridiculously unconvincing accent, and Michael Caine offers his effortless charisma to a supporting role as a pilot who tries to romance Gary. It may not be a great role, but his presence in anything is always welcome. One worthy component is the music score by Michael Small; both adapting John Williams' legendary themes and adding his own compositions, he helps to make the scenes just a little bit better.

Then there was Jaws 2 \u0096 a pretty poor sequel geared mainly to make a little extra money on the back of its illustrious predecessor. Jaws 3 came later \u0096 a really poor second sequel with gimmicky 3-D effects and an unrelated plot. But they saved the ultimate howler for last. Jaws: The Revenge is the fourth and final film in the series\u0085. and it is absolutely terrible. I'm talking terrible in its most pure form here. Jaws: The Revenge is an all-time clunker that will be looked back on one day by collectors of bad movies with the kind of fondness reserved for Plan 9 From Outer Space and Santa Claus Conquers The Martians.It has been several years since Police Chief Brody killed two Great White Sharks off Amity Island (that would be the story lines from Jaws 1 and 2, if you don't already know). Brody is now dead, having spent the last years of his life haunted by memories of his shark experiences. His widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), still lives on Amity Island and her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) is now the local policeman, following proudly in Dad's footsteps. Unfortunately, one Christmas Sean is called out to remove some debris from the harbour and, while going unsuspectingly about his work, he is attacked and killed by another Great White Shark. Distraught, Ellen leaves Amity and heads off for the Bahamas, where her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest) works as a marine scientist. Michael assures his mother that there's nothing to fear as Great White Sharks wouldn't survive in the Bahamian waters as they don't like warm seas. But by now, Ellen is convinced that the shark has a vendetta against her family and will not stop until it has killed them all. Stupid as it sounds, her fears prove correct\u0085. the Great White pursues her to the Bahamas and sets about finishing off her and her son.Let me just recap that if you think you've read a misprint: \"The Great White pursues her to the Bahamas\u0085\". Yes, a shark actually somehow figures out that its intended victim has travelled a thousand miles to a different part of the world. Yes, the shark then swims down to this different part of the world to find this victim. And yes, the shark goes there even though it means leaving its normal habitat. One must assume that the film is suggesting that the Brody family have had so many run-ins with Great White Sharks that some kind of telekinetic link has formed between the two. Such a plot device is so stupid - so utterly, utterly ludicrous \u0096 that it is insulting to the viewers. However, we might still find the charity in our hearts to forgive the films its moronic plot if it were able to at least provide some decent shocks. But even here our hopes are struck down in tatters. There is no suspense whatsoever in Jaws: The Revenge. The shark attacks are minimal and when they finally arrive they are predictable, dull and half-hearted. Even in the finale, when it seems that Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles have been killed by the shark, both turn up alive and well shortly afterwards!! Jaws: The Revenge is truly, truly awful and what makes matters worse is the fact that it leaves such a bad impression that it almost makes one forget how good the original was.",

The movie is pretty cool at bits and some characters are down pretty good but to be quite honest I only watched it because it has Michael Caine in it. Overall I think this movie is very, very stupid but does not deserve the extremely low rating that it has. So watch this if you just want to watch an OK horror movie that is pretty damn stupid so I rate it 52%.",

I made each cut with glee, knowing the effect that it would have on the audience. I don't ever want to be involved in another picture like that.\" \u2013 Steven Spielberg \"Making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick.\" - Steven Spielberg (1978) Sooner or later all these slasher franchises become increasingly supernatural, their plots and audiences finally confronting the fact that their horrors were never remotely \"real\" in the first place. Were never anything more than an amusement park ride.We see this taking place in the \"Jaws\" franchise, in which the shark not only nonsensically reassembles itself after dying in each episode, but then develops a taste for vengeance. But not only is Jaws a supernatural and vengeful shark, but he is a master of genetics, detective work and propulsion as well, able to home in on whole family trees, pinpoint the offspring and spouses of those he hates and swim from New York to the Bahamas in less than three days.But that's not all, Jaws somehow manages to get larger and larger with each passing episode (he's resurrected in a bigger body each time?), is able to roar like a lion and even manages to kill the hero of the first \"Jaws\" film by provoking a heart attack. When did shark attacks start manifesting themselves as heart attacks? The heroes and victims of slasher films always behave in stupid ways, but this film exhibits some extraordinarily nonsensical behaviour. Our heroine is attacked by Jaws on the water (and loses her son to him) and so where does she decide to go on holiday? The Bahamas! Woman\u0085serious? An island? Not only that, once she's attacked on a boat by Jaws (how did he find her?) she then decides to go out on yet another boat. What the hell? Lady, stay inland! With the film so bad, it's nice to see actor Michael Caine not taking things too seriously. His dialogue is ridiculous - \"Sweet Jesus, we are heading straight for it!\" \u2013 but the guy delivers his lines with a camp quality which makes the film watchable today. In a sense, Caine's self mocking performance was ahead of the times, teasing an inept film that took itself far too seriously.7/10 \u2013 So bad it's funny. Incidentally, Spielberg all but disowned \"Jaws\", refusing to direct any sequels and denouncing the concept of franchises. Ironically he would later forge a career dependent on \"Jaws'\" gleeful machinations and carny tricks and himself direct numerous sequels.",

Guest and Young were more than noticably put together for sex appeal, and Peebles is just not that funny. The worst part is that terrible excuse for a monster that looks more as though it tries to be more tough than the previous sharks...not gonna happen! Whats with the stuck up nose, and the .5 mph swimming? Something needed to be relooked at before release. Michael Caine is also wasted as a good hearted Hoagie...sad stuff.

            "content": "Why people dislike this film is a mystery.  In view of the four \"Jaws\" films this film ranks number 3.  \"Jaws 3-D\" is the worst of the four.  The reason for this is due to \"Jaws 3-D\" being removed from the series (Mike and Sean Brody in Florida), whereas \"Jaws the Revenge\" begins where the first two were placed; Amity.  As such, the story is a continuation of the first two films; in the \"Jaws\" universe.  There is a bold move in the begining of the film (which must be seen in context of the other films to get its impact) involving an attack.  The acting during this attack is very well done.  It would be the actions and words of one in real life.Perhaps the reason people dispise this film as much as they do is due to the same reason they call the shark \"Jaws\".  The shark is not named Jaws; the title refers to a part of the shark.Another factor that places this film above \"Jaws 3-D\" is the music.  John Williams' score is used rather than mangled as it was in the third film. \"Jaws 3-D\" used an altered version, while \"Jaws the Revenge\" used Williams' music combined with Michael Small's score.Now, the film is not a strong film, yet it is a studio release and far better than many similar direct-to-video releases.  It is also better than the many similar plotted shark films released after the first film.The director of \"Jaws the Revenge\" stated on Entertianment Tonight, \"Jaws 3 was not that good.\"  The errors here are due to the fact that the screenplay was written in such a short time.  The first film had many drafts by Peter Benchley.  This is what makes the difference.  Something that is worked on over a period of time will be greater than something done as a first (or close to first) draft.\"Jaws the Revenge\" was a return to the series.

Lorraine Gary gave a laughable performance as Ellen Brody. Mario van Peebles gives a flop as Jake, the badly accented Jamaican (if thats what he was intending to try to be anyway!). Why is Michael Caine wasting his time here? The plot here is AWFUL! Although I did not see the entire movie, I know the entire plot pretty much and who dies, yada yada yada. Sean Brody, Chief martin Brody's youngest son, is killed first in this movie by a shark who is mad at the Brody's for killing its relatives in the first 2 movies. OK, but thats ridiculous. Why would the shark know to go for the Brody family? How does it even know who they are? Well, anyway, something about Sean being the new chief of Amity and he goes to check a buoy and is killed by the shark or something. Afterward, Ellen Brody goes to the Bahamas to see her other son, Michael. But the shark FOLLOWS HER! (Why not just make him FLY while they're at it?) Then he munches on a victim once he's there to show he \"means business\" or something. After a long and boring story or something, the main characters are on a boat in the water and the shark decides to attack. Jake puts something in its mouth and is then dragged into the ocean and munched on in a pool of blood and dragged under. However we later learned HE LIVED! WHAT THE HELL? Anyways, then Michael pulls out a fancy looking blinking strobe light and it makes a camera sound like its taking a picture and flashes like he IS taking a picture. The shark then jumps out of the water and replies with \"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWR\". At this point I was almost peeing my pants laughing. Then it shows clips of Martin from the final fight of the first movie and Ellen gets the stupid idea of driving the boat at the shark as if shes flying a missile into a deadly asteroid.(How is she seeing this? SHE WASN'T THERE IN THE FIRST MOVIE!) Then, by some miracle of god above, the spoke on the front of the ship hits the shark's fin right after Brody says \"Smile you son of a-\" In the flashback and the shark EXPLODES!! They then all jump off the boat for seemingly no reason and in the next scene the boat is GONE! NO trace of it anywhere! Then Jake turns up not-dead and blah blah blah OK I'm bored. This was the only movie I ever laughed at for being so horrible. Me and my brother make fun of it all the time. We always say \"when jaws flies\" rather than \"when pigs fly\". This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, my brother too. It ruins the Jaws movie(s) and stains the screen with its terrible plot and acting.

This would have built up suspense, if it weren't so unrealistic. Second, the shark only kills people in water. Smart move staying right next to a home surrounded by it, don't you think? Third, it somehow manages to get out of the water and bite off somebody's arm in the beginning. Fourth, the shark can't stay in the temperature of water it was in. It's cold-blooded, right? Fifth, was that there was a plot hole some where near the end. The sixth reason is that the shark came up to a dock or whatever, and started biting it, when the people were so far away.But, I didn't notice many of these reason when I first watched it. The thing I hated the most about Jaws: The Revenge is how interesting it was, and it wasn't very interesting.

Meanwhile Michael and best pal Jake (Mario Van Peebles) encounter the shark and attempt to study its behaviour, while pilot Hoagie (Michael Caine) tries to take Ellen's mind off all things finned and toothy by showing her the sights.Even ignoring the ridiculous notion of a shark somehow tracking Ellen's flight south for 1200 miles, Jaws IV is still a really poor film, with none of the great characterisation, atmosphere, suspense or sheer horror of the original (hell, it doesn't even come close to Jaws 3-D). Way too much time is spent on Ellen's romance with Hoagie, Michael's relationship with his wife Carla (Karen Young), and his friendship with Jake, when it really should be focusing on the shark.Even when it does get to the man-eating fish, the film is a complete let down, the rubbery shark completely unconvincing and not nearly deadly enough: only two people are killed throughout the entire film, Jake and Hoagie surviving their close encounters with the shark because it would be upsetting for the viewer if they died (they're too nice to get eaten). After plenty of silliness (including the shark pulling a plane under the surface of the ocean), the killer fish is stopped when Ellen rams it with the hull of Michael's boat, causing it and the vessel to explode.3/10, purely for the banana boat scene, which delivers the kind of human chomping action that there really should have been more of.",

Two movies, the SAME series and yet one is a classic and the first summer blockbuster and the other is, er, well...I'm not quite sure. We'll attempt to work out what it is together over the course of the next 300 words or so. Where to begin? No doubt the producers of 'The Revenge' asked themselves a similar question. What was left? Amity had endured two shark problems which is quite a lot for a small coastal town, especially a fictional one and they'd tried the Jaws in a different setting thing but it was curiously one-dimensional, even with 3-D glasses. You could of course just have another shark wander into the waters off Amity's shore but that night be construed as stretching credibility in some way so instead they came up with something quite wonderful and zoologically spurious - a vengeful shark with a murderous grudge against the Brody Family! Absolutely brilliant! Except that this is of course the most insanely misconceived idea in movie history. It's so bad that the only explanation for its passage to production is that someone pitched it as a kind of joke only to be horrified when the backers gave it a resounding thumbs up. Screenwriter Michael De Guzman who strangely hasn't subsequently become an A-list Hollywood scribe must have been too embarrassed to correct his bosses and so off he went and the result may be not just the worst sequel of all time but possibly one of the worst movies of all time. It does however introduce us to the most intelligent Shark in the history of the world. More cunning than his predecessors no.4 can set traps, learn the details of local law enforcement and manipulate certain people to come out on to the water, use its contacts on dry-land to find flight information on the Brody family and alter its own bio-chemistry to survive in warmer waters having swam some 3,000 miles to pursue the unlucky Brody brood. Is it any wonder Roy Scheider's character had a fatal heart attack? Teams of experts should be descending on the Bahamas to study the most unique animal that's ever lived but instead Michael Caine wants to kill it, which is baffling frankly. So the script isn't so much Quint as Jack Sparrow but at the least there's the taunt direction, the polished production values and the impeccable performances and if believe that you'll believe a Shark can roar.",

            "content": "Alas, Jaws: The Revenge; the fourth (count them) Jaws film and third successfully insignificant sequel to that of Spielberg's fantastic 1975 film Jaws but Jaws: The Revenge shouldn't just be compared to that of Jaws but also to that of any other film ever made in terms of quality. Jaws: The Revenge on its own is not even entertaining enough to be a second rate monster movie like an Anaconda (1997) or a Deep Rising (1998) or something along those lines.The things wrong with Jaws: The Revenge just spill off the screen like a barrel of grease down a water slide \u0096 anything that CAN go wrong in terms of logistics, what we're seeing or even the entire premise in the first place; DOES go wrong. Early on one character actually states about how the thought of the shark coming back for revenge on the Brody family is simply impossible \u0096 you know that and I know that \u0096 shark's don't know who's who on land so the fact one of the characters openly denies the fact this plot is even feasible on screen is mind blowingly backward film-making on its own merit.Another problem with this film is just its basic content which is split into two different pieces: dialogue on the land, sea or in the air and action scenes. A lot of the dialogue scenes at least to me just seemed pointless and to be honest, were rather dull. Examples of this are: the scene on the beach in the Caribbean as Ellen looks out to sea in a silly 'I know you're out there' sort of a way, the sea bed digging scene involving Michael Brody (Martin's son) as he looks for sea snails or something (we don't need to know what he does for a living) and the new year's eve party which serves as an overly long and tedious scene where the outcome is just Hoagie (Michael Caine) admitting some sort of a feeling for Ellen \u0096 this whole love side plot was very out of place and in the end, so pointless that the film could've chopped the whole new years eve part out.So many things backfire on so many levels, it's incredible. The fact we need to stomach this shark is actually out for 'revenge' against the Brody family and that it can swim from Amity to the Caribbean as well as pinpoint where it is the Brody family are now living; the fact the child is smart enough to recognise Ellen is called evasive by her mother and be able to imply it herself when Ellen is actually being evasive in front of her yet is not smart enough to know that you 'fly' a plane and not 'drive' it; the way in which Michael, Jake (van Peebles) and the rest of the characteristically non existent Caribbean crew are stupid enough to continue whatever pointless exercise it is they're doing even though the shark has struck \u0096 Jake even wants to go after it bringing back rehashed ideas Jaws 3-D had when the water-world employees wanted to capture it for their park.If there is any saving grace it's the finale where the shark and the characters do battle on a little boat that Ellen took out on her own \u0096 something I still can't fathom the logic behind. The film borrows so heavily from the first Jaws film that the flashbacks involved are practically retelling the way the first film concluded and as a result, it feels like we're watching the first film's climax! With continuity problems abound, an insane and impossible premise as well as a really comic atmosphere and rather bland film-making, Jaws: The Revenge is the slow and painful death of what was the Jaws franchise.",

            "content": "I've been reviewing so many movies that I like that I have forgotten the pleasure of bombing on a movie that sucks. Let me take some time now to skewer this stinking turd of a movie. Let me start out by saying that this film should never have been made. Jaws should never have spawned any sequels, it wasn't set up that way. This movie is a classic example of Hollywood milking a franchise until it's completely dead. Other reviewers have listed some of the inconsistencies that abound in the movie. I have to point out some whoppers though. First of all, the shark ROARS. Since sharks don't make any sound let alone let out a corny roar much sampled by other movies, TV shows and cartoons, I think it's pretty damn hokey. The shark is following the family. It's interesting that a fish can follow a family on land. This must be some kind of mutant alien shark or something. Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) has flashbacks to scenes that she never was there for. Maybe she's all seeing like God or something. A strobe light drives Jaws nuts. If only they had known this in the first film, Robert Shaw might still be with us. Michael Caine agreed to do this film. He must have been really, really, really drunk to agree to this. \"Jaws 4, that sounds like a right good film. Shark follows family to the Bahamas eh? A classic like this needs an Oscar winning chap like me. Where do I sign.\" The shark gets impaled by the bowspirt of Michael's sloop. Sorry to ruin the ending for you there but you see the shark was holding itself almost completely out of the water roaring because the strobe light was driving him crazy and Ellen smashed into him with the bowspirt and....it's just to much for a film fanatic to take. At least Mario Van Peebles got eaten. Depending on the version of the film you're seeing he could have lived. Let's just say that he died ok. It makes me feel better. Bottom Line: I could go on and on and on but you get the general idea. Jaws 4 sucks.",

Thus follows a tale of two lonely people trying to find company in their later years. Beautiful. True, the shark follows Lorraine Gary to the Bahamas, but so what? Have you never been followed by a wild animal on your way home from the supermarket? I was once followed by a cat.

Okay, I could, but I was never sure whether Michael Brody would live or die. I figured he'd live, but I thought they might kill him off to create some dramatic tension (killing off Sean wasn't enough). And eventually, they killed off Jake (though in some versions he lives) and I was kind of upset, I liked Jake and his reggae attitude.

            "content": "Any movie that asks you to accept the idea that a shark could harbor such deep-seeded feelings of resentment that it would follow the widow of a man who killed two other sharks a decade earlier to the Bahamas and take up residence in waters completely opposite its natural climate so that it could lie in wait and pick off the widow's family members one at a time, clearly has some problems right out of the gate.So, certainly Jaws: The Revenge is a dicey proposition. But the inherently ludicrous nature of the story isn't actually the reason why this film is so awful. The real problem here is that the impossible plot isn't the most idiotic thing about the film, and if pressed to identify the key element that makes this fourth entry in the Jaws saga such a wretched mistake, I'd have to say it's the 90 minutes between the opening and closing credits.While the unquestionably retarded logic that drives the core thesis of the plot pretty much ensures that this is going to be a mess of a film, we have to at least give Jaws: The Revenge credit for being consistent, because every other absurd element in the movie reaches that same grandiose level of stupidity. In fact, when the film climaxes with our central protagonist flashing back to events she wasn't there to witness when they happened, our shark being rammed with a boat and exploding on impact, and a character who was bitten in half minutes before returning to the surface alive and well, we have to conclude that Jaws: The Revenge couldn't possibly end in a fashion that more dutifully encompassed its vision.By the time we get there, we've already been forced to adapt to the idea of a shark with the ability to leap out of the ocean and balance atop the surface of the water on its tail-fins. We've hurdled through the presence of a beast massive enough to swallow a man whole, yet svelte enough to maneuver its way through the narrow corridors of a sunken ship. We've also seen an abundance of lingering close-ups that plainly show us that this revenge-seeking predator has mechanical joints and glides along the sea floor on a clearly-displayed track.But, somehow, all of this fits in the warped universe of this film, as does Ellen Brody's decision immediately after a shark attack to commandeer a boat and follow the beast out into the middle of the ocean with the apparent intention of literally feeding herself to it. When confronted with the rashness of her actions, even her response is perfectly tailored to the skewed thought process behind the film: \"I had to, there was nothing else to do\".Ellen is exactly right, too. In the world of Jaws: The Revenge, staying out of the water where the shark can't get you wouldn't make any sense at all.So, at least in terms of adherence to its idiocy-laden logic, we can safely say that Jaws: The Revenge is a profound achievement. And every time we think things couldn't get more absurd, our shark eats a plane or zeroes in on a Brody family member within a throng of swimmers, so J:TR spends a great deal of its running time outdoing itself.It's worth noting that even the NES video game released in conjunction with this worthless offering is widely considered by those in the know to be one of the crappiest and most utterly pointless games of all time. That certainly adds another layer to the notion of consistency I mentioned earlier, but since spawning an awful video game and effectively ending a franchise are less-than-admirable legacies, I don't think there's any way around stating the obvious fact that Jaws: The Revenge is one of the most dreadful films ever made.If you consider that a selling point, then spread your chum and dive on in. But, please don't consider anything I've written here a recommendation. I couldn't live with that on my conscience.",

In fact, the ushers should have given them a gas mask after he ripped their ticket.First if all, one doesn't have to be an oceanographer to know that sharks have a brain the size of a walnut. They aren't exactly brilliant animals. How one knows the members, travel plans, and history of a certain human family is beyond any reasonable explanation. Second of all, the thought of an aging Michael Caine and menopausal Lorraine Gary doing the nasty doesn't make for a romantic plot. It turns your stomach.And last, when in the history of the world has a shark ever stood up on water and roared? I think a plastic blow up shark would be more convincing than the extremely fake looking herky jerky robot shark they used. At least in Jaws III, we got to see a very hot young Lea Thompson in a bikini. But this joke of a movie had absolutely no redeeming qualities. Even Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary themselves commented on what an awful movie this was. In fact, i'll bet this movie is the reason she left movies altogether.

The shark kills Sean Brody first in the beginning in a spectacular, sinister sense, the shark jumps on to his boat and kills him.

If you tried to make a parody of the Jaws films, you couldn't make anything more effective than Jaws: The Revenge.Even after the debacle that was Jaws 3D, someone at Universal Pictures still thought they could wring a little more money out of the movie-going public by cranking out a fourth Jaws flick. I can only imagine how much hookers and blow was enjoyed before they came with that idea. I can only guess how much more hookers and blow had to be consumed for the studio to go through with it after Roy Scheider turned them down and they had to resort to bringing back Lorraine Gary, who played Scheider's wife in the first two films. The studio executives must have then had to spend a year at the Bunny Ranch and snort the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Columbia to decide that their killer shark movie should have a subplot of middle aged romance.Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) is still living in the island resort town of Amity, years after it was terrorized by two great white sharks. Her husband has been dead for several years after a heart attack (although the film takes great pains to remind us that Roy Scheider used to be the star of these movies), her younger son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) is a town deputy and her older boy Michael (Lance Guest) is a marine biologist living with his wife and young daughter in the Bahamas. After one of the most hilarious shark attacks you'll ever witness, Ellen decides to spend some time with Michael and his family. She flies down to the Bahamas\u0085and the shark follows her. Yes, that's right. They don't even bother for a moment to pretend this murderous fish has anything in common with an actual animal. They might as well have put a mask on it like Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees or Leatherface because that's exactly the sort of character it is.In the Bahamas, Ellen gets romanced by a local pilot named Hoagie (Michael Caine). This goes on despite the fact that Lorraine Gary looks almost old enough to be Michael Caine's mother. She was certainly long past her freshness date when she made this movie. Eventually, Ellen, Hoagie, Michael and Michael's black friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) all end up on a boat trying to kill the shark. That involves them turning a flashlight into some sort of \"shark taser\" and an explosion that defies every known law of physics.I can honestly say that if the shark had walked up out of the surf on its hind fins, put on a top hat and danced a jig on the beach\u0085that would have been only slightly more ridiculous than what happens in this film. Between Hoagie apparently being able to walk on water, a great white that looks faker than the Landshark from Saturday Night live and a Greg Evigan impersonator whose acting consists of a variety of blank stares, there are more unintentionally funny moments in this movie than you can shake a stick at.If you want to watch something good, stay far away from Jaws: The Revenge. If you and your friends want to watch a bad movie you can make fun of, it doesn't get any worse (and therefore better) than this.",

We're led to believe that he's just after the Brody family, but the makers can't kill of any more of them so they just have him eat a couple of nameless characters with zero lines. Exciting times. Michael Caine appears for some reason, and he really just enjoys his free vacation and pads out the running time by playing the standard love interest.

            "content": "\"Jaws: The Revenge\" (1987), all of you know how much I loathe \"Jaws 3-D\" (1983). That film has a poorly conceived and executed storyline with mediocre special effects. Now, that being said, \"Jaws 3-D\" is a masterpiece compared to this worthless and retarded pile of filth! \"Jaws: The Revenge\" has a predictable yet confusing story, the acting is a joke, the special effects are garbage, and the soundtrack is cliched! The plot is, Ellen Brody is now a widow since Martin Brody died of fear between the third and fourth film. Then, after Sean dies from a shark attack a grief-stricken Ellen and she her family move from Amity down to the Bahamas where a great white shark actually follows them, seeking revenge. Yeah, it's every bit as dumb as it sounds. I may not be a fan of any of the \"Jaws\" movies, but the fact that a Martin Brody is killed off due to fear of fighting a shark is insulting to his character. That's about as lazy as you can get! It was their excuse for him not appearing in this \"film\". Then, after Ellen tells her family to stay away from the water, they decide to move to the Bahamas and be completely surrounded by water. Finally, to top it all off, the shark actually follows them from the United States to the Bahamas! I honestly couldn't finish typing the storyline aspects without laughing. This is easily, one of the worst plots I have ever heard of in any movie. There is no suspense, no thrills and on top of that, the story is boring! What were the writers thinking?! How does the shark know about the Brody family? Why did they move to the Bahamas where there's even more water than at Amity?! All right, I think I've ranted on about the story long enough. As for the acting, it's nothing short of dreadful, from the whole cast. Not even Michael Caine could save it! Yep, somehow he got bribed to be in this \"film\". He's the only one who appears to be putting forth some sort of effort with his acting. That being said, effort doesn't always result in a good performance. This is, in my opinion, Michael Caine's worst acting performance out of all his movies! Don't even get me started on the name of his character. His name in this \"film\" is, Hoagie. I guess Sub, Grinder or Grilled Cheese were already taken? Come on, writers, you seriously couldn't come up with any other name? Like, I don't know, a human name? All of the acting is an embarrassment, but the worst performance comes from Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. Her acting is, without a shadow of a doubt, some of the worst I have ever seen in any movie, I'm not kidding. Why did she deserve her own starring role and \"film\"? No one cared for her character in the other films, including me! Fun-fact, Lorraine Gary was married to the President of Universal Studios at the time. Maybe that had something to do with it? On top of that, her character is so annoying and obnoxious, that I was rooting for the shark to eat her! Really, whenever I saw her precious face show up on the screen, I wanted someone to slap her! Granted, I'm sure that she's a nice person in real-life. But, when she's on the screen, she sucks! All of the acting is terrible. As for the special effects, I have a lot to say about them. However, I'll keep it short, sweet and to the point. They suck! There are very few that are adequate, but the majority of them are trash. The worst special effect is the shark itself. You can see the hinges in it's mouth, the harness holding it up in the air, etc. Plus, are you ready for this? Jaws roars in this \"movie\". I'm serious, the shark roars! Did elementary school students write this script? Although, to tell you the truth, I think children would've been better screenwriters than the wastes of life who vomited out the screenplay! Sharks don't roar, they cannot roar, it's impossible. They don't have lungs, or vocal cords. At this point, an unborn fetus is probably smarter than these incompetent writers! The special effects are nothing short of a joke. There are endless logical errors and flaws that are so bad, that you can't help but laugh. In one scene, Michael Caine's character swims in the water and as soon as he climbs into the boat, his shirt is completely dried. I'm not joking with you. When I first saw that part, I actually shouted: \"What?!\" But, I immediately burst into laughter just as fast as I yelled, if not faster! That's barely scratching the surface as far as how bad the special effects were. Some of them were so horrible, that I said to myself: \"was the budget $100.00, and $99 dollars went to the actors' salaries?!\" Finally, the soundtrack is a disaster. It's about as generic and cliched as you can get. There is nothing redeemable in this film score at all! Now, let's get to the only good element in this piece of garbage, the sets/locations. They give a good atmosphere, but that one positive is just simply outweighed by the negatives. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only thing that keeps it off my top ten worst movies list, is the fact that it makes me laugh and that it actually merits a one-star rating. That being said, for a film to qualify for my top ten worst movies list, it has to have zero stars. For some reason, this \"film\" manages to salvage one out of me. It's a miracle! Even then, I'm struggling to give this \"movie\" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. For the sake of your decency and intelligence, stay away from \"Jaws: The Revenge\". Thankfully, it's the last one in this apparent franchise. I'm actually embarrassed for it. Although, this film isn't even worth being embarrassed for at all! All of the \"Jaws\" movies are a total waste of time, especially \"Jaws: The Revenge\". Everyone involved with this worthless \"movie\" deserves to be eaten by sharks!",

This is quite the most monumentally massive mistake in movie history.  Even more so than Batman and Robin this film raises the question, 'which studio executive heard the pitch/script and said \"hmmm, sounds promising.  Here's a budget - go make me movie...\"?  Alan Smithee wouldn't put his name near this nonsense.This film was made 12 years after the original but has positively the worst effects of all 4 films. The Jaws 3 model was bad enough but this thing is barely a shark.  The fact that the shark has a gaping hole in it's belly means that the camera views are highly restricted and every time it jumps out of the water (which is nearly every appearance) it seems to pivot on its tail.  During the banana boat scene it looks as if its floating on the surface it's so far out of the water.For a 'scary' film, its death count is even worse than its predecessor (2 or 3 depending which ending is used).  Basically everything about this film sucks.  There's too much time wasted on land (there seems to be more emphasis on Ellen and Hogie's romance than on the shark), a ridiculous plot (Great White swimming to the Bahamas on personal vendetta) and, in the end, absolutely no feature worthy of anything other than ridicule.Give a ten year-old a video camera, a rubber shark and some ketchup and you'd have a more effective film than this.Maybe one day, a good script will be written and, with the aid of CG effects, the Jaws series will be put back on track.

A massive gaping hole with pullys and levers can be visibly seen as the 'shark' is chasing Brodys son into that ship wreck. Also, when did sharks grin?, the state of the sharks mouth is a joke, not to mention the roar of it, near the end of the film. I thought it was going to turn green and into the incredible hulk it roared that loud!.If they would have made this movie into a comedy then it would have been plausible and acceptable. Surely they cannot possibly expect a half intelligent audience to take this criminal film seriously??!!.Jaws for me, is only 2 films long. Jaws 2 was okay, mainly because Roy Scheider in it (not that I think much of him in Seaquest), the original Jaws was sheer genius.

How did a classic film end up a big rolling turd after a few years time? We all know JAWS: THE REVENGE is bad, but it's made worse by the fact that it was a spawn of a masterpiece. It's hard to mention Steven Spielberg's JAWS right next to this awful insult of a sequel, even for simple sequel-sake. This is just bad. I liked watching the original \"Jaws\", the first two sequels were fine, but when it comes to \"Jaws:The Revenge\", things change. This film is obviously trying so hard to be, not like to be, the original. The film tries to turn Lorraine Gary as a fighter, turning her into something like Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens\", which is simply silly. She obviously allowed herself to be sucked into the role, and she even tries hard to be Ellen Brody's Husband Martin, like saying his lines before shooting the shark(\"Smile you son of a B#@*h!!!\").The plot involves Ellen Brody's (Gary) attempt to avenge the death of her son's death. Fair enough, only director Joseph Sargent wants us to suck in as much lame-brained silliness and pass them up as willing suspension-of-disbelief. Just how much stupidity can this viewer take while watching this film? Well, once the real plot unfolds, I'm already losing track of the numerous moments of stupidity. I think I just found a film that reaches new heights of incompetence. Camp is probably one reason to see this, but as yourself: Do you really want to spend money of something you desperately want to laugh at but have to endure 89 minutes (that's long enough!) of tedium and insulting stupidity? Funny, in one scene, Mario van Peebles' (in a ridiculous Jamaican accent) says to some of the characters \"If mediocrity were fat, you'd all be whales!\". It's easy to say this to anyone involved in this mess. Rating: * out of 5.",

The film is so bad that this is my second time pummeling it with an angry review.Jaws: The Revenge is in fact the worst mainstream film I have ever seen, and I've seen 'em all. The cast is good enough but completely wasted by an awful script, bad direction, and anything else that can make a movie bad.The story centers around a great white shark apparently seeking the Brody family out to get some revenge for all the others which have died in these films. Maybe it's just some kind of ghost that continues to haunt the Brodys. Anyway the films begins with some murky shots of the bottom of the harbor near the coastal resort town where the family has always lived. The camera work is nothing special, then the audience is hit over the head with some laughably unintelligible narration about fate and whatnot.The first shark attack claims young Sean Brody who is following in his late father's footsteps as a local cop. The grief-stricken mother then heads to the Bahamas to spend the Xmas holiday with her other son Mike and his family. You see, great whites don't like warm water, and there has never been one seen there before! So naturally, our shark would not dream of turning up to spoil their Xmas, would it? The film is terrible in many, many ways. Let's look at some of them...The shark is poorly constructed, and looks very fake. At times you can see the mechanical devices holding it up and making it move. The shark seems to float very slowly and almost on its side most of the time. When angry, this shark even has the ability to roar and growl.The editing is seriously flawed, as well. In one scene, Mike Brody and his partner Jake (Mario Van Peebles) are talking about how \"the money is gone... the shark's gone... can't track it.\" That would be fine and dandy if only for the fact that these two clowns don't even see the shark for the first time until the NEXT SCENE!!!! What the hell?? How could have this slipped past the editor? The dialog is putrid and forced. Mario Van Peebles ad-libbed all of his lines, and it shows. Nobody has anything either important or interesting to say about anything. Even Michael Caine is hard to stand, and he has always been a very likable actor.The film has very little action. Huge gaps of dead spots buffer the shark attacks. There are flashback sequences had by people who were never there to see the incidents take place. The final showdown between Mrs. Brody and the shark is ridiculous from any standpoint. It defies logic, physics, and common sense all at once.What do you suppose the studio bosses at Universal said after they first saw this stinker? What could you say? This film has been criticized by everyone under the sun for the past 18 years, and deservedly so. It truly is the worst film ever released by a major studio.a very generous 1 of 10 stars from the Hound.",

If anyone had actually bothered to to watch Jaws 4 they'd soon realise that it's a great movie. Forget the first three movies in the series (I can't remember what they were called, but don't bother looking them up - it ain't worth it) this is the one to watch. It's got a great cast, a great script and a great villain. Some people complain about the low body-count in this movie. Well, I say if you want a high body-count go and hire out some 'dumb-a**' action movie like 'Cross of Iron'. Plenty of people die in that movie. What you get with Jaws 4 is a serious attempt to get inside the mind of Great White Shark. As it says on the movie's tag line \"This time... it's personal\". And it certainly is as the shark seeks to avenge the deaths of the other sharks in the previous movies by swimming off to the Bahamas in an attempt to eat Lorraine Gary (she's the wife of the guy in the first two movies). And who can blame it? Sharks always seem to be cast as bad guys in the movies (just look at all those James Bond movies - the bad guy always seems to keep killer sharks as pets). People seem to forget that the sharks were there first, no wonder they get a bit annoyed when idiots in boats keep chasing them, and anyhow they're only trying to get something to eat. How would you like it every time you went into Burger King for a Big Whopper you got some guy chasing you with a harpoon gun? Also, some people complain that the shark isn't very realistic, that its rubber teeth can sometimes be seen bending - well you'd hardly expect them to use a real shark!It's also great to see a major Hollywood movie with a 'mature' woman leading the cast, not some 20 year old bimbo with silicon implants.

First off, sharks cannot stand out of the water for two resons. 1-They're bodies are too bulky and huge and can't be able to balance themselves on their tales. 2-If they do manage to balance themselves, how will they be able to breathe? it's gills were flaring, but i didn't see any water on them!! also, the shark roars. this mistake was also made in jaws 3, but jaws 3 was actually better than this...thing. also, what i said earlier about the shark platform visible in some scenes? the other 3 jaws films succeeded in keeping the platform and machines invisible (except in jaws 3, but you can barely see it because its so dark underwater, and it's for an extremely short time). also, there's no jump scene. in the other 3, there were 3 corpses popping up here and there (ben gardner from J1, the boat driver from J2, and overman from J3). in JTR, there is no gross-scary-corpse part so that just takes away all the suspense. another thing JTR failed, was originality. If you think this film has an \"original story\", see the 1977 Jaws rip-off \"Orca\". On the film's poster it says \"Orca is the ONLY creature who seeks revenge other than man\" (i can't believe the creators of JTR missed that) and that the plot of JTR is strangely similar to ORCA, about a sea creature filled with rage and kills people for revenge. another bad thing about JTR is it's location. i'm not saying it shouldn't been set in the bahamas, the bahamas are beautiful, wonderful place. but great whites (as said in the film) can't survive in the water surrounding the bahamas. also, the wtaers in the bahamas are very clear blue. in the scene where they try to attach a transmitter to the shark, we see that the shark sticks out like a sore thumb in the ocean. when it dives underwater, and they lose sight of it, i just laughed. they're on a boat, in the middle of the most crystal clear ocean in the world. i don't know about you, but if a huge clunky, rubber, 27 foot long mechanical shark was in the water surrounding me, i'd notice it from a mile away. how the guys on the boat lose sight of it so easily and instantly, i have absolutely no idea. this brings me to m next point. the death/attack scenes. this film has the lowest death/attack count in the whole series. J1 hd about 5 deaths i think. J2 had i think 7. J3 had the highest if you count the 5 or 6 people killed by the shark plus the 7 or 8 people injured when the shark tore apart the dock. in JTR, there are only 3 attacks (two deaths, one injury). Sean's death was pretty awful. Aside from being graphic, when my sister saw that scene with me, she cried because she loved his \"adorable\" character from J1 and J2. also, the fact that this guy is getting torn apart by a giant shark while carolers from a distant away are singing \"hark the herald angels sing\", is pretty damn disturbing. the woman's death on the banana boat finally came just when the film had gotten really boring, so YAY!!!!! lol. when jake was attacked, i stood there with my mouth open, with a \"WTF\" expression on my face. i got over the fact that his character was attcked, but then at the very end, he turns out alive after getting his ass bitten off (literally). now THAT was dumb.now, as i'm saying this, i wonder, \"Why did the creators of 'Cruel Jaws' decide to rip off scenes from the other 3 films in the series and 2 other shark movies, but not JTR?\". well, let me answer my own question. that would mean featuring scenes from a BAD movie, and the creators of CJ did their best to make their movie \"good\"3/10",

            "review_title": "It Had Potential",
            "content": "This film really did have potential. I mean, (most of) the Brody family is back, it's set back in Amity Island (instead of boring Sea World), and we get to see some familiar locations. Unfortunately, the potential flies out the window right when you pop this movie into your DVD player. The film score is great, but that's all there is to worship about the movie.I may be wrong on this one, but wasn't Amity Island the Brody family's summer film? What the hell are they doing living in it in winter? Oh well, maybe since Martin's death, they couldn't pay for two homes. And speaking of Martin, I have to admit, the picture of him in the police office is pretty clever. He was supposed to be the one who dies, but Roy turned the role down. Instead, we get Sean, an interesting character, who dies. How sad. And is it me, or can you feel that Ellen is talking about Martin when she says \"It's waited all this time and it came for him\" and other phrases concerning Sean's death? Anyways, this movie has moments of bi-polar disorder, like when Ellen comes downstairs and is about to cook dinner, a bunch of pots fall and she's in an upset mood, saying \"I want you to get out of the water!\" and when Jake is yelling at Mike, he randomly stops and says \"Sorry about your brother, man!\" The shark was always a great part of the Jaws series. In Jaws 1 and 2, the shark was always memorable; in Jaws 3-D, the shark is pretty damn forgettable, since she's barely in it. It's all about boring humans. But in this one, it's shameless. It's pretty unforgettable, but for the wrong reason: The shark always has a \"DURRRRR!\" expression on it's face. It's always open-mouthed whenever you see it. I guess it has problems. Is that why it just randomly blows up when Ellen's boat hits it? Which reminds me, the ending fiasco is a real pain. The original ending was awesome! Sure, the shark looked like a dinosaur in some scenes and it looked a bit CGI in the scene where Ellen's boat tip hits it, but it still looked cool. It was spitting blood and everything. So after an unsettling feeling by the test audience, what happens? The ending is changed to a one that looks completely fake and makes no sense. So, Ellen's boat tip stabs the shark and it blows up for some reason. If you pause at the moment before it blows up, you can see how phony it looks. It looks like it was shot in a bathtub. The original ending at least made sense. The shark was stabbed and slowly fell down to it's death after the injury. In here, it's just... BOOM! When I was a kid I though the \"bathtub\" ending looked cool, but now... It looks stupid.The flashbacks are like the flashbacks in D3: The Mighty Ducks, it just makes us wish we were watching the movie (or in D3's case, MOVIES) in which the clips were taking from. That also doesn't make sense. Ellen is the one having these flashbacks, specifically the scenes where Martin shoots the shark and where he bonds with Sean at dinner. She clearly wasn't there in those scenes, but yet she's having them.The dream sequence is pretty non-sensical, as well. Ellen has a dream where she's swimming in the Bahamas, and the shark eats her. She doesn't like the water, so why would she be having a dream like this? Overall, this movie doesn't get me enraged like other things, but it's a mess. It's along the lines of \"so bad, it's good\" at moments.Also, great touch on not doing the clich\u00e9 of having the black guy die! That's a movie clich\u00e9 that EVERYONE likes to point out and say that every film does it.",

            "content": "After the death of her son, a woman decides to go visit her other son in the Bahamas where everyone comes to believe that the killer shark that killed their family has arrived and is stalking the area forcing them to race to stop it from attacking the rest of the community.There isn't a whole lot to like in this one. One of the few bright spots here is the action sequences when they occur as the few attacks the shark has aren't all that bad. The opening attack, where a victim is savagely ripped up and bitten savagely before being pulled underwater, is quite stunning and really shocking as it sets a great opening for the film, a later attack on a crowded beach where a victim is snagged off a marine toy in front of a small group of kids is really a great sequence for its cruelty and viciousness than anything else and the chase sequence in the sunken galleon does have an air of suspense as the shark does manage to constantly get at the victim after every possible method is used to put distance between them. Beyond these, though, there wasn't much to really like about it as there's a lot to really dislike in this one. The utmost flaw is that the film has the most unbelievable and nonsensical plots ever. Beyond the fact that sharks are incapable of living in the location chosen, the fact that it manages to get to there in a short amount of time is very hard to believe. There's also the family history of the sharks that the film brings up. Using the film, the shark is in fact the first film's third-cousin twice removed, and would have no motive to carry out the vengeance issued. That's assuming that the connection is correct, and if it isn't, then it's even more off in terms of where the shark falls in the family circle. The other big mistake in the film, beyond trying to figure out where the shark comes from, is the very slow pacing involved. Scenes drag on for far too long or have no reason to be there other than padding out the length. The biggest one is the family quarrels about being in the water, which was done nicely enough at first but then it happens twice in a half-hour span, and nothing comes of them since they all go into the water afterward. The struggling marriage scenes have no bearing on the plot and seem needlessly thrown in as well. There's a couple of other big problems in the film, the biggest of which is that the film feels really flat. In fact, the film flat out ignores all opportunities to create tension or fear. Just about all the attack scenes seem perfunctorily rushed and no effort is whatsoever made to make them frightening or even suspenseful. The ending, which should've been a big rousing affair to finish off the shark once and for all, plays out really flatly and the stupidity found within has a lot to do with that. Finally, the shark does look really fake, and there's really no scenes where it looks the slightest real. It simply floats along with minimal movement, being even more distracting. This really wasn't all that great.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children in danger.",

There is a line Lorraine Gary says that is just... Embarrassing. The entire film only contains 2 deaths, and the child in it is a little brat. PLUS, the ending has footage from the original of the sharks corpse floating to the bottom of the sea, Lorraine Gary has flashbacks, to things which she didn't even see, and if you look really closely at the banana boat scene, one of the sharks teeth falls out.The whole concept of a shark hunting a family is just pathetic! Plus, Mario van Peebles is attacked on screen, where he is ripped in half. He then appears at the end of the film, intact and swimming. Micheal Caine was swallowed by the shark, which you can briefly see, and then appears climbing onto the boat afterwards, complaining that the sharks breath smelled bad. The shark had previously eaten his airplane as well, which is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film.The B story, of the romance between Gary and Caine, is just pointless. Just another thing to laugh at. Many scenes in this film are just to bad to describe in writing. The plot, acting, script, special effects and everything is just terrible in this film.

            "content": "The tagline for Jaws: The Revenge states, \"this time it's personal.\" Really? I thought it was already personal after the second Jaws film was made and another shark attacked poor Amity Island again. If Jaws: The Revenge should be seen as anything personal it should be viewed as a personal attack - better yet, an assault - on a tremendous horror film that capitalized off of suspense and editing.I should've reviewed Jaws: The Revenge three weeks ago, but I've been putting it off because I've needed to review other films since then. And also, what can be said about Jaws: The Revenge that hasn't already been reiterated and restated time and time again? The film is a dreary slog that consists of waiting for suspense and atmosphere to build, waiting for the shark to appear, being disgusted when the shark finally does appear, and then finally being greeted with the end credits, concluding the mess we just witnessed. If you still want to classify the film as a horror film, even though I'd argue the series thrust its way into the action genre after the second film, then this is one of the worst, most redundant horror films I have yet to see.The film stars Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), whose husband Martin from previous films has died of a heart attack, which is believed to be brought on from the stress of dealing with sharks in Amity Island. Ellen now lives with her son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), who is sheriff deputy, and his fianc\u00e9e Tiffany (Mary Smith). Despite normality seemingly coming back for the gang, Ellen is convinced she is being followed by a great white shark when she vacations to the Bahamas to visit her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest). Now it's a matter of killing another shark before the shark can kill them.It's no wonder Steven Spielberg had no interest in pursuing a sequel to his original Jaws film and had no involvement with any of the three sequels. I imagine he recognized that a \"man vs. shark\" is only really fresh the first time around and that doing the same thing film after film would begin to become monotonous and painfully familiar. Even if Jaws: The Revenge wasn't plagued with such lame acting, terrible effects work, and collectively sterile camera-work, it would be hard to convince us that a fourth movie about a group of people going after another shark would be something worth paying to see.I recall when I watched Jaws 3 and got so tired with the characters and the plot that I just wanted to see a shark attack. Then I saw how painfully cheap and ridiculous the shark looked and kind of wanted more exposition. Then when I received more exposition I kind of just wanted the entire thing to end. The film was a muchness. Jaws: The Revenge suffers from the same form of monotony. One is constantly waiting for something to happen, then upon being rewarded, they wish they had never seen such a thing. For the purists who complain that the shark was clearly artificial in the original Jaws, I'd love to see how they responded to the shark in Jaws: The Revenge. I doubt there's enough howling in the world that could do justice to its artificiality and stunning banality.Thus concludes the Jaws franchise for now, thankfully. This is one of the few franchises I know of (next to the contemporary Paranormal Activity series) that failed to have another \"good\" film after its first film, which, in both series' cases, was phenomenal. One should take the hint how in conversations about the original Jaws, rarely do the sequel names come up, and by God is that for the better.Starring: Lorraine Gray, Mitchell Anderson, Mary Smith, and Lance Guest.

Therefore, she wages a personal revenge mission against the shark that has caused her and her family so much grief.The plot sounds pretty interesting but, to sum it all up in a few words, this movie is pretty boring. It is basically just mediocre drama with sub-par acting, showing the characters preaching endlessly about their livelihoods and plans on what to do with the shark, which appears in a few scenes only. There is really not much shark action or suspense until the climax of the film. Overall, it's the worst off of the Jaws movies and one you can definitely stay out of the water.Grade D--",

I admit that the shark's personal quest for revenge is stupid even for a fictional movie universe, but at least makes the movie work because Jaws 3 was a total mess, and in my opinion is even worse than Jaws 4.Now lets think about it. After the first movie (a true cinema masterpiece) everyone got the \"jawsmania\" and wanted to go to the theaters and watch the shark eating his victims. So the shark became the driving force behind the whole franchise (even they never planned to make it one). Bottom line we all watched the sequels for the shark and the shark delivers big time in this one. This movie its mindless fun and full of carnage.In conclusion. The producers wanted the Brodys in the film, (this family with sharks is like John Mclane with terrorists), they had the shark and they needed to find a way to make the Brodys get in a situation against a shark again.

The remaining son Michael (Lance Guest) is in Jamaica working in oceans and studying the effects of fish while seeing that his mother comes to visit after the death of Sean where that pesky shark keeps returning. Is there a radar on the Brody family? Other stars include Mario Van Peebles in a Jamaican accent and Michael Caine who skipped his Oscar win for Hannah and her Sisters to do this hunk of junk.AHHHHH!!!!",

Since when have sharks declared blood feuds on human beings??? This is uselessly dumb!!!!! It's a pity the Brodys didn't end up as shark chow at the end of this pastiche of Jaws, it could have earned a five out of ten then. Things I learned from this movie: -Sharks roar under certain circumstances. -Ellen Brody is a psycho. -Sharks declare blood feuds on people but still manage to spare the lives of their intended victims. -Minisubs are a favourite chew toy of sharks. Well, those who wrote and directed this movie are fit for the execution block for all I care. Both thumbs down for Jaws 4.",

I couldn't even tell that I was even watching a movie. It looked more like some never ending short film made by college students who don't know how to even use a camera. This is notable in being the lowest rated movie that Roger Ebert ever gave zero stars to and it's great that we all agree with him. From beginning to end, this film is an exercise in stupidity. The main character from the first film has died, so there's almost no one from the original film here. He died of a heart attack, but his wife thinks he died from fear about a shark. Wha...? Most of this film is dreadfully boring. There's a bunch of subplots that are never resolved but to be honest, I didn't even notice them. I may have had an even harder time keeping awake watching this movie than \"Jaws 3\" and that one literally put me to sleep. The special effects in this film are horrendous. The shark looks like some giant puppet plopping around in the ocean and it probably IS a giant puppet plopping around in the ocean. It's simply incredible how with all the new technology that comes in the past twelve years since the original, the effects get worse and worse. There's this one Jamaican guy who's so annoying.When I first heard that guy's voice, I seriously thought there was something wrong with the movie I was watching. I thought I had accidentally turned something else on because it seemed like I was listening to some stupid parody. The best part is that the guy does get attacked in the end. They even manage to mess that up, as he actually survives being bitten and dragged underwater! Brody's wife goes after the shark by driving a boat out by herself with no weapons. What?! How stupid is she?! Was she going to just wrestle the shark to death or something? Was she trying to commit suicide? She just says she did it because she had no other choice. Worst of all, at the end the shark roars and it gets stabbed and literally blows up! How does a shark just get impaled and then blows to pieces?! I had no idea at all what was going on in this stupid movie. Brody's wife has flashbacks to things she wasn't even at. In fact, no living person even witnessed those events! Well, it is kind of implied she has a psychic link with a shark, but that's even dumber! It's the worst sequel of any kind I've seen in my entire life! Zero stars",

Especially compared to the original jaws movies this one has a very unbelievably bad shark animatronic - which makes the whole movie feel trash-ish.And that's what makes it so hilariously fun.

I enjoyed it and I think, if you don't take this movie to serious, you might be entertained as well.I personally will never understand 1* rant-ratings.

Giving the wife the lead was a bad decision as her character is far more annoying than the original two films. She came across as too whiny and nagging. Michael Caine comes off across as obnoxious as well and the son Michael Isn't interesting either.The main lowlights include the climax with the shark roaring than exploding for little to no reason. Easily the worst looking and low budget shark of the series. Also very little shark kills in this film (only 2- the lowest deaths of the franchise).Featuring virtually no suspense and thrills, this film is just boring to get through. We also wonder as to how Jake survived in the end after being brutally attacked by the shark and taken underwater for a long period of time.

Another aspect of the film that was completely absurd lies within the idea that the great white is out seeking revenge against the Brody family. Lastly, it mentioned that Chief Martin Brody died earlier from a heart attack caused by a great white. What a joke! No wonder why this film is constantly bashed and often seen on worse movie lists. This loss falls squarely on the director and writers.The only redeeming aspect of The Revenge was scoring Michael Caine to be in it and bringing back Lorraine Gary but let's be honest the two of them couldn't save this film. Half the budget for this movie had to go to Caine or he just wanted to vacation in the Bahamas, maybe both. It was odd too seeing these two great cast members having to try and sell these really cheesy bad lines. The beginning of the film had a surprising twist, which is respectable since it took some stones to pull off but it was way too rushed. From there, a lot of flashback scenes were inserted, with laughable dialog and crappy shark effect scenes.

This scene is underrated in my opinion, but then the movie terribly falls and becomes a mess.The body count is minimal taking in account that these kind of movies need many death scenes.

All right so the series isn't really famous, so much as the first one is.  I haven't seen the middle two, but I don't think that would have helped me comprehend this weird movie any more than I did.Now I understand that movies, especially horror movies, call for the suspension of disbelief.  Skeptics could say I'm jaded, but I disagree.  I do suspend disbelief, to an extent.  When I see a \"shark cam\" shot, I accept that.  When the shark cam shot is above water and we cut to a wide shot of just the fin sticking out the water, my suspension disappears.  Unless Jaws is a super-shark, he has no eyes on his fin.Then again, maybe he is, given the laughable behavior of this crazed fish in the movie.  The essential plot is that this shark is still on the loose after all these year, even though I'm pretty sure it's been killed at the end of every single movie.  I guess it decided it was tired of being killed by the Brody family (Stars of all the \"Jaws\" movies), so he decided to start offing Brodies one by one.  The wife of Sheriff Brody, Ellen, is the only one who believes that the shark is out to get her and her family.  Well, you know, it sounds so logical that I cannot imagine why anyone would disbelieve her!I tried to understand this movie, I really did.  But it is so completely devoid of talent and thought that it's impossible not to laugh at its total stupidity.  The fin-cam is just the tip of the iceberg.  Jaws not only can spot his prey well out of the water, and even on boats, but he can nimbly hop out of the water, up to the deck to chomp on his victims before quickly returning to the depths.  And let's not forget Ellen's recollections of scenes she didn't even witness!  The shark is so intent on revenge, that he swims from Long Island to the Bahamas in about two days.  Someone sign that fish up for the Olympics!  And the climactic confrontation with the shark is edited so poorly, I honestly couldn't tell you what happened.  I know the characters lived, but as for Jaws, it's a big bloody mystery to me.While making the first \"Jaws,\" director Steven Spielberg realized his shark didn't look very realistic.  So he intentionally kept it out of sight through the whole movie.  I guess the director here had a little more confidence in his aquatic creation, because you see a lot of the shark in the movie.  Of course, the thing looks as fake as ever, maybe even more so now given the ridiculous situations he is forced into.  The worst detail about the fake shark?  It always, always, has its mouth gaping wide open.  I just felt like I was looking at something someone made in shop class.Again, this movie is dumb and goofy and ridiculous.  If you're looking for a scary movie like the first \"Jaws,\" rent the first \"Jaws.\"  Looking for that here will only cause you great pain and discomfort.  If you're watching to see how NOT to make a movie about a revenge obsessed shark, well, look no further.",

'Are you going to be okay?' he nods and she says..... 'Okay'. brill! Michael Caine has some of the best lines, such as the classic.. 'Oh Sh^t!' when his plane gets attacked by Jaws. and the profound 'There's a lot of ocean out there' The sound in this film is comical, at the end of the movie for some bizarre reason we have inaudible dialogue going on from Michael Caine as the plane pulls away. This technique is used elsewhere also when a car pulls in.. inaudible dialogue suddenly becoming clear as Caine opens the car door! Very stylish sound design! In my view this movie must have been made bad on purpose, maybe originally designed to be a comic take on Jaws that never quite made it. Anyway it makes for some light entertainment, and Caine looks very happy throughout with the pay cheque he undoubtedly picked up for the project!!",

The story is intriguing, and keeps you wondering what'll happen next. The character development of Ellen makes the movie more intense in that you'll never know what might happen to her in her escapade to slaughter the shark. I went into the movie thinking it would be maybe a 3 or 4, which is still better than Jaws 3-D, but WOOOOOO was I wrong! The quick flashback scenes really help tie the series together and the Bahamian setting gives this one a very unique look and feel, but still reminiscent of the original Jaws.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie, it's fun, it's unique, but it never loses sight of the past.",

            "content": "I'm laughing at people hating this movie, just because it's not realistic enough. The whole point of the Jaws franchise, is showing a shark that is monstrous, evil and completely out of this world. Like plague from the sea, set upon mankind. At least residents of the place that was picked on the map (?). Either way, I'm also of those who can't get past 3-D's atrocious special effects. I like it, it's one I used to watch a lot as a kid. Especially because it took place at Sea World. But \u00ab The Revenge \u00bb is set in the Bahamas... I mostly blame the chaotic production for its hard to overlook flaws. At one point in the movie, it was like nobody really cared about making a good product, and couldn't wait to finish the film. Saying it was rushed, is an understatement. As scary as the shark is, the way it was shot sometimes, shows how botched post-production was. The special effects during the showdown, were a real insult to viewers who paid good money to see the movie in the theaters, back in late 80s. So for that, I could've understood the outrage. But that's not why people hated the movie. Critics maybe, but not viewers. No, they couldn't get past the fact that the shark roared, when it did in the first movie too. And can't grasp the notion that it might explode, after being given several violent and repetitive jolts. As far as unrealistically big shark goes, it's not a big stretch. Making Helen the heroine, was a questionable choice, I get that. But it could've been worse. And we get to see a Michael closer to the one we left on Jaws 2. Michael Caine was decent, but his character was not very like able. But that was the point, wasn't it? The acting is good overall. And that dreamlike setting was perfect for the theme of the movie. Jaws 2 remains the best sequel, but Jaws (4) has its moments, and looks aesthetically better than Jaws 3-D.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I will say that no other Jaws film can live up to the original that remains in a class by itself. Also, Jaws has unfortunately created a destructive stigma regarding great white sharks; thus causing many people to be incapable of separating reality from fiction. Anyhow, let's begin.Was Jaws The Revenge a cinematic masterpiece, absolutely not. Arguably this movie was made following the epic failure of Jaws 3; no disrespect to Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. who carried the film.Nevertheless, (from a narrative standpoint) JTR followed the events of Jaws 2. It involved one of nature's fiercest predators having a bloodline of monster sharks and seeking vengeance against the Brodys nine years later.In addition to Ellen Brody suffering from depression following the death of the youngest son Sean, she decided to leave the horrors of the monster shark attack and Martin's death behind her, and traveled with her oldest son Michael Brody and his family to the Bahamas, only to be revisited by the beast again.Now, I can see what the writer was trying to do, but as a fan of Jaws and a shark lover, I have to say that this was a narrative failure. It can also be argued that the writer piggybacked of the plotline from the movie Orca. Killer Whales are intelligent creatures and only have one mate until death. Sharks on the other hand swim depths exceeding 4,000 feet whenever another shark's blood is spilled. If you don't believe it, Google it.There's no way a great white shark targets specific people as a means of vengeance. In my opinion, the movie would've been fine as Jaws 4 instead of Jaws The Revenge. In fact, it could've been a coincidence that the shark popped up in the Bahamas and began doing what it's known to do. At that point, Ellen, Michael, Jake, and Hoagie could've lured the beast away from the beach, and squared off out in the open aboard the Neptune Folly.To reiterate, this was a narrative failure, but the movie wasn't all that bad. In fact, I couldn't get enough of it growing up. With all the hiccups involved pre and post production, kudos to the late Joseph Sargent who gave it his all while directing this film. I really like the dramatic score by the late Michael Small which undoubtedly lived up to John Williams' original rendition to make it feel like a Jaws movie. I hope to find the theatrical version instead of the recently updated copy; you know, the one with the deleted scene of the backdrop falling apart. \ud83d\ude12\nLastly, if I had to choose between this film and Jaws 3, I'd gladly take that plane to the Bahamas with the Brodys and Hoagie as the pilot any day.",

The shark only manages to kill two people, much of the film being taken up by boring family-drama padding.  Michael Caine appears as a pilot, but he's completely wasted in an undemanding and thankless role.The plot of the film is just complete gibberish.  A shark somehow finds out that Mrs Brody, now a widow, and family are off to the Caribbean and follows them, managing to travel halfway across the world faster than an aeroplane. Mrs Brody has flashbacks of things she never even witnessed, the shark roars and seems to be floating above the water in one scene.  The older Brody brother escapes the shark underwater by letting the air out of his oxygen-tanks and rocketing up to the surface, somehow managing to avoid the bends.  And the last ten minutes or so of the film are packed to the gills with characters seemingly coming back to life after inescapable deaths. Surely this kind of thing only belongs in cartoons.Overall, Jaws 4 has a few memorable moments, is certainly better than that terrible 3-D outing, but it's just a might-have-been.",

Not so apparently when you see what this shark does to a banana boat looking more rubbery than a latex muppet and at a reported forty feet (!) giving way to the sheer absurd.Same old story rehashed with Lance Guest now assuming the lead role (taking up where Dennis Quaid left off in 3D), his long suffering mother (played by the original Lorraine Gary, though one wonders why she waited nine years to return for this abomination; perhaps it was the Caribbean location) hell-bent on taking revenge on the most recent predator to rip a limb off her diminishing family tree. And then there's Michael Caine playing a care-free helicopter pilot named \"Hoagie\". It's a toss-up between this turkey, \"The Swarm\", \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" or \"Blame it on Rio\" as to which is his all time worst effort. Caine dances in this film while romancing Gary, so it's a tight contest.Not an ounce of suspense or even mild shock is created by the director of \"The Taking of Pelham 123\", Joseph Sargent apparently absent from the director's chair for most of what ended up on the screen. Good to see younger and elder Van Peebles together, even if they have to share the ignominy of it being in this film.

Christmastime setting is the only novelty here, as Ellen Brody, mourning the death of her husband from parts I and II, loses one of her sons in another shark attack. Her other son convinces her to go to the Bahamas with him and his family, to take her mind off everything. That just makes her go even more crazy, and insist the shark has targeted her family as part of some ridiculous voodoo curse. Yes, you read that correctly: a voodoo curse is the reason why her family has been beset by shark attacks. Voodoo curses, revenge, drug smuggling, the return of a little-used supporting character having flashbacks to events that she was not present for, and a large plastic shark (which roars!) are all thrown into this mix, then Pur\u00e9ed in a blender, and thrown onto the screen, in one giant *splat*This is the only Jaws film not written by Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, whether that's good or bad is open to debate. There is a difference between fictional story writing, and insultingly stupid story writing. The makers of this thing thought that the audiences would accept, with perhaps only a minor suspension of disbelief, any story at all, no matter how ridiculous or implausible it is, as long as it has the \"Jaws\" name attached to it, and as long as someone from the original cast returned. It expects you to not only suspend your disbelief, but also requires you to be dimmer than a one- star restaurant, and pretend to not notice the footage from part I being reused at the ludicrous climax, and not question how characters miraculously return to life after being devoured by the shark. And repeatedly ignore the very obviously visible tracks the shark is \"swimming\" on. And ignore the support beams used to lift the shark into the air. And ignore an obvious miniature, which explodes for no apparent reason, and does so four times, for the film's quickly reshot alternative ending. And, is that duct tape I see, holding the body of the shark together? Supposedly a twenty million dollars budget for this, and that's the best they could do, duct tape and stock footage? The Jaws theme is used all throughout the opening credit scene, quickly ruins its effectiveness; it is a dramatic piece, not to be used during something as mundane as the opening credits, seemingly just to remind people they are watching a Jaws film. Michael Caine's potential love interest for Lorraine Gray's character is filler material; it goes absolutely nowhere, and his character could be edited out almost completely and his absence would not even be noticed. But the same could probably be said for Gary's character, also. Good shock of the boat suddenly being attacked from underneath in the opening shark attack, one of the few memorable shots. The rest of the film is only good for lots of unintentional laughs, which is why I rated it as highly as I did. If one doesn't include the three or four minutes long opening credits, and the four minutes long closing credits, the film's real run-time drops to about 81/ 82 minutes.",

            "content": "Let me just say that this film has to be one of the most terrible and embarrassing films I've ever seen in my entire life.The first \"Jaws\" movie that Steven Spielberg directed back in 1975 was an absolute classic, one which didn't even need any sequels to it whatsoever.Although \"Jaws 2\" was a surprisingly good sequel and \"Jaws 3-D\" was a fairly okay sequel, \"Jaws: The Revenge\", this is a movie that shouldn't even have been made if it was going to be this terrible.Though the beginning of the movie starts out pretty good, it slowly begins to go downhill right from there. I can see now why this film was nominated for so many Razzie awards because it most certainly deserved it.Let me begin shall I: the actors: To be honest I was so disgusted to see Lorraine Gary reprise her role as \"Ellen Brody\". Her being in a movie like this made me never want to see another movie with her again. And then we get introduced by even more lame actors. Mario Van Peebles comes into this movie as an annoying fast-talking Jamacian freak. This is where the film takes place in: The Bahamas. They make the shark swim in warm water. Wow! What an accomplishment! NOT! Lastly, Michael Caine also stars in this movie. Now, let me ask a personal question, how is it that a great actor such as Michael Caine be put in cast of a really terrible movie like this? This film just had a lot of unnecessary actors who each gave a very poor performance in this film. Plus, it says here that Lorraine Gary had won a \"Saturn Award\" or something for \"Best Supporting Actress\". I don't know how the hell she managed to win an award for something like that being in a movie like this.the dialogue: The worst scripted movie I've ever listened to in my life. This \"Jaws\" movie is the only one in the series that's rated \"PG-13\". My guess is that it's because the writer felt that he needed everyone using the word, \"s***\", scene after scene, so that it would help make the movie more interesting and good. It absolutely didn't! The action was so slow-paced and there was hardly any suspense built up in this movie whatsoever. The dialogue was just awful, in every sense of the word.the special effects: The special effects in this \"Jaws\" movie weren't at all better or even improved since the last \"Jaws\" films. So, you mean to tell me that they made the shark stand on its tail and roar like a lion? In case the filmmakers didn't know, sharks do not even roar and they most certainly cannot stand up on their tails on water. The special effects really were dull and it was so obvious to tell that the shark was fake.the acting: The acting in this movie is probably one of the worst I've ever heard. Really, it's absolutely atrocious. I was so sick of having to hear that little girl, whatever her name was, Thea, singing and screaming almost half the time throughout the whole movie. I can understand that they're all on vacation and she wants to have a fun time, but you know what, when it comes to \"Jaws\", right when people see the shark swimming around, they should have to scream as if they're really scared. This girl, every time when I heard her scream, it sounded like she was screaming in a very hysterical manner, and that was just sad to see.In conclusion, This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my entire life. Heck, on the back of the DVD case it says that it's a \"suspense-packed thriller\" and that it's \"the scariest 'Jaws' of them all\". Yeah? Well, that's complete bulls***! It is in no way, shape or form a suspense-packed thriller and it certainly isn't the scariest 'Jaws' movie of all time. It's just like any other regular B-monster movie with poor actors, poor script and poor special effects. Only this one doesn't even show the shark most of the time, there's barely any action in this movie whatsoever, and not a lot of people get killed or eaten in it too. I've finished counting up exactly how many people actually get eaten by Jaws in this movie. The result is 2. How disappointing is that? That in the other \"Jaws\" films, more people got eaten by Jaws and in this one, the filmmakers made only 2 people get eaten by Jaws in a 1 hour and 31 minute film? I don't even need to explain how terrifyingly bad this movie was any further. I think I've pretty much covered all of it up. If you're a fan of the first \"Jaws\" movie, I would recommend avoiding watching this poor excuse of a sequel. Trust me, it's totally not worth it.With all of that said, I give \"Jaws: The Revenge\", 1 star out of 10.",

I'm able to sit through the movie so I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10(or a D as passable). I can think of much more boring movies like the Sci-fi channels movies or the regular drudgery of Direct to video movies. Honestly, if you take Jaws out of the title, it isn't that bad.",

Were they really that desperate for a film that they financed something just because it has the name Jaws in it? Ohhh please. So let's get this right, this shark has a personal vendetta against the Brody's now? Why? Did they do anything to this particular shark? Did they kill it's mommy? And if they did, why is it waiting 12 years to extract revenge on the remaining Brody's? Why didn't it come get revenge right after the first one blew up and the second one fried? I guess it had problems communicating with the dead! Oh but wait, there is more stupidity. Ellen has flashbacks of things that she was never there for. I'm sorry, was there a fourth on the Orca? Did she help Brody fire that rifle? Was she on the grassy knoll?And, yes ladies and gentleman, there is more. When Sean dies she wants to get away from it all and she decides to go the Carribbean. Hey there's an idea. Let's got to the one place where the shark actually has a chance to be. How about a trip to Northern Ontario? Or even to Wisconsin. How about Russia, Germany, Lichtenstein! Anywhere that doesn't have a salted body of water around. I know if I ever got attacked by a bear in the mountains, the first place I would go to get away from it all would be to the mountains, but a little further south! Cause ya know, bears aren't in the mountains down south! Oh and of course the shark makes it to their place of destination before they do. So as one of the other reviewers in here alluded to, I too am going to travel Air Sharky next time I go somewhere. But you know what? I have a perfect script for the next Jaws and I was hoping that maybe they would be reading this review and they could contact me. The story would be simply that Ellen Brody, Michael ( her son ) Michael Caine and all the execs that made this film should be in the next one. Hell put in Joseph Sargeant as well. After all, he is the one that tried to make a film here. So you put all of them in the film and you make Bruce a real shark and we can just watch all of them get eaten, for real. I'm serious too. That would have more of a plot and a story ( a plausible one that is ) than this piece of !@##*. You can call me at 1-976-STUPID-MOVIE.It's kind of strange, Jaws is my favourite movie of all time. I also think it is the best made film ever. Jaws 4 has got to be the worst film ever made. What a pity. What a piece of #@^*!.",

This is what the punters have all paid to see: Michael Caine battling a shark with a personal vendetta.Disappointingly, though, Jaws: The Revenge's reputation as a superturkey of the highest calibre is a little overblown. Oh, sure, it is pretty bad, but it doesn't qualify for the premier league of celluloid waste that counts among its number Batman & Robin, Speed 2 and The Avengers.None of the Jaws sequels were really dire, of course, merely so-so and average. The first possessed possibly the most famous tagline in movie history, though was strangely unengrossing. The second suffered from the obvious demands of its 3-D format, though even that probably isn't as bad as you might remember.While obviously not containing the worth of the original mainstream classic, the sequels were popular enough to reach film No.4, which surprisingly features Michael Caine in only a relatively minor role. That said, an unusually tubby Caine does give sufficient enthusiasm to what you can tell he knows are third-rate lines. However, despite cod Jamaican accents, the general personal workings of the film are well in order, if not terribly exciting. The word of mouth that the shark is after revenge turns out to be a misnomer. The only person in the film who believes this to be the case is the traumatised Ellen Brody. Okay, there is one point where she seems to be psychic, but generally this is never as silly as it is purported to be. The frequency of the shark's attacks may seem farfetched, but never more than in any of the other films. In conclusion, the subtitle for the film seems to be based on Brody's desire for vengeance, rather than that of the \"overgrown goldfish\". The tagline - This time it's personal - has been similarly misunderstood.But the real sticking point comes with the shark itself. Whereas the others had used a dummy shark only sparingly, opting in the main for genuine shots of such a creature, here the action seems to be wholly taken over with an animatronic puppet. None of the movies in the series were able to do this successfully. The original and Jaws 3-D were acceptable if you squinted and applied a kind eye, whereas the second produced the odd wry smile. Here though, the dummy used looks shabby and plasticcy, several shots appearing to reveal zippers and wiring on the creature's casing. Let's be honest \u0096 even Stevie Wonder wouldn't be convinced that this was a real shark. It looks ridiculous, and every time it appears, which is often, the audience cannot help but roar their hysterical disbelief.Some hilarious goofs - including a waterlogged Caine emerging from the ocean with dry clothes, and a roaring shark - push the laughter factor even higher. Underdeveloped denouement drags this half-hearted film towards the end credits, a shambling mess with a joke as its major star, the actors only underwritten support. Yet, sadly, it's still not enough to make this a enjoyably bad film. Jaws: The Revenge suffers the ultimate indignity of merely being lacklustre. 4/10.",

At one point, it seems to stand on its tail and roar in the truly sad finale, in which Mrs. Brody sails out to sea alone to hunt down the shark, whom she believes has been intentionally killing members of her family. I am not making this up. And what in the hell was Michael Caine thinking? Judging from this film, I have to say that he must have been suffering temporary insanity.

But the next story would not use the elements from Jaws 3-D, instead they would use elements from the first Jaws. It would be interesting to see how the next story would be developed, by using elements from the first chapter which is still iconic. But the only actress to be back for the next Jaws movie, is Lorraine Gary who appeared in the first and the second one as Ellen Brody. The rest of the cast never appeared, in any previous Jaws movies neither did Michael Caine. In 1987 came out Jaws: The Revenge by Joseph Sargent, with Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine. The movie's plot: Martin Brody's widow Ellen Brody would confront a great white shark, that is seeking vengeance by following her to the Bahamas. As the movie is the last establishment of Jaws franchise, there have been expectations to surprise the audience and the critics. Instead it completely failed by becoming, a much worse Jaws chapter than the third one. The movie has a rhythm to be boring and predictable, which unnecessarily repeat some elements from Jaws by Steven Spielberg. The attack scenes didn't work to be suspenseful, but it worked to be predictable and laughable. The score by Michael Small tries to be as workable as possible, but it does not worked to be unforgettable. The editing has been elaborated to be acceptable but the using of some footage, from the first Jaws make the narration of the story pointless by distracting the audience. The cast like Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine did well with their performances, but it would entertain not as much as necessary to make a good movie.

A great white shark terrorizes the small Massachusetts resort town of Amity Island, so the local police chief, a marine biologist, and a fishermen go to hunt it down. Three years later a sequel came out. Jaws 2. Even though only three years had passed, the simple charm of the original was lost. It's not bad though, and it deserves your attention nonetheless. Five years after that Jaws 3-D came out. And boy was it awful, but not as much as this one, Jaws: The Revenge. The first problem I have with it doesn't even have to do with the movie itself. It's the title. Jaws: The Revenge. Why not just call it Jaws 4? I know that Jaws 3-D was a gimmicky name (to match the gimmicky special effects) but at least it had the number 3 in the title. I guess it's because Jaws 4 (or Jaws: The Revenge) ignores any plot elements that were introduced in the third film, but continuity honestly wouldn't be that bad. Anyhow, I'm kind of getting into the weeds here. Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) has just lost her son Sean Brody (Mitchell Anderson) to yet another shark attack. When her other son Michael Brody (Lance Guest) comes to visit her she tells him that this time, it was personal. The shark came and ate Brody because of some kind of blood oath against the Brody family. That means that apparently this shark is in the same family as the other two (or three depending on whether or not you count Jaws 3-D). Or maybe it's just the same shark that somehow keeps coming back to life. It honestly wouldn't be any less ridiculous than anything else this movie. After hearing the ridiculous theory of shark vengeance Michael decides to help his mother get over her fear of the water by taking her to the Bahamas, hoping that even more water will somehow help. Well surprise, the shark follows them from the United States to the Bahamas, solely to fulfill it's revenge mission. I'm not even going to attempt to explain the plot from there. You've got subplots like Michael's research on underwater snails turned research on the shark, Ellen's growing delusions as well as her relationship with Michael Caine, and some other stuff. At the end of the film the shark blows up once again, this time because the bow of the boat merely touches it. It shouldn't be hard to realize what's wrong with this movie. Aside from the clear delusion that sharks can choose a certain person like a serial killer, the shark half the time doesn't even go after the Brody family. There's a part where the shark goes after the granddaughter and then deliberately misses her and goes after someone else. The revenge aspect isn't even focused. The bottom line is this was finally the last Jaws movie, and thank goodness too, because they just kept getting worse and worse.",

She tries to unwind in the Bahamas with her oldest son Mike (Lance Guest) and a local pilot (Michael Caine).  But the shark won't let her, and it comes down to a climax that, while spectacular, is also totally ludicrous, and not helped by the device of Gary having flashbacks to events in the original film she was never even a witness to.The only thing that saves JAWS 4 from total disaster is the relatively good direction of Joseph Sargent (COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT) and Michael Small's score, which integrates John Williams' original theme.

Jaws 4 has seemed to be cast as the worst sequal because people think that the story line is so unbelievable. Come on which one of the films is completely believable. It showed potential at the beginning however did go down hill then after.On overall this film is not a good one but it is watchable and in fact if take lightly fairly enjoyable. Lets all forget about the rest of the films for a second and think if this was the first it would have been rated alot higher but since its predicessors were so incredibly good (with Jaws 3 the exception of course) which movie could live up to them. So look lets all give it a break and hope that one day a tremendous JAWS 5 comes out.",

            "content": "In my opinion, I've seen two good \"Jaws\" movies, then the third one came which I thought it was lame and now I've seen the fourth one that takes the cake for being the absolute worst of the franchise. Where do I begin? Well, I give you one thing about what is the plot of this ridiculous movie: another great white shark comes in, but instead of attacking more people it wants revenge on the Brody family. Wow! That has got to be one of the most stupidest and ridiculous plot that I've ever heard in my entire life. From the show \"Siskel & Ebert,\" Roger Ebert asks Gene Siskel what shark is this? A brother? Cousin? Maybe a distant relative? I don't know, but this revenge plot really makes no sense at all; its hardly a revenge movie because the movie keeps focusing more on some parts that we don't care, and while the shark only pops in whatever it feels like it. If its not focusing well with the revenge plot, then just call it \"Jaws 4.\" Also, the movie has many errors like Michael Caine's character coming out of the water while his clothes is almost completely dried off (thanks to Siskel & Ebert); then you have the shark that knows where to find our human characters from traveling the United States to the Bahamas, and last but not least, the shark roars like a lion. Sharks can't roar! Here is another thing, how is the shark able to reach out to eat people by what using its tippy toes or thinking that the shark is Mr. Fantastic? I blame how the movie was written by a bad screenplay. Even the movie is badly directed by Joseph Sargent who also produced this. Do both the writer and director know that sharks can't roar, and making some dumb excuses that the shark is being powered by the magic of voodoo? Heck, they made Martin Brody's wife Ellen who she thinks is Spider-Man that her sharky senses are tingling, and having these flashbacks that she wasn't there. Except where she witnesses her granddaughter who almost got killed by shark, and watching her late husband and son having their moment at a dinner table from the first one. The dialogue in this movie is really terrible like Ellen's granddaughter asking about Uncle Sean coming back. Uh...he just got killed by a shark, and can't come back. Such a dumb question that she brought up. I really hated that the filmmakers made Ellen saying that her husband died because not only a heart attack, but his fear of sharks. Lorraine Gary should've know about this, as she may have seen the first two movies where Martin was trying to be brave and strong to kill two sharks; she could've say no to say that line because its really insulting to Roy Scheider's character, but no the filmmakers want her to say it and just made everyone mad on how much we love Roy Scheider from the first two movies. I find it just as bad as making Megan Fox's character looked bad in the third \"Transformers\" movie, where she was replaced by a model that can't act. I don't think the acting in this movie is good, and I don't buy Lorraine Gary as the lead. She is no Ellen Ripley. By the way, I like to point out that when she sees her granddaughter almost get killed by a shark, she steals a boat or ship as we know that she can't take it anymore but here is one question: if she is going to steal a boat to find the shark, then why can't she bring any weapons to kill it? She is not well prepared onto anything. Heck, after Sean dies at the opening scene, some cop leaves Ellen her son's gun and never bothers to take it with her to kill the shark. Well Ellen, you are some hero. You know that? Some hero. I do feel sad for Michael Caine for doing this movie, and I think I'm sure that he regretted for not attending the Academy Awards for getting his Oscar on his work for \"Hannah and Her Sisters.\" I never saw that movie, but I wish if he hadn't done this movie. The shark itself looks good on the first three movies (while the third movie made the shark cheap looking in 3D), but here its so darn fake looking. The effects in this movie are just as bad as the effects from \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\" This movie won the Razzie for Worst Visual Effect over the fourth \"Superman\" movie. The movie has two ending that were filmed: one the shark gets stabbed, and two it explodes for no reason while Michael Brody's friend survives. I don't care which ending I like best, because they both have bad effects and they're both lame. I do kind of like Caine's reaction of the shark before his plane got taken down. Oh, I also don't care for the music either. You wish if this movie never existed, but hey this is the last one and I am glad that its all over. I think the \"Sharknado\" movies are more entertaining than the last two \"Jaws\" sequels. I give \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a flat out zero. But I have to give it a one, because giving it a zero won't make its 2.8 rating go down. I wish I could, but got to be respectful to IMDb's rating system; and seriously, this movie sucks!",

It is also insulting to the audiences who should feel cheated and insulted at this atrocity of a movie. It should be an insult to the many actors involved in this movie, including but not limited to Michael Caine and Mario Van Peebles. Steven Spielberg, director of the first movie should feel insulted considering the memory of the first movie has been stomped on but then again he has nothing to do with this movie. Peter Benchley, the author of the novel Jaws which the first movie was based on should also be insulted that this marked the death of the Jaws franchise. I should also add that this should be an insult to Universal Studios who was responsible for this, but then again somebody must have thought that this was going to be a good idea and like a cash cow, milk it for all its worth.Jaws: The Revenge focuses on the now widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary) and her family is being targeted by a great white shark following the horrific death of her deputy sheriff son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) who was killed while on duty. She becomes further paranoid when she believes a great white has followed her and her family to the Bahamas to target the remaining family members in revenge for the deaths of the sharks in the first two Jaws movies.The tagline sums up the entire movie: \"This time it's personal\". Are you serious?! Are audiences REALLY meant to believe a great white shark is going to seek revenge on family members with its own vendetta. I'm very puzzled here. Are audiences meant to get excited about a shark targeting members of the Brody clan after Martin Brody (Roy Schneider) killed the infamous great white shark from Jaws (1975) and Jaws 2 (1978)? This is completely wrong and surely someone must have piped up during the development of the forth movie and said \"This is going to be a bad idea\" unless they were told to shut up or they decided that this was going to be a good idea. Already this movie was going to have disaster written all over it.Jaws is a classic, the second movie was worth watching, and the third was an inferior movie which should have ended the Jaws series at number 3 (actually it was Jaws 3-D to capitalise of 3-D movies).Jaws: The Revenge should be left to sink to the bottom of the ocean.1/10.",

This is one of the most poorly made and badly acted movies that I have ever seen. Joseph Sargent, the director of this trash, is a good director. He has directed lots of movies mostly on TV. He's won a couple of Emmy Awards to prove it. But what on earth was he thinking of when he made this. Certainly he got no help with the script. The screenplay is by Michael de Guzman. How can somebody write a script that is so incredibly stupid? The plot of \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is such an incomprehensible mess that it has to be seen to be disbelieved. And what about that acting? It was a travesty to see Michael Caine in this movie and watch him waste his considerable talents. And what was even more shocking is that when he won his first Oscar for Woody Allen's \"Hannah and her Sisters\" in 1987, he didn't show up on Oscar night to collect his award; he was making \"Jaws: The Revenge\"! Lorraine Gary (reprising her role from the first two \"Jaws\" movies as Ellen Brody), Lance Guest, Karen Young, Mario Van Peebles, and (the late) Judith Barsi all give bad performances thanks largely in part to the hilariously awful script. An easily seen continuity error late in the film proves that \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is as ineptly made as everybody has said. Oh, I forgot to mention the performance of Bruce the Shark. Whoever made that shark didn't even try to make it look real and convincing. The shark ended up looking fake and unrealistic. And as a result, of all these bad qualities help to sink \"Jaws: The Revenge\". And boy does it sink fast. Only the beautiful Bahamas locations keep me from giving this catastrophe no stars.1/2* (out of four)",

Basically a shark has taken revenge on the Brody family. The film starts out with the youngest son of Chief Brody being munched by a new giant killer shark. Widowed Ellen Brody (widowed because no amount of cash could get Roy Scheider to star in this tosh!) believes the shark is out for revenge and will hunt them down each individually. WTF!!!\nNo amount of drugs or alcohol can prepare you for such a ridiculous idea for a film. To such ridiculousness that the shark follows them from Amity island to the Bahamas. Really?!!! Unlike the original Jaws and The Shallows this movie has absolutely no suspense. We are shown the shark way too early and oh my God does it look crap! It's so bad it makes the rubber shark from the original film look like they've stolen a real one from the Discovery Channel . The model shark in this terrible film looks like it was made out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9!\nThe studio must've spent the entire budget for this film on Michael Caines new house. Because surely that is the only reason why such a talented actor would sign on to star in this rubbish! \nGone are Michaels famous lines like \"You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off\" To be replaced by \"Oy get off my bloody leg!\" Actually I don't think that line was in the movie but if it was it would've made the movie two hundred percent better. \nThe climax of the film involves electrocuting the shark with a completely made up device. Every time the shark is shocked it growls like a tiger! Since when do sharks growl or make any noise for that matter? It's bad enough that they come up with the stupidest idea ever put on film but they have to make the shark growl too?\nSomebody kill me now is what I was thinking as I watched the climax of this, the worlds crappiest, most stupid, ridiculous movie! \nThis film is downright disrespectful to Spielberg's masterpiece.I'm sorry but the question needs to be asked people. Is the shark out for revenge for being killed in the previous three movies or is he just upset because the Brody family killed three of his buddies? Why not ask such a ridiculous question since the movie is totally ridiculous anyway? \nWe could forgive this film since now there's stupid films like Sharknado but at least they are not taking themselves seriously. They're meant to ridiculous. \nThe problem is whenever Jaws The Revenge is on TV I have to watch it because it's like a train wreck! I just can't take my eyes off it. More fool me.I hate Jaws the Revenge with a passion!\nHate is a strong word but I do.\nI hate it because it soils the brilliance of the original. I hate it because every time it's on TV I'm drawn to it like a rabbit to a trucks headlights. \nIf I could go back in time I would erase this movie from history.\nIt's the Jaws movie that killed the Jaws franchise and for that I can't forgive.\nIt's even worse than Jaws 3D and that's saying something.",

Shawn Brody( Matthew Mitchell) is now a Deputy on the police department. He's a very young deputy at age 20, and Ellen worries about him all the time. Sean's brother, Mike ( Lance Guest) is now a Marine Biologist in the Bahama's. The two love their work, but Sean still lives with mom until he gets married. One night Sean is on duty, when he gets ready to leave a call comes in. A piece of driftwood is stuck on a channel marker, which is a hazard. Sean goes out and checks it out, he starts to remove the wood off and his attacked by a shark. He is killed and his mother in complete shock.When she finds out a shark is responsible for the attack, she believes a shark is stalking the whole family. After Sean's funeral Mike and his wife tell mom to come to the Bahama's. She does on Mike's private plane, flying it is Hoagie( Michael Caine). Hoagie and Ellen develop a relationship why she is there, but she is still traumatized with bad dreams. She begs Mike to quit his job, but he shrugs it off.One day Mike and Jake( Mario Van Pebbles) are working together and are almost attacked by a great white shark. It attacked the boat, but what a scare for them. It is odd because great whites are not found down there. Mike tells Jake not to say a word about what happened to his mom. Ellen still continue to experience nightmares, then Mike begin's to have them.When Mike and Jake come up with a plan to track the shark, so they know the location at all times. The tracker monitor's the sharks heartbeat at all times. When Ellen takes another boat out to hunt the shark down. Hoagie finds out contacts Mike and Jake and now they look for her. When they find her they all get on the boat. They realize they lost the signal of the shark so the have to be cautious. Hoagie and Jake look for her by air, Mike by boat. When Hoagie lands the plane on the water, Hoagie gets out, but Jake is still in the plane. All of a sudden the shark appears and grabs Jake. Mike eventually kills the shark and 10 minutes later Jake comes out of the water. This ending is one of the worst, killing a higher ranking on the film. A plus in this movie that helped was the cameos of Mrs. Kitner( Lee Fierro) and Mrs. Taft( Fritzi Jane Courtney), both from the original Jaws.

Jaws 2 is decent, flawed but saved by Roy Scheider's great performance. Jaws 3 is... a funny movie.But then there is Jaws: The Revenge... Why was this movie made? Did they really expect us to go \"Oh, that makes sense\" at this egregious premise where a shark goes after Martin Brody's wife as revenge? This doesn't make any sense whatsoever considering the shark Martin hunted DIED. All right? He killed him. But considering we now have a shark which is so p'issed off it swims aaaaaaaaaall the way to Bahamas, that has to mean it's another shark who was informed one of his friends died and so now decides to go after Ellen. You might believe this is a joke, but it's not! This is what actually happened!The acting is a joke. Lorraine Gary is decent for what she has to work with, but the rest? Not very good. I don't remember much about Michael Caine's performance (he probably tried, but the stupid script didn't give anyone good material to work with), but Mario Van Peebles... He was absolutely ABYSMAL! What was up with the hokey slang he had to speak all the time? He sounded like an idiot! Whenever Jake (that's his character's name) was on screen, I was either laughing or shamefully shaking my head.The shark itself looks... weird. It's very different-looking from the other sharks, although mostly in a negative way. It has a really silly design and makes you chuckle rather than horrified. Christ, the shark in Jaws 3 was at least believable enough to make the movie work. What I'm seeing here though, is a plastic toy. Was the budget a nickel or something?The worst sin though is how boring this movie is. There are several scenes where you hear these knuckledhead characters \"talking\" with each other and you are just waiting for it to END already. If you are gonna develop characters...

How can anyone even consider making a Jaws movie where the shark actually targets the Brody family. I know movies can be a little far fetched, and I tend to be an open minded person, but there's a limit as to how far fetched a movie can be for me. I could understand Jaws 3 (Jaws 3D) being okay because it was the time of 3D movies. If it's a 3D movie, odds are it's not out to make history, and who cares if the plot sucks, the effects are enough to keep the crowd busy. But this movie didn't even have 3D. It had a crappy-looking shark that looks like a souped up pool toy and a plot that had more static than a kid walking across a carpet in socks in the winter time. I often say this movie is good for the elderly because some of the acting could stimulate even the most constipated old person. Michael Caine, as much as I respect him as an actor, was at his worst (probably because the movie sucked so he couldn't bring his best performance out in the first place). Mario Van Peebles...please...I've heard Asian people who've done better Jamaican accents than that. Lance Guest...not much to say...not his best performance (even though I've only seen him in Halloween II and this film). Lorraine Gary and Judith Barsi (God rest her soul) pulled it off. Judith was just as cute as could be, and I felt for her after the banana boat attack. Lorraine Gary seemed to be the only adult who actually gave a good performance.

Horrible horrible horrible, made even worse for the fact that it's made as a sequel to one of Hollywood's best.  I wish I could give it none out of ten. Thankfully, though, there was no Jaws five.  perhaps the shark could have eaten whatever studio heads greenlighted this load of manure.",

The direction is solid because the acting would have been all over the place without a solid direction from a director. I have seen bad movies and believe me, this is not An inept movie like hobgobblins or Cannibal terror, it is not in their category.

People, this is quite possibly the worst sequel, if not the worst film of all time. Why this movie was made is beyond me. What'd they think, that by having loving flashbacks of Roy Scheider, they'd gain some sympathy? This movie is an utter and complete failure and speaking as a big Jaws fan, a complete insult. I'd rather run across a busy freeway wearing a blindfold and cement shoes than watch this mush again. Nobody walks away unscathed from this one. Michael Caine must've slapped himself repeatedly while watching this. Or maybe they paid him well enough so that he didn't feel the need to. Lorraine Gary received a special Razzberry award for her performance if I'm not mistaken and rightfully so. She stunk in this movie, and to high heaven. The shark put in a better performance than her or anybody else in this hunk of junk. Mario Van Peebles succeeded in making me angrier than I ever had been. I'm actually sorry that his fate in the movie wasn't replicated in real life. Okay, I don't really mean that but somebody who's responsible for this splooge has to die by shark attack. Whoever greenlighted the whole \"great white shark attacks the Bahamas\" pitch, maybe. The pain!

            "content": "Seriously this is one of the goofiest films of all time. It was so bad it was kinda funny. I don't think you will ever see a more dramatic collapse in a franchise from the first to the fourth as you do in the Jaws movies. Jaws the original is possibly the greatest movie of all time, Jaws-the revenge is possibly the worst movie of all time, and has often been rated as such!What is semi bizarre is the fact that at the beginning, it actually starts off surprisingly- the opening attack and killing of Shaun Brody (the Brody's youngest boy) whom is now grown up as a cop in Amity replacing his now deceased dad whom apparently died of a shark motivated heart-attack?!? I certainly didn't see it coming.However, after the first two minutes this movie suddenly becomes goofy to the point of ridiculousness. The surviving Brody's decide to jet off to the Bahamas to get away from this vengeful shark...(lol) and this is when the goofyness sets in...this super shark swims basically at 400mph following the plane making the trek from New England to the Bahamas in time to catch its breathe and beat the plane there. INstead of a homing pigeon we have a homing Shark a remarkably personal one at that. Seriously this film was one step away from the shark climbing out of the water and getting a charter plane to the Bahamas.We are introduced to Mario Van Peebles character 'ya mon' and his sublime acting skills in tackling a Jamaican accent. If this film was to be taken semi serious, it would be mildly insulting in its stereotyping- but this is the least of this films worries. When we see the shark in action you can see the mechanics in its mouth at times and the the little railing it goes along on the sea bed!!! Seriously check it out! Remarkable. It also seems to possess selective speed, it swims from the US to the Caribbean faster than a plane but it can't catch Mario Van Peebles...go figure. We see a disastrously hammy effort from Michael Caine post Oscar winning perfroance, supposedly Mrs Brody's love interest. Incidentally she seemed to get over Martin Brody's heart-attack pretty fast. However i digress, there is one scene where Caine gets attacked in his plane in the water, and the rubber shark supposedly eats him. Yet INexplicably and quite hilariously Caine's character swims and climbs onto the boat everyone else is on where he's washed, completely dried, and without a mark on him. His reaction to being attacked by this shark 'wow, it had bad breathe' seriously, this is no joke...there is no way you can take this film seriously. The climax is...i laugh at the prospect of recollecting it...Mrs Brody now very annoyed that this vengeful shark, interrupted her holiday and transported Michael Caine unharmed; sets off to beat this shark once and for all...now apparently she was aided by this mechanical device which sent electric waves from the boat on to the shark because suddenly this fish begins to flap about on its fins hovering above water...and roaring...again i kid you not... i didn't know a shark could roar either. Anyway, this shark continued to hover above water long enough for Brody to cunningly control her boat and ram the shark with the bow of the boat and stab it in the belly to kill it.Despite the fact that is hugely implausible the best is yet to come, she has flash backs to things which happened in the original which she wasn't there to witness...yet she steers the boat right into its chest and the shark blows up...seriously it blows up! But the realms of implausability had already been tested by the safe transportation of Michael Caine after being eaten; swimming faster than a jet plane; having a personal agenda against a human family; plus it takes Mario van Peebles by the head, but don't worry he survives in the end as well...so i guess a roaring shark hovering above water and blowing up from being stabbed is not any more unlikely than the atrocities committed by the director in this film! A truly awful film, but enjoyable if you want to laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole movie.",

That being said, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. While the idea is silly, the actual story of some of the Brody family being scared that a shark is targeting them is preformed pretty well. The action scenes with the shark are so much better than the third movie and are not far behind the second. I enjoyed all the nods to the first movie and felt it was just enough without dwelling on the past. The ending is alright until you get to the moment of the shark's demise which really doesn't make sense. From what I understand the original ending made a lot more sense even though it's still far fetched.I realize that few will probably agree with my opinion but, I don't think this movie deserves the low rating it has. It is no classic but, it's a decent enough movie if you get past cringing a little whenever the \"the shark is out to get us\" statements are made. I think it still ends the franchise a good note and I'm personally glad the it didn't end with train wreck that was Jaws 3.

In 1983, it was Jaws 3-D, it was a guilty pleasure. Together these 3 would have made an uneven but decent trilogy. But no Hollywood is greedy and came out with Jaws 4. This film is one of the worst films of all time. Even the worst Halloween sequel (Part 6) cant compare to this.On the trivia area it is reported that the events in Jaws 3-D were ignored during the making of this film. I heard the filmmakers hated Jaws 3-D and ignored everything that happened. Jaws 3-D was not a great film at all, but most people would have to admit its better than this ridiculous piece of crap.The Shark in the films are not realistic at all. The model in the first was barely passable. However, Spielberg used the less is more technique to achieve suspense. Not much of the shark was shown but there was a great deal of Suspense. The shark is shown way too much here and it is fake looking as hell. Joseph Sargents does a terrible job at achieving suspense, ok there is no suspense. He is not Spielberg.The acting is horrible. Lorraine Gary overacts all the time. Michael Caine is wasted. Why is he in this film anyway? Mario Van Peebles is annoying.The way the Shark is killed is ridiculous and doesnt make sense. There is no way Lorraine Gary could take on the Shark by herself. She is not Sigourney Weaver, she is an old hag. The movie is consistently lame, everything scene is drenched with lameness. The flashbacks of the first movie have no purpose, just to block off the fact that the screenwriter had no idea how to kill off the Shark. I am surprised there is no Jaws 5. The Shark is supposed to be invincible and yet it looks like if you kick him he'll die.Yet for all that is terrrible about Jaws 4, the Ocean is beautiful looking. It looks great to swim in. Who cares about the Shark, check out the Ocean. The Carribean is beautiful. For those images I was able to give Jaws 4 half a star instead of zero.",

Because it's the biggest piece of crap excuse for a film that I have ever seen!!! The whole plot (???) is contrived, the shark looks more fake than in the prequels, and as if SEA WORLD weren't an unlikely enough target (#3) now the target is anyone in the Brody family!!! This is NOT Jaws!!!Jaws stands as one of the most memorable and excellent films of all time. And Jaws 2 is a great sequel. I refuse to count the last two films as part of the series at all. Actually, I like to pretend they were never made. Here are some things I really hated about this film:1) Horrible directing-  No one's gonna top Spielberg's astounding direction in the first film, but Jeannot Szwarc did a great job following it with Jaws 2. This film has some really awkward cuts, and it just doesn't feel right. The style is not as tense.2) Fake attack scenes-  In Jaws 1 and 2, attacks are barely shown if at all. There are sounds, splashing, and some blood. But in this film, we see graphic death scenes. Not only that, but the shark leaps from the water and somehow suspends itself in the air???3) Shark looks MORE fake-  You'd think that the animatronics would have improved from the earlier versions. Wrong. The shark in this version looks different and frankly much more unrealistic than in 1 and 2. It also GROWLS... Come on people! I am still baffled by how the effects of Jaws 1 and 2 were achieved, but this film just makes me laugh.4) Plot???-  I've already mentioned this, so I'll be brief... Uhhhh,no. Just, no.5) The Music Sucked-  Jaws 1 and 2 were both accompanied by the wonderful compositions of John Williams. Not only is the Jaws theme memorable, but the other music in the soundtrack fits in perfectly with the action. You don't see much, but you can certainly hear the tension in the music, which is scarier. This movie barely even uses the main theme, and when it does it's in the wrong spots. Sometimes in this film, there is no music at all when there should be some. And the music there is is all cliche and overdone.6) Characters-  Even without the incredibly stereotypical African-Americans in this movie, the annoying child, and the really unfunny Brit, this film has no sympathetic characters. I could really care less about the life of Ellen Brody. I could care less about Michael and his conk research. And frankly, if I were anyone in this movie I'd want to be Sean so I could get out of there as quickly as possible so as to avoid the rest of this horrible movie. Basically, this movie has the same character problem that Jaws 3-D had- No Roy Scheider. Come ON! Once the Chief was no longer in the picture, the story ends. Martin is Jaws, Jaws is Martin. Who cares about everyone else???And last but not least....7) Atrocious Climax/Ending-  I don't even understand how this shark is supposed to have died. It went insane??? What is THAT??? He also got poked by a stick??? It was so incredibly stupid that I was just completely lost. And as if you couldn't tell how bad this ending was, just look to the fact that they had to rely on the climax of the FIRST film to make this one work! Actually, I'm glad they put this part in there. The best part of this movie isn't even from this movie. It's Roy Scheider's famous end scene from the first Jaws movie. Imagine that.All in all, I would not recommend this film to anyone, ESPECIALLY not to anyone who's a fan of the true Jaws films. Stick with 1 and 2.",

            "content": "...well, a whole hell of lot of fun!Jaws The Revenge............oh boy. Now here's a movie that's reputation has ALWAYS been in the toilet - and deservedly so. Jaws The Revenge is simply an insanely ridiculous and poorly made movie. THOUGH I must confess that it's something of a guilty pleasure of mine and I think you'll agree that most of it's entertainment value comes from the sheer implausibility of it's plot and the ridiculous scenarios that follow. Also take notice at just how utterly fake the shark looks this time around. Pitiful.Let's get the few good aspects of this movie out of the way early and since there are so few positive qualities it won't take long. The best thing about \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is obviously it's beautiful location photography, which takes place almost entirely in the Bahama's. No two ways about it, down in those tropical climes it's pretty much a paradise on Earth. Another excellent part of this movie is the sheer effectiveness of it's opening scene, it was simply staged in such a way (filmed at night), that it possesses a palpably evil and nasty edge - unlike all other action/attack scenes found later in the movie (this is in direct contrast to \"The Banana-Boat Sequence\", which makes up for it with it's enormous comedic value). So... Bahama's and opening chomp scene and that pretty much expends my legitimate compliments of the film. Because if you watch this movie I think you'll agree, that it's glaringly self-evident - Jaws: The Revenge is an incredibly bad movie.But I absolutely must say that this terrible movie is NOT without its charms and it has many and almost always for the wrong reasons, too. Now here comes the fun part, which is dissecting the the hilarious lunacy that is, Jaws 4 a.k.a. Jaws The Revenge (and man-alive does this flick give you a lot of material!). First things first, a most gifted shark, evidently Jaws now has the ability to read minds or at least that's what the utterly brilliant screen writers would have us believe. So don't forget to chalk up \"Telepathic Perception\" to Jaws' resume! Anyways, after losing her youngest son Sean, an aging and not so fresh Ellen Brody needs to \"get away from it all\" and so she hops on a plane and fly's to the Bahamian Islands, but of course Jaws obviously knows this and proceeds to make the long trek to the Bahama's, a distance of 1,195 miles (that's from the fictitious Amity Island, which is essentially Martha's Vineyard Massachusetts to the Bahama's). How long do you think it would take, for a great white shark to swim that distance? And if I'm remembering correctly, Jaws beats her down there! Very interesting physics isn't it. Not surprisingly the movie really drags badly when it doesn't directly involve the ocean (meaning Jaws) and Mario Van Peebles ridiculous cringe-worthy character certainly takes some getting used to and his voice is patently annoying indeed.The robotic shark effects, wow..... as far as the series goes, they are simply are at their WORST in the fourth film. The effects are an important aspect that you really would think would've gotten better with each film, however, the exact opposite happened. And that's particularly true with some scenes in the middle of the movie, where the shark looks utterly fake and completely static and please try to keep in mind, that the people who made this movie, are asking you to believe that what you are seeing is a marvel of evolution, a super-predator - a monstrous man-eating shark. Perhaps the films most entertaining and ridiculous sequence is when Jaws, a 25 foot long / 6,000 pound great white shark, chases Mike Brody into a sunken ship and then proceeds to navigate it's narrow underwater corridors almost as easily as a person would. And let us not forget Mikes \"inspired escape\", where once again, in a Jaws movie, air-tanks are just doing some CRAZY THINGS - admittedly however, it does look great on film. And what about The Bends/decompression sickness and all that??? Oh yeah, right, this is Jaws 4, so never mind.....The real victim of this movie has to be Michael Caine, he's the only actor among them who has/had anything of a successful film career. I guess Caine had some down times and this HAD TO BE one of them. He plays a middle-aged pilot, making a living flying sight-seeing tours and at the same time, is trying to get into Ellen Brody's pants (brave man). Near the end of this highly slip-shod affair is one of cinema's most glaring continuities, involving Michael Caine, who crashes his plane into the ocean, swims some 60 to 70 feet to a yacht and gets aboard with WET hair and DRY clothes?!?! Which leads us to the finale, evidently Jaws want's revenge so badly, that it's on a hell-bent collision course with the Brodies yacht. The scene is handled through a succession of quick cuts of Jaws/Brodies/Jaws/Brodies and is capped-off with one of the most ridiculously funny and comically clich\u00e9d slow-motion shots ever seen; which involves our steely heroine Ellen Brody letting loose a highly dramatic \"NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\". Then Jaws slams head-first into the yacht, which, depending on what version you see, is very poorly depicted, showing nothing more than a broken bowsprit and a spray of red water. Awesomely anti-climatic.And wait - what's that! Is that Mario Van Peebles! Again!! WTF!!! Despite finding himself right in the jaws of the beast and was dragged several meters underwater, he somehow miraculously survives. Apparently he was saved by \"test audiences\", who inexplicably \"liked him\" (SMH).............. a nice sunny conclusion, I guess. Oh, this still isn't as bad as Jaws 3D.",

Lorraine Gary is in this movie because her husband owned the studio that produced it, and she comes across as a crazy widow who at this point should honestly be committed to a mental institute. The shark is shown very early and very often, and to call it laughable would be the understatement of the movie. It is amazing that I can't tell whether the terrible CGI shark in Jaws 3D or the terrible mechanical shark in \"The Revenge\" is worse. In the end, it doesn't matter. The story is incoherent and boring with very little tension or suspense. The characters are bland and forgettable while being played by actors who either took this movie too lightly or too seriously.

In other words the aim is not so much to entertain as to make a quick buck! Jaws was simply not fit for a sequel. The shark dies in the first film. Bringing a new one along just to terrorize Amity once again is so stupid an idea that one wonders how did they come up with it, the weirdest part being that no resident of Amity seems to ask him/herself \"why is it that great whites have a thing for our island?\" Having Brody's wife assume that the shark came for them is so dumb, it actually insults our intelligence as an audience since we are supposed to buy that load of garbage.The thing that struck me the most about the revenge is the final water sequence when they've killed the shark,(by driving a boat into it! Don't make me laugh) the horizon backdrop is obviously a painting. It's so obvious it physically hurts since even the water splashes against it! How are we supposed to not notice something that's literally thrown at our face. I'm sure most of you who've seen the film know exactly what I am talking about.It seems that Universal has quite forgotten what constitutes a good sequel. Robert Shaw (Quint in the original Jaws) suggested that they make a movie about him on the Indian outpost in World War 2 (see his monologue in the first film) where a bunch of sharks ate many of his army buddies. This could have made a good sequel since it's unique and quite possible. But no! Universal had other plans. They'd rather show us a group of stupid kids trying to get away from a shark with Brody's son with them (of course, great whites never forget!)In the revenge the studio has taken its overwhelming stupidity to the next level. A shark eats Helen Brody's son and then another shark hunts her and her second son in the Bahamas. As the poster says: This time it's personal. Indeed it is. The great white sent a message to his buddy in the Bahamas asking him to do some killing on his behalf and obviously he agrees. This friend of the great white is apparently some kind of X shark due to the fact that he is blessed with vocal cords that enable him to roar (maybe its mother mated with a lion) and has another extraordinary ability to stand on water. So he is an X super shark. I can't believe I bought the damn DVD. But anyway it serves a completion purpose. I'd like to finish this article by making a film suggestion to Universal pictures and Hollywood. You seem to be so into making sequels and prequels e.g Saw3, The Texas chainsaw massacre:The beginning, why not make a 5th Jaws? \"Jaws: The return of the great white\", where the shark gets cloned by modern day technology and is then free to continue his hunt for the descendants of the Brody family. Sounds stupid? What do you care as long as it makes money we are all happy and we do't give a damn about quality.",

Everybody liked the first \"Jaws\" movie, people where affraid to go in the water even, and because it's great succes a second part was understandable.Jaws 2 wasn 't as good as the first, but still a good movie. I wished that they ended the \"jaws\" movies after that one! Where the first two movies where of the same quality Visually, that quality was long gone in the third Jaws movie if you ask me.The first movie was the worlds first introduction with the big shark, the second movie lost that element of surprise, it's still an exciting movie, and there is nothing wrong with the story line or the ending. And the formula for succes was being the first to send shiffers down peoples spines in fear of a \"realistic\" monster, where before movies like \"godzilla\" or \"king-kong\" were scary in there own ways, but didn't make people go home in fear of a gigantic lizards. The film makers must had the same conclusion about the \"succes formula\" so to get that element of surprise back they thought \"let's go bigger, more action and more extreme. I agree that it was the only option IF jou want to make a decent new jaws movie. \"IF\" because my opinion is that they gone overboard with the third movie. It lacked te same \"feel\" as the previous movies, the \"new for it's time\" but looking ridicilous (special effect) shark attack sc\u00e8nes and a big, bad and bloody script that left nothing to the imagination. So they must have made a bunch of money with that third one but i rather saw it never being made.Than now finally the movie where my whole story began with. Jaws 4 ..... again they had the same conclusion as me, bigger en bloodier is not going to be the way they must have thought.So...sadly...they made another movie, and they must have thought, let's go back to basic. And let's use that , \"first a few deaths, than in fear and doubt, to end with a all or nothing fight to the Death\" script and maybe a surprise survivor at the end or something, people love that. I'm gonna stop because i'm getting grey hairs of frustation. Only reason that people start this movie is the word \"Jaws\" in the title.CONCLUSION: If jou want to see a predictable, boring \"jaws light\" this is your movie. What seperates this movie from the other ones except the title and the fact that it's a soft version of the first two movies.......ehhh...one of the lead actors is black. BTW SPOILER ALERT: the shark dies.",

The first Jaws was truly terrifying from the opening scene to the final moment and you believed that such a thing could really happen. But this movie laughs at what film making is and has a contempt for the audience with its absurdity. A shark born from the first one that was killed comes back with revenge on its mind to get the family of the man that killed its mommy....I can't believe Lorrene Gary and Michael Caine were even a part of this project. In this film you have a shark that roars and can stand on its tail out of the water as it attacks people.This movie should be required viewing in film school on what crappy film-making is and what to avoid.",

It's in the ballpark of Plan 9 in the sense of bad plotting. Frankly, if you watch Jaws the Revenge as a comedy, it's one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. Unfortunately, it wasn't filmed or marketed that way.My favorite parts: Jaws swimming down the coast and trailing the family from Bermuda to the Bahamas (or whereever the heck this film is set); Mario Van Peebles appearing virtually unscathed after being ostensibly crushed in the jaws of Jaws; Michael Caine landing his plane in the water and then swimming later to the boat (the boat didn't look as though it was designed for water, and I found it hard to believe that a) he could survive the crash and swim to the surface and b) he'd destroy an expensive piece of aircraft).",

            "content": "\"This movie sucks\"  \"I hate this movie\" \"i can't believe what i just saw\" Typical reviews to this stupidity parade called Jaws: The Revenge.  And the sad thing is it's all understandable.  I still HATE this movie, so much! I'm like Burce Wayne, even after avenging his parents death the rage and fight is still there.  Even after writing an argession filled review three years ago, i still have to come back here every few months to read these same reinforcing hate filled reviews.  Because no matter how many times a reviewer points out that a SHARK stands on its tail and roars my head can never fathom the earth-shattering stupidity of it all.  Bruce Wayne will never get his parents back, I will never get my 90 minutes back, and the scar left on the name of a groundbreaking piece of cinema will never heal.I'll forgo the instinctual impossibility that a shark would camouflage himself near a piece of driftwood to eat a person on a boat rather than just swim up and eat another fish.  I'll forgo the logistical impossibility that a shark fearing widow would flee her island home to ANOTHER ISLAND!  As I type this I just watched today's best NHL goaltender come out of his zone, drop his stick and let an open ice puck crawl right between his legs for a goal in the Stanley Cup finals.  So people make stupid mistakes in times of pressure, I'll forgive you Ms. Brody, just as I forgave Mr. Brodeur. After all what brings more pressure than a telepathic, reborn, teleporting, roaring, exploding, vengeful predator of the seas? I'll even forgo the physical impossibility of surviving the bends.This ending, although cannot be forgiven by Jesus Christ himself. The last twenty minutes is just an unbelievable orgy of every irrational idea conceived by filmmakers.  There was a method behind Spielberg's exiting finale in 1975.  He said that by that point he \"has his audience.\" After taking them on this thrilling yet conceivable ride, that for just a few seconds they would suspend their beliefs and allow a great white to swim around chewing on an oxygen tank.  Well he was right.  Maybe the makers of Jaws: The Revenge had a reverse plan...  maybe their plan was to constantly bombard you with inconceivable acts of stupidity and impossibility until you are rendered retarded from the whole ordeal so when they unleash a plethora of insanity at the climax you barely realize it.Can there be any other excuse for a shark to walk on its hind fins, roar, catch a man in his razor sharp mouth in slow motion, let him survive, get poked by a stick, and explode!?  Ok let us look at this systematically. A shark on its hind fins:  Maybe they were trying to out-do the original scene where Bruce capsizes the Orca.  \"Well a shark lunging out of the water to surface onto an already half-sunken, half decaying boat is pretty amazing.  Let's do something really amazing!\"  Too much of a good thing, no wonder this is a sequal.  And what they can't \"improve\" on from the original, they just steal.  Just random scenes of the original thrown in the movie, as if to say \"Hey, she's saying the same thing her husband said while fighting a shark, what a great example of..\" bullshit! it's pointless and only reminds me of what film I SHOULD be watching!  And she's not heroically surviving one last face to face battle with the predator armed with only a rifle.  She's on a huge boat with all her surviving friends and family about to poke the gravity defying fish that's wearing some flash cube.  Not exciting at all, it's pathetic! Two last comments before I finish...  why would they make the shark roar? I suppose the filmmakers knew they weren't gifted enough to make a giant hungry silent eating machine about to attack be scary, so they made it roar to add \"a scary sound effect.\"  You know in slasher movies when they just make a nail-on-chalkboards sound whenever the murderer pops out?  That kind of cheap garbage.  But they can't have someone just scream, or have a loud wave crashing sound.  No, it has to be this insanely thoughtless roar. Finally, the explosion.  Have you ever seen that Simpsons gag where something clearly stable and inflammable like a shopping cart crashes and explodes?  That satirical gag is EXACTLY what this movie pulls, and wants you to seriously accept it!  Try to think about that fact logically for more than a minute and don't blame me when you regain consciousness.  To see something like this even referred to as a serious idea is inconceivable for even half a second!Well, as I finish this review, the Devils paid for their mistake and lost the game.  So that piled on all these horrible factors that equal Jaws The Revenge, i must retire before i simply throw my computer out the window. To conclude, I hate this movie, you should hate this movie.  And it is NOT healthy to imagine Spielberg making a sequel to \"save\" this franchise. It should have never been a franchise anyway.  It was a wonderful suspenseful work of art about nature, fear, and survival; and now the name is synonymous with monumental acts of stupidity and ridiculousness.  Please, enough damage has been done.",

And this movie more than either of the first two movies showed so many extended shots of it.  Why show something that sucks and is going to take away from the suspense (see my review of Jaws II for more on this).   The picture is clearer in this movie than in the others - because it was done the most recent. The Brody boy is all grown up in this movie.  He's afraid of sharks since he was terrorised as a kid by one in the second movie.  The movie shouldn't have spent so much time with his psychological problems with sharks - I really miss the strong roll Roy Scheider had in killing the shark in the first two movies.

This would be fine if the writing was strong enough to support a dialogue-driven film, however all the lines are dull and uninteresting.

Lorraine Gary puts in a string performance as the now widowed Ellen Brody (Roy Scheider sensibly kept his distance after JAWS 2). Lorraine Gary is an excellent (and underused) actress. Michael Caine is OK as the maverick pilot Hoagie - He seems to be enjoying himself(and the free trip to the Bahamas where most of this picture was shot). The actual shark is the worst in the series - you can often see the mechanics working the shark and when it is shown \"swimming\" in the water it just seems to be \"bobbing up & down\". The ending of the film Just makes no sense whatsoever and is ludicrous. On the plus side - The musical score by Michael Small is excellent and the photography is also impressive.

Something tells me that the shark had a private investigator noting the movements of the Brody family and relaying them to the shark. - Sound stupid? Well, yes, but so is the film and if/when you see it you'll know what I'm on about.The Plot: Sean Brody has to go out at night and detach a bit of driftwood from a buoy. As he attempt to do this, his arm is bitten off. He sits in the boat screaming to the land for help but they're busy rehearsing music for Christmas and can't hear him. As he's leaning (rather stupidly considering what's just happened) over the edge of the boat shouting for help, he's munched - tasty! Anyhoo, Ellen Brody has the feeling that the shark is hunting down her family and goes out to the Bahamas to stay with her other son, his wife and his daughter. While there Michael Brody and his partner Jake are tagging snails when they discover a huge great white shark which quickly tries to attack Michael - see what I mean about the P.I? So, Jake and Michael try keeping track of the shark and when Ellen's granddaughter is attacked by the shark she decides she's going to go and try and kill it, and thus we get a stupid ending. Mario Van Peebles (Jake) is out on mast sticking out the front of the boat, sticks something in the sharks mouth but goes in as well sideways and the front mast breaks as Jake's dragged bleeding underwater. Michael's then using an electric charge to drive the shark crazy, Ellen Brody steers the broken front mast straight into the shark as it rises out the water due to the shock Michael gives it and the shark explodes. Yes, that's right. When you stab a shark with a sharp piece of wood it explodes. Oh, and Jake survives. The shark let him go because, as Jake says \"Sharks only like white meat!\" This is a very stupid, crap Jaws film, basically. What more can I say? I think I've given enough above for you to make up your mind. Mario Van Peebles is the best actor in it, shame he had to be in such a crap film.2 or 3 out of 10 As always, Cat \u00a7quire",

Nothing makes sense, and this film is not only a bad one, but It's also a stupid and incompetent one. 3D failed to save \"Jaws 3,\" and now we have \"Jaws: The Revenge.\"It's about Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), now a widow, who is still living on Amity Island. Her son, Sean (Mitchell Anderson), is now the Chief of Police and one night, is eaten by a shark. Ellen becomes convinced that a great white is targeting her family, and she flees to the Bahamas with her other son, Mike (Lance Guest), a marine biologist. Ellen begs him to give up his job, but he tells her there has never been a shark in warm waters. Mike discovers the shark has swum from Amity Island and attempts to keep it a secret from his mother as he tracks it. Ellen discovers the shark has followed her, and she sets out to destroy it once and for all.If that plot sounded stupid, you're right. The tagline reads, \"This time it's personal,\" like we are supposed to believe that a shark has a vendetta against Ellen. You can hear those sharks plotting their revenge. \"Jaws 3\" was terrible, but this picture is worse and about as bad as you can get for a story, characters, screenplay, cinematography, editing and a shark. A plot centring around a woman and a shark feuding make no sense, but a shark that swims three days from Amity to the Bahamas to find Ellen is beyond stupid.It opens on a Christmas night, where Sean gets tasked with fixing a buoy in the channel marker. He drives the boat out and gets attacked by a shark. Now, this scene is stupid for a few reasons. There is a children's choir singing Christmas carols in the background, and I'm supposed to believe they don't see him? Second, how does the shark know where Sean is going to be? Did the shark plan the whole scene? I'm fine if I don't learn the answers. Once Sean is eaten, Ellen has to be convinced to move to the Bahamas. Her son just died and, afterward, she is happy as a clam and Mike, seriously, has to persuade her to go with him. How touching! You know she would have stupidly stayed on that island. Once Ellen reaches the Bahamas, she begins to fall in love with a carefree pilot named Hoagie (Michael Caine), and Mike becomes jealous of this for some reason, a subplot we do not get an answer to, but that's fine.Speaking of Mike, he works as a Marine Biologist, of course, he does. Wouldn't you know it the shark has followed them? Instead of telling his mother, he keeps it a secret and attempts to study it. \"How do sharks swim for three days and track a widowed mother?\" I'm sure you can tell that I'm making fun of the film because it hasn't even got to the worst scenes yet.Ellen's fears are shown with the cheap \"dream sequence,\" not once but twice. Ellen wakes up covered in sweat, fearing the shark is going to get her in a dream. This sequence is a cheap gimmick that irritates more than anything. Mike and his crew get attacked by the shark, and he ends up swimming for his life when he stupidly goes into the water to try and find it. He begins to believe his mum's theory that the shark is targeting the family. The shark looks so bad and fake. It looks like a rubber bag that floats side by side. Its head looks like a blown-up puppet with a lot of plastic-looking teeth. Somehow, the shark can break through a steel wall underwater before, with what clearly shows, someone operating its mouth.Somehow, Ellen can feel when the shark is about to attack someone. Yeah, and I'm the Easter Bunny. Someone is about to get attacked, and Ellen stops dead in her tracks on the beach with Hoagie before she shrugs it off. What? I was confused here more than I was when you see the shark's point of view. The camera makes it, so it looks like its eyes are above the water. One of the many errors of the movie, but that's not the best one. When Ellen finally sees the shark, the hunt is on. I do believe at this point, Ellen and the shark have something real, and they must fight it out at sea. Remember, it's personal! She commandeers a boat and sails out alone into the ocean to sacrifice herself to the shark to stop the madness. Oh boy! Hoagie manages to crash land his airplane so he can rescue Ellen. After being almost eaten, he climbs aboard with a freshly dry shirt after being in the water. Has this movie made any sense to you yet?Did you know that Sharks can also roar loud too? They try to bait it by using some electronic beeper box that drives it insane with rage, and it lets out this shrieking roar as it lifts itself above the water. Somehow, the shark can stand on its tail before being rammed by the boat. No really, straight up on its tail. I'm also wondering why there are flashbacks before the shark blows up in a sequence where there is a crucial shot missing. It's so incompetent that there is no establishing shot either. As they get closer to the shark, it's roar because louder, and they use the same camera shot three times over before It explodes, and we can finally leave the theatre. You may notice I used the word \"Somehow\" a lot. That's because everything in this picture is a question mark that eventually we don't care about, and if they make a \"Jaws 5,\" you can be sure it's not safe to go back to the theatre.",

However, the good points are faltered by the rest of the movie. In this whole movie, Ellen Brody thinks the great white that killed her son is after her. WHAT is that? No way can a shark just go after a certain person it doesn't like, especially if the person is someone that is related to the other person the shark just killed. In my opinion, she was insane. And Sean Brody losing his arm? THAT was stupid. He shoulda just died right then, but they had to freakin's extend that and dramatize it. This movie had way too much blood to be in a shark movie. Sure, I enjoy some blood, but when Sean loses his arm and there's all that blood, plain stupid. And most of the movie was a drama about a mother and her son anyways. I kinda enjoyed Mario Van Peeples as Jake, the Rastafarian scientist that was Michael Brody's partner. And of course, the black guy always dies. I knew he was going to die in the end. I think that Hoagie should've died when his helicopter crashed in the water. He was standing on the edge of his helicopter, the shark comes out of the water, digs his mouth into the helicopter, and yet he doesn't die? BS. I didn't like the kid very much. She was EXTREMELY annoying and in the way. The narrator was absolutely pointless in the beginning and was saying all this BS that had nothing to do with the movie. I mean it sorta made sense, but come on, it was dumb. Another BS. The ending. Totally unreal. No way can a fake looking shark jump out of the water and then the boat ram into it and impale it. It's impossible. The shark looks so fake anyways, it's not even funny. Oh, and another thing, great whites don't just swim into the Bahamas for revengeful purposes. Besides, it even says in the movie, great whites don't swim in warm waters.To finish up, this movie has its very, very few good moments. But it is the weakest Jaws movie in the franchise. Overall: 3/10 and bogus",

He must already have been a very rich man in 1987, and could not possibly have 'done it for the money'. Surely an actor must have to consider a box office hit in favour of a shed load of money. Not so here it would appear. I'm so disappointed Micheal! But, at the end of the day, it's just another case of over stretching a good idea. There ought to be a law concerning the making of sequels.

There is a good soundtrack accompanied by eerie camera-work, followed by the genuinely shocking death of one of the Brody sons.In fact, the entire effort involved in making this film seems to have been put into the first ten minutes. After that, Ellen Brody (now a widow, incidentally) goes on holiday. But she is followed by a shark which has defied science with its psychic abilities in finding the relatives of the man who killed its kin, and by rocketing halfway across the world in no time at all. In the Bahamas Ellen meets Michael Caine, wasted in a minor role. From then on the film descends into thrill-less slop. Most of the characters are just irritating, the special effects are terrible (at one point the fake shark seems to be hovering above the water. So, if this shark can fly, can it fly as fast as it can swim? Watch out Richard Branson!) The plot is nonsense - the shark roars, Ellen Brody has flashbacks to events she never even witnessed, people who face seemingly inescapable deaths miraculously come back to life, and the exploding shark makes the scene at the end of Jaws 3-D look believable by comparison.",

Each sequel was worse than its predecessor, and Jaws: The Revenge does not disappoint in that regard.By the end of this film, it unintentionally makes a complete mockery of the entire movie series. I'm specifically referring to the instance where Michael Caine's character almost in jest flips himself back on board of the fledging boat without so much as a scratch on him moments after being attacked by a gigantic white shark. I remember joking with my friends, saying: \"What if the pilot of the crashed plane (Caine's character) miraculously survives and climbs back on board? Wouldn't that be hilarious?\" Well, it was hilarious, and so was the rest of this picture.The acting is downright dreadful and the storyline is completely ridiculous. It's somewhat unsettling that a team of professionals called a meeting, sat down and approved a plot line that calls for a giant shark to miraculously come back to life (unexplained) and stalk the family of the man who tried to get rid of him in the original title. Are you kidding me? The first significant moment of the movie occurs when the youngest Brody son Sean -- who is now the Police Chief of Amity -- is attacked and killed by Jaws during the holidays. The sound of a choir caroling on the beach mutes his cries for help a mere yards from the shoreline.Hmmm....Anyway, the plot continues and the eldest Brody son, Michael, visits for the Holidays/funeral and convinces the now stricken Ellen Brody to visit him at his home in the Bahamas. Though originally reluctant, she agrees and the film shifts to the beautiful islands.While there, Ellen begins to lose it, fearing that the shark that killed Sean and terrorized Amity 10 years prior is out for revenge, suggesting it followed her to the warm waters of the Bahamas (a place unfit for sharks) and will instantly chase down the entire family the moment they enter the salty sea waters. Michael thinks it's a crazy idea, but when his daughter is nearly killed by the shark, he begins to think his loony mother may be on to something.The ridiculous climax takes place in the middle of the ocean when Ellen decides it would be a clever idea to confront the sea beast alone on her son's boat. Making a painfully long series of events short: Ellen, her new love interest Hoagie (the surviving pilot), Michael and his assistant survive the wrath of Jaws, joyfully cheering as they float aimlessly in the middle of the vast blue ocean after watching the shark explode into smithereens.",

According to sources this movie ignores the events that take place in part 3, which isn't a bad thing, but unfortunately most people want ignore want happens in this one too. We start where it all began in Amity with Chiefs Brody's wife Ellen (Gary) now the main character and one of her sons Sean (Anderson). Chief Brody has apparently passed on, but of course Ellen knows it was the shark \"it was fear of it\" that caused it. Could it not be the strain of the job and people never believing the man when he talked? Sean is now a cop and has to answer a call out in the harbor. Well not surprisingly, in a grisly scene Sean is killed by Jaws and naturally Ellen knows the shark had it in for him. Her other son Mike (Guest) comes up from the Bahamas, where he researches underwater snails. He convinces her to take a vacation and come on down. By the way if you think a shark has a vendetta for you why not go to the mountains instead, but no she goes to the beach. Of course the shark manages to follow her and get there before her in amazing time, also impossible. While down there she meets Hoagie (Caine) they have fun and Michel and Jake (Van Peebles) find out there are more than snails down in the ocean. They keep the shark on the dl and decide they can study it. Not surprisingly the shark eventually attacks \"the banana boat\" while Mike's kid is on it. Ellen knows its there for her so she takes a boat and goes out after it. Hoagie takes his plane and the others to find Ellen, lands the non oceanic plane in the water and Jaws makes his move. Don't worry Hoagie gets to the boat dry and unharmed. The climax comes with Ellen and all our main stars confronting jaws on the boat. Jake manages to put some electric toy in the shark's mouth, just before he gets chomped that is! But does he live? So Mike teases the shark with the toy's electric shocks which sends the shark jumping out of the water and roaring. Yes roaring one of the dumbest scenes in film history. Soon it comes straight for the boat. Ellen thinks fast, speeds up, (flashing back to her husband blowing up the fist shark, although she was not there) and impales the shark as it jumps out of the water killing it as it sinks to the bottom. Of course that depends what version you have seen. Take notes there are different versions.This is a really bad movie. A total insult the first two films which I thought were great. Its no surprise the Roy Scheider turned down the role, he didn't even want to do the second. The deal was even if he had his character would have been killed right away. And of course in titles like this they kill of characters you may like, for instance Sean the youngest Brody is killed brutally right away in the film. The story may be the worst part, but that's debatable. Ellen is convinced that not only was the shark responsible for her husband's death (heart attack, oh wait it was fear), but that it's seeking revenge on her family. Does she forget the 2 sharks that her husband dispatched in the first 2 films? Then it follows her down to the Bahamas and beats her there, oh please. Wouldn't this be a good time to move away from the ocean Mrs. Brody? Adding to that the acting is terrible in the film. I'm sure Michael Caine wants to forget he ever made this film, it's just so bad. If you can manage to pay attention you may catch the part when Mike and Jake talk about the shark, even though they haven't seen it yet.But don't forget the special effects, which are awful. The shark looks very fake. They were still using the \"Bruce\" mold from the other films, but this is many years later and it should have been updated and certainly not show as much as it was on screen. Upon sight of the creature you will be laughing at how bad it looks. \"Bruce\" the shark is rolling over in his shark pen where ever he is, like that little one in part 3. They also make the shark do laughable things, the worst being that it roars like some kind of creature from He-Man. Sharks don't have vocal cords morons. It constantly eats and chews on boats too, which looks stupid. Many times when it leaps out of the water you can see the mechanics behind what's it doing it. I mean really who put this together? There are really too many to mention, but some have to be. Hoagie after the plane crashes in the water and he climbs up on the boat and he's completely dry. You think we wouldn't see this? Also there are different versions of the film. When I was we lad and saw this I think I saw the one where they claimed Jake lived, which is crap because there is no way he would have survived. But soon talking with other kids at the time it became a war of words about he lived or died and that the shark either was impaled and sunk or blew up at the end. Its all bad\u0085just bad. So believe me there are more than a couple versions all of which, not surprisingly, are bad. If there is a plus to the film, I would have to say the shots of the Caribbean are great, but that's not enough. Overall a bad film that has really cheapened the franchise even further, and should be an example of how not to make a film. One and half stars.",

It's no surprise that Lorraine Gary hasn't been seen in movies since. In the simplest terms, she sucks. While I'm thinking about it, she sucked in Jaws and Jaws II, but not bad enough to derail a classic (9.5 out of 10) and an O.K. sequel (6 out of 10). This was just an excuse for more gore as well. The opening kill, when a policeman gets his arm bit off is not terror, it's just buckets of blood, which is only entertaining for grade-school kids. The last scene, when Jaws is shocked out of the water and roars, is beyond belief. I didn't know sharks made noises out of water! I saw that this movie is in the bottom 100 of all-time.

Lets make another Jaws movie where the shark settles the score.\" Imagine all the suits sitting there, thinking 'This will WORK!!!\"Which it patently doesn't. Sharks have many virtues, but they aren't big on personality. And this one is no exception, in spite of the efforts of the film makers to turn the fish into the Esther Williams of the eighties. Like its predecessor it rises majestically out of the water and grins endlessly into the camera during extended underwater shots. Many have criticised the shark for roaring, but its vocal efforts are not so far removed from La Williams and at least it doesn't wear a floral bathing cap. (Conversely Esther Williams did not have a hole in her stomach with bits of wood and wire hanging out. At least, not to the best of my knowledge.)The plot concerns a haggard Ellen Brody, now matronly and sporting a dreadful coiffure, coping with the death of her son from a (yawn) shark attack, and slowly coming to the realisation that the Great White is picking off members of her family. Whilst relocation to say, Arizona, would have been an obvious solution, with impeccable logic she moves to the Bahamas. Before long the shark turns up and pretty much swims around in circles minding its own business, occasionally launching into shark song.\nMarkedly less bloodthirsty than its predecessors, sharkie meets a very odd death when Ellen plays dodgem cars with him. Sharks being well known for their sensitivity, it conveniently blows up for the happy ending which pairs Ellen and Michael Caine. I can only imagine the phone calls Caine made to his agent from the set.",

            "content": "OK lets get straight to the point the Shark obviously angered by the demise of his family members in the previous films has developed a grudge and seeks revenge against the Brody family. Whoever came up with this was either drunk, stoned, acid tripping or perhaps they were just having a laugh. The idea that a shark could develop a grudge against a family is so funny that when trying to explain this concept to my friends i found myself and them in absolute hysterics. To top it all off the Shark also it would appear has developed some kind of satellite navigation which allowed him to track the entire Brody clan as they move some 2000 miles away or whatever. Thats right the Shark is able to track down the family. Whats even more funny is that rather than setting up a nice home in the country or buying an apartment in the city, Brody's wench of wife despite her belief that the Shark is following sets up home about 1 minute away from the coastline. Maybe its just me but if a white shark was stalking my family i'd set up home as far away from the coastline as possible. But despite their predicament the Brody family really do seem to have a death wish. Firstly the younger son decides to become a coast policemen and is deservedly chomped up by our vengeful shark. His older brother despite his families history and calls from his mum still decides to continue his work as a marine biologist. Call me unsympathetic but these people deserved to die. It gets even more ridiculous when they allow the Brodies Granddaughter to go on a freaking banana boat i mean come on don't you people take a hint stay as far away from the sea as possible! Perhaps there not so terrified because they like the rest of us come to realise that the shark in fact is made out of rubber is clearly attached to wires and swims with the grace of a turd. In saying that unbeknown to me and anyone who's ever watched a documentary on white sharks according to Jaws 4 White Sharks cannot only bear grudges, stalk people over thousands of miles but also can balance up on their tails and roar like lions unbelievable i know. Also why the hell is Michael Caine in this film it really is rather sad seeing one of Britains finest ever actors prating about in this film. After suffering a near death experience with the shark he somehow survives and says something like \"his breath stank.\" There's also some irritating Caribbean guy who gets killed in one version and then in the directors cut emerges with a few grazes despite been in the sharks mouth for a few minutes. Sorry to rant on but why the hell would you move next to the coastline when a shark is stalking you, surely if you moved to a city apartment then the shark would have no chance. In saying that though sharks according to this film can bear grudges, stalk, roar and balance on their tails so perhaps we could of had the shark slowly but surely crawling from the sea to the Brodie's apartment in some city. The final confrontation would actually take place on the roof of the apartment where the shark would fall to his death. Believe me you think thats a bad ending wait to you see the actual ending. Lets just thank the lord that Jaws 5 is highly unlikely.",

The shark looked so mechanical.Look how great Jaws was without the modern technology!!!! It speaks volumes. I wonder if Spielberg had directed Jaws 4 would it be watchable? I reckon so.

Because, from what I understand, people have watched it. They didn't listen to the other critics. But it's not their fault. Despite panning it, giving it a 0% on Rotton Tomatoes, and calling it the worst movie ever made, it didn't stop people. Before the Emoji Movie, there was this. Jaws 4 is a disgrace to cinema. It is a disease-ridden decomposed corpse to cinematic history! Now I'm sure the same thing is on everybody's mind. Did any part of this movie have anything to do with Steven Spielberg? Well, I've looked into it. And no, it doesn't. Although I can say, this movie's title is very connected to Spielberg's work. By being \"The Revenge\" for Jaws, this film is a perfect representation of the awful films that tried to destroy the reputation of good cinematic masterpieces! In this regard, it has achieved Revenge indeed! When Peter Benchley wrote a novel about a malevolent force that targeted humanity through the form of a killer shark, he didn't realize it would become a reality. Not in the form of a fish, but rather a sequel that is hellbent on destroying an audience's cinematic experience. Awful pacing, bland characters, unspeakable dialogue, dreadful writing, deceptive settings, unavoidable stupidity, lackluster music, bad cinematography, terrible visuals, unsuitable tone(s), worthless special effects, poor acting, useless plot devices and a blatant lack of creativity all mixed together in a broken blender and calculated just right!! That is Jaws 4, the worst film to ever be made. Make no mistake, watching this film is one of the worst decisions a person can make. On the front cover, it says, \"This time it's personal!\" Well, that's one hundred percent accurate! The film is deliberately attacking you by denying you the right to enjoy yourself or its story. It goes out of its way to be as uninteresting as possible. I'm not giving this movie a ranking because frankly, it doesn't deserve even one star. It's awful, and I hope nobody ever had the misfortune of watching this unholy disgrace to cinematic history! THE FILM F****** SUCKS!!!!!!!!",

The gap in quality, writing, direction and effects between the first film and this series closer is an abyss of cosmic proportions. First, some questions...1. Since when do Great Whites care for relatives? They will eat each other from developing inside the womb until the day they die, so why would this one care about it's predecessors? 2. How did the shark know who Brody's offspring are? 3. How did it know said offspring's job, then lay a complex ambush that required the duty Deputy and the Coastguard to be busy in order for it to work? 4. After the attack and Ellens move, how did the shark uncover her travel plans? 5. Sharks can maintain a steady 70 knots for 2 days no sweat. Since when???? 6. You want to avoid a large fish by moving from an island to... another island. Dolt! 7. Do all sharks have huge bits of machinery jutting out of them? That last one is maybe a bit much, I actually saw this 'movie' on late-night British TV and the pan/scan version shows all the shark workings unashamedly almost every time it appears, making the suspension of disbelief all the harder. I could come up with several thousand more questions about this crap, but suffice to say it's riddled with complete nonsense and is a joy to watch because of this.I'd hate to think of the poor souls who actually paid to see this trash in the cinema, but as long as you know you're in for a real Plan 9 style no brainer it's a great laugh.

Today, I take full responsibility for subjecting my parents, whom I forced to take me to the show, to this nightmarish experience. This film had completely destroyed everything I loved about \"Jaws\" and I have long since declared this to be the \"worst movie ever made.\"The only redeeming quality about this movie is that it stands as the benchmark for which movies should be deleted out of existence. Therefore, if a movie is found to be worse than \"Jaws: the Revenge,\" all copies of such a movie should be burned and all of those who have seen said movie should be quarantined. Having said this, the other night I decided to subject my girlfriend to this film in order for her to gain a greater appreciation for every other movie ever made.And now on to the meat. The opening of the film begins with your usually underwater sequence with the Jaws music playing. In this movie, however, the style of the title and opening credits gives it a very made for T.V. feel. We are soon to discover that Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) has died of a heart attack, or as it was suggested in the film, from \"fear of the shark\" (the same shark he destroyed in the first film). Martin is survived by his wife and two sons. His youngest son, who followed in daddy's footsteps and is now the chief of police in Amity Island, is quickly eaten during the first ten minutes. This leads to a chain of events where Mrs. Brody (Loraine Gary) develops psychic powers to be able to feel when the shark is present and becomes convinced that the shark is out to get all the Brodys. Mrs. Brody now decides to move to the Bahamas to live with her marine biologist eldest son Michael. Next the film tries to expand itself with some awkward character development featuring scenes with Michael's wife discussing their sex life with his mother and the entrance of Michael Cain as Mrs. Brody's love interest. That's right, I said Michael Cain! Michael Cain, a great actor, can be seen here collecting a paycheck. For some reason, Michael Cain has a habit of doing bad movies, and this one is definitely no exception. Somehow the shark discovers that the Brodys' are now in the Bahamas and quickly, and I mean quickly, makes the 2,000 mile trip down. At this point the viewer becomes confused as to whether this shark is a cousin of the original shark, or as the movie seems to suggest, is the same shark! The shark appears to have no interest in anyone except the Brodys; therefore, the film loses its fright factor because as long as you are not a Brody, or near a Brody, you are safe from the dilapidated rubber mess they try to pass off as a shark. The film continues to limp along, I will not even begin to point out the many flaws as others have mentioned, blatantly plagiarizing many scenes from the original film. The film concludes with one of the worst endings in film history. Mrs. Brody, Michael, Mario Van Peebles, and Michael Cain are trapped on a boat being terrorized by, what appears to be, a slow moving rubber mess with its own psychic powers to locate members of the Brody family. Mario Van Peebles is eaten but manages to convince the shark to swallow a strobe light. Michael then begins to use another strobe light, that is somehow connected to the strobe light the shark swallowed, to drive the shark \"crazy\" and make it roar like a lion while leaping 15 feet out of the water. Finally, in one of the most confusing scenes I have ever witnessed, Mrs. Brody impales the shark with the bow of the boat and the shark appears to explode. To accomplish the exploding shark effect, the director simply pasted the shark death scene from the original \"Jaws\" onto this film.If the \"Jaws\" sequels were intended to be a contest as to who could make the worst installment in the franchise, this movie is a crowning achievement. Not only does it surpass all expectations for an awful sequel, it quite possibly may be - \"the worst film ever made.\"",

From Michael Caines I'm bored performance to the ridiculous looking shark puppet thing, this gets my vote for the worst movie sequel ever. Halloween sequels are Hitchcock masterpieces compared to this thing that has the gaul to call itself a movie. And to think the first movie was nominated for best picture in 1975. So whats wrong with this one. Well let me start my ranting. First off is the slackest direction ever used for any film, EVER. No single scene can entertain in this movie. Its like t.v. movie of the week material infringing its way into theatres. Compare scenes where the shark attacks to those in the other films. In a film like Jaws the director used a slow restraint letting the tension of the moment build. Even if you weren't scared at least you might be entertained by the direction. In this film however there is no restraint. The shark appears, attacks something and the audience is supposed to be scared. Oh me oh my. The only thing scary about these scenes is the horrendous overuse of the Jaws theme in the film. Say your nodding off( which should happen every ten seconds in this movie) all of the sudden the shark attacks, the music swells and your awaken from your peaceful slumber to face the true horror; The Movie ITSELF!!!! Somehow this movie stars of all people Michael Caine. How in the name of god does this dreck star Michael Caine? Well perhaps Caine was on vacation in Jamaica, spent all his money on the trip, and decided to make any movie he possibly could to earn his way home. During the time he was making this he won an academy award for his performance in Hannah and her Sisters, but could not accept. Why? Because he was busy making Jaws The Revenge. No wonder his performance borders on quiet rage, to outright boredom. Next lets attack the story. Did some writer think this story would be in any way interesting. I mean come on a shark stalking a family all the way from Amity to Jamaica. Thats the dumbest idea in the history of dumb story ideas. Not any shark mind you, its a super inteligent vengefull shark, that stalks specefic prey and can spend large amounts of time out of water. And the ending of the film. Did that thing make sense to anyone? Let me just end this paragraph by saying the backwards swimming sharks of Deep Blue Sea seem more plausible than this rusty, wire pulled monstrosity. Well I did get some enjoyment out of one scene. The scene involve the shark coming out of the water, and snatching a screaming helpless victim from a raft. As the shark spends about a minute above the water not moving or chewing on the victim who is still sreaming like she was being eaten alive, I was reminded of Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster, wrestling with an octopus puppet who was supposed to be eating him alive too.

You shoot some footage, edit it, add some some blood and gore, along with a mean looking beast of nature, you should end up with a pretty cool film as long as no one completely screws up. Well guess what...OK, so 2 and 3 blew but at least they were watchable (except of course for the memorable puppet show at the end of third film (HA HA HA.) This revenge crap however is so despicable it hurts. The idea that a shark follows a woman it doesn't even know to the Bahamas over a period of 3 days in retaliation since her husband killed another shark (which I presume this shark doesn't know either) is lame. Also, she keeps having flashbacks about situations where she wasn't even present or where no one survived so they could tell her. If you don't fall asleep during the first 3/4 of the film, you might wanna catch the hilarious ending. The shark being pulled through the water (by a yellow cable they didn't even bother to conceal) at a blazing 2 knots, builds up enough momentum to fly out of the water, suspend it's body in mid-air for 5-6 seconds, get stabbed by a boat and for some reason...explode into a million chunks. And why, because they didn't have an establishing shot for any of this (I had to rewind..) and because they blatantly ripped off the Spielberg ending. Not only is it similar, it's the same. Not only is it the same shot, it's the same footage. God I hate this movieP.S Watch out for the black comic relief who get eaten and drowned but returns later on claiming the sharks must not have \"liked his flavor\"",

Jaws was the first great Blockbuster and Jaws : The Revenge the great movie franchise mega-bomb. The director and screenwriter should never work again after this incompetent mess.

A million chimpanzee's randomly banging away on typewriters could come up with a better concept. This was a bad, bad movie, and I even heard it lost money. (Ha ha, there is justice). There were two redeeming qualities, though, the first was that it was not Jaws 3(D), and the second was the music, was was better than Jaws 3(D!). And when I write that, I mean that it could be actually good (whoa, the music, I mean) and that the rest of the time, it wasn't so bad that it made me want to tear off my ears.But enough praise for this piece of cheese. The 'story' was basically this: a giant sock-puppet shark plans to hunt down the remaining members of the family from the original Jaws and kill them in a series of incoherent jump cuts. But the mother, being the astute little one, comes to the conclusion that the shark is seeking revenge for the other four sharks that the Brody's killed through-out the other movies. So she logically goes with the LAST STARFIGHTER to an even smaller island in the Caribean populated by a bunch of 'Jamacians' and Michael Caine.There is some romantic banter between Caine and the widowed Lorraine Gary (the mom), and we get to see the LAST STARFIGHTER and his good friend (snicker) Mario Van Peebles put tracking devices on conchs.(?)Though out all the remaining running time, only one person gets killed, and, I would like to note, that person was driving a Bannana Boat....I won't give away the ending, although I will say that Gary (Lorraine) steals a boat to kill the shark, Michael Caine's seaplane gets eaten by the shark (?), Mario Van Peebles get munched and dragged underwater but...doesn't..die, THE LAST STARFIGHTER's huge scientific ability as he try's to fix the weird shark-zapper thing by lightly tapping the outer-case. And, oh yeah, the shark roars repeatedly, jumps 20 feet out of the water, stays there for about 30 seconds, gets impaled on the boat, and blows up.Whoops.While enjoying this movie, its fun to try and find bloopers and technical mistakes. For instance, whenever the shark appears, there is always a pool of blood, even if it hadn't attacked anything. Also look for the pole that propels it attached to its side in practically every shot (or the rail attached to the bottom as it stalks the corridors of the sunken ship(?)) There are also fun little tidbits and factual errors such as the fact that sharks don't roar like lions, and even though they can in fact jump out of the water, they tend not to stay there for half a minute. They also try to avoid traveling hundreds of miles in a single day, and usually, they arn't fixated on the death of a single family.I could go on forever complaining, but I already have. I recommend watching this if you have insomnia or if you have no choice.",

I always thought shark attacks were because people in general look like seals to sharks, but it looks like sharks are willing to swim hundreds of miles for one family...Yes, Michael Caine is a good actor, but even that did not make the film any better. For example, in one part, a man falls out of the boat, and into the sharks mouth. Then he floats to the surface, alive and swimming, five minutes later, would that really happen? Maybe the makers of the film forgot the rubber shark was supposed to be real so they showed it as if it was as harmless and stupid as a rubber shark.If I am honest, it was surprising that the shark did not simply grow legs, learn to talk, and grow hands so that it could walk on shore, break into the Brody household and eat everyone, because the film was that stupid, it would of fitted in with the rest of the film.However, despite all of my negative views in this, it is one of the best films I have ever seen in terms of comic value. Yes, it was supposed to be a horror or an action film, but the ridiculous plot and abysmal special effects make this film hilarious, so if you really want to watch it, take no notice of the plot or acting, and just laugh.",

            "content": "Jaws was based on a simple, terrifying, and effective idea. It's incredible success, coupled with the simple, adaptable concept of a killer shark ensured there would be sequels, and Jaws 2 surprised everyone by being a very watchable and enjoyable little movie. Jaws 3D was a good idea, badly executed, and 5 years later the final instalment in the series, Jaws: The Revenge hit screens.Choosing to ignore the events of the third movie, we return to Amity Island to find the widowed Ellen Brody (Lorraine Garry) living with her younger son, now deputy of police Sean (Mitchell Anderson) The eldest son Michael (Lance Guest) is now a marine biologist based in the Bahamas.All appears rosy until Christmas eve, when Sean is called out to clear some driftwood from the harbour. He finds more than he bargained for and falls victim to one of Amity's now recurring great white shark attacks. Distraught with grief, Ellen decides to spend some time in the Bahamas with Michael, his wife Carla (Karen Young) and young daughter Thea (Judith Barsi) to try clear her head.Despite Michael's assurances that great white sharks don't like the warmer waters of the Bahamas, Ellen is haunted by nightmares and terrified of the sea. This is not ideal given Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) work underwater. She finds some solace in the company of easy going retired pilot Hoagie (Michael Caine)However, it doesn't take long before a giant Great White Shark mysteriously arrives in the Bahamas. As devout Marine Biologists, Michael and Jake decide to study the shark, keeping it a secret so as not to upset Ellen. However, when the shark attacks Thea on the beach, Ellen decides enough is enough and it's time to end her family feud once and for all.Probably the most interesting thing about The Revenge is that it opts to ignore the events of Jaws 3, despite the fact the only event that would have any bearing is a change in career path for Michael. I've always found it a bit bemusing when sequels do this, I find it a bit pompous, and in most cases actually sets the film makers up for a fall, and oh do they fall here. We're not just talking a little trip either, I mean a plunge to the very depths of cinematic purgatory.Let's get it out of the way straight off, Jaws: The Revenge is easily one of the most ridiculous movies ever made. A killer shark not only waits 9 years to get its revenge, but in the process swims from Amity, which I believe is based around New Hampshire, down to the Bahamas to try finish the job.The absolute carnival of the outrageous surrounding the movie even goes as far as the deleted sub plots: the original plan was for Michael to offend a voodoo Doctor who curses the family to death by shark, and Michael's reservations about Hoagie, which make him come across quite bratty, are revealed to be justified as he turns out to be a drug smuggler. This has got to be the first AND second cases I've ever heard of explanations for massive plot issues being cut that actually make me glad, because the terrible plot issues are still better than the intended ones.The redeeming factor of Jaws: The Revenge, is that while it is bad, it at least has the grace to do so in such a majestic manner it's almost impossible to hate. People band around the term 'so bad it's good' too often for my liking, but this really is a shining example of that ever so rare sub-category of cinema. From Mario Van Peebles awful accent to the fact it's never really clear what he and Michael are doing right up to the ending, oh the ending, The Revenge certainly never lets you grow bored.Speaking of the ending, I normally wouldn't spoil something so explicitly, but I'm not sure something this bad can be spoiled. The ending features a shark, popping it's head above water to roar (sharks have no vocal chords. Not the first, or even first Jaws film to make this mistake, but the one that beats you over the head with it) eventually leaping out and balancing on its tail long enough to have the mast of a boat sailed into it, and, depending on what version you watch, ultimately exploding. It's one of these scenes text cannot do justice to.It's also worth noting the special effects quality somehow varies depending on what version you take in. My DVD features a fairly standard rubber shark that isn't great, but does a job. I once witnessed a version on tv where in several scenes that mechanical inner workings were clearly visible in some scenes.The worst thing about The Revenge is that there were slivers of hope for it. I first saw this as a child aged about 5 and the opening sequence and the Banana Boat attacks both stayed with me and terrified me. Watching it back, both of these scenes, especially the opening, from the credits up until Sean's death, still hold up very well. I also think Lance Guest put in a passable performance as Mike, and Michael Caine is basically playing Michael Caine, but that's always good for a laugh. Composer Michael Short's score, incorporating the famous John Williams theme, is also actually very good, it would have been befitting of a better movie.Despite these few bright spots, it isn't hard to see why The Revenge has, almost 30 years later, been the last entry into the franchise. A series about killer sharks had potential to be open ended (Did Amity seriously have no shark trouble post Jaws 2?) but this took an interesting throwaway line from Rob Scheider (who famously stated Satan himself couldn't have talked him into this movie) in the second picture about if a shark could send a signal when dying to the absolute extremes, making a laughing stock of the series in the process. It's bad, really, really bad actually, but still incredibly watchable.",

They were still pretty bad in comparison to other movies with prominent use of visual effects.Thirdly, just like Jaws 3-D, the action scenes with the shark are terrible, some are even worse than Jaws 3-D's action scenes. The worst and most disappointing of them was the final showdown which although the shark had the same fate as the shark in the original Jaws, did not give me any satisfaction for the shark's death, unlike the original Jaws movie.Fourthly, the editing, cinematography, and filming are TERRIBLE, the camera angles are not good, and just by the naked eye and not paying attention to any specific details, it was quite obvious that the movie was rushed both in filming and in editing.Fifthly, the shark still roars like a lion in this movie just like in Jaws 3-D. Why does it do it more often in this movie?Sixthly, there are A LOT of plot holes, like how did the shark go all the way from Amity Island to the Bahamas, and no shark will follow a specific human being just for revenge, so the movie title does not make ANY SENSE.Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is NO tension in this movie AT ALL, there is no suspense during the entire movie, it didn't matter whether it was a shark attack or not. None of the action scenes felt tense, not even when the musical score was playing or when the shark was approaching, there was no suspense at all.Just like Jaws 3-D, Jaws The Revenge is an embarrassment to the Jaws franchise which was once praised by many for its first film and now loathed for both Jaws 3-D and Jaws The Revenge. Honestly, I am saddened at the fact that a franchise can go from critical acclaim to being unanimously loathed by critics. It is also a shame that the franchise had to end on a bad note.",

All I can say is the screenwriters should be shot and the producers should be hung.  This movie is so bad, it is actually funny!  The shark is somehow able to lift itself out of the water and make sounds (growling noises) like a tiger. Also, how does a shark explode from being impaled by a ship?? How in the world did this film get created?????  I have seen some really bad movies and this one ranks as one of the worst.",

            "content": "I've seen a lot of horror movies in my time, but I can easily say that Jaws: The Revenge is one of the scariest movies ever made.Is Jaws: The Revenge the ultimate experience in grueling horror? Yes.Is it any good? LORD NO!!! The reason Jaws: The Revenge is so scary is because it actually takes one of the best movies ever made (the original Jaws) and destroys everything enjoyable about it. Let's begin the breakdown of this cinematic piece of junk: First off, the movie starts out by not only killing Sean Brody, the little kid from the first film, but by telling us that Chief Brody died of a heart attack - and not just a heart attack, mind you, but a SHARK-INDUCED heart attack!!! Oh, the horror!!! Now, Mrs. Brody is a little upset that her son and husband were killed by sharks, so she decides that the shark is apparently RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS SHARKS IN THE SERIES AND WANTS REVENGE!!! If this doesn't make you scream in horror, read on...So Mrs. Brody decides to get away to a shark-free place...you'd think maybe Kansas or North Dakota. But NO, she goes to the flipping BAHAMAS!!! Because sharks, like, you know, are in the Bahamas and we need to keep the story going. Feel free to scream any time now.Of course, the shark that killed Sean and Chief Brody follows her!!! Just when you think a brutal wave of attacks should occur and at least make the gore-hounds happy...the film becomes a cheesy soap opera about Mrs. Brody falling in love with Hoagie, played by Michael Caine (!). I don't know if it's some sort of curse, but Oscar-winners seem to do bad movies after winning their Oscar. Halle Berry had Catwoman; Jamie Foxx had Stealth; Jennifer Connelly had Dark Water; Ben Kinglsey had Thunderbirds, Suspect Zero, and the upcoming A Sound of Thunder and Bloodrayne; and Michael Caine had this...Anyways, just when you thought it was safe to say this film couldn't get any worse, the shark makes its dramatic return, chasing her other son Michael Brody around inside a SUNKEN SHIP!!! Yeah, I'm sure a shark could maneuver around inside a boat, seeing as how they can't swim backwards and that they die if they stop swimming...The shark then goes and almost eats Mrs. Brody's daughter, but ends up killing some nameless victim we don't care about, raising the body count to a whopping two people (at this point in Jaws, the shark had eaten four people, one dog, and a holiday roast). At this point in the movie I wanted to kill myself.But it's not over yet!!! Mrs. Brody then takes a boat and goes shark-hunting (not using any bait, mind you - the shark just knows where she is). The shark then gets up out of the water and attacks the boat, roaring all the while (oh my God, this movie is B-A-D). Fortunately (or unfortunately, if you want the movie to end), Mrs. Brody is saved when Hoagie, Michael, and his buddy Jake come to the rescue in a plane. Of course, the shark EATS THE FLIPPING PLANE!!! But don't worry, everybody will be alright (and despite being in the water, Hoagie won't even be damp).Then the shark comes up out of the water and eats Jake (sort of, see below). Mrs. Brody then decides this is the last straw and steers the boat towards the roaring shark. She hits it with the front of the boat and...Ready for the ending? Because here's where I have to review the ending twice, once for each different ending.ENDING ONE: The shark roars as it bleeds to death, capsizing the boat in the process. However, everyone's okay, and it's a happy ending for the Brodys...at least, until they make a Jaws 5. There you have it, 89 minutes of pure terror.ENDING TWO: The shark BLOWS UP!!! IT REALLY BLOWS UP!!! FOR NO REASON AT ALL!!! The boat then capsizes FOR NO REAL REASON!!! And after that, despite us seeing Jake being swallowed earlier, Jake SURVIVES WITH ONLY A FEW INJURIES!!! AFTER BEING UNDERWATER FOR A GOOD TWO MINUTES IN A 25-FOOT SHARK'S MOUTH!!! Anyway, it's a happy ending for the Brodys, and I want 91 minutes (yes, there's an additional two minutes in this version) of my life back.So...is Jaws: The Revenge worth seeing? Not unless you have to see everything Jaws-related. Otherwise, you're better off stapling your eyelids shut.1 out of 10",

            "content": "This is with out of doubt the worst Jaws movie sequel ever made. Why, well here's the thing.First of all, the shark looks even cheesier than in Jaws 3D, at least in that movie it was somewhat realistic, but this comes off as cartoon-ish. Also, it roars like a lion. In real life, sharks don't roar.Another thing about this movie is that it's just boring, I mean once in a while, they'll cut to the shark, but most of it is just Terms of Endearment mixed with a shark movie. There also seems to be a scene where Michael Brody and his wife argue over not taking the garbage out, long story short, it's unnecessary.Also, you can see the metal pivot that makes the shark move. How can the creators not notice that. Also you can see some air tubes and even the mechanics that makes the jaw move up and down.It's also improbable. I mean, how can a shark go from a New York island to the Bahamas in less than 3 days. And as for the whole \"Revenge\" plot, well the shark has a very screwed up revenge plan. Oh, and if you in pail a wooden pole onto a shark, it explodes. And yes, that's how the shark dies.Now for all the negative criticism I gave this movie, I'll give credit for the acting of Michael Caine and Lance Guest, at least they were trying. I also liked the music, Michael Small did a great job composing the music. The underwater shots were also really good.But overall, this one was the worst Jaws sequel, but to be honest, it's worth checking out. I know it's strange, but I think it's one of those films where it's so bad that it's actually good. So if you're up for some absolutely horrible, but surprisingly entertaining stuff, hunt down this movie. But I still give this a 2/10",

            "content": "Okay i could go on and on about the shark in this movie. But i won't because you have most likely already heard enough about the shark from other reviewers. So basically the shark in this movie is \"Fake\".Moving on the acting in this movie to me saves it. Especially by Lorraine Gary. Now the whole idea of this movie is that Ellen Brody thinks that the shark is seeking revenge on her family. And she must kill the shark before it kills her and the rest of the Brody's.Ellen is just going crazy because she keeps losing a member of her family. And the fact that she as seen the shark at least twice in Jaws And Jaws 2. Even though the shark in this movie is not the same from the first 2 movies. She only thinks it is. This element of the plot seems logical to me.And Ellen goes to the Bahamas to try and escape the shark, but it follows her there. (Let's just say the shark owns a speed boat and got to the Bahamas in record time.) After the shark shows up and kills another person she decides enough is enough and goes to kill it. THE END.Now back to the acting part of this movie. All of the actors in this movie did what they could do with the script and all of them were successful to me. I don't know what it is about Lorraine Gary but i think any movie she is in is worth watching. However i do feel sorry for Lorraine that she had to come out of retirement to do this movie but that put aside she still was the best actor in this movie out of everyone else in it. At least thats my opinion.So all in all i will say watch this movie if you like Lorraine Gary. Because this was her last movie. And i give this movie 5/10 really just because Lorraine Gary is in it.5/10",

Meanwhile, Ellen Brody falls in  love with a pilot and begins to recover form her shark phobia, but it is reawakened when the shark attacks and/or kills several people. She boards a small boat and heads toward the shark for a final showdown.MY TAKE ON ALL OF THIS: Alright, The storyline is quite cheesy. The acting is fine. The shark ends up dying when the boat crashes into it. (It does NOT get poked with a stick, as many think,) The death is still VERY unclear. Another point, The shark only kills TWO people in the entire film. There are also many factual errors, (Shark like colder water, Sharks can't follow you across the world, They can't roar etc.) The film itself is quite bearable. After all, what would you expect from a 4th installment? The major letdown is the ENDING!! Very uncreative. The rest of the film is OK (2 of 5 stars)",

Now the room is on fire, then you're on fire and you're screaming in pain.. good news: nothing's on fire and you're not in hell. Bad news: you're brain believes you are as you're watching Jaws The Revenge... Now, I'm sure there are plenty like me that think \"Jaws\" is the greatest movie ever made. I'm also certain there are equally as many that believe this film is the worst. How was this ever made? And more importantly, why? \"spoiler alert\" it sux.. we start on familiar ground in Amity where Sean, the younger bro from the first three is now the local cop. On cue he is attacked by a shark and killed. Was it a random attack? Umm nope.. it was a shark exacting revenge on the Brody family. Are you still with me? Or have you raced to the kitchen to stick cocktail umbrella's in your eyeballs? Well the nonsense doesn't end there. The shark decides to stalk Ellen Brody to the Bahamas where she is heading to see suddenly ineptly retarded older brother, Michael who is now a marine biologist (ofcourse he is). What unfolds in the plot is the true horror of the film and sheer torture for any Jaws fan. Upon trying to exact revenge, the shark manages to navigate to the Bahamas, following Brody (in 3 days, impressive huh). Upon trying to exact revenge, the devolved remaining Brody clan decide to make it easy and sound all their time in the water. Perhaps the most bewildering aspect is why Michael Cain turned up? attempt at career suicide? Well he manages to crash his plane in the water, get attacked my the shark, but pop up on the Brody boat cracking jokes, completely dry in a newly pressed shirt...ummm. Well if you're not screaming and stabbing at your eyes by this point, you soon will be. Newly retarded Michael Brody comes up with a hair brained scream to electric shock the shark to death by putting a receiver in its mouth which shocks it when he turns the nob on his fisher price like \"shock machine\". Well while this unfolds, his equally bad friend, Jake, predictably gets attacked then disappears (presumably eaten) Well the shark makes a turn and comes in head on, while Michael turns his knob. Impossibly and ridiculously, each shock send the shark skyward like flipper and it sits out of the water roaring like a lion (yep that happened). To put us out of our misery, the last shock causes it to sit up in front of the boat and be stabbed by the boat, causing it to blow up.. yep, stabbing it with wood makes it blow up. It's safe to say that the old saying: don't go back in the water, applies here...don't go back in as you will no doubt drown by laughing to death. This is such a slaughter of the Jaws franchise and also (somehow) Manages to be worse than Jaws 3. Grab the cocktail umbrellas or perhaps take the toaster into the bath. It will be less painful than watching the revenge.",

After all, Jaws was the first movie I ever saw, and is still one of my favorite movies.  Jaws 2, a good sequel, showing the aftermath of the original and showing how the Brodys are coping with what happened.  Jaws 3, pointless.  Mike Brody (the oldest son) works at Sea World?  After all the problems he had with sharks and the ocean he works at Sea World?  And that brings us to this one.  Where to begin?  There may be slight spoilers ahead. Okay, number 1:  The sharks attacks and kills Sean Brody (the younger of the two sons).  The shark is apparently to blame for the death of Martin Brody, who died of a heart attack.  The shark tries to kill Mike Brody.  The shark comes close to killing the annoying Thea Brody.  Notice a pattern? The same shark is hunting down the whole Brody clan.  Not only that, but it follows Ellen Brody from Amity all the way to the Bahamas.  Does it has radar or something?  Number 2:  At the end, Mike uses some sort of device to torture the shark.  This device makes the shark roar like a lion and stand on its tail.  Number 3:  Why did Mike become a marine biologist if he hates the water so much?  Number 4:  Jake (another marine biologist) is attacked by the shark and dragged under the water.  About 10 minutes later he pops back up, very much alive?  How the hell did he survive the attack and staying under water for 10 minutes?  No wonder the TV version cuts that out, leaving the viewer to believe that he died.  Number 5:  How can Michael Caine land his plane in the water and have it float on the surface?  Number 6:  Why did Michael Caine miss out on the Academy Awards (which he won an Oscar but was too busy filming to accept it) to make this piece of trash film?  To sum it all up, very, very bad.  In the future, the next clan of sharks should hunt down a new family, preferably the ones who made this one.",

But a lot of inconsistencies and idiotic, laughable things occur in Jaws the Revenge. One of the most famous is the scene where the shark stands on its tail in the water and almost leaps onto Mrs. Brody's tiny boat.  Apparently she wasn't told of her husband's quote about getting a bigger boat.  Her dreams/nightmares provide her with memories of things she couldn't possibly have seen but not that one.  Michael Caine brings nothing to the film, except for the novelty of the fact that he couldn't pick up his first Oscar because he was filming this movie!  Lucky for him he won a second one (I think they felt sorry that he missed out for this trash film).  No suspense, no horror, bad acting, horrible writing.  They only green-lighted this based on the concept, you see.  They thought 'Gee, we can make money with another Jaws movie.  How 'bout if the shark is angry and wants revenge.'  That would've been fine...if they had attempted to make a smarter movie.I've seen a lot of bad movies but this one is among the very worst.

Ironically, but to be fair, the film does start reasonably well, it has to be said, but the problem with the first attack is that it is predictable and in that, you know what's going to happen and the suspense has disappeared - they could've made the appearance of the shark a bit more unexpected and dramatic and that would've made the opening scene more effective.It was nice to see Lorraine Gary again - she is a good actress but she shouldn't have returned to this vehicle. The premise that a shark can hold a grudge is ridiculous in itself in the notion it killed her son. They should have changed the plot to show that it was a random attack and that Gary should've taken the shark on herself or done something following a few more attacks.Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary's relationship is an attempt to go in the right direction though and it is simple enough and not much can be faulted there, in fairness.The problem is, the attacks are few and far between and all family targeted by the shark - the banana boat sequence I thought was a good idea but the problem is, its too familiar and by this time, people knew the shark was rubber. Now we have CGI, who knows what they could do with Jaws.As said, the premise would've been better had it begun with Sean's demise as a random attack and various other attacks, leading to a showdown with Gary and the shark under different circumstances - a lot of things needed to be changed and that's why it failed as a film though its certainly not the worst film I've ever seen - that accolade belongs to Traffic.",

            "content": "I can't believe some of the commenters on the IMDb bemoan the idea of the shark taking revenge. Yes I know it's utterly absurd too, but you could have at least guessed from reading the film title surely...Like every series of films, each installment attempts to bring something new to the party. The original was a classic of man vs. nature, fear of the unknown; Jaws 2 - a pale imitation - introduced the idea of a group of friends in peril; Jaws 3 - utter bilge - at least restricted the boundaries by setting itself in an aquarium; and I like to think Jaws 4 set out to be the comedy version of the franchise.Personally I believe the mistake made here was focusing on the shark itself. It seems tiresome to mention it again, for so many others have pointed it out, but for a family who've suffered such numerous and deadly shark attacks as the Brodies, the answer really is simply to move inland. It's here that the opportunity was wasted.Since we know it isn't the same shark doing the attacking, no-one can credibly believe that a family can be this unlucky. So why not pursue this angle instead? The \"bad luck family\"? \"Jaws\" is a fairly generic term, no-one said it had to relate to sharks. So how about this as a proposal: Brody family up sticks and move to Canadian wilderness, start new life in small town community, before being terrorised by rabid free-roaming bear (Jaws 5). What's left of them up sticks and moves to China to settle in dirty Shanghai suburb, only to again be confronted by a ferocious maneating street panda (Jaws 6). Geddit? Lovely jubbly, franchise restored, Oscars all round.In the meantime, sit back, stick \"Jaws: The Revenge\" on, open a beer and laugh a la Naked Gun, for that is all this tripe really is.",

Sean Brody is eaten in the first few minutes.  So Eileen Brody goes nuts.  She says the shark deliberately killed Sean cuz' he's a Brody and that Sheriff Broady died of his heart attack years ago cuz' he was thinking about the shark.  So Eileen wants to get away from sharks.  Hmm, Nebraska? Iran? NO! Bermuda!!! Not only that, but this shark somehow got the Brody's flight arrangements and swam to the exact right island before they even arrived!  Aside from the fact that this is completely ridiculous, a question comes to mind.  If there is a drive behind this shark what is it? Is it the same shark from the previous flicks and just keeps regrouping itself like the T-1000?  Or is simply a family member?Anyway, Mike Brody works down at the Bahamas with his Jamaican stereotype friend collecting conch shells.  Oh did I fail to mention that every time a Broady family member is attacked, Ellen's shark radar hits in? She can be clear across another island parting with Mike Caine and just go into trances. No need to worry though.  Michael Brody can escape no just the shark, but the bends by using his oxygen tank to shoot himself to the surface.Bad plot, bad acting, bad writing, maybe you can just sit back, hit the mute and just watch the flick like a mindless slasher, WRONG!  The body count is 2 (maybe 3), and the shark is the most fake piece of muppet scraps ever put in the water! And the people who do get killed just fall into the shark's gaping mouth! no lie! And ah, the climax.  If you are a MSTie, this is the sole propose of watching the movie.  The ending will shock you in the worst way ever. *Spoiler*Weeeeeel, Eileen has had enough.  She decides to steal a yacht and go out into the ocean for a final battle.  How she's gonna kill the thing, well she'll cross that bridge when she gets to it I guess.  The cast catches up to them, gets killed by the shark, oh wait, no they don't. Then they put a light in the shark, which makes it roar (Yes roar! As in lion roar!). Apparently, by now the writer decides that he's killed the movie totally, he decides to throw in some dolphin-esque aerobatics to the shark.  We're talking big, full out of the water, 5+ seconds of hang time.  In the past 3 films we've seen a shark get exploded (2 times) and electrocuted.  How does he bite it this time?  Poked.  Yep, poked by a damn stick! Instant head explosion, complete rip off of the classic film.  Hell it even had footage from the first film! In flashbacks! In flashbacks where no other living human could remember!! I've learned there is a directors cut of this movie.  They completely changed the ending for home video.  I thought for a second \"Damn right they changed it!\".  I see the movie, all they changed was allowing the Jamaican guy to live! That's it! Of all the things to change in that movie they make that comic relief bastard survive falling into the shark's open mouth! His explanation for surviving \"I guess he didn't like my taste Mon!\" ARRRRRGGG I hate this movie!!",

All right then (yawn). I also hoped to at least some good shark special effects. This movie ranks a 0 on my rankings list; it might have made a 4 with a good shark.

But it wasn't. It was a total waste of film. After I saw it, I decided to throw this movie, and everything connected to it and the third one in the garbage, and I advise every Jaws fan to do the same before they do something they'd regret.Oh, and not to give away the ending or anything, but the shark explodes when punctured by a piece of wood, and the shot of it sinking down to the depths of the ocean is exactly the same shot as in the original film after Brody blew it up with the oxygen tank and shotgun.

Lorraine Gary reprises her role as the now widowed Ellen Brody who finds herself reliving the horrors of the past when a mammoth shark kills her son. Grief-stricken, she travels to the Bahamas to be with her other son, a marine biologist (Lance Guest), and his family. There she meets and falls for a carefree airplane pilot (Michael Caine). But just as she is putting her life back together, the nightmare of the past returns when her granddaughter is attacked by an all-too-familiar Great White. Determined to end the terror once and for all, Ellen sets out for a showdown to the death. The action and tension build rapidly to a shattering climax in this, the most incredible Jaws adventure of them all. And this time, it's personal!NO IT'S NOT, IT'S RIDICULOUS!This film is a must see for all the wrong reasons. It's one of those films that's so bad it's actually brilliant. Don't confuse it with such abysmal films like Independence Day, Armageddon or the truly obscene 2012, these pictures are just big-budget garbage that trivialises the subtext. No, what I'm talking about is a film that's has noticeably lost its way during filming. Whether it's down to costs, script changes, actor hitches or good old fashioned executive interference, a film that's so fragmented the bloody thing should've been abandoned.A good comparison I suppose is David Fincher's Alien 3; it's believed that three endings were filmed (I've even read many more scenes were filmed post-production) coupled with endless script changes, actors walking away due to other commitments and many production fines meant that filming became a nightmare.In Jaws IV something similar has clearly happened; what you see is a plot of such ludicrous incredulity that you cannot believe your eyes. Ignore MCA Universal Home Video's official film account because in one sentence the story goes something like this: The great white stalks Chief Brody's widow to the Caribbean for a final showdown. Thereby inferring that sharks have scruples, can reason, have the ability to track humans on-land and can hold a grudge; I mean, I knew they were intelligent but c'mon?!!Okay, let's start with the main protagonist THE SHARK: it's still a cheap prosthetic and in some clips the unobservant amongst you can see the vehicle driving the contraption; the observant should just be laughing and shaking your head. I don't think this 'glaring error' is meant to be included in the final cut, but whatever the reason for its inclusion, the Director didn't feel the need to 'fuzz-it' out. Perhaps he was contemplating suicide at this point! (Later edits have masked the mechanics, so try and get hold of an old VHS/DVD of the original release and laugh out loud)ELLEN BRODY (played by Lorraine Gary): As wooden as a work-mate and as 'hammy' as Derek Jacobi in everything he's ever done! This was Gary's final acting role; I wonder, was she pushed or did she jump?HOAGIE NEWCOMBE (played by Michael Caine): I just don't know what to say; he dances in one scene, brilliantly awful (oxymoron for you) as ever!I'm going to sign-off now, but listen-out for Mario Van Peebles' (Jake) dreadful West Indian accent!The film doubled its money, so who am I to judge?Box Office (Source: IMDb) Budget: $23,000,000 (estimated) Opening Weekend: $7,154,890 (USA) (19 July 1987) Gross: $51,881,013 (Worldwide)Other rubbish, but unintentionally funny films are: Shocker, Judge Dredd, Speed, Highlander, Backdraft, Rambo: First Blood Pt 2, War of the Worlds (2005), Total Recall, Contact, The Abyss, Dracula (1992), The Time Machine (1960)...the 2002 version was 'rubbish' only, The Black Hole...oh my Lord they're endless.",

Sure, the island scenery is gorgeous to look at and there are plenty of pretty girls but, yikes, that first reveal of the shark is the final blow to any credibility that this movie was hoping to have.The alternate TV version, in an attempt to make some sense of what the viewer is about to see, adds a needless voice over that only serves to make the entire premise of the movie even more absurd.This was near the top of my bad movie list (just before MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE) but both have been displaced by Timothy Hines' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.

            "content": "There are a lot of bad movies out there, some would argue there are more bad movies than good. Of course, that would depend on one's taste. For this movie, taste does not even need to play a factor. This movie is bad. Really bad. Some bad movies are actually enjoyable to watch in small doses. For example, look at Battlefield Earth: the screenplay is poorly-written and almost painful to listen to, the science is completely wrong, and there is no effort put into the acting. However, if you interpret it as an unintentional comedy, it can be pleasurable. There's also Alone in the Dark: Horrid script, wooden acting, but at least the visuals are somewhat nice to look at. This movie... has no redeeming value. I hate it. I hate it so much that if given the chance, I would obliterate every copy of it and erase it from history.The first Jaws was brilliant: Masterfully-placed suspense, dedicated acting, and a crafty plot. The best part was the shark model. In this movie, Steven Spielberg was careful not to overuse the shark model so that it would look authentic. That was the main point of brilliance. The first Jaws is definitely one of the 100 best movies I have ever seen in my life.The second Jaws was okay. It wasn't as exciting or as developed as the first, but I still had fun.The third Jaws... almost immediately I saw things that could be improved. I thought it was really bad, definitely the worst of the three.Little did I know that a certain abomination was lying just around the corner:Jaws... THE REVENGE.This may not be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, but believe me; it's at least in the bottom five.I'll tell just what it is about it that makes it so horrendous:First of all, there's the actual premise: A SHARK trying to get REVENGE on humans? Okay, so the Brodys have previously killed four white great white sharks. Why would another one suddenly want revenge? And for that matter, how would it even know how to sort humans out?You see what I mean? Just the idea itself is beyond ridiculous. But here's the actual movie:After killing Sean, the shark actually FOLLOWS Ellen Brody from Amity to the Bahamas. Again, how does a shark track human that is not in the water? It can't!Also, almost straight away, you notice how such little effort is put into the acting.They also have Michael Caine. Here's what's sad: Michael Caine MISSED receiving his award for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscar ceremony in 1987 because he was busy filming THIS pathetic excuse for a film. Good lord, Michael; you should know better!Then there's the introduction of some new characters: Michael Brody's wife, his daughter, and his Jamacian friend. All three of these characters are so annoying that I wish I could have just fast-forwarded through their scenes. But, alas, I sat through every moment of torture.This movie is also more focused on the lives of the characters than it is on the shark.Speaking of which, here is by far the worst part of the movie: the shark model.This shark model is about as fake as they get. It makes the models from the Shark Attack films and the Mega Shark vs. Whatever-The-Hell movies look authentic.It did not scare me. Not for one millisecond. In fact, only the shark from the first movie really took my breath away for any amount of time. I was too busy laughing and crying at how fake this model was. I was laughing because it was stupid, and I was crying because it was ruining the first Jaws with its terrible quality.But there's more! The shark actually ROARS. Yes, it freaking ROARS. Guess what people! Sharks now have vocal cords!But wait until you hear about the fate of the shark: They impale it with the bow on their yacht, and it... explodes. Yes, apparently Sharks have nitroglycerin or something for blood now.Words cannot express how much I hate this movie. My hatred for this movie is so great that it's almost unhealthy.People, do not see this movie. You will regret it. You will regret sitting through even one second of this sh*t fest.If you do decide to go see it... be ready.You've been warned.",

It doesn't even deserve that high a rating. Why does Hollywood insist on knocking out sequel after sequel and why don't they know when to stop? Jaws 1 was exceptional with Jaws 2 being okay, still very watchable. Jaws the Revenge was so far fetched that only an idiot would enjoy it.We are supposed to believe that a shark somehow knows who is a Brody and even knows when these Brody's leave Amity and head down to the Caribbean! Did you know sharks were that smart? Why aren't scientists doing way more research on them? Naturally all the Brody boys still work on or near the water, when most certainly after what they witnessed as children, they would be living in a desert somewhere nowhere near any body of water. But then the makers of this film couldn't have blessed us with this 2 hour waste of time.The ending is so ridiculous as to be almost funny. Someone please tell me why Ellen Brody thinks she can catch this shark all by herself to finally end \"The Revenge\". Give me a break. Then she acts like she's on tranquilizers and needs serious help mentally. But she manages to actually spear the shark on a part of the bow. HURRAY!

This movie has far too many impossibilities like a jet speeding shark (a shark beating a plane to the Bahamas?), a growling shark, a roaring shark, an exploding shark, a sharks that sets traps up, a shark and human with some sort of psychic interaction. It never ends!The really sad thing is that the first Jaws movie (which was fantastic by the way!) didn't even have half the budget of The Revenge but made almost half a billion dollars in profit, whereas The Revenge had over double the first movies budget but made less than $30M profit. It really goes to show that modern technology doesn't pay off, doesn't it?Apart from all the crazy ideas thought up in the storyline, it seems as though there was absolutely no effort whatsoever put into the making of this movie. There are endless mistakes that are clearly seen throughout the movie like the wires and tracks where the mechanical shark is swimming, the shark skin tones changing, fake backgrounds... Many of which could of been prevented or at least made less obvious.Sequels almost always seem to ruin the original movie. Perhaps this movie was made to try and get everyone to forget about the disaster of a movie Jaws 3 made, but compared to this movie, Jaws 3 deserves a golden globe.1/10",

After Sean is killed by another shark, Ellen decides to head down to the Bahamas with her other son Michael (from the first 3 films). According to Michael, there has never been a great white shark down there, because it is too warm for them. Things get ridiculous when the shark follows them to the Bahamas to seek revenge.

Sure, there are more worse movies, but they may not have had the advantage of a budget or the backing of a major studio, OR of being a \"Jaws\" for that matter.  This is a travesty from start to finish. The movie should have been titled \"Jaws, The Quest To Be Eaten\".  Every character seems to go out of their way to literally throw themselves in the path of the shark.  Correct that, \"character\" is the wrong word. Caricature is the term.  Also, even \"shark\" is inadequate to describe our wee beastie of nature.  Supersonic shark is the more correct description as \"Bruce IV\" manages to swim half the length of a continent in three days.  He also, honest to god, roars. Yes, roars.  Sure, whatever.  The plot is a meandering mess, establishing certain story and character development points, only to completely forget about them when the next scene roles around.  Though it's not like you particularly care about any body anyway.  The acting would embarrass Anson Williams.  Again, it's easy to pick on the likes of Lorraine Gary or Lance Guest.  They are obviously not real actors and are merely taking a paycheck.  If they themselves think they can act, well, delusions delusions.  It is Michael (pay me! pay me!) Caine and Mario (I'm not a stereotype!) Van Peeples that should know better.This movie makes \"Yor: Hunter From the Future\" look like a taut, masterfully crafted artistic triumph. nuff said.",

They have applied human logic to a brainless instinctual fish, and it has resulted in this garbage, this pinnacle of idiocy, sharks don't take mates, they don't have families, they are loners except for perhaps in the occasion of a frenzy. And as for the destruction of this shark, the viewer has literally no clue as to what has just happened, I mean literally they do not. The shark begins to roar like a lion, and rears upright, (like it can do that somehow), and is being shocked by some electromagnetic device they fed to it, and then having a flashback to her husband killing the first shark when she was never even there, Ellen Brody crashes the jagged bow of her ship into the shark and pops its head, and as far as I can fathom, she must have stabbed the device, or some such nonsense, because next thing, the ship has fallen to pieces from the force of the collision.

For crying out loud, why didn't the family just move to another costal place if they were that fond of the sea. Why, oh, why did they insist on staying at a place where 4 great white sharks have hunted and killed a multitude of people in the last 20 odd years?

Anywho, Jaws and the Revenge is the story of a shark who swims around looking for people named Brody. Oscar winner Adrien Brody, rocking guitarist Brody Dalle, ostensibly foreign pro wrestler Bruiser Brody, if your name is Brody, the shark would like to have a quick this-and-that with you. Ellen Brody is a mother who lives on Amity Island and after losing a husband to post-traumatic disorder after killing not one but two of the these buggers, and seeing her son turn into Dennis Quaid for the last movie, is letting her young son work in law enforcement. Her only caveat is that he only go close enough to the water where the shark can lunge (and baby, the shark in this movie got some moves!) and chew his arms off. The shark does, but then the son leans forward to yell at it. The shark then eats the rest of the son. Ellen has had enough of this and moves with her surviving son, who is no longer Dennis Quaid, to the Bahamas. The shark decides that's cool with him, and he swims down there before they can get there in their plane. Not exactly a fast plane, there. Upon arriving we meet the rest of the cast. There's Lenny, played Jamaicanly by Mario Van Peebles, who you may recall from his other work, unless you've never heard of him. And of course Chewie, played by Michael Caine, who like Louis Gossett Jr before him, used winning an Academy Award as a stepping stone to get involved with this franchise. (Look it up). How Jaws got Revenge is about the mind of a killing machine, who swims, eats, and gets revenge. Ellen takes things into her own hands and drives a boat to find this shark. Peebles' character is grabbed by the shark and dragged under water. Don't worry kids, he's totally fine though. This shark is aggressive though. He roars, bellows, moos, coughs, and growls. Chewie is very attracted to Ellen Brody, who after four movies of this would probably like to change her name from Brody. Chewie, in a role that would establish Michael Caine as a legend, is insatiable in his quest for her. He roars, bellows, moos, coughs, and growls. At the end of the day, The Revenge of Jaws will keep you on the edge of your seat, white-knuckled, biting your lip, making you wonder what will happen next. After seeing this film you will know what the words \"revenge\" and \"personal\" truly, truly mean. And knowledge, unlike sharks, is something that will never just come and go.

Its true, seldom does one come across a film so awful, that it actually inspires admiration for the people who made. Whoever they are however, i'm sure that they have long since been fired from the film industry. I might be a tad mean, but the gap in quality between Jaws and Jaws the Revenge is so massive, i don't think another one exists in the entire history of cinema. The one star a gave to this film is for the guts of the filmmakers to actually attempt putting such a lame, and utterly pathetic film on the film reel.The only good aspect of this film is the music, although it variates on the classic John Williams tune, as it allows one to close their eyes while watching the film, and admire the music. But then there's the roaring shark (really, a roaring shark? you must be kidding? sharks don't roar!) Oh, they do, in this film apparently. Actually both the shark and anyone watching this film has something in common when it comes to jaws. the shark is using its jaws to chow people, while your jaws are hitting the floor. Oh yes, and did i mention that the shark also seeks revenge on the Brody (Sharks don't seek revenge! What are you talking about?) Yep, thats what makes this film truly unique. A shark, probably a second cousin 5000 times removed from the original Bruce. Apparently Matin Brody has died from a heart attack from \"FEAR\"! Like he new another Great White was coming to attack the town. Its like he had some sort of telepathic link with it. (That's impossible!) I know it is.I don't think anyone enjoyed seeing young Sean Brody getting killed like that, especially considering that he is the little kid from JAWS, who everyone thought was so cute for imitating his father's movements like that. AND, you know what? The SHARK LAYS AN AMBUSH!!!!!!! Wow, i bet you'd never heard of that in the history of cinema. In fact this film is so bad, that almost every Jaws spinnoff is better than it, and that's just insulting.Also, this film leaves Amity island and takes place in the Bahamas. Unless the shark flew, or hitched a ride on a speed boat, which is the only way it would have gotten there in time, this doesn't help the credibility of this picture. Oh, and for peaks sake, in the sharks death scene, they actually had the nerve to steal a shot of the original film. That i admire. That, and the whole roaring shark shark thing. Apart from that, the film has undeveloped characters, a crappy story, and is 87 minutes long, which is just unbearable for such junk. Oh, and just for the record, great white sharks cannot stop moving, or else they stop living. Someone should tell that to the films director.",

Lorraine Gary's performance is...well, melodramatic (I suppose with the tragic death of her husband, she should be). Really, her performance is inspired...by needing money, I suppose. Maybe she had a heroin addiction to feed. Doubtless, she made millions from this film. I'm sure that the famous Joseph Sargent (who was mostly a TV director and has never actually made a decent film) thought that the script was money, and the film would make his career. Or end it (he has not directed a film since, only television). All in all, Jaws: The Revenge is an epic (as epic as a flatulent attack) end to an exciting motion picture quadrilogy. I'm still waiting for the nine-disk boxed set, complete with the 3-D version of number 3 (which is quite possibly even worse than Revenge).",

            "content": "This is the worst sequel I have ever seen. It is terrible to the point of insulting. For those of you who have not seen this appalling film, please click back now.Now this is set some time after the events of Jaws 2. For some reason Jaws 3-D never happened. Anyway Ellen Brody's son is on patrol one night, until he is ambushed and killed by a Great White Shark. This is one of the least suspenseful death scenes in movie history. It tries to get you into the classic Jaws spirit, since you can't exactly see the shark and it has the same sort of music. But you can't help but notice its many mistakes. For example it is implied Sean's arm has been taken off by the shark, so why is almost all his coat sleeve still intact? Ellen is devastated at this, but then seems oddly alright with it after-wards.When her eldest Michael and his family go to the Bahamas for Christmas he convinces her to come with him. On the way, Ellen meets a Sub sandwich called Hoagie. In an effort to make this film good \"Hoagie\" is Michael Caine who missed an Oscar ceremony to stay on set filming this. Anyway the shark somehow manages to swim all the way to the Bahamas in pursuit of the Brodys. While hunting for shells, Michaels boat is attacked by the shark. For some reason Michael says they should not tell anyone of this incident. Since no-one else can deal with this shark apparently, Michael and his friend Jake try and track the shark but fail.Assuming everything is safe again, Michael goes down to the ocean to study shells. After his Submersible is wrecked by the shark, he escapes and goes into a sunken ship. After barely escaping that funny attack, he insists on looking for the shark the next day. Unable to find the shark in the ocean depths, it is soon realized it is going to attack Carla's art celebration party. The shark appears and eats a woman on a banana boat ride. Another mistake is the fact the woman deliberately puts her leg into the shark's mouth. You will not find it hard to notice this! Ellen, convinced she can stop a giant killer shark, steals Michael's boat and heads off to find the shark. Michael, Jake and Sandwich successfully find Ellen but then crash the plane. Although it looks like 'Hoagie' has been eaten, he emerges with a freshly ironed shirt. When Jake realizes he can use his flashlight-tracker thing, he decides he can put it directly in the sharks mouth where it won't be chewed or digested. The shark then leaps out and chews him up! Michael uses Jake's invention to make the shark levitate above the water. When Ellen takes control of the boat she rams the gunwale into the shark. It somehow manages to blow it to pieces like it had explosives strapped to it. Now several mistakes can be noticed in this rushed sequence of the film. Why does Ellen have flashbacks of an event she wasn't there for? Why does the shark roar like a tiger? Why did the shark explode? Why did it almost hover above the water? Why and how does Ellen have some sort of psychic connection to the shark? How did Jake survive? All these questions are never answered.To sum up, Jaws: The Revenge is not only a terrible sequel,it is just a terrible film. It drops suspense, horror and laws of physics completely. Why couldn't they just leave it at the third Jaws film? This one should just be forgotten.",

The ending is totally unclear and you basically want it to come quickly. Yeah, the fact that a shark actually follows a woman to the Bahamas, as if guided by some force is pretty darn impossible, and there are some little details that sort of add to the disaster, such as Ellen's flashbacks of her son Sean sitting at that kitchen table playing with his dad, which Ellen didn't actually see according to Jaws 1.Good points: The music is good, the setting of the Bahamas is beautiful, small things like Ellen's daughter in law's sculpture looking like a shark's face are quite cool, some of the acting is good, some scenes are memorable (like when Jake, Ellen's son's friend who's a stereotypical Caribbean man is in the underwater pod seeking out snails and Jaws sort of pulls up alongside and he goes on his microphone 'Oh god, we've got a big fish down here man'), and the bananaboat scene is good too, although you can spot that the fin racing behind it is just a fin attached to a piece of cardboard, and also there are some tense scenes like Michael being chased around a shipwreck by Jaws.Bad points: Sharks don't really roar (!), the shark swimming underwater looks the fakest out of all the Jaws films, many things are unclear such as how Jaws dies in the end, the story of a shark having a vendetta against a family is ridiculous, the name 'Hoagie' (Caine's character) is even more ridiculous, Ellen's shoulder pads are even more ridiculous than that, the final scenes are obviously filmed in a swimming pool with high walls as you can see that there are waves bouncing against a wall  a few metres from the characters, that has been painted grey with a few clouds here and there, and do you want me to go on?",

This movie is awful from death of a Brody, how in the name of all that is sacred did that happen.  In the three other movies they could be in dire straits but they made it out okay.  Well Chief Brody's baby boy Sean is dead.  Thank heavens Roy Scheider's character was killed off, because I like Roy Scheider and I would have hated for him to take an ACTIVE part in this film.  And if you thought the beginning was lame the middle is jumbled and put together like some 5 year old found some footage lying on the floor and decided to edit the thing himself.  What the heck is up with the psychic link between the shark and Mrs. Brody.  And how did Mrs. Brody have flashbacks of what happened on the Orca(from Jaws 1975) where Chief Brody says the classic line, \"Smile you son of a b*tch,\" (That's what I meant Scheider didn't take an ACTIVE part, but some how some way he was put in there passively.)I never feel sorry for rich successful people but, I do feel some sorrow for Michael Caine.  Here is a man who is one great actor and can hold his own with any other actor dead or alive and he decides to keep filming this drech instead of going to the Oscar ceremony, where he ended up winning.  And then at this year's ceremony no one let Michael forget his error.I also want to point out something, which is a common theme here, which is I hate this movie.  Not so much that it is bad, no I hate this movie because it is so awful and that it carries the name Jaws and it ends up soiling the name of an AWESOME film.  Jaws (1975) frightened audiences as well as it captured the imagination of the audience.  The original triumphed at the box office and became a critical and fan favorite.  And the death scenes from the girl at the beginning to Quint being bitten in two were intense and we knew the deaths were coming we didn't know when.  By the time we get to Jaws4 the deaths are laughable and the shark is so fake, why did they show that piece of scrap plastic so much, it took away from any chance that it would frighten the audience. Also the deaths weren't engaging at all in Jaws 4 heck I rooted for the shark to kill off Hoagie, which didn't happen, and I rooted for the shark when it killed Jake, which I guess there is a version where Jake lives (that's criminal).  Another IMDB member wrote that in the other two the deaths of the sharks were done by explosion or electricution and in this one the damn thing got poked in the neck AND (get this) EXPLODED. Like Eric Cartman from South Park I must say something to those who made this \"film\":(In a Cartman Voice): I hate you guys so much, you are hella stupid and lame.  Oh God how I hate you, really, really, really hate you.  You guys suck!I HOPE EVERYONE AGREES THAT THIS WAS A LAME MOVIE AND SHOULD ONLY BE SHOWN AS A TORTURE DEVICE OR IN A FILM CLASS ENTITLED \"WHAT NOT TO DO 101\"I also must say that if you do know some one who likes this movie, and doesn't have an IQ of a vegetable, please smack them.    Then again I don't even know someone with the IQ of a vegetable that likes this movie, but if you do meet that rare individual please smack them I believe it is a constitutional right.",

It's simply impossible.Also, sharks do not telepathically communicate with humans! The shark wouldn't have even cared if Brody had killed it's parents, if it had any emotion, it would have been gratitude, because it's parents would have wanted to kill it! Lastly, SHARKS DO NOT ROAR! They are not capable of making any noise at all! (This is a spoiler) But, at the ending, the sharks leaps up, and holds it's self there, which a shark cannot do, roaring like Godzilla, while they impale it with the boat, and it EXPLODES. Come on!

How did the shark get to the Bahamas in 3 days?2. How did it know what beach Ellen brody would be on, let alone what island?3. Why would she go to vacation to a place that is SURROUNDED by water? If your entire family was eaten alive by sharks, wouldn't you move to, let's say, an apartment??This movie is just another good example of bad writing.  The writer, and I say writer because there's no way in hell two people could write something this dumb, needed 1) a shark, 2) some water, and 3) Ellen Brody.  And since he couldn't write his way out of a paper bag, the end result is Jaws IV: the Revenge.  The Revenge?  More like Jaws 4: The Pitiful Attempt to Cash In.",

Jaws was a masterpiece and is something that I would be able to watch over and over again.  Jaws 2 is a great follow up to the original.  Jaws 3 was said to be a bad movie however it was something that I was able to relate to pretty easy and I didn't think it was all that bad. However Jaws:The Revenge wasn't a good way to end the other movies. This movie started out good and then went down and stayed down for the rest of the movie.  The first 15 minutes were good and I started to enjoy the movie.  When the movie was up to the part where they flew to the Bahamas that whole scene ruined it.  There is no way what so ever that a shark can swim from a small northern resort all the way to the Bahamas at the exact same time the mother had been there.  The movie had lacked originality and the acting was horrible some scenes were so unreal they were laughable. The last scene of the movie featured the main characters on a boat in the middle of the ocean attempting to destroy the shark.  The plan was for them to shock him to death with an unusual device but instead they rammed the boat into him and the piece of wood on the front of the boat caused the shark to explode.  The shark also stood up almost jumping completely out of the water and stood up in its tail roaring like a dinasaur from Jurassic Park.  All in all I give this movie one star and I would recommend this movie to anyone who feels like being disappointed over something that looks like a good movie.",

Tragically, this was not the case with \"Jaws\".Just to highlight the remarkable capability of Hollywood's cinematic alchemists to turn gold into lead, I must hasten to remind the reader that the original \"Jaws\" was an excellent film that set a high standard for the horror genre. Spielberg's original (which I gave an IMDb score of 9/10) stands, with the original \"Alien\", as one of the exemplars of my #1 rule for horror films. Don't let the audience get a good look at the monster -- until it's too late! Who ever would have thought that a simple dorsal fin could be so scary? Who even knew what a dorsal fin was before they saw \"Jaws\"?But back to the grim task at hand, \"Jaws: The Revenge\" flagrantly violates this rule. If you get to see the shark all the time (and it's easy to see how poorly constructed the \"shark\" is as another reviewer has pointed out) then it's not scary. At all. Once that happens, what's the point of making a horror movie?Let's talk about the title -- \"Jaws: The Revenge\". They really, honestly, sincerely mean that. It's not one of those movies where the monster goes berserk and the body count soars with gruesome special effects galore. No, not that type of revenge. You know, the type of movie where a sleazy corporate lawyer talking too loudly on his cellphone wades a couple of feet into the water and then ... CHOMP! (And the whole audience cheers.) I could imagine enjoying a movie like that -- in the right mood.But I did not enjoy \"Jaws: The Revenge\". At all. When they say \"revenge\" they mean that other, human type of revenge. The shark actually has a personal vendetta against some poor woman throughout the movie, then jumps out of the water and roars at her. Now there are just three problems that I have with that.1. The shark has a personal vendetta against a human being.2. The shark jumps out of the water.3. The shark roars.Maybe it's just me, but I have a great deal of difficulty believing that any fish would or could do such things. Maybe in an animated feature where the fish also talk to each other and sing songs. Tragically, this was not such a movie.The last straw for me is the abuse of genuinely talented, famous movie stars in this picture. Tragically, Michael Caine, Lynn Whitfield, and Mario and Melvin Van Peebles were all tricked into appearing in \"Jaws: The Revenge\". That may be my biggest bad-movie pet peeve. A low-budget schlock-fest with no-name actors is one thing. I can almost forgive the makers of \"Manos: Hands of Fate\". (Almost.) But when a major Hollywood studio drags good actors we know and like through a festering pile of manure like \"Jaws: The Revenge\", I cannot forgive that. At all.IMDb Score: 1 out of 10 (only because I can't give it a 0)",

Last week I gave up watching Jaws 3 to do something more interesting (paint my nails). Until yesterday night I didn't even know that \"Jaws : The Revenge\" existed. I have seen it. Now I can die. I have seen everything. This movie is so bad I don't even know where to start. The plot is awful. If my whole family were chased and eaten by giant sharks every time they are near a coast, I would settle somewhere in Siberia, thousands of miles away from the nearest ocean. I would not become a sort of coast guard. Nor would I become a marine biologist. And I would definitely NOT go on holiday on an island! The acting is terrible. It was even more painful since I watched the French version. The dubbing made me laugh to tears, with word-to-word translations that don't even mean anything in French (you've got to translate it back into English to understand the meaning). Everything has already been said by more talented reviewers about this huge rubber puppet that can swim 2000 miles in 2 days, survive in warm water, roar (???!!) and stand on its tail above the water. And it must be filled with hydrogen or something like that because when it is impaled on a wooden stick, it EXPLODES! I watched the last 20 minutes without a word.

The cinematography actually is ok camerawork and lighting wise. It's the fact that the scenes themselves are filled with either boring nonsensical scenes or outright batshit insane plot scenes that makes it bizarrely terrible. The music isn't good either, its a mix of boring generic cinematic music and the actual Jaws theme with literally no change to it from the first and its barely used. The editing and pacing are horrifically bad because its filled with boring subplots about Michael and his Mother that literally contribute nothing to the plot and are not well acted. The acting slowly gets worse in this. Easily Michael is the worst character and is terrible and makes just a dumb choice to not tell his family about the shark and never gets scared. Making the Mother have a telepathic connection with the shark is one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of for a character in a movie ever. The special effects are terrible as the shark is constantly stiff and looks fake even more so than the other films. It's such a shame because this is such a nice location this takes place in as well. The dumb choices characters make like not going to the final confrontation without any weapons, the dumb ways characters are written, the SUPER DUMB plot, the horrifically boring middle of this that contributes nothing to the plot, the bizarre in between movie backstory of what happened to Roy Schneider, and no tension in the slightest makes this one of the worst sequels and films ever made. You know I have to say the worst part for me wasn't even the Roaring Shark or the dumb plot...it was the beyond BORING subplots in the middle of the film where Michael and his Mom have there romance subplots and family issues...It's soooo boring. I'm honestly recommending this though for anyone who wants to learn what makes a terrible sequel and a bad movie in general.",

I'm more impressed than disappointed. Even the title doesn't make sense it completely contradicts an important line in Jaws 2 where a scientist points out \"Sharks don't make things personal Chief Brody\"  however this shark has so much vengeance in him he swims from one ocean to another, that's not even possible for a shark for fack sake. Its as if they only did this for money\u2026\u2026\u2026.. well, we all know Michael Caine did and I respect him for that. I first saw this movie when I was about 9 years old and even then I switched it off after 20 minutes and if you can't even entertain a snotty 9-year-old kid who's obsessed with sharks then you've failed on a catastrophic level. \nThey even straight up copy scenes from the first film for example the sweet and endearing scene when Brody's son mimics his movements and facial expressions well suck out all the soul that scene had and plaster it in this movie, do you get it? We're being relatable this doesn't come off as lazy in the slightest. They even steal the final scene where the sharks corpse sinks to the bottom of the ocean talk about hitting rock bottom\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. (Sorry not sorry)\nThis movie manages however to find the perfect balance between depression and hilarity. The effects are awful don't get me wrong however they make the film entertaining, but the ending is one to be desired. Depending on which version you watch there are two endings one where the shark stands up on its tail out of the water and explodes when it gets lightly touched by the boat and you can tell it's a miniature model of the shark especially when you pause it at the right moment and the far superior ending is when the same thing happens the shark ROARS and stands up on the water as if its Jesus Christ himself and the boat just stabs it then the shark just dies and spews blood everywhere it is comical which is why as much as I hate this film I would only watch it drunk.\nOverall, it's a sad sombre sitcom with a shark as a guest star. the saddest part though is that its memorable for all the wrong reasons. Watch it drunk or high or even both that's the only way to watch this utter garbage. \n-10/10",

And I do wish I left it alone, this has a reputation on the whole as being one of the worst sequels ever, and as far as I'm concerned that reputation is deserved. Steven Spielberg's Jaws is brilliant, not only one of his best films but also the very movie that made me afraid to go into the sea.\n\nJaws:The Revenge didn't have that effect on me whatsoever. In alternative to giving genuine scares and thrills, the whole film is laughable. Especially in the plot, which is really quite inept, and in the climax, which is the epitome of WTF? Jaws:The Revenge also has some embarrassingly cheesy dialogue and poor pacing. Then there's the direction, Spielberg's direction was one of the many things that made the 1975 film so good, but the direction here from Joseph Sargent is incompetent.\n\nThe production values don't fare much better. The locations are quite nice but the cinematography and lighting are altogether unexceptional. The music is also disappointing, whereas the music was what made Jaws so unnerving in terms of mood, it was way too gimmicky here. The less said about Bruce the shark the better, he is not menacing at all, instead he is one of the many laughable assets of the film. Also he is not used well at all, and there is little to no build-up or suspense whenever he appears on screen. The acting is atrocious, the only actor who tries and the only redeeming quality is Michael Caine who deserves better. Lorraine Grey is annoyingly neurotic, while I was shocked that the talented late Judith Barsi would participate in such a mess, and her talents aren't even put to good use. Don't get me started on Mario Van Peebles, him, his character and his comic lines are annoying and get old fast.\n\nOverall, a terrible film and one of the worst sequels I've seen and I have seen a lot. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

It's bad, but it's not *that* bad. It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.\n\nMichael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly stated himself. Lorraine Gary, meanwhile, spearheads an average support cast. Speaking of whom, I did find their dialogue and interactions to be very unnatural and forced.\n\n2*.

But the studio was in a bind from the previous year that you can read about it online. Mostly the studio and the people involved making it laughed at the idea that they were trying to beat the clock with only five or six months from being released. They weren't prepared. Shocking as that sounds, they didn't have any time to think things through. When the movie came out, it shows that they acted from the director Ed Wood, with only one or two shots and they had a produced film that wasn't even 90 minutes. Run, gun, and get it done. Everyone can complain about the shark, or how terrible the dialogue was. Reading the book of this film made it more substantial and they should've included that part from the book's perspective. They knew they were in a bind, but hopefully could make it work. When you watch the film, the majority of people knew it was bad, so they tried their best at it. Now, given that I've seen the movie multiple times, little kids will love it. Adults will chuckle at how bad it is, and it ends with a climax that's all over the place. I admit, I can tell what they were thinking of...but they shouldn't have included scenes from the first film to counteract with what they were representing in the fourth film. It's in poor taste. Yet, I found myself enjoying this movie for a lot of reasons. The opening with the deputy, the ongoing battle with the shark, and hearing Michael Caine going, \"Oh sh*@!\" The shark goes after a banana boat, the iconic music score, and JAWS goes after a plane. The idea taken from the book that it's two sharks is quite ideal. One was upstate only they have a voodoo priest call upon terror with a new shark located near where they lived. Why they didn't include this scene it would've made it more tolerable in the long run. As the franchise killer, it was terrible then and more terrible now. If they explained that Lorraine Gary was out of her mind and hearing things, it'd be okay. But I think we will get a reboot of this franchise. Call it JAWS: MERCY. It would be a complete antonym for the damage they caused with the Revenge as title. As a movie, I can honestly say I can watch it over and over. But as a good movie, it's not definitely not that.

The director of this movie actually said the reason it was so dumb is because they were thinking they should use a little tiny bit of magic or something like that since they knew it would never be as good as the original so they wanted it to be as unique as possible, and not to mention they were given barely anytime to make the movie which probably added to some of it's glaring flaws, the ost is amazing tho definitely my favorite arrangement of the iconic theme song.

I mean compare it to Superman IV: The Quest For Peace!\nMichael Caine makes a career defining appearance that achieved it's objective of paying for a new holiday home!\nI started by watching the trailer on You Tube. Any trailer that has a Blondie song 'One Way or Another' as the soundtrack is funny.\nThat was how I approached the film. Funny.\nNot as a major comparative piece of the merits of the first film (which it does allude to with pictures and discussions mentioning Chief Brody (Roy Schieder).\nThe main sticking point regarding this film is the thought of a Great White Shark travelling thousands of nautical miles to the warmer climes of Florida to just get revenge on the Brody family! The sheer thought is preposterous!\nThe film was made super quick in 1986/87 in an era before CGI and it shows. The models of the shark are awful. A primary school student could do as good a job to be fair.\nThe sequence at the start of the film where young (new) Chief Sean Brody is mauled is quite good and bodes well for the rest of the film.\nGoing back to 1987. It was a great year for sequels of major franchises! What with this, the already mentioned Superman IV and even Timothy Dalton debuting as James Bond in The Living Daylights where did the year go wrong!",

How could there be any pretense that this was going to be a good movie when the poster tag line is, \"This time it's personal.\" How is a shark going to take things personally from the prior three films? And when the shark got killed in all of the prior films, is this film's shark supposed to be the third cousin twice removed coming to get revenge on Chief Brody's wife (the only person from the original film appearing in this fourth installment). There is no reason to watch this film outside of put camp. It's awful and is only watchable when the mechanical shark appears.",

The plot is the worst plot to a movie I have ever seen. \"Jaws: The Revenge\" has terrible horror shots of people being murdered by the shark. The music in this movie is terrible, there is no music in the film that fits in with any of the scenes. Finally this movie is no boring there are no entertaining scenes at all.

Why not just do a full metal Dan Rowan and have Caine pop on deck in a tuxedo holding a highball in one hand and a cigarette in the other? Better yet, actually show the airlifting of Sir Michael onto the deck of the boat as he sits at a card table drunkenly playing bridge with Roger Moore, Omar Sharif and George Segal.

There is one version of this movie where they stab the shark and the shark explodes, for no reason, he just explodes. There is also another version where boat pierces the shark and blood is flying everywhere. I prefer the original ending. Sure it looks, funny and cheap, but it makes sense, except the retard roar part. Worst things in this movie are that in Jaws (1975) you never saw the shark, it was scarier that way. In this movie, the shark comes once in awhile and you see the wires holding the shark prop. The worst thing in this movie is the fact that Roy Scheider dies. The coolest characters of the series and you kill him off, come on. Instead watching this piece of garbage, watch Steven Spielberg's Jaws and other Spielberg film like Indiana Jones or Schindler's List. It's also abomination to Michael Caine, because he missed the Oscars because he was filming this, because that year he won an Oscar.",

The movie got a lot of criticism and has many plot holes, and I must agree it's my least favorite one of the series. The ending is just ridiculous. It was nominated for 7 Razzie awards (bad movies). The original theme song and some flashes of Roy Scheider from the first movie were used. Next to Gary we see the respectful Sir Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige)and Lance Guest (Halloween 2, The Last Starfighter). Who's in for a swim? \n\nNow that Martin Brody has passed away after a heart attack, his son Sean has stepped into his shoes as a police deputy. A few days before Christmas Sean has taken a boat to clear a log from a buoy, but is surprised by a great white shark that tears of his arm. The man dies, leaving his mother Ellen (Gary) devastated and convinced that the shark has targeted her family.\n\nEllen is invited by her other son Michael (Guest) to come and spend some time with him, his wife Carla and daughter Thea at their home in the Bahamas. She agrees. On her way, she meets airplane pilot Hoaggie (Caine) to who she develops a friendship. But what Ellen feared, seems to be real. The great white shark has followed her to the Bahamas and has only one thing in its mind: to devour the Brody family...",

The characters are bland and forgettable once again and their acting is just bad and none of them had any sort of charisma at all on screen. The only people that have ever done great in a Jaws film were Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, their characters were the only ones you actually cared and rooted for. I can't believe that this film actually killed Roy Scheider's character off screen. But the biggest problems with this horrible disaster lie within the story, plot, and special effects. The story and plot are just really really stupid and highly unrealistic and the special effects are as bad as they could possibly get in a movie with a shark in it. Also whenever the shark would be eating somebody, the film would go into extreme depths of terrible as hell camera work where there are so many quick cuts that you could never figure out what was going on. There was just no thought put into anything at all and you know that the filmmakers just didn't care and the only thing they try to get out of this production is an easy paycheck. Another thing is that this was the most boring Jaws film ever and I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen, but nothing interesting ever did happen. Michael Caine is a fantastic actor and here he is incredibly wasted and the movie never allows him to unleash his great acting talents. I had thought that Jaws 3 really sucked, but this movie manages to suck even more and in the end the film goes down in history as one of the worst films of all time. I am so glad that I am finally done watching and reviewing all of the unnecessary Jaws sequels and when I want to watch a Jaws film again, I will just go back to the 1975 classic where there were filmmakers that actually put thought and devotion into their work.",

Jaws: The Revenge isn't one of the greatest horror films, it most certainly isn't as good as the first Jaws film, but atleast I was entertained by it.\r\n \r\nI have seen some truly terrible movies that are worse. (I.E.: The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, Manos: The Hands Of Fate, The Titanic cartoon with the rapping dog in, and some of the shitty spoof films made by Friedberg and Seltzer - Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, etc.) I would rather re-watch Jaws: The Revenge, than re-watch any of these crappy films again, or any horrible film full of graphic violence and rape.

I also never realized that the Nintendo game was actually based off of the plot of this film, which I don't really get. This movie isn't even a \"so bad it's good\" kind of movie. It's just bad. Boring and meandering, with very little interesting things in it. It's also funny that they call it Jaws, despite the fact that Jaws was killed in the first film. Oh well. You know how sequels can be. We'll do whatever we want. That's the mentality of this horrible, horrible film. Now, does it tarnish the Jaws legacy, as in the first film? No, because no one really cares about it so it has no power over that film at all, and that's a good thing. Just ignore it and you're likely to ever forget that it existed.",

Now I can really see why this film sunk the franchise for good, as it is easily the worst Jaws film, period (And this is coming from someone who is a die hard fan of Jaws 2 and even salvaged Jaws 3 for camp value). Still, I wanted to give this film another chance before writing it off for good, and sadly, it still sucked. Now let me explain why.\n\nThe plot mostly focuses around Ellen Brody, the wife of Chief Brody from the first two films. After her son, Sean, is killed by a shark, Ellen becomes convinced that her family seems to be cursed and will be endlessly pursued by this new Great White until it finishes off her family for good.\n\nDespite her new fears, she decides to go to the Bahamas with her son, Mike, and his family to get her mind off her grief and even meets a charming pilot while she's there, whom she grows close to romantically. But, her worst fears are confirmed when the shark starts to come after Mike and his family, and now Ellen must do everything in her power to take down this shark.\n\nHonestly, even though some of the ideas are hokey, the premise of Jaws: The Revenge sounded really interesting. I also admired the fact that it tried to go back to the roots of the original film and also tried to be more dramatic. Had the story been properly written and the film had been directed properly, it could have made for a hell of a drama mixed with harrowing shark attack scenes, and peppered with just the right amount of 80's cheese to make for a damn good Jaws film to close out the franchise. It could have been a thrilling, harrowing, and terrifying film, but it sadly didn't work out.\n\nAs a drama, this film falls flat on its face thanks to a poorly written script which drowns its talented cast in a sea of cliches, flaccid emotions, and unrealistic scenarios. Worse yet, the film can't even be salvaged as trashy fun because shark attacks are few and far between, and what does happen doesn't get interesting until the final confrontation (Which results in a bizarre and unintentionally funny death. The shark not only explodes when the boat rams it, but it also causes the boat to explode into pieces). It's a bad drama and it's also a crappy shark film that can't be salvaged for camp value.\n\nI do feel, however, that the cast did their best with the material and I really enjoyed the performances by Lorraine Gary and Michael Caine who I felt managed to deliver even in the midst of so much awfulness.\n\nIn the end, Jaws: The Revenge is a disappointing conclusion to the franchise that is filled with a lot of interesting ideas that it never utilizes. The direction is bad, the story is crap, and the shark attacks are disappointing and filled with bad special effects. It's a probably a good thing they never made another Jaws film again because it would cause too much pain to fans to have to endure another one.",

            "content": "Someone should probably exact revenge on Joseph Sargent for making this, the most terrifying \"Jaws\" of all, but not in a good way. Where \"Jaws\" influenced blockbuster filmmaking, \"Jaws 2\" influenced inferior obligatory-feeling sequels and \"Jaws 3\" influenced lame 3D gimmick third installments, about the only thing that this film seemed to influence was Sci-Fi Channel original films. I broaden that statement to include all Sci-Fi Channel original films, rather than just the killer shark Sci-Fi films in particular, because just about all of the films Sci-Fi produces seem to be about bad CG sharks. Seriously though, it's a shame that the series has come all the way down to this point, but hey, at least this film makes for the worthy wrap-up to a certain aspect in the series' progression, because where we started with a 100% critical approvement of the first \"Jaws\", with this, the final installment, we've finally brought things down to 0%. I think that this film was doomed when it came to the concept, and by that, I don't mean that the film was doomed once it thought that it would be a good idea to have a shark understand and take advantage of the concept of revenge (\"This time, it's personal\"... It's a shark, tagline guy!), I mean that the film was doomed once it decided to not have the shark don a yellow jumpsuit, whip out a samurai sword and track down the man responsible for almost killing him on his wedding day. Granted, \"Kill Bill\" came out almost two decades after this film (Quentin Tarantino's such a nostalgiac that he makes stories that pay homage to B-movie stories that never happened), but the point is that if this film was going to go that far stupid, then I would have to give it credit just for being so gutsy. ...No, it would have been worse, because, really, sarcasm aside, this film isn't even close to as bad as people are saying it is, yet make no mistake, it's still pretty bad, and no matter how amusing this film's stupidity gets or how undeniably charming Michael Caine is (Yeah, I say, \"undeniably\" as though we can expect anything less from Michael \"Definitive Charming Englishman\" Caine), nothing can save this film, which isn't to say that there aren't \"some\" things in the actual final product that tried.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, I think that we can all ever so easily agree that not one of these sequels' scores have ever come close to touching John Williams' master work for the original, and yet, unexpectedly and undeniably, well, let me struck down if I don't think that this sequel came the closest. Granted, this film's score is a bit conventional, as well as used fairly rarely, yet when it does finally kick on, I did find myself won over, as Michael Small's adjustments to Williams' original themes, while definately not an improvement, still boast plenty of lively intensity and sweep that's both neat to listen to and stays faithful to the film's, and by extenion, the series' themes. The film's action is limp, as I'll discuss further later on down the roard, yet that score work breathes a certain essence of life into such moments as the action sequences, decidedly not to where it raises the action to genuinely intense, yet still raises to a certain degree, nevertheless. Still, as I said, the score work is fairly underused, and between those moments of musical glory, we're going to need some compensation, and, of course, we don't get that compensation, though not through lack of trying... or at least I don't think so. Okay, now, Joseph Sargent clearly couldn't have had his heart too deeply in this project, neither as producer or director, or else the film would be considerably more competent, so this film doesn't quite have the inspiration that \"Jaws 3\" had on a few occasions, yet it does have the charming ambition that \"Jaws 3\". Sure, with more inspiration and less missteps, this film's ambition would have been more charming, and therefore more capable of saving this project, yet I can't help but admit that I felt some degree of appreciation towards Sargent's intentions, no matter how tremendously unrealized they ended up being, and it certainly helped that, well, this film isn't nearly as bad as everyone and his or her grandmother is saying, for although the film is a disaster, I was going in expecting a towering testament to ineptitude and ended up finding not much more than your usual run-of-the-mill '80s mess, hardly worthy of evoking something like \"The Garbage Pail Kids Movie\", or \"Troll 2\", or \"Battlefield Earth\", or other films that seem more worthy of being placed among the worst ever messily crafted. Still, make no mistake, this film is still a mess and a disaster, surprisingly coming close to passable, though not close enough, as it find itself pulled down more than just a few fatal flaws.\r\n\r\n\"Jaws 3\" presented CG that was truly abysmal, as well as a few practical effects that weren't quite as convincing as they probably should have been, yet what I didn't mention is that there were still quite a few production designs in \"Jaws 3\" that really were pretty decent, and certainly much more worthy of my appreciation after this film, for although CG has been removed and a few production designs are left standing as reasonably passable, on the whole, most of this film's practical effects fell flat, and when they seriously shouldn't, for although the more passable practical effects and, of course, Michael Small's score raise tension to a moderate degree, the laughable effects really do launch you out of this film and, certainly, the film's sense of conseqeunce. Still, it's not like you're ever truly invested in the story, because this really is a pretty bad screenplay, or at least the story that the script structures is. Many of this film's story concepts are pretty poor, and made all the worse in execution, as Michael de Guzman's screenplay goes riddled with cliches, uninteresting filler, holes, poor characterization, unbuyable character actions, unbuyable story actions and, of course, bad dialogue. Okay, maybe Guzman's screenplay isn't immensely inept, yet it does collapse into utter and sometimes glaring incompetence at every turn, and it's made all the worse by, well, \"a few\" poor acting jobs, for although there a couple of passable performances (Hey man, you've got to love Michael Caine, even if he is playing Michael Caine once again, just the way we like it; also, I must admit that I was digging the also immensely charming Mario Van Peebles), there are still quite a few performances that fall flat as bland, at best, which is a complaint to be had about \"Jaws 3\", yet there are a few more performances in this film that are just all-out bad, or if nothing else, obnoxious (Ah, that stupid little girl!). Still, at the end of the day, the performance that taints these waters the most is the key one off of the screen, for although I can appreciate Joseph Sargent's ambitions, seriously, come on man, you have to do something to fulfill ambitions, rather than contradict them. Outside of providing mild charm through ambition, Sargent's direction does very little, if anything to carry this film past its flaws, or even spark the film in the first place, for although it was blandness that made \"Jaws 3\" so mediocre, yet also saved it from collapsing any lower, here, we're presented with more blandness that really does bear down on the film, rendering it disengaging, though not so disengaging that you don't still notice the many, many flaws that bypass the potential for mere mediocrity amidst the blandness and leaves the film to collapse as both laughable and dull, and grow more so in progression. The film starts out, not necessarily strong, but fair, then proceeds to progressively decline in quality quite considerably as its blandness grows more and more intense and its flaws grow more and more pronounced, until by the end, I found my time wasted and a film in disastrous ruins, for although this film isn't nearly as incompetent as I'm making it sound, and certainly not nearly as incompetent as everyone else is making it sound, it is nevertheless still consistently incompetent, and through all of Sargent's charming ambitions and Michael Small's actually pretty good score work, it's the incompetence that ultimately prevails, thus leaving this film, and by extension, the film franchise that started out strongly to finally sink.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the occasional fine score piece livens things up, while Joseph Sargent's palpable ambitions spark a certain undeniable charm within this film that makes it difficult for me to dislike the film, which isn't to say the flaws helped in my dismissal of the final product, for although the film isn't nearly as inept as many are saying, it remains incompetent, with shoddy technical value landing a blow to consequence, while a poor story ultimately slays the compellingness, and does so with the help of a poor screenplay, executed generally blandly and occasionally a smidge poorly by the cast, as well as Joseph Sargent's direction, which offers plenty of blandness and not enough compensation, thus leaving dullness to set in and help in ultimately making \"Jaws: The Revenge\" a sloppy and unworthy major misstep that may be considerably better than it's said to be, but is still pretty bad.\r\n\r\n1.5/5 - Bad",

For everyone who quibbles about the unlikelihood of finding a Great White in the warm waters of the Bahamas: this shark also roars. Like a lion or something. A roaring shark. You read that right.\n\nThe filmmakers also keep cutting shots from the original JAWS into the climax. As a reminder that there was actually a good film at one time here? A distraction from how horrible this one is?\n\nThey paid Michael Caine enough to be in this stink bomb--but obviously not enough to wear a wet shirt after climbing out of the ocean. His expressions often convey that he's there but you're lucky he's at least facing the camera.\n\nWas there something better he could have been doing? Yes. Picking up his first Oscar for HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. But he missed the Oscars to be in JAWS: THE REVENGE. At least he went on national TV to admit that he did this movie because he had a home right there in the Bahamas (he even pointed at the house during the interview).\n\nThe demise of the roaring shark is a baffling, badly-edited violation of all of our natural laws and logic. Shark rises out of the water. Boat rams shark. Shark explodes. Boat explodes. Everyone survives, even the annoying Jamaican who got chewed up several minutes before. Roll footage clearly the same of the blown-up shark sinking from the original.\n\nWow. It's that bad.\n\nThe tag line for this movie was \"This time it's personal.\"\n\nThey were right.\n\nThat studio's really got it in for us!",

I might as well believe the shark got to the Bahamas by plane, but his flight was landed early due to snow, and he had to travel with an irritating John Candy to the Bahamas, by plane and truck, along the way learning that sometimes the most different of people, can become the best of friends... then he ate John Candy. It would make no difference. neither makes any sense. Also, Michael Caine is in it. (Is Hoagie really a name? It really shouldn't be.

I'm not sure the credibility of any other series has fallen quite so far; from an Oscar-nominated masterpiece to possibly the cheesiest movie ever made, Jaws: The Revenge is simply another shameful attempt to cash in on the legacy.

The major problem with this movie other than the fake-looking \"Bruce\" (the shark), is how BORING it is! Now, I have yet to see the other two, mainly because every time I watched any of the Jaws sequels, I never got passed the first 10 minutes of them.\r\n\r\nPlot/Story: The story is cheesy, the plot is just referencing the first film & also seems to be pasting other stuff from other movies, & there are so many plot holes. And as the others have said, the plot is about the shark stalking & murdering the Brody family. Yes, the shark actually stalks the family that has killed it in the previous movies. But that's the least of this movie's problems.\r\n\r\nThe plot & story is also both illogical & makes little sense. Now, the one illogical thing this movie has is how the shark traveled from New York, all the way to the Bahamas. That's almost what...2000 km? The shark not only would have never made at the same time as the characters did, but it would have never even have had to make it in the first place, because, great whites don't like warm water! Now, I know some of you may know me for the fact that I'll take realism in a film, rub it in my ass cheeks & then toss it aside, but this film tries to portray a man-eating shark in a realistically fictional way, which doesn't work so well.\r\n\r\nThen there's the problem with Ellen. But that part I'll save for later, so don't forget it. And then there's the part where the shark follows Michael through an entire sunken ship labyrinth. A great white shark is too damn stupid to do such a thing. But that won't get in the shark's brain because apparently this shark now grew a brain that of a human intelligence! It THINKS of what to do next if it doesn't seem to get to it's victim!\r\n\r\nCast/Acting: Lorraine Gray came back to reprise her role as the wife of Martin Brody, & then we have Michael Caine, the supporting actor. But everyone else in this movie is forgettable. And the acting is extremely questionable. There are points where the actors play their parts right, but then they are in another scene where they seem to be acting like they've been doing some drugs.\r\n\r\nCharacters: Remember when I said above to not forget about the problem with Ellen Brody? Well here it is now. Ellen now became the more heroic character of the movie, but that's not her problem, the problem she has is how she is always paranoid, & worse of all, she is haunted by flashbacks of events that she was never present in! Such as the scene where her husband shot the shark dead in the first movie & where her son was murdered in the beginning of the movie. Her character is also boring, not doing much but freaking out & pretending to be fine. I don't even wanna get to the other pointless characters.\r\n\r\nMusic/Score: The score is just fine, almost as great as the first one's score, but the problem with it was that it sometimes got a little too dramatic & loud.\r\n\r\nSpecial effects: They sucked, ass. The shark looked way too fake, especially compared to how it was used in the first movie. And don't get me started on the scenes where the shark began to 'rise' out of the water. And the scene where the shark was finally killed, for that one frame of that second of the movie, you can see the cheap, primitive tool used. Don't even get me started on the idiotic scenes of how the shark began to roar. Yes, the damn shark roars like a lion or some other beast, which is completely illogical.\r\n\r\nChemistry: I felt lots of chemistry between Lorraine Gary & Michael Caine, that's pretty much it.\r\n\r\nDialogue: The dialogue in this movie is so poorly written & executed that I seriously wondered if the actors themselves questioned if they were supposed to be saying what they read in their scripts. It's just bad, plain out bad.\r\n\r\nFinal summation, this movie sucks, is boring, & one of the worst movies ever made, but not that I've seen. It was an unnecessary sequel.",

Michael Brody (Lance Guest) turns out to be a marine biologist. Not only is this convenient to the plot, but it ignores Jaws 3's idea of Mike being a SeaWorld worker...or something. Anyway, Ellen decides to go where no shark will bother her anymore......THE BAHAMAS! Not only is this a very poor decision, but the shark must've overheard this conversation, because when Ellen and family go to the Bahamas, not only does the shark follow them, but he gets there first. Terrific! When they get there Lorraine meets Hoagie and LOVE IS IN THE AIR. Being the great parents they are, Michael allows Thea (Judith Barsi) on a wonderful Banana Boat of FUN. This fun banana boat ends up to be a banana boat of...deadliness, as good old Bruce kills an innocent civilian. Ellen is SHOCKED. She goes to finish the shark once and for all in Jake's boat. Michael arrives and sees his dear wife holding Thea, who is in shock. And Michael finally (albeit by accident) says that he knew the shark was out there. So he goes with Hoagie and Jake in the magical airplane to find her. They do; and secure a safe landing on the water, by a revenge-seeking shark. Mike and Jake get out easily, but Hoagie takes his sweet-ass time and gets sunk along with the plane. But he manages to escape and gets on the boat; as dry as...well...someone who hasn't been in water. Jake then decides to put this...thing inside the shark to make him go absolutely nuts. I don't see how this would kill him, but whatever. So Jake goes to the edge...stick to feed it to him. The shark unexpectedly flies up to him and eats him all up. Of course, Jake didn't forget to put that device in the shark's mouth. So, Mike presses a button to make the shark go crazy. It makes the shark so crazy that it defies all logic and roars...like Spot from the Munsters. In fact, I think that IS Spot's roar. Wow. Anyway Ellen ignores Hoagie's warning to come about and goes straight for the shark, stabs him with the moat and the shark struggles on it and dies...I guess. When the shark falls into the water, it takes the boat with it and Ellen and co. fall out of the boat and then go back to shore, somehow. Then Hoagie flies Ellen to Amity and all is well! Two people died in this movie. Wow. \n\nNow, I've seen an alternate ending where the shark explodes when he hits the moat (?) and Jake survives. Whatever, either way this movie is so great and obviously not full of plot holes and errors.\n\nKicked off a star because I had to see Michael Caine dance.\n\nLovely lines:\n\"Sharks come and go, Ellen!\"\n\"ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!\"\n\"We got us a great...white! Now we're gonna do some REAL research, boi!\"\n\"I have an irresistible urge to kiss you, Ellen Brody.\"\n\" I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.\"\n\"Dad died of a heart attack!\"\n\"No, he died from fear. The fear of the shark!\"\n\" If mediocrity were fat, you'd all be whales!\"\n\"I deliver laundry!\"\n\nWhat a great film.\n4/5",

        {
            "content": "If there ever were proof of the law of diminishing returns, the fourth entry in the Jaws series is it. The original was a taut thriller that launched the career of one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors. By comparison, Michael Caine often looks as if he is incredibly upset to be missing his award ceremony in order to appear in this piece. Lance Guest and Mario Van Peebles frequently appear to be wishing to have better things to do, while Lorraine Gary frequently looks stoned in moments when she is supposed to look frightening.\r\n\r\nClearly, the budget spent on this film didn't go into the research, script, or mechanical shark. Exactly why Michael Brody and his pals are putting what are apparently tracking devices on conch shells is never explained. Perhaps any explanation they thought of was so incredibly stupid that they thought it best to give up. An alternate explanation of why Michael is working in the water was never thought of, either. The true Ed Wood moment of the film comes towards the end of the piece, when the shark rises out of the water, and roars at Elaine. This is the first time I've heard of sharks having vocal cords. Given the box office draw this stinker had, I suspect it will be the last.\r\n\r\nThe shark takes a real beating here, too. The reason the shark wasn't seen often in the original was because Spielberg noticed that if one put it in front of the camera for long enough, the audience would notice that it doesn't move like a real shark. In this edition of the Jaws story, not only do they keep the camera focused upon the shark for more than enough time for the audience to notice the model's flaws, in so doing they make it crystal clear that this shark was made on the cheap. There are some shots in which the support structure of the shark is visible under the outer layer. There is even what appears to be a seam in the back of the shark's main fin.\r\n\r\nTo its credit, Jaws: The Revenge is well-photographed. While the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, depth of field is used with great effect in several shots. The fact that even frames with one character in them won't make sense when cropped to fit analogue television is a credit to the director and cinematographer. If only this kind of workmanship could have been seen in other aspects of the film.\r\n\r\nAnother area where Jaws: The Revenge deserves due credit is the score music. While the score is very much inspired by that which John Williams provided for the original, it distinguishes itself and genuinely works in its own right. In fact, one could almost say that the score music is more than the rest of the film deserves. The music is literally able to inject dramatic tension into scenes that, by all rights granted under the accepted rules of film-making, really shouldn't have any.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, I gave Jaws: The Revenge a one out of ten. It works as a comedy in the sense that it is a stinking pile of crap, but there are precious few moments when the people making it seem privy to the fact. As a result, the film winds up in a class all of its own. It's not just so bad its good, it is so utterly bad it is incredible.",

If it was just enough B-Grade horror flick then sure, there's some fun to be had, but for a major studio film, especially one descended from the DNA of one the best film in history...it's depressing...it's an insult. The worst part is the direct intercutting of a few seconds of Scheider's climatic moment in the first film with the climax here - it's like dropping a Ferraro Rocher into a vat of industrial quality chocolate - jarring, pointless, and deeply insulting to the Ferraro Rocher.\n\nThere's been some bad sequels to some great movies in my time, but seriously, the gap in quality here has gotta be the widest.

It's clearly supposed to be taken seriously, but the premise is incredibly laughable.  Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), widow of Amity Island shark killing Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider, who is notably absent save scenes culled from the original; if the actor saw this script, he certainly was wise to pass on it!), thinks that the shark is out to get her and her family.  After yet another incident at Amity, the same shark apparently goes so far as to pursue her to her son Michael's Bahama island home.  Is that enough for you?  It's just getting started.  Forget that Brody blew up the previous sharks in the first two films - and it's not entirely clear, if it matters at at all, if anyone remembers the third movie - but, apparently, someone's out for revenge.  While it might seem like it should be Ellen Brody out for blood, it appears that this movie is really about the shark taking revenge.  Maybe it's P.O.'d for how the Brodys have treated its relatives?   There are so many absurd elements present - and Michael Caine does his best to play it straight - I watched it from beginning to end with a smile and laughed out loud at times.   If I was grading this as a comedy, it would probably be a three star one.   So I wonder when someone is going to reimagine this series?  Please don't.  Watch the original.  If you need more, see the first so-so sequel with Scheider.",

In mourning, Ellen goes to visit her other son, Michael (Lance Guest), in the Bahamas, where she meets the charming Hoagie Newcombe (Michael Caine).
