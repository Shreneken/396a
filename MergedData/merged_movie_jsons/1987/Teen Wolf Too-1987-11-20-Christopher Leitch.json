            "content": "Although he is Scott's cousin, Todd Howard has managed to dodge the \"family problem\" and is a perfectly normal young man starting a promising college career. Despite being very weedy and interested in becoming a vet, Todd has managed to get a sports scholarship without being sure why. Turns out that the Dean has assumed that Todd can do for the college boxing team what Scott did for his high school basketball team what with him being a werewolf and everything. Todd discovers this quickly and is keen to disappoint but his genes betray him as the \"family problem\" manifests itself suddenly. Overnight Todd is a star in the ring and on the campus \u2013 but can he manage this sudden change?When I read overly negative reviews of the first Teen Wolf film I can only silently shake my head and wonder what the same viewer makes of the sequel. I say this because, as basic as the original film is, Teen Wolf Too/Two/2/whatever is like the makers condensed the original film to the basics and then just put that out on as little money, time and effort as possible. It shows in all areas of the film but I have to start somewhere so I will do so with the actual story. The flow of it is this (a) studious kid doesn't really fit into school/college, (b) kid becomes werewolf, (c) kid becomes popular but also a major a**hole, (d) kid learns life lesson. OK, so you can see it is essentially the same film as the first time, with the sport and setting different. In terms of the telling of the story though, we literally jump between these parts without any gradual development between them. I'm not saying it needed a lot of complexity but maybe just one or two scenes bridging the gap between the elements \u2013 instead it will literally have 1 scene of him becoming a werewolf for the first time, then the next scene is him popular and doing a 50's twist (for some reason) at a party \u2013 not even a bridge which shows him winning over an initially hesitant campus. This is the same across the whole film and it makes it weaker as a film \u2013 a problem considering it would still have not been great with these scenes.This slapdash approach is reflected in the whole film and it is no surprise that the script is poor. The dialogue matches the \"good enough\" approach to the narrative \u2013 ie lines are clunky, obvious and lacking anything that would make you care enough to listen. However, producing even this level of trash was clearly too much for the writers because they appear to have been too busy to get laughs, fun or energy into the script. Visually it looks cheap. The sets are faded and unconvincing while the aim appears to have been to try and pull off \"crowd\" scenes with as few extras as possible. The wolf makeup is also really bad \u2013 never great of course but in Too it looks like a mask purchased at a corner store.With all this it is no surprise that the cast can do nothing with it. I feel sorry for Bateman but he is poor here and cannot do anything with the material handed to him. He has almost zero chemistry with Chandler as well \u2013 again neither of them helped by the material having no bridge between \"oh hi\" and \"you are the love of my life\". Astin must have hoped for more but, even though he has a glint in his eyes that suggests a fun role in the film, he does nothing and has nothing to do. Fratkin and Holton are both annoying and deliver nothing in the way of laughs that the writers clearly just assumed they would do on their own (wackiy guy and fat guy \u2013 practically writes itself.....errr, no, no it doesn't).The end product is not so much a terrible film in that everything was misjudged but rather a terrible film because nobody seems to have given a single, flying f**k about it from conception to final delivery. The plot is the same as the first film but yet so much worse and basic, with similar dialogue. The \"feel\" of the film is likewise cheap and \"make-do\" and it is no surprise that nobody in the cast can do much of anything with the whole affair. The only value the sequel has is making the first Teen Wolf film seem more fresh and filled with fun that it was.",

Not even Jason Bateman's hotness can save it, particularly seeing as his acting here is not very good and that's an understatement. The rest of the acting is poor, that is including Kim Darby and John Astin, and it doesn't help that their characters are written so badly. The production values, especially the editing are shoddy, the story is predictable and feels like a rehash and the writing is clunky. Even the soundtrack isn't as infectious this time round. Overall, a horrible film. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "After a lifetime of watching movies and searching for the greatest moment in cinematic history, I've finally found it.  Is it Orson Welles' breathless death-rattle of `. . . rosebud.' In Citizen Kane?  No.  How about Al Pacino giving Fredo the kiss of death in Godfather II?  Try again.  What about Peter Finch screaming into the Network camera `I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it ANYMORE!' . . . not even close.Are you ready?  Here it is:  the greatest moment in contemporary motion picture history is . . . in Teen Wolf Too when Jason Bateman (as the Wolf) runs across the park, leaps through the air in slow motion, and comes down with a Frisbee in his mouth-all without losing that stupid hat he had on!Oh, but this film is peppered with other fantastic gems.  Like the part where the Wolf and Chubby where cruising around in the University Corvette (what, your school didn't have one?) and they almost ran that guy on the bike over and the Wolf just kept laughing and laughing--good times; or what about when Chubby was in the ring and he bounced the smaller guy into the ropes, put his hand on his hip, twirled his fist and knocked the kid out; ew! ew! ew!  I know!  What about when the Wolf was singing `Do You Love Me!' Remember?  When he had that little suit on and he was strutting his choreographed stuff with the team of wannabe Solid Gold Dancers?  Box office dynamite!I don't remember a huge portion of this film, because the part of my brain that controls my higher cognitive functions shut down somewhere between the part where Chubby farts and Stiles sits in the smell and the part where the science teacher walks away from Gomez Addams with a tail wagging from under her skirt.  Just thinking about it makes my lobes tingle and go numb.If there was one thing worse than the moron who played Stiles in Teen Wolf, it has got to be the guy that played Stiles in Teen Wolf Too.  Oh my God that guy was horrible.  The only highlight of this movie was when Stiles gets punched-out in between rounds of the big climactic fight scene-I like it because I've convinced myself that it was an outtake and he REALLY got hit.  Take THAT Stuart Fratkin!  What was he thinking?  `Yeah, I landed a SWEET gig on Teen Wolf Too-I'm STILES!  Just the springboard my career needs!'  Yeah, look out DeNiro, here comes Stuart Fratkin.My buddy Marc brought this movie over to my house and I'm not sure what to think.  This is the same friend that exposed me to Pumpkinhead 2.  The only thing I can figure is that he is one of many alien infiltrators sent to Earth to use bad movies to brainwash people into a zombie-like trance, making way for an alien take over.  To those in a similar circumstance, I say RESIST!  You're not taking my soul with Teen Wolf Too, Marc!  I'm on to you fella!",

            "content": "It's a sad truth that there are a lot of bad werewolf movies out there. But there are a few that really stand out as being among the worst of the worst ... and \"Teen Wolf Too\" is undoubtedly one of them.It follows pretty much the same plot as the first movie, which was itself a recycled formula. Todd Howard (cousin of Scott from the first movie), a hard-working science student, arrives in college wanting to work towards becoming a vet. But there's one snag -- he's there under a sports scholarship, and unless he performs well in the boxing tournament his place in the college is at stake. Thankfully, he finds himself succumbing to his cousin's lycanthropic curse and becomes a popular and agile werewolf. But in the process he, of course, forgets who his real friends are.There are numerous recurring characters from the first movie, some of whom have inexplicably moved to this college. There are Scott's high school chums, Chubby and Stiles -- Stiles is this time played by Stuart Fratkin, who also appeared in an episode of the TV show \"Werewolf\" the same year (\"A Material Girl\"). Scott's dad also makes a few appearances, as well as the Scott's coach, who is also played by a different actor this time. But of course, none of this matters ... without Michael J Fox, this movie was pretty much doomed from the start. He was pretty much the only thing that saved \"Teen Wolf\" from being a flop.The dialogue is unbearable, the directing is clumsy, and the acting in places is downright appalling. Since this is basically a remake of the first movie, there's absolutely no reason to watch it. Just watch the original, and forget about this one altogether. There's hardly anything good to say about it at all. And believe it or not, it still made money. In fact it's very surprising that we didn't see a \"Teen Wolf Three\" the next year.

            "content": "I am going to start out by admitting that even though I think the original Teen Wolf is a pretty stupid movie, I actually like it quite a bit.  I don't know what it is about it that I like, but for the last couple of months I've found myself watching my copy of Teen Wolf about once a week.I decided to purchase (you gotta OWN these titles, that's the fun of it.) a copy of Teen Wolf Too on eBay for $4.  The only other time I had seen this movie was when I was in 4th grade, which was over a decade ago.  I didn't remember much about it, save a couple of moments involving Chubby.I just finished watching the movie for the first time in 11 years, and I can say with complete certainty that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a LONG time.  In many ways, this is the *perfect* bad sequel...  The first film wasn't especially good or commercially successful, so it seems pointless to have even considered making another chapter in the Teen Wolf saga.  They also weren't able to get the big star of the first movie (Michael J. Fox) to come back, so they instead focused on his cousin, whose personality is almost exactly the same.  Even further, they decided to bring back a few of the characters from the first movie, only two of which are played by the same actors.  Stiles, who was corny but funny in Teen Wolf, has been replaced by an actor who isn't nearly as convincing or amusing. Coach Finstock, who was the only genuinely funny character in the first film, is now played by a man whose line delivery made me laugh exactly zero times throughout the course of the film.These discrepancies aside, the plot of this film is crap.  It's basically exactly the same as the original, only even more sketchy.  Anyone who hasn't seen Teen Wolf will probably not be able to make sense of the plot, not that any of them would actually watch this ridiculous film in its entirety.I could probably write a fairly long essay on the problems with this movie, but I'm limited to 1000 words here.  I would comment more on the many specific elements that make this movie stupid, but I don't want to waste more of anyone's time.  And since I'm trying to keep you from wasting your time, then I will recommend that you do not watch this movie.  Ever. Anyone who says that this movie is not that bad is wrong.",

Well, guess what - this sequel manages to be even worse!

To make matters worse, this time around this plot moves at a snail's pace, with only sporadic attempts at humor (all of which crash to the ground.) Jason Bateman here is a bland presence, alternately being whiny or befuddled. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that unlike many other '80s comedies, this one isn't very dated in its fashions and other cultural touches.",

Granted, Teen Wolf is a 80's classic, I would not say the follow up is in that catagory. However, if you can overlook the fact that 80's pop culture icon Michael J Fox is not in it, the film really is'nt all that bad. It does try to copy the 1st film in many respects and is not altogether successful. But, even as a failure, it is not a bad film. It does follow the same formula for every 80's teen comedy and while it is lacking someone like Michael J Fox who could knock this out of the park, Teen Wolf Too is far from unwatchable. Jason Bateman actually gives a pretty decent performance, comparing him with Fox is'nt really fair as he is not a superstar or possessing of Michael's unique charisma and screen presence. The film is not nearly as funny as the 1st film either and at times is a bit corny. Either way, Teen Wolf Too is a decent time passer and if you take into consideration that this movie follows a lot of 80's genre conventions and won't blow you away, Teen Wolf Too is passable campy entertainment.",

            "content": "\"Teen Wolf\" was a popular film. So, it's not surprising that the studio would want to make a sequel. The problem was that the star of the first one, Michael J. Fox, hated making \"Teen Wolf\" and refused to make the sequel. It's not hard to understand, as between the two films \"Back to the Future\" came out and shot Fox to greater stardom. So, in a pinch, the studio tossed out many of the original cast and tried to see if they could get away with it. Despite all this, the sequel still made a modest profit....though it also made IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. So, according to the list, this is the 62nd worst major release of all time according to users.\nWhen the film begins, you see that Jason Bateman is playing Todd Howard....the COUSIN of Michael J. Fox's character from the first film, Scott. Oddly, Scott's father (James Hampton) is in the movie and he's acting the role of Todd's guardian. Todd is starting college (which is odd, as Bateman was 18...and rarely do roles for teens ever actually go to real teens....often they are 21-30) and he's there on an athletic scholarship but apparently didn't deserve it...much like those actors and their kids you've heard about a lot in the news recently. However, in Todd's case he could get killed, as it's a BOXING scholarship! Will Todd's lycanthropy help save him from being beaten to a pulp? And, like every teen film of the 80s, will it help him get the girl?While I was NOT a huge fan of \"Teen Wolf\", it seems like \"Teen Wolf Too\" is a step backward in most every way. The biggest problem is the writing, as some of the characters are one-dimensional and ridiculous caricatures (especially John Astin as the Dean). They also often used slapstick instead of cleverness...and really, really bad slapstick....like the sort of stuff 6 year-olds would enjoy. Hard to watch...and easy to hate.\nSo, while it's bad, is it Bottom 100 bad? Probably not. But I have noticed several other film franchises have the same pattern....a film is loved by its fans and the studios create sequels that simply stink. And, because so much love existed for the first one, there's a backlash and folks not only dislike but HATE the sequels. Some examples on the Bottom 100 are \"The Neverending Story III\", \"Son of Mask\", \"Jaws the Revenge\", \"The Human Centipede II\" as well as \"The Human Centipede III\". The same cannot be said of \"Baby Geniuses\" and \"Baby Geniuses II\" because both films made the list and both films are god-awful.",

The best high school movies are adult rated, delivering raucous entertainment that anyone who's ever been a teenager can readily identify with. By comparison, this is a cheap and cheerful sequel, the 'highlight' of which involves a huge '50s-flavoured dance off with our hero headlining in full werewolf costume.The narrative involves some kind of predictable moral fairytale in which our hero must learn humility and to constrain the excesses of his ego. It's all rather sanctimonious in approach, layered with '80s cheese and the usual stock characters: the nerd friend, the bad guy jock, the bimbos.

TEEN WOLF TOO, on the other hand, is pure garbage and the worst thing is that it's pretty lazy and just a boring rehash of the first picture.Everything that happens in the first picture basically happens here, although the quality is much less. You've got a teenager struggling with life who finds himself becoming popular. The teen loves the popularity but soon realizes it is costing him real friends. He soon realizes that the party girl isn't what he wants. He realizes that the party life isn't what he wants. Does all of this sound familiar? If so, I'm sure you know how it ends.Worst of all is the fact that all of the goofiness that worked in the first picture just doesn't work here. Bateman is a complete bore in the picture.

As if the cheesy first film starring Michael J Fox wasn't bad enough, some dink in Hollywood decided that a second must be made despite the fact that there were many obvious signs not to make it. Shouldn't the signs be clear when you can't get star of the film back, or half the rest of the cast who realized they'd be doomed to the C circuit forever?This is just a poor rehash of an already terrible idea. Geek (Jason Bateman) going to school, is somehow into athletics when he should really be into studying and insects, is in love with the hot chick on campus but doesn't notice the blistering crush the longtime girl friend has on him. He turns into a wolf, parties, gets really good at sports, learns a lesson, and then wins as himself instead of using the magic powers Oden inferred upon him and discovers that the longtime girl friend is the hottest chick in the movie. yay. I only have a few thoughts on this flick though. Why did they feel the need to bring back Mr Howard? I mean, they could have made a clean break, cast all new people and just made it another film that had a similar 'plot'. But instead, they bring back incidental characters from the first film that weren't that entertaining then. They bring back Scott's friend Stiles. How does he know Todd (Bateman)? I'm not really sure. I'm kind of surprised he knew him since this Stiles looks completely different do to either complete facial reconstruction or a casting change. Not that it matters, as the annoying character he is, the less you remember his face, the more better off you are. Why is Chubby in this film? I mean, talk about bringing back a character that brought nothing to the table. The only thing he did in the first film was eat jello from a girls cleavege. Sure, we all want to do that just once, but it still shouldn't mean getting into another film.And why Boxing? I mean, what colleges have a boxing circuit? And does Bateman look like he could hurt a fly? At least basketball, football or even baseball could pass. Hell, track and field!! But, alas, they decided Boxing was the way to go. Another great choice by these people. I'm shocked they're still working after all this.At least Bateman has redeemed himself by doing some good work on Arrested Development. But it'll take an Oscar for me to ever forgive this horrendous film. Avoid it like the plague and thank the lord above if you've never seen it. Amen.",

Worse yet, two of the most amusing and entertaining characters from the first one are recast with lesser actors: Paul Sands makes for a terribly glum and mopey Coach Finstock while Stuart Fratkin grates on the nerves something painful as slick hustler Stiles. James Hampton is wasted in a minor part as Uncle Howard and Mark Holton likewise isn't given much worthwhile to do as Chubby. This picture hits its absolute groan-inducing nadir with a simply pathetic song and dance number set to the song \"Do You Love Me?\" and the especially dopey moment when Todd catches a Frisbee in his teeth. On the plus side, Kim Darby tries hard as the sympathetic Professor Brooks, the fetching Estee Chandler delivers an appealing performance as the sweet Nicki, and John Astin hams it up with deliciously lip-smacking brio as the slimy Dean Dunn. Only the climactic exciting rough'n'tumble boxing match manages to rise out of the mire of numbing mediocrity. Pretty stinky.",

It lacks originality and top notch acting. It is just a college version of the original \"Teen Wolf\" that deems it unnecessary and unworthy of a sequel. However, I really like Jason Bateman and I think he's good in even this film. The only justifiable means that I can use to compare this movie as being better than its former is that it always made more sense to me that a werewolf participate in a combative sport (such as boxing) over basketball.

Jason Bateman turns into the werewolf in the middle of a boxing bout and the whole school starts cheering for the wolf, without even thinking 'wow, a dude just turned into a werewolf, that's a little unique'. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT. Possibly because the cast had seen the original Teen Wolf and knew that it is possible for college sports stars to morph into werewolves when they face adversity. Unfortunately the rest of the film is pretty weak, with alleged jokes misfiring at regular intervals and Teen Wolf singing 'do you love me'. Don't really have to say anymore about that\u0085I wont give away the end, just in case people are reading this and thinking 'wow, its been out for 18 years but it's only now that I feel the need to get amongst this cinematic masterpiece', but will Teen wolf decide to face the world as himself or as the wolf?

As in: Teen Wolf, Also. Or Teen Wolf, As Well. This sly and ingenious inside joke no doubt refers to the once controversial and now celebrated decision to cast Jason Bateman in the leading role as opposed to Michael J. Fox. The title seems to be saying....yes, Michael J. Fox shone brightly as Scott. But, guess what, world? There's ANOTHER Teen Wolf. Yes, Jason Bateman along with his indelible creation, Todd, is a Teen Wolf too.And what a Teen Wolf he was! Bateman inhabits the role of Todd. It's impossible to distinguish where the actor and the character begins. Which is a nice segue into the remarkable make-up and effects. When Todd finally transforms in a beautifully paced scene racked with tension, we are transported by the make-up. Here we are, looking at a teen wolf! And yet, Bateman's performance is so committed, so brave and so genuine, that we never forget....(can't believe I'm actually getting emotional writing this)....it's still Todd in there.I find it hilarious that critics of this film claim that it's a rehash of the first film. First of all, Todd is a completely different Teen Wolf as the title states right out of the gate. Secondly, boxing and basketball have nothing in common other than the fact that they're both sports. I suppose The Natural and Kingpin are identical films as well? Spare me. As Syd Field can tell you, all films follow a similar formula. It's short-sightedness and bias that prevent folks from appreciating just how strikingly different Teen Wolf Too is.",

Coach Finstock used to coach basketball & Todd's cousin Scott who had great agility & strength when he turned into a Werewolf & hopes that Todd himself is a Werewolf & can help the boxing team out. Todd isn't too interested in boxing & just wants to study science but is forced to take part in competitive matches, while being beaten in the boxing ring by an opponent Todd unexpectedly changes into a Werewolf & wins the match & at the same time becomes a local celebrity who milks his new found fame & popularity for all he can but Todd loses sight of who he is as the Werewolf inside takes control...Directed by Christopher Leitch this was the first & so far only sequel to the surprise box-office hit fantasy sporting comedy Teen Wolf (1985) which starred Michael J. Fox, Teen Wolf Too doesn't star Michael J. Fox & is basically more of a remake than an original film that tries to expand & develop the ideas seen in the original Teen Wolf & instead just blatantly copies them. The only great difference between Teen Wolf Too & it's predecessor Teen Wolf is that basketball has been replaced with boxing in which the central character must prove himself & his humanity over the Wolf. All the themes & ideas of the original Teen Wolf are shamelessly copied here, the high school loser & social outcast turned celebrity by becoming the Wolf, the good girl bad girl problem, the way schoolwork & study suffer, the way he goes from useless weakling to an overnight sporting success &, of course, the central moral message of just being yourself will be enough. Teen Wolf Too is throughly predictable, at over 90 minutes long it feels like it lasts forever & for a supposed comedy it's extremely unfunny, in fact I don't think I laughed once & the majority of the so-called jokes & gags are just plain cringe worthy. From a Frog fight in a biology class to the Dean & his pet Dog to the laid back Coach to the horrible musical montages featuring some hideous 80's pop music Teen Wolf Too is actually quite embarrassing to watch with zero plot (that was a really random twist at the ends up being totally pointless) & certainly not funny in any way.The whole film has a forgettable look to it, sure it's competent enough I suppose but nothing special. The special effects are poor, from the awful Werewolf make-up to the Wolf tail that actress Kim Darby has to wear that looks more like a static duster than the tail of a Wolf. About half way through Teen Wolf Too there's this awful musical number in which Howard the Wolf dressed in a purple suit does a song & dance number at a party with all the other students there joining in & thus making this big dance number which is truly horrifying to watch. Scenes like Howard the Wolf running after & catching a Frisbee in his mouth like a real Dog don't help neither does the fact that it takes half an hour before he even turns into the Wolf.With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 I can only wonder where all the money went? Apparently filmed at Pomona College in California. James Hampton & Mark Holton are the only returning cast member from the original Teen Wolf while Jason Bateman makes for a bland leading man & maybe the fact his dad Kent Bateman was the producer had something to do with his casting.Teen Wolf Too is a really bad 80's comedy fantasy that is actually quite embarrassing to watch, from the horrible 80's pop music to the lame jokes & gags to the wretched make-up effects one has to say that you would be better off watching the original Teen Wolf again & considering they are both virtually the same film you won't miss anything here.",

Having to make references every five minutes is desperate enough, but to have two minor actors not coming back to the film, and have them played by someone who looks absolutely nothing like them, you may as well have had Bateman play J.

The make up is awful, there are no laughs in the entirety of the movie, and Bateman becomes highly unlikable when he starts to use his powers on a regular basis.And why boxing? Of all the sports the writers could have chose, baseball, Football, Athletics, Running, they choose boxing.It's as bad as people have been saying for the past 29 years, and i'm sure Bateman hates the fact that this is on his CV.But it does have one good line in it.You're wrong, and I'm late.dreck.",

The sporting storyline is almost exactly like the first film except it's boxing, not basketball this time. I was most annoyed that none of the original actors were there (didn't that tell the film makers something when none of the originals wanted to do another?) but the same characters were present with different names (stiles is different and has a mullet, the attractive popular girl is different, as is the true love). The idea of a teen aged were wolf may have had a little live left in it if all the same actors signed and more time was given to writing a decent story and script. Like the first film there was lots of 80s clich\u00e9s but then it is 80s so maybe that can be excused. The first one made in 1985 made the 80s look cool but this one makes it look horribly dated and retains none of the charm (I think Michael J Fox had a lot to do with making it charming so the new actor didn't help).",

            "content": "When i was a boy in the late 80s, I used to rent out videos from my local store. One such one was Teen Wolf Too. I seem to remember enjoying it, probably cos it was about boxing and i liked fight films at that age like any boy (my favourite movie series was the Karate Kid). I didn't remember much about it, but must have liked it cos I then rented Teen Wolf, the original, to see where it had come from. Low and behold the main character was Michael J Fox, my favourite actor at the time. Then I fell in love with THAT film, perhaps even forgetting it all started with Teen Wolf Too.Years later, with newly installed Sky, I see that Teen Wolf Too in on Sci-Fi channel one afternoon. 'I'll watch that, I loved those films when i was a kid, it's like walking down memory lane'. I was shocked at how bad it was (more on this later). Was I that clueless as a kid? Anyway, a week later I saw that the original Teen Wolf was on, and thought 'Hey, let's truly confirm my poor taste as a child'. I was again shocked. Because it was good. Okay, it's not really, it's actually stupid and I still don't know why: A) Scott/Todd turn into a werewolf. A little explanation is all I ask, not a realistic one, just a little.B) Scott/Todd just accept what happens to them.C) No one else goes 'That's a werewolf, that's both freaky and unusual, quick, run!' (Instead they all go 'Yay, go Wolfie! We love you and your furriness!') D) Why being a werewolf helps you be good at Basketball/Boxing.Saying all that, Teen Wolf is okay. Its entertaining, has morals, quite amusing, has energetic and sympathetic characters, and Fox's phone in performance is still very likable. I must have watched it so much as a kid, i could remember so many lines. Only the Karate kid matches that.Teen Wolf Too though, is dreadful. People are saying remake/copy, and i agree, except that's too kind. If it was remade properly, it would be close to having the story of the original. But it's like they took the main plot points of the original and said 'Okay, we got that scene, well let's set it here but make as little effort as possible, i mean we're only remaking Teen Wolf, no one cares if it's good.' The result is a mess of awkward, tired, unfunny scenes that only make sense when you see the original and realise that's what they were trying to achieve. In particular, 'Do you love me' was such a terrible, forced, illogical copy of 'Surf's Up' it was painful. But i'm glad i saw them the wrong way round again, because this really makes Teen Wolf look like Back to the Future.Oh, and the point of my story is that I then realised my taste as a kid was obviously not that bad, cos I had seen this twice and then stopped. I had watched Teen Wolf again and again, that's why i knew so many lines even now. The only line I could remember in this was: 'Thanks, you got any fries.'",

Jason Bateman has always been considered a cut-rate Michael J. Fox and this movie proves that theory to be true.Teen Wolf Too is a text book example of how to make a horrible sequel to an average movie. None of the elements that made the original film enjoyable were present in this piece of work. I can understand the reason they had to go with a new lead character. I can understand the reason they changed the location to a college campus. However, I don't understand why they attempted to include the characters of 'Styles' and Coach Finstock, especially since the actors who portrayed them in Teen Wolf didn't reprise their roles.Jerry Levine and Jay Tarses are two of the elements that added charm to Teen Wolf. They complimented Michael J. Fox and their characters were amusing. In Teen Wolf Too, the actors who portray 'Styles' and Coach Finstock seem as if they are actors who are doing bad imitations of Jerry Levine and Jay Tarses.Once I got past all of the returning characters being re-cast (with the exception of Harold Howard and Chubby), I still couldn't enjoy this movie because the story is no different than it was in the first movie. Like the first film, they cover up the lack of plot by including several montages of Teen Wolf Too doing amazing things and being loved by his peers.  The footage seemed to work in the first movie, but it doesn't really fly here. Maybe basketball highlights and breakdancing are more exciting that boxing highlights and frisbee catching.I don't know why the screenwriter didn't choose to elevate the \"teenage werewolf\" theme and concentrate on some of the difficulties of dealing with that type of situation when in doesn't involve winning in sports. Why not introduce a female 'teen wolf' and show us the problems associated with her situation.I could go on and on about how it could have been done, but unfortunately, they have already wasted my time with this piece of trash. The only thing good about the DVD is that you can flip it over and watch the original Teen Wolf. On the other hand, the worst thing about the original Teen Wolf DVD is that this waste of time is on the flip side of it.",

Firstly the only reason the first film was such a success is that Mr. Fox was in it so you'd have thought that no Fox would mean no sequel. But no, some bright spark thought 'Hey lets use another character and why dont we make him Scotts cousin and lets make him completely devoid of charm, and hey while were at it lets replace funny Stiles with a new unfunny and rather annoying Stiles.'....bah!!!!! Annoyingly Teen Wolf Too is included on the Teen Wolf DVD which is a shame as i'd rather have seen some special features, extras etc from the first movie instead of valuable space being taken up by this sorry sequel.

The storyline was a carbon copy of the first one - swap out basketball for boxing, same awkward coaching interactions, same friends getting annoyed with the werewolf getting attention, same lessons learned at the end.

This is understandable considering we are dealing with a new place and apparently new people. Well, that is actually what made me start thinking about this film and that is that as far as I could tell, there was only one actor, and that is the father (James Hampton) that actually came across from the original movie. However, there were a number of characters that came over as well (including Styles and the Coach) but it appears that these actors had better things to do with their time.Oh, the guy that plays Chubby comes over as well, but maybe that was because he was having a lot of difficulty finding work in Hollywood at the time.Okay, now that we have put that aside, I might then go on to suggest that this film reminds me of The Hangover Part II. No, not because it is about a bunch of guys that get outrageously drunk and have to piece the previous night together (though if they had thrown a werewolf into it, it might have made that movie somewhat more interesting) but rather because it is an exact duplicate of Teen Wolf, to the point that we pretty much know exactly what is going to happen. The only difference is because we are dealing with boxing as opposed to basketball, and we are in college as opposed to high school.Oh, we do have mention of those dreaded sports scholarships that seem to full American Universities with semi-literate people we are able to coast through their courses simply because they are really good at sports (and considering that college and highschool football is actually a big money spinner over in the states, I can see why they want to attract the best athletes). However, we must remember that while the athletes may become millionaires (if they are lucky and don't land up like Al Bundy, working in a ladies shoe shop, caught in some familial situation where he is the butt of all the jokes), it is the geeks that go on to become billionaires (unless, of course, you are like me that you did not actually use your geekiness and your intelligence wisely, and ended up wasting your time playing Dungeons and Dragons, and wasting your money buying Magic Cards).",

            "content": "Though it is an unneccessary sequel, and we can feel this had a good deal, on putting a hiatus or arrested development on JB's carrer, it's kind of cool, and intriguing why they used 'Too' as if a ballsy attempt, for making for a cute double meaning title. JB plays Michael J Fox cousin, so we know we're gonna see the same sprouting beard hair, the lighting up of emerald wolf eyes. Extra sharp protruding finger nails, and fangs dropping. Story is basically same, and for me who just watched this, and should of 33 years ago, the tired moral, the film represents, made it cliche'd and predictable, one character providing a twist towards the end, even though I sensed it much earlier, which you don't have to be Einstein to figure it. The film's thankful offering for me here was Bateman, and I really like this dude, and always have, though really hasn't doesn't much for me as an actor. Again wolfing, turns an unpopular loser, with scientific talent, into a fully bearded, campus stud, who in and out of wolf form, extracts a bit of revenge on those ridiculing score, who are making his college days, less than liveable. The opening song honoring the college campus, is what really stays with me, and the opening scene, in John (Gomez Addams) Astin's office, with his snarling controlled canine, is probably, sadly, the funniest in the whole film, and there was that boxing scene between the school bully at the fatboy, where the bully gives new meaning, to the term, 'lightning punches'. TW 2 or too, is lighthearted, late 80's comedy entertainment, where you can just be glad, Bateman was in this. I would of loved Jerry Levine to reprise his role, as the wild sex starved Styles in this, but we don't have a too bad substitute, but the original, of course, substitutes for this better, but this is very entertaining fun, if waning a little now from age. Sad too (ha) fine actor James Hampton who starred in this and the original, had died this year from Parkinson, if a cruel irony, condsidering M J Fox has it too. And yet again, I can't get that Hamilton tune out my head. .",

            "content": "Jason Bateman is much better than the film deserves, and actually gives a sharp and funny performance despite the mediocre production. We see the same progression in Todd as we had scene before with Michael J. Fox's Scott, where both characters turn on their friends and become real jerks after getting a taste of teenage popularity. The only difference here is that Todd is now playing for the college boxing team rather than a high school basketball team. When topped off with the rather ugly make-up effects, Jason Bateman looks more like a disfigured cat than he ever does a wolf. Paul Sand, Mark Holton, and James Hampton make appearances from the original, with John Astin and Kim Darby joining the cast.Christopher Leitch leaves nothing to chance in this unnecessary sequel, trying his best to recreate the same successes of the first film with very little variance. Still it's the 80's so I can't hate. The story is pretty much a re-hash of the original but is about boxing instead of b-ball and is at university instead of high school. The acting is actually quite good, considering the movie's obvious low budget and overall silliness. The werewolf \"FX\" (ie - make-up) is a little crude but it is done well enough to just about suspend disbelief.Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",

The movie was a terrible sequel to the original Teen Wolf, which was corny, but it has something good. This movie about a guy who becomes the Wolf Todd Howard, tried to but basically did not convey some of the ideas of the original Teen Wolf movie about Scott Howard who became a wolf. That means a viewer who has seen Teen Wolf, will immediately draws a comparison to Teen Wolf when they watch this, but it is a bad comparison. For one thing Teen Wolf conveyed a concept about team work, with the sport of Basketball. Scott Howard of Teen Wolf learns that team work is important. For this movie they tried the same thing, but they picked the wrong sport to relate to teamwork (Boxing), so you don't get the same message. In Teen Wolf, Scott Howard becomes the Wolf and the important guy and gets some attention from the beautiful girl he has been chasing. In this movie, it is not obvious that Todd Howard is chasing the beautiful girl. In Teen Wolf, Scott Howard has a long time girl friend who objects to the wolf, who is not the attention grabbing beautiful girl he is chasing, but someone less attractive, who likes him for himself. In this movie the same part is there, but she is not someone who has been around Todd all his life, and furthermore, she is the prettiest girl in the movie, so the message is not the same. You will probably wonder why when you watch this movie too.",

Sometimes you can't escape it even if you have a successful career.The original was okay when I was a teen but in hindsight, nope.Of course it's a far fetched movie; it's about a werewolf. That aside, if they are telling a story in the otherwise real world, then attempt to make it realistic. I mean, come on, who gives a boxing scholarship? Yes, some will say that football, for example, is barbaric and not worthy of the same consideration. I love football, so I'm bias. In all reality, no sport should get you a scholarship, academic excellence should. Very few people actually go on to a professional sport, let alone for several years, relative to the number who play in college. Then you have the chubby kid in fencing?! It's like movie portrayals of the chubby kid playing the baseball catcher. The constant squatting to standing and a rocket arm!!
