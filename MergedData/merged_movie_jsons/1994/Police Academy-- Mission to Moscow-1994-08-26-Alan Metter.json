            "content": "What is it that's so resolutely unfunny about Mission to Moscow? Is it the lifeless direction? The disinterested performances? The lack of atmosphere? The joke-free script? It's all of these things, of course, but there's also something inexplicably poor about it that you just can't quite put your finger on.The regulars are the major weak point. While the guest cast have the misjudged enthusiasm to irksomely overact, all the usual culprits seem embarrassed by the whole thing. None of them sell their underwritten, reheated lines, and the fact that Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey failed to sign up is a damning indictment. What comes through the screen, from George Gaynes to David Graf, is the sense of souls bleeding. \"Please get me a proper job, there must be a better way to pay my mortgage\" these actors scream with every fibre of their being. Leslie Easterbrook gets her usual single \"my character's got big breasts\" joke - why does she even bother to sign up for this crap? Michael Winslow looks old, tired, and frankly bored with the whole thing. Was his involvement only confirmed at the last minute? Because while he gives a curiously muted performance throughout, the script also fails to accommodate his talents in almost any way. Note that this is the ONLY Police Academy sequel in which he doesn't do his (admittedly run into the ground) \"Bruce Lee\" schtick.Police Academy managed to keep up the same level of quality between films three to six - they were all rubbish. But even by their low standards Mission to Moscow plumbs the depths, making Citizens on Patrol look like Annie Hall. New recruit Charlie Schlatter, there for the completely incongruous love interest theme, is never funny and the Russian characters are the crass stereotypes you'd expect. Any film that promises \"we're going to kick buttski\" is clearly dumber than is tolerable, and a tasteless reference to Chernobyl doesn't help matters.The only Police Academy film made outside the 80s, it was produced five years after the last one - why?!!?? Was there a big demand in the market for sh*te? Some cartoon sound effects (whistles, birdcall, etc.) are added to the action to try and pep things up, but this really is a DOA of a movie. True to form (or should that be formula?) it ends with an extended chase sequence that is neither suspenseful nor convincing.Just look at scenes like the one where G.W. Bailey gets hit in the face with stew. The stew is clearly missing his face and just lands on his chin, so Bailey (the only regular who tries) moves his face so that the full brunt of the stew will land on it. This dedication to duty is admirable, but also perfectly highlights the sloppy desperation of the whole thing.\nThe series' move from the teen fodder of the first two, 15 certificate, movies had been subverted into the last five, PG cert entries. This is at its lowest ebb here; a comedy that seems wholly aimed at the under-5s and doesn't know what to do with its characters. Russian acrobats entertain the kiddies while its ... er... \"stars\"... are left to stand around like second bananas, giving unfunny reaction shots.Maybe it's the \"fish out of water\" feel of it all, with the somewhat flat Russian espionage themes failing to ignite. But whatever it is, Mission to Moscow feels like a TV sitcom with the canned laughter track removed. In any other franchise this would be described as an \"unfortunate, sad end\" to the series. With Police Academy however, finishing with one of the unfunniest comedies of all time seems strangely apt. 2/10.",

Ten years after it's release we got to see the quite awful Police Academy 7.It ruins the spirit of a film series when later installments fail to match up to the original. The Police Academy films were brilliant with the exception of Part 4 but even Part 4 was better than this.For starters, it was too serious. The first six Police Academy films had our heroes battling bumbling foes such as street punks and bumbling diamond thieves. But in this movie the heroes battled the Russian mafia. It didn't seem right.There were very few laughs in this movie, in fact there were none really. Maybe it would have been better if there had been more laughs and a less serious storyline. Being serious didn't do this film any justice.I felt real disappointed when I first watched this in 1994 because it got me thinking about how I had sat in a cinema ten years earlier enjoying a really funny movie.",

I mean come on, George Gaynes is now the lead actor in the credits?!  Bubba's gone, Matt McCoy's gone, not even Lance Kinsey's Proctor came back.  And poor Charlie Schlatter.  Six years ago he was starring opposite the legendary George Burns in \"18 Again,\" and now he's doing stuff like this.  I feel for ya, bro.  But as far as the film goes, here's what passed for a joke: Gaynes getting into the wrong car and riding with strangers...oh stop, your killin me!  And way too painful sight gags like Bailey's inner ear being yanked with an earpiece through a wall.  Mmm, that was just tough to watch, not funny.  I have to come clean here, though.  I did not see this entire movie. I gave it 45 minutes but just couldn't take it anymore, it was just too putrid.  I didn't even get my customary smile at the opening credits when Robert Folk's familiar P.A. theme started up... they revamped the damn thing! Yuck, stay away from this dreck.",

Namely one Konstantine Konali who has invented a video game that is sweeping the nation.  He plans a sequel that will include a piece of software that will him access to any computer that comes in contact with the game.  Can the officers get enough evidence before he succeeds?  Meanwhile Lassard gets lost and moves in with a Russian family.I always feel that when even the support characters start to back out of a film series then you're onto a loser.  Surely the fact that even Steve Guttenberg felt he'd had enough by part 4 should have told the makers and the audience that enough was enough.  The plot is \u0096 oh arse, what's the point!!?  Imagine all the characters being allowed to get into all sorts of stupid and unlikely situations all in the name of dumb jokes and you'll have an idea of what this is about.  The plot of bringing down the Russian mob is only evident at the start and end \u0096 the rest of it is just one silly pratfall after another.  Some of it is amusing \u0096 I've always found Lassard's innocent wanderings to be pretty funny and the only smile I had was where he wnet off with a Russian family!None of the cast have anything approaching ambition or drive.  They seem happy to be sitting in their cartoon characters for 7 movies!  Gaynes is as dopey as ever but I like that.  Graf is dead now and it's sad to think this is his legacy.  I have seen him in other films and he's OK when he's not just shouting and firing comedy guns.  Winslow needs to get a new act \u0096 does anyone find `the human sound effect' funny anymore?  Easterbrook is blonde with large breasts \u0096 and that's all the film needs her to do.  Schlatter makes a weak lead man and is real poor.  But wait \u0096 my God but who are these support actors?Is that Claire Forlani?  Why yes it is, well I suppose she was still at the bottom of her career ladder.  Oh no \u0096 tell me that isn't Ron Perlman, but it was and he just seems content to be in an American movie no matter how bad it is.  Worse still is the fact that Christopher Lee is in this at all \u0096 I know he is having a great spell at the moment but is this how low he sunk at one point?Overall this has almost no smiles in it never mind laughs of any form.  Even die hard fans of the series and idiots who laugh when they see the colour red will struggle with this.",

            "content": "Imagine having your testicles ripped off by a Grizzly and you're half way to appreciating how painful an experience this movie is. Whatever you thought about the previous Police Academy movies (and I'm not particularly fond of any of them) they at least fitted in to the genre of comedy. This one creates it's own sub-genre: the anti-comedy. There's not a single joke in the entire film that makes any sense, and this is partly due to the fact that the script reads as though it was translated from English into Russian and then back again. And I'm not trying to insult the Russians. They get a hard enough time in the movie. If the makers of this film are to be believed, the Russian people are a humourless bunch, and so you imagine that the producers thought that a film with absolutely no humour in it would go down a storm with Moscow audiences. Now, I've never seen a Russian comedy, but I think it's safe to bet that they're better than this.In one scene, a character batters a hole in a hotel room door using an ice bucket stuck to his head. I don't know why, and it's typical of this film that you're never quite sure what it is you're supposed to be laughing at. The jokes just rattle on and on like this making no sense whatsoever.If you were to convince yourself that what you were actually watching was a serious drama about the mental illness of a high-ranking police officer lost in Moscow, you might get some perverse pleasure out of this. On the video packet, though, the distributors assure us that it's a comedy, so you can't even give the film the benefit of the doubt.It's interesting to note that after the Police Academy team's adventure in Moscow, the authorities saw fit to let them back into their own country, where they went on to make Police Academy : The Series which is, believe it or not, even worse than this.Best to watch this drunk.

I don't give many movie Zero stars, because I like giving at least a full star rating, but this sequel is just so awful one cannot even believe their eyes when watching this worthless tripe. Is there one laugh to be found in the entire movie? Well, yes there was one scene that had me laughing, it's how the news reporter is supposed to be hooked on \"The Game\" but there is actually no video game inside the unit. Aside from that this is so awful that it doesn't even deserved to be mentioned in the same sentence as comedy, indeed it doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence of Police Academy 5!

The plot is so deeply stupid that I lose IQ points just typing it. Series regulars George Gaynes, Michael Winslow, David Graf, Leslie Easterbrook, and G.W. Bailey return. No laughs are to be had. The cast, whose likability kept the series afloat early on even when the jokes missed the mark, can do nothing to save this sinking ship. Actually, it had already sunk by this point. Now it's just a few survivors desperately trying to stay afloat before the sharks eat them. Avoid unless you are a glutton for punishment.",

The news reporter on TV is playing with a Gameboy (I think), apparently playing a new popular game. On closer inspection, as we get close ups, you notice there isn't actually a game cart in the back of the GB, utter fail in the first five minutes.The plot kinda sounds OK when you think about it, the Russian mafia laundering money under the guise of a highly addictive and popular video game. The bad guys use this game to be able to hack into any computer system it has been played on, hence they are able to commit many crimes. So Lassard and his best men are brought in to bring down this Russian gang led by a well cast Perlman.The cast for this final outing is sparse, we still have Tackleberry, Jones, Callahan, and Harris, but we are missing many of the regular officers such as Hightower, Hooks, Proctor, Fackler, Nick Lassard and of course old Mahoney. This time without Nick Lassard as the Mahoney replacement, we have another replacement, this time for Nick Lassard! This new recruit looks like a young Matt McCoy (Nick Lassard) but has none of the charm, I'm not even sure why he's in the film really as he pretty much does nothing.That is the whole problem with this film, nothing actually happens. There aren't really any pranks, not many laughs, no training sequences (thank god) and not much plot excitement. There is one amusing sequence where Harris and Tackleberry join in on a Russian ballet performance in full get up, but that's about it really. There are some silly acrobatics from some Russian cops that seem to be mute, a mediocre car chase and a small hint of humour. Not even Harris or his Russian equivalent can help this film.Unfortunately its a poor exit for the franchise with this final film, the last film was quite good at times but this is really dull and not at all visually exciting, its all filmed on location in Russia but it looks grim. Cultural differences are of course used but none of it really works, its just not funny. The fact that Cmdt. Lassard spends half the film AWOL with a Russian family merely by accident just seemed like the writers had no idea what to do with him, he's virtually a cameo. Quick mention for Christopher Lee who looks quite good as the Russian Cmdt. but I have to wonder why he agreed to this bottom of the barrel flick. The final curtain falls on this quite historic franchise but not to a standing ovation I'm afraid, bit of a stinker.2/10",

While I have only seen the first two films, I decided to watch this final movie for one big reason...it's currently on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List--the 100 lowest rated major release films. Somehow it turned out to be the only entry in the series to make the list.The plot involves SOME of the idiots from the previous films being invited to Russia to help the Russian police capture a gangster named Kanali (Ron Perlman). And, once there, the team act like a bunch of brain-dead buffoons. Steve Guttenberg left the series after the fourth film (a sure sign that the franchise stinks when even Guttenberg won't appear in the movies), he's replaced with a bland wimp played by...well, who cares?? He's not the only absence...several other series regulars are strangely absent....their good luck, actually as the film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever....none.How bad all this? Well, for starters nothing about this is funny. Instead of laughs, they use a lot of bad slapstick...such as a scene where the perennial foil, Captain Harris, has a dog urinate in his face and several scenes where guys are hit in the crotch. Also, for big laughs(?) all the sound effects not done by Michael Winslow were stangely loud and exaggerated. None of the film makes much sense and it's obvious that the actors were simply going through the motions in order to get a paycheck and they had pretty much given up on their careers.Overall, a film that is LESS funny than cancer...and a truly cynical excuse to squeeze the last few dollars out of a failing franchise. See it only if, like me, you actually WANT to see all of the Bottom 100. I can think of no other reason to see it...unless you are a masochist or plan on using it to torture someone.I give this one a 2....as at least the film has nice cinematography and is in focus and has sound.",

There is at least two genuinely funny scenes, one of which I referred to in the subject. I won't spoil the other one for you. The plot isn't completely contrived either. The premise of the Russian video game as a criminal tool is great. I wish it had been explored further. Konstantin Kanali (Ron Pearlman) is genuinely funny and charismatic. Cmdt. Lasard (George Gaines) also steals a few scenes. I never tire of his deadpan expression.This isn't Citizen Kane but it might induce a few chuckles.

This is a comedy without any jokes, no story, no anything. It's not hard to get why this is the last credit for both screenwriters. We see something with a bellboy in a hotel, then something with Lassard getting in the wrong car, some bike tricks with Jones, just try to make a plot out of this. The actors all look incredibly bored, even the new guy seems like he's already sick of these movies. The attempts to humour are just really bizarre. Of course you have the usual reused jokes from the original, but now they've added weird cartoon sound effects to them like you're on a really bad trip. In reality you're just watching a really bad movie. Really it's no surprise this movie tanked, just check out the tagline. Oh God the tagline. Kicking buttski(cringe). Make you laughski(roll up in a ball). The academy is YAAARGH back...ski. Excuse me I'm going to hang myself now.",

This one sees the few remaining familiar faces heading off to Russia to combat an evil megalomaniac who plans to put Trojan horse software into a popular video game franchise he's created.It's as ludicrous as it sounds, but what really hurts MISSION TO MOSCOW is the lack of talent involved. I never thought I'd miss Steve Guttenberg but I really did and David Graf is no substitute. Michael Winslow is the only one I have any remaining liking for and even he's more annoying than funny here. Poor old George Gaynes and G.W. Bailey play out the same tired gags that they've been running since the first instalment.It's fair to say that I never laughed once during this puerile gag-fest in which all the jokes are well telegraphed, the slapstick is painful rather than amusing, and the acting embarrassing. This is the infamous POLICE ACADEMY that Christopher Lee appeared in as a favour, although thankfully he's not on screen too much. As for Ron Perlman's villain...well, Perlman has made his disdain of the movie widely known, so there's not much more to be said than that.",

I was actually amused and even chuckled at this silly movie. I do admit that seeing the great Christopher Lee in this movie was surprising but then I read on some other websites that he did it as a personal favor to the director ?? or something.Mr Lee does try hard with the limited time he's on screen,I laughed at his scenes with Gaynes,especially when they kissed each other on the mouth at the end of the movie, I fell out of my chair laughing. Michael Winslow has two funny scenes with Mr Lee too,he is so funny with his mouth noises.Ron Perlman doesn't fair as well as the bad guy,he comes off like a Boris and Natasha cartoon character. I did think Leslie Easterbrook was funny in that big hairdo and especially when she falls off the piano while singing. Look for GW Bailey dressed in a tutu doing ballet ,the scene is so stupid that it's funny. I also remember Charlie Schlatter as a cadet who sneaks his way into the Moscow Mission,he did some other better movies before PA but unlike some other actors ,if your not a high tier you might have to just take what comes your way to earn a paycheck.Hey I would do a PA movie ,it would be good fun and to get paid for it too would just be a bonus. One thing noted,they did film it in Moscow ,if you watch the backgrounds during the car chase scenes you will see some beautiful buildings and scenery in Moscow. The ceremony scene at the end was filmed in Red Square. I also read this article about what was going on during the film shoot.\"In the midst of shooting, cast and crew had to retreat quickly when Government troops began their October 1993 assault on the Russian parliament building. Series producer Paul Maslanski (who also made The Russia House in Moscow) and director Alan Metter (Back to School) were lunching at the US Embassy when the confrontation began. They decided to regroup with their company at the quaintly-named Hotel Gorbachev Finance Academy about five miles from the chaos. After a few days indoors and confident that President Yeltsin had regained control, their fictitious mayhem was able to resume.So there was some actual mayhem going on. Still not bad for a movie that actually got filmed in Russias capital of all places.Enjoy",

            "content": "As has been said before in my reviews for the previous six 'Police Academy' films, the best of the 'Police Academy' films will always be the original by quite some way. It isn't great and will never be a favourite comedy or overall film of mine, but it clearly knew what it wanted to be so it was easy to take it for what it was and what it set out to do.It was followed by six sequels, and none of them were as good or even on the same level as the first, though admittedly some are worse than others. Most of them are actually being pretty bad or worse and lose what was enjoyable about the original in the first place. While it was with the fourth film where things properly got particularly stale, it was from the fifth film where finding redeeming qualities proved to be difficult, with the sixth film and especially this one being particularly bad.Just in case you're wondering why all the seven films were watched, mainly it was curiosity to see as to whether the sequels were as bad as their reputations, to see if they were that bad or if it was a case of going against the general consensus (which honestly has happened with me before).'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' is the worst of the series and is the first time in a while where watching a film (which always helps me forget any troubles and is a favourite pastime) feels like the viewer is serving a life sentence of their own. Not even some nice locations can save it because a gorgeous city is not used in its full majesty. The previous sequels ranged from tolerable to terrible but still had a couple of casting bright spots or gags that just about worked. 'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' has neither of those, it's completely devoid of laughs and has no redeeming qualities, as the locations are pretty wasted here they are not enough to count as one.Only a few of the original cast members return, but are reduced to acting even stupider than before and looking bored while all their material is one-joke and no longer funny, instead being dull and annoying and saying it's gone beyond breaking point doesn't feel enough. Charlie Schlatter, if can be humanly possible, manages to be even blander and more ill at ease than Matt McCoy.And what possessed great actors like Christopher Lee and Ron Perlman to take part? Lee tries but has very little to do, an unforgivable waste of a screen icon who could turn lesser material into gold when able and a crime that none of the other films committed. Perlman constantly looked like he regretted doing the whole thing, the embarrassment and lack of enthusiasm is all over his face the whole time he's on screen.'Police Academy: Mission to Moscow' is so amateurish-looking it makes the previous sequels, all of which looked cheap, look like Best Cinematography/Editing Oscar winners. There is nothing memorable about the soundtrack, while the direction gave the sense that the director didn't know what he was doing.Like the sixth film, the premise was stale by the fourth film but now it is a case of an increasingly thin and repetitive premise stretched to breaking point and now with this film beyond that. The film is completely laughter-free, with recycled material that passed its sell by date long ago, and at worst the writing and gags are worse than infantile, swaps genuine hilarity, wit and cleverness for a distasteful mean-spiritedness, low-brow smut (that would make the crudest 'Carry On' films seen sophisticated in comparison) and juvenile vulgarity.In summary, absolutely awful and the worst of the 'Police Academy' films. Mercifully, no more was made after this. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Clearly the writers didn't care, so why should we? Trust me, when you find out what the supposed plan is, it's beyond ridiculous. I watched the second movie, the third and then this on TV. Not sure why they skipped the three inbetween... I have a hard time imagining that they were worse than this. At this time six years had passed since a flick in the series(you know, back when they cranked them out as if their oxygen supply was depending on it). You might think this time was spent on a script. You would be wrong. This is violently unfunny, with extremely poor, uninspired and half-assedly executed gags. Do you laugh when you see things flying back and forth through the air? If so, this is for you. Literally, I think that was their goal. Try to count the amount of objects that you'll see this happen to. They're also unbelievably culturally insensitive. If this stuff was at least clever, or had genuine observations, but it's based on a proud ignorance(and clear fear) of anything beyond the borders of the US. Had this been seen by many ex-Soviets, the Cold War may have started back up. Not just because it's offensive, no, also on account of how incredibly stupid it makes its country of origin look. Look. I have guilty pleasures. We all do. This one, however, crosses a line that I'm not sure anybody realized existed. You see, whenever the production of a creative enterprise is undertaken, there's an expectation that actual effort will go into it. If nothing else, by accident. This manages to avoid that entirely. A lot of energy must have been spent on keeping it out. The acting is bad. Characters are cartoons. The \"humor\" is screwball without skill. Cinematography and editing are average at best. At least there are hot chicks. There is brief nudity in this. I recommend this to those who have to experience the dread for themselves. 1/10",

It's SUPPOSED to be and, on that level, it works brilliantly. I loved it. The extended car chase near the end is hilarious & the running joke of Commandant Lazzard spending the whole film with a funeral party never gets boring. Apart from that, can anybody name me ONE other Hollywood movie shot so extensively in the middle of (beautiful) Moscow ??? Steve Guttenberg may have been the star of the Police Academy series but (in my opinion) he was far from being the best actor, or the funniest character. George Gaynes ( a wonderful classically-trained actor) David Graf (RIP) and G W Bailey were always better. In fact, I missed Eric Lazzard's goldfish more than Mahoney. Perhaps a russian version of The Blue Oyster Bar would have added to the fun but all-in-all I enjoyed this film throughout. Just watch and enjoy for what it is.  7 out of 10.",

Released the total of five years after the sixth, maybe you could expect a bit more of some original movies than the the movies that came spitting out from the mid 80ties to the late, no - it just tops the final thing about the whole Police Academy series, that it's truly bad movies.If you love the movies with your heart, I guess you'll think this is a bit cool, but for all others - avoid!",

Perhaps it is the incredibly stilted dialogue. Could it possibly be that the characters don't even receive half of their first dimension? Regardless of the reason, one cannot help but imagine that if Ed Wood were alive today, this would be the kind of film he'd make.The Police Academy films as a series were never about high-brow humour, or high-brow anything, but this film has so many problems with it that it's impossible to know where to begin. Charlie Schlatter, obviously desperate to appear in anything since his career tanked after The Delinquents, plays a part that is as discernably different from Brownie Hansen as a white wall is discernably different from a bone-white wall at a distance of eighty feet. George Gaynes is the top-billed star, but the story displaces him from the action very early on. The rest of the cast struggle with a script that doesn't even allow them to perform the schtick that they got down to an art in the other six films.The story, such as it is, concerns itself with a Russian crime syndicate that distributes a video game. So far, so good, except the first moment we see when the game is explained involves a newscaster playing it on a Nintendo Gameboy... that doesn't have a cartridge loaded into the appropriate slot. It gets worse from there. Claire Forlani gets the thankless task of portraying Charlie Schlatter's love interest. Given that she doesn't draw attention to her poor acting, even trying to act off a guy who looks more like Alfred E. Newman than police officer material, she must represent the Good Actor quotient of this episode. The plot is not a whole lot better. I can understand Charlie's character going into the crime boss' hideout undercover, but I'd like to know how it is that almost the entire rest of the squad show up.Ron Perlman and Christopher Lee also get a turn to injure their careers here. Lee's performance is fairly quick and to the point, giving a bit of exposition to explain why the Russian police would solicit the help of these goofballs. His screen time is minimal, but it's not enough to add this film to the list that have left Christopher Lee wanting to fire his agent. Ron Perlman gets a great deal more screen time, but thankfully he manages to convince the audience, in spite of the layers of crap, that he really can act. While you're watching him, however, spare a thought for G.W. Bailey, who has tried so hard to find credible work outside of this ridiculous franchise, all to no avail.To be fair, the film is fairly reasonably shot. The photography, while not nearly as brilliant as that shown in Sergio Leone films, is competent enough to demonstrate why the only way to present a film is in the intended aspect ratio whenever the option exists. The dialogue, while horribly stilted, manages to get the story across. I wonder if it is just a coincidence that the character name Konali is so similar to that of a video game developer (Konami). I also wonder if the Russian gymnast police were originally intended to make grunting sounds similar to the bleating of monkeys. The last strength of the film, as is always the case where Police Academy is concerned, would be the incomparable George Gaynes, although one has to wonder if he was in full possession of his faculties from around the time he signed his contract.I gave Police Academy: Mission To Moscow a one out of ten. Don't act like you're surprised. This is without a doubt one of the worst films ever made, and its place on the IMDb's bottom 100 is well-deserved. Its best purpose is as a present for someone you're not fond of.",

So Cmndt. Alexandrei Nikolaivich Rakov (Christopher Lee) sends for help from Russia to America, and obviously it is Cmndt. Eric Lassard (George Gaynes) and the Police Academy: Sgt. Larvelle Jones (Michael Winslow), Sgt. Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) and Capt. Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), plus Capt. Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey), that answer the call for help. While Lassard is hanging out with a family he presumes knows Rakov, the heroes are trying to bring down Konali, who is planning to create another game, \"The Next Game\", which could bring down the systems protecting and belonging to the world powers. Also starring Claire Forlani as Katrina, Charlie Schlatter as Cadet Kyle Connors, Richard Israel as Adam Sharp and Vladimir Dolinsky as Bellboy. Winslow doesn't add as much humour as I'd like, Lee made a ridiculous decision to be in this, you wonder where are other regulars such as Bubba Smith and Marion Ramsey, and not even the quite magnificent sights of Russia can save this film from being a waste of time, and an unworthy anniversary celebration, let's hope this is the last time, although a spin off with just Winslow might be fun.

There was no laughing at all on my case and I was actually looking forward to this movie. I loved the first few Police Academy movies, so I didn't see why I couldn't love the last couple sequels, but at this point, I think they were just trying to milk the Police Academy series for all that it was worth. There is only 2 of the original classmates back together and we have Harris, Harris is the only funny character these past couple of sequels. Mission to Moscow really doesn't try and is without a doubt the worst of the sequels and was a waste of my time, the story was weak and the characters were lame.The team is sent to Moscow, Russia to help them out with the Russian Mofia and their crimes. The Russian Mofia is distributing video games and is brain washing the entire world with the record breaking sales they are making. But the team plans to go under cover and take down the idiot criminals who are beyond hard to believe that they could even spell let alone take over the world or security systems with their minds. Lasard must try to make sure the team can do this while trying not to embarrass the American cops and their reputations.Police Academy: Mission to Moscow, I wanted to trust this movie, I watched it with an open mind and am very disappointed. We only have Harris and Winslow to pick up the team with the laughs, but even they couldn't hold it together enough to make this movie funny. It's just trying too hard and was nothing without the old gang, it would have been so much cooler if they had the original cast back for the last movie, but I don't know if there were plans to make another Police Academy, but I'm glad they didn't.

They seem to have been hugely popular during their times of release, and really, if you look at the numbers, it's not hard to see why such a prodigious stream of sequels was made. The first movie was made for a budget of around $4.5 million and brought in a stupendous $81 million at the box office. The second movie brought in $55 million, part 3 brought $43.5 million, part 4 $28 million, part 5 almost $20 million, part 6 a meager $5 million, and Mission to Moscow proudly raked in a whopping $126,000. If nothing else, the Police Academy franchise stands as a perfect example of a film series that was played out until it was officially a very, very dead horse.The awesomely moronic plot this time involves a Russian mafia boss named Konstantine Konali (played by none other than Ron Perlman, now better known as Hellboy), who is marketing a video game that he plans to use to secretly distribute a computer virus that will allow him to hack into government security systems and like, take over the world or something. The movie opens with a scene that is meant to show us how purely addicting this game is. We see a news report where a woman is giving her news report, and her co-anchor, a man in maybe his 50s or so, is sitting next to her oblivious what's going on because he's so entranced by the Game Boy he's playing. I imagine we weren't supposed to notice that there was no cartridge in the machine he's playing, but no matter. I'm willing to let that go in order to enjoy the avalanche of stupidity that was to follow. So why are the members of our beloved Police Academy in Moscow in the first place? Well, it seems that the Russians need help in dealing with the Russian mafia, so they have recruited the help of the most famous police academy in America. And mostly the gang is all here except for Mahoney and Zed, both of whom I am sad to say are missed. Lassard, of course, is his usual self, so he has gotten himself lost and ends up at a Russian funeral within a few hours of touching down in Moscow, so the rest of the team occupies themselves with trying to compile evidence against Konali while Harris follows along two steps behind waiting to jump in at just the right moment and claim credit for everything. As usual this provides plenty of opportunities for bonehead comedy, but they just pulled out all the stops with the low brow humor this time. Harris and Tackleberry end up dancing in full make-up and costume in a Russian ballet in one of the movie's most embarrassing scenes, Harris attempts to spy on Konali and instead gets a dog peeing in his eye through a periscope, and Jones has developed the ability to open safes with his noise effects. Sigh. In the movie's defense, it does have it's moments. Well, it has it's moment, anyway. There is a scene where Tackleberry jumps at the opportunity to give a speech to the Russian authorities about American law enforcement tactics, and he launches into a vicious beratement of the piddly \"excessive force\" policies that are tying his hands back in the states. Yeah, the movie is spectacularly stupid, but this might have been one of Tackleberry's two or three best scorns in the entire series. If you ever find yourself watching this thing on DVD, make sure to watch the short supplemental video that's included! I have to admit that I have found it particularly interesting and amusing to watch these videos for each installment in the series, where much of the original cast come back together and discuss the movies. I especially love G.W. Bailey (who played Captain Harris), who clearly has grown weary of having ever had anything to do with the series. In the video for part 5, he sarcastically mentioned people who would approach him years later and ask if he still had \"Dork\" tanned across his chest. For this one, it is noticeably difficult for him to conceal his resentment as he talks about his past in performing Shakespeare on stage, and now he's remembered for a dog peeing in his eye. Don't worry, Mr. Bailey, haven't you seen the box office for this movie? No one's seen it!",

The acting is bad,and when I mean bad, I don't mean wicked or brilliant- just mediocre, the humour is more on par with the under 10s and not even clever and humorous as it was the first time round. The first two films were okay but by the third onwards, it starts to grate on you, as you wonder how on earth the people behind this managed to get away with churning out the same old tireless jokes and infantile, silly humour in each instalment.This type of humour worked with the Naked Gun trilogy but that's because it only went as far as three films, which is reasonable enough.

For some Chrisopher Lee is present, and adds some style, but does little. Claire Forlani adds some extreme beauty to the film, and she is pretty good, but clearly should not be making this kind of film. The comedy is wildly unfunny for the most part, mostly slapstick, and there are far too many unfunny noises on the soundtrack meaning we cringe throughout. The remaining actors all seem bored, and only Lassard and Harris get any chuckles. The only really funny moment I can remember is the fact that Lassard just walks into some Russian's house and becomes part of their family. It is so stupid, yet typically Lassard that you can't help but laugh. Oh yeah, and Conner's moustache being blown upwards is the other funny other moment. The rest of it is forgettable, and while the remaining characters once again show why they are there, what they do is just not funny. They should have stopped at 4.

I did that piece of CENSORED.\"He forgets - as does most of the rest of the non-bonkers world, that there was a 1997 syndicated Police Academy series that followed a new crew of recruits across 26 episodes. Only Winslow would return as Jones, but there were guest-starring roles for Easterbrook with Callahan becoming a district attorney, Art Metrano as Mauser, Gaynes as Lassard, Graf as Tackleberry, who is now a Captain, Colleen Camp appearing in archival footage and Tim Kazurinsky as Sweetchuck. Bubba Smith would finally come back as well, with Hightower being promoted to Captain in episode 19.There was also a 65-episode cartoon series that spawned a comic book and Kenner action figure line, which is amazing when you consider that the original Police Academy movies earned their R rating.While the TV series is unavailable on DVD or even streaming, the cartoon certainly is. It was animated by Toei. Yes, the same studio that made Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon.",

Actually it culminates in the equally terrible 'Police Academy: The series', but that's neither here nor there (but fits in well on the crap-o-graph).This film is bad for so many reasons it is frightening. My first beef is with roping in a few well respected actors into this farrago. My second is with all the terrible Russian stereotypes. Well actually my second is really that this film is crap, but that's a bit general.The fact that the Police Academy series has followed such an easily identifiable loss of quality surely showed someone that making this piece of crap was a bad idea. Or at the very least showed them where they went wrong in the previous 4. It is just a project that was bereft of ideas from the start, a sign of a bankrupt imagination.What a load of Crap.

And it is Lassard who carries the humor trough whole movie, I Had some really funny moments watching him with the his Russian family. Konali is quite good for being a bad guy, and brings certainly some action to this movie with his villains. But i only give 5 stars for that reason that there is used to many same jokes as before, and we would have needed at least Hightower and proctor to fill the gap, now we get instead some strange Russian polices and a annoying Lt.Talinsky.

            "content": "Sometimes it seems producers have a hard time understanding when a movie shouldn't be made. The \"Police Academy\" franchise should have ended in the sixth film, and even then it would be ending up pretty worn out. This film, made several years later, was an effort that was simply needless and certainly leaves no one with good memories.After seeing the movie, I was really sorry that the franchise ended with such a bad movie. It was something that, for me, should have been avoided. \"Police Academy\" was one of the most interesting and successful comic franchises of the 80s, and there are still many people who have fond memories of these films today. I myself, as a child, saw them several times on television.The script is perfectly idiotic and a simple excuse to take some of the characters in the film to post-Soviet Russia, where they must help the local police to fight a big mobster who is turning into an oligarch (one of many that, as we know, emerged from the ashes of the communist regime, fat with shady deals in which the Russian people ended up losing). It's an unhappy, poor script made by incapable people. Humor, on the other hand, is completely absent. I don't laugh for a single minute.The cast, which until now had been relatively stable (with the absence of several actors starting from the fourth film), had completely collapsed, and most actors refused to be part of this project. George Gaynes is back, but his character, Commander Lassard, looks simply like an old man with Alzheimer's (with all due respect to anyone suffering from this serious illness, don't get me wrong). Gaynes is not funny, and his performance here is disgraceful. Michael Winslow also tries to make some of the jokes he's already used to us, taking advantage of his vocal skills... but he doesn't have the material or time and what he does has no freshness or novelty. Sir Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance in the film, and as far as I can understand, he did so as a favor to the producer. Friendship is a beautiful thing, and also professional courtesy, but I bet Lee won't want to be remembered for this movie (and he certainly won't, he's done better things, as we know). Who ends up standing out in some way is Ron Perlman. The actor, who we know for other, much more dignified works, tried to be funny and give some dignity to his character. Meritorious, respectable, but unworthy of the actor he is. The rest of the cast is not worth mentioning.Are there any redeeming qualities in this film? To be honest, I don't think so..., but even so, I feel obliged to make a small caveat: I liked the fact that they did a lot of the filming in the real city of Moscow and that they used real Russian extras and Russian speakers. This gives the film a certain authenticity that deserves to be highlighted, and which is most lacking nowadays, where any piece of green or blue screen replaces a real set and saves a few dollars on the production budget. However, it must have taken courage and some dose of madness to try to make a film in the midst of the political and military upheavals Russia was experiencing in those years.",

PA6: Mission To Moscow is a bland, retarded piece of film-making, and totally (and rightfully) killed off the Police Academy franchise for good (I hope). Whereas the first film was mediocre, but humorous fare, this film has killed any and all attempts at police comedies. Seriously, the stuff in this film is so outdated, cheesy and stupid that it's a miracle the film was even released in the first place.Basically, for those of you who haven't seen the film, the plot goes like this: the Russian government is having trouble with the local Mafia, and decides to call on the Police Academy recruits for help (are you kidding me? You telling me that the Russian police are so inept that they need help from a bunch of young cadets?), and the veterans of the PA force (read: the only actors actually needing paychecks) enlist the help of some young recruits to help them stop this guy named Konstantine, who has made a new video game called \"The Game\" (nice marketing tie-in) that can brainwash people or hack into computers...whatever the script calls for.This film is truly something. I mean, most of the original cast left (including the actors who played Hightower, Hooks, Proctor, and Mahoney) and were replaced by a few no-name actors. There's even a subplot in the film that deals with a young recruit trying to woo over a Russian translator (played by Claire Forlani, who really should know better than this). Heck, the main \"plot\" of the video game just sort of disappears for most of the movie, as does Sgt. Lassard, who strangely ends up living with a Russian family for the majority of the film. The jokes are tired and lifeless. Captain Callahan STILL emphasizes her breasts, Tackleberry STILL loves guns, Sgt. Jones STILL makes weird noises, and Captain Harris is STILL a bumbling fool.The filmmakers should have known that when the supporting cast from the previous films backed out, they were in deep trouble. As it is, the film just drags for the entire running time. It's only saved by the performances of the veteran actors like George Gaynes and Christopher Lee (and no, I am not counting Michael Winslow). The film ends up resorting to physical humor in order to elicit a laugh, and doesn't focus on the interaction between the characters. It's just the same things from the past few films repeated, ad nauseum. The film doesn't even really have a proper ending, just Cadet Connors hooking up with the Russian woman.Bottom Line: This truly was the death knell for the Police Academy series. Still, it did have a few good actors doing what they could to lift the material, so that is one point in the film's favor. I give this film a 3 out of 10. Stick to the original.",

Without these, the film sucks big time.If you are a fan of the Police Academy series, you will want to see it, but I guarantee you will watch it only once.",

The 2016 movie was bad enough but just the trailer of After Life made my eyes roll. How about that latest Vacation movie? Mission to Moscow is at least as good as those and it has an advantage those movies didn't have. This doesnt try so hard to be something its not. Good.This movie is lousy compared to everything else already done in the series. I liked the Police Academy movies when they were new to cable. Granted my age was still in single digits in those days and Id grown out of cartoons by then. I remember seeing 2, 3, 5 and 6 often on Cinemax and I do mean often. Paid Cable had a tendency to beat to death certain movies. There is a nostalgia around them like sitting through Twins, Memories of Me, Money Pit, Punchline, Awakenings, Air America, Weekend at Bernies and Who's Harry Crumb? All movies played out beyond anyones comprehension on cable, But Mission to Moscow? I didnt know that existed until years later because it was direct to video. Now that Ive seen it, I can at least say Ive seen it.What everyone says about it is true. It was all done before and better in these movies with a fuller ensemble cast and when the gags weren't worn out yet. I wouldn't recommend watching this one. Really the backstory about the making of this is far more interesting and would have been an excellent documentary. Not many comedies are produced in the middle of a civil war. I found myself imagining what was happening behind the scenes when I should have been laughing at the jokes. It is also interesting to see Russia instead of Toronto like most of the other movies.Another advantage this movie has over the overdone but still bad remakes is you can at least see some of the original cast, half of which are gone now. Indeed, David Graf has been gone for nearly 20 years now.Again, its bad but in the present day context of what Hollywood tries to revive based on name recognition alone, it is at least as good as most of them...",

After the total failures of Police Academy 4, 5 and 6, what the hell was Alan Metter (the director) thinking when he decided to produce this piece of SH*T? The way he created this pile of garbage and got away with it is absolutely disgraceful! I think Mr Metter needs psychiatric help! The film is so bad it makes you want to VOMIT! It's a terrible mess. They should of put a warning sign at the beginning of the film saying how lousy it was going to be. The acting is awful, the plot is trash and the jokes are appallingly unfunny. When the Environmental Agency in the US prevented them from filming their dirty work on home territory, the Police Academy gang (Lassard, Jones, Tackleberry, Callahan and Harris) fled to Russia to deal with the mafia and kick some buttski. Instead, we see them making complete fools of themselves. It's embarrassing! It's toilet humour! How many more times are we going to see the same old, repetitive and rehashed gags? When will those clowns who came up with the idea to make this get it through their thick heads that this kind of stupid crap is not funny anymore? This is bad comedy at it's best! Cheap, lame, sloppy, cack-handed and utterly redundant. By far, the very worst film ever made. They don't come any worse than this!Rating: 0/10",

            "content": "Easily the worse comedy I've seen to date. Everything was horrible about this film. You get the feeling that when they were halfway through filming this heap they must've said to each other \"You know, this film is truly going to die at the box office, let just do any old crap, film it and send that out to the cinemas. They'll buy it, it got Police Academy written on the box after all\".The best bit that just completely sums up how bad the film was ***SPOILER WARNING*** (Like I'll spoil anything anyway lol) was when Jones and Tackleberry go to collect lassarde from his hotel room. They arrive outside his door and they become suspicious that all is not well inside. So they decide to investigate. Now at this point you'd think Tack would simply kick the door open and shout \"Freeze\", as is normal procedure for cops to do in America. No, not for this film, they decided that the methods for kicking doors down was downright silly. Instead Tack decides he needs the aid of an Icebucket...on his head. Clearly when he went through the academy they showed him differently the way to gain entry into a locked room - by putting a bucket on your head and ramming it against the door presumably. He puts a hole through the door anyway, stands up, takes the ice bucket off his head, sighs and then walks away with Jones without even going inside to investigate. All that stupidity for nothing and not one bit funny, logical or rational. ***SPOILER OVER*** I think about halfway through the film I began to realise this was not getting any better. I found myself becoming entertained by the site of my dog licking her rear in front of me. It was funnier too.Anyway I recommend you to watch this \"film\" just purely to see how bad the series had become and to find out just how bad films can be in general. On the other hand I recommend you NOT to watch it if you want to stop your brain melting out of your ear holes with boredom.",

It is the weakest movie in it and your only hope is that it is in the \u201cSo bad it is good\u201d category of your taste. Even my childhood nostalgia cant prevent me from disliking this movie. It is just a shell of what we have started. I continues the trend of being more cheesy and silly than the previous movie in the franchise. Unluckily it is not the good kind that in combination with the cast made it charming and enjoyable.  It is again more like a ticking off things from a to do list without having the insight why these have worked in the first movies. It is even worse as we have 2 legendary actors as support with Ron Pearlman and Christopher Lee. The title Mission to Moscow is what you get. The chief of Moscow\u2019s police Commandant Rakov has problems in dealing with the rich and famous businessman by day and secretly crime-boss by night Kostantine Konali (open secret without any provable evidence or witnesses;-). Because he knows Commandant Lassard from the past he asks him for help as his man / woman are efficient and as outsiders is certainly not on Konalis pay-list or even radar.  There is also relevance to a video game from Konali called The Game (zero creativity for naming this). This is the set up for the movie. I have been repeating this for the last movies and say it again. There is so much potential here and I see the sparks of things that could be awesome. However it does not work as the story is not immersive and not enjoyable enough. It is tasteless and boring compared to the first 3 movies and even the next three had more redeeming qualities. The humor is mostly weak and failed to get laughs out of me. What I truly hate is that we have lost so many actors of the great cast (Clarification: Lost not in the way of passing but in the way of never returning to the franchise). This continued from (later) movie to movie. It is a last man standing situation. Left are George Gaynes (Eric Lassard), David Graf (Eugene Tackleberry), Michael Winslow (Larvell Jones), G. W. Bailey(Thaddeus Harris) and Leslie Easterbrook (Debbie Callahan). That means we have lost from the last movie: Bubba Smith (Moses Hightower), Matt McCoy (Nick Lassard), Marion Ramsey (Laverne Hooks), Bruce Mahler (Douglas Fackler) and Lance Kinsey (Carl Proctor). I am a huge fan of the cast but here they cant deliver and their ranks are so thinned out. I have respect for all of them and say they were cast in a horrible script. Non of the characters works well here and it pains me to say this. These were so iconic and our childhood favorites. But this is not even me. It failed at the box office and is hated by fans and critics. Overall this is a sad end of a once great franchise and I must warn you from this movie. Like I said the only hope is that it has the so bad it is good (=entertaining) appeal for you which is even more sad.",
