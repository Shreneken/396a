            "review_title": "The best Hindi comedy ever made!",
            "content": "There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.",

            "content": "Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first  being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is  nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make  it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions  in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I  never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two  characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces.  Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The  real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.  The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless  sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to  get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo  a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to  India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join  hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl.  When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both  of them get into Raveena's house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as  his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are  complicated as Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and  pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get  rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and  sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.  This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it.  I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also  recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good  comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).",

            "content": "There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be  box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and \"Kaliaa\" make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being \"loud\" at times, it remains one of the scarce \"funny\" movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned.",

Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.All an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema.",

It never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick.",

I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genre of Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies).",

            "review_title": "Brilliantly Marvellous",
            "content": "Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you'll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but I'll put the characters in order of favoritism: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew but for Mogambo, he's more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, \"A Fraud and a Cheat!\"). Now, Gogo's only goal is to get back what's his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogo's struggle against the sinner-world.Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajaj's twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the night's darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveena's Dad), though Teja doesn't regret his actions. Teja's sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his father's cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveena's father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.I won't reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldn't stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet there'll be a second ride after that... and then a third!The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back!",

Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) 'regains his memory'. I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count. And I'm so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi/ Urdu and loves good comedy.Watch it you'll love it!!!!!",

When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it.....The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber. Then they both get a news that a Millionaire 's daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ...both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon..(the millionaires daughter)......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is Raveenas Uncle (Millionaire's look alike brother) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father.....since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know).......then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly funny......The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....Aamir khan uses his \"aaila \" brilliantly and Salman goes like \"OOima \"........and for Gogo there is \" Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega\" ......each and every scene is so funny......I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having \"chillar\" money in a bag....that scene is so funny..I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret.......",

Yes, comic book villains.We'll return to our two main leads and their despicability in a moment. But first, let's talk about the actual comedy. This era of Indian film-making seems to think that it's the height of humour for the main character to say something that gets misunderstood, pull a funny face and get whacked on the top of their head. That's about three quarters of the jokes in this film. Stuff you would see in Looney Tunes here in the West. Except more subdued and slow because it's a life-action film.And I'm sorry, but that's just not funny. Perhaps it is to an Indian audience. From what I've read, this is a beloved comedy classic in India. But humour is very subjective and often very hard to translate. And this is a fine example of just that.It doesn't help that I found the two main characters to be utterly loathsome human beings. Everything they do, they do for money. Sure, the film tries to convince you that they end up caring for the heiress and her household, but that's a lie. These two shouldn't get the girls at the end of the film. That's a horrible message to convey to your audience. A sick, disgusting message.Not a good film. This comedy is not funny, subtle or benign. If given the chance, give it a hard skip.",

I don't mind cheesy slapstick humor, but what I do mind is cheesy humor targeted at 6-10 year olds. Some of Salman and the 'Goondas' antics during the 2nd half are downright stupid, and NOT funny. Stuff like 'crime master gogo' may appeal to people who laugh too easily....but it ain't my cup of tea. Nonetheless, barring the final 35 mins. or so and the occasional silly humor, AAA is a laugh-riot not to be missed led by Aamir and Salman's great performances. The chemistry shared between these two is something we probably haven't seen shared between any two actors since. Karishma and Raveena have also lend in fine support. Paresh Rawal's double role is a standout among everybody else. Overall, AAA is a hilarious flick with good repeat value.",

While jokes don't always hit the mark, there are many scenes in this movies which are very funny and even some of the songs are catchy.

In fact, I have noticed that nearly all the films I have seen and reviewed from India were made after the mid-1990s. Now I mean no offense by this, but I notice a HUGE difference in the quality of the films made before this and after. The earlier films tended to have poor sound (the dance music sounds canned), the acting is broader quality-wise most of these earlier films don't come close to the quality of Hollywood's productions. But this definitely has changed in recent years, and now often Indian movies are among the best and highest quality you can find.I decided to watch \"Andaz Apna Apna\" even though it is an older Indian film because I have so enjoyed the movies of Aamir Khan....and Salman Khan to a lesser extent. But I soon realized the film would not appeal to me for a variety of reasons. The sound quality was terrible...cheap and flat. The acting was broad and over-the-top...and about as subtle as an episode of \"Benny Hill\" (at best). Finally, the film makes many references to films made before 1994 and apart from a few films where and there and the very realistic movies of Satyajit Ray, I just didn't understand the references. Had I been Indian and grew up with the films, I am sure I would have appreciated it much more.So this is my verdict. If you like older Indian films and don't mind ridiculous comedy (accompanied by funny sound effects and broad overacting), you'll probably love it. But for westerners not in love with older Indian films, it will be a chore to finish.",

Certainly a victim of high expectations, Andaz failed to update or improve comic shticks that were unoriginal fifty years ago. Energetic and upbeat, this film had its heart in the right place, but could rarely elevate jokes above the \"smirk\" level. Every character was initially amusing, but their simplicity and lack of evolution aggravated the already substantial run time. The music was not even memorable. This is not to say I hate the movie or was even particularly bored. Hijinks were certainly abound. I was never surprised by any outcome, but was at least amused watching each bit of chicanery unfold. Humor is arguably the most subject aspect of film, and I will surely not claim that I was able to pick up every subtlety across the language barrier.

All that existed in the name of comedy was appalling David Dhawan and Govinda combo (sic!). \"Andaz Apna Apna\" is a cult-classic which in today's times can be compared to a \"Hera Pheri\". Sadly when released in 1994 it was written off as a flop. Even the casting coup Aamir vs. Salman and Raveena vs. Karishma combo did not stir the cash register. Rajkumar Santoshi proved he is a maverick by steering away from his forte action genre and trying his hand in an un-ventured territory. Aamir Khan clearly ruled the roost. He was at ease in the character of super-confident conman. Comedy timing perfected to the \"T\".Salman Khan had lots of potential in the character. Sadly he clearly faltered. Probably he did not develop the sense of comic-timing then. Nonetheless Salman is compensated with the actual booty in the movie. Raveena and Karishma were passable. Paresh Rawal showed his promise in the comedy genre. Sadly year later it took \"Hera Pheri\" for the people to take notice. Other star-cast namely Shakti Kapoor, Mehmood, Jagdeep, Deven Varma, Shehzaad Khan, Harish Patel & Tiku were spot on. Each character leaves an lasting impression. Its a character-based storyline. Songs deserve a special mention as they carry the tinge of the 1960 (ode to O P Nayyar, Naushad, Shankar-Jaikishen etc). At the risk of being repetitive, \"Andaz Apna Apna\" is an under-rated classic. Every scene/ every line is nothing short of gem. A definite \"miss-me-not\" movie.",

The sad thing is there actually are some decent comic ideas in the script, but it's all executed so amateurishly and clearly aimed at the lowest common denominator.

Something remarkable in the top250: Almost all recent Hindi movies are starring Aamir Khan.

We don't need this movie to be among the most iconic comedies of Indian cinema.Now, let's call the film what it really is, it's iconic alright, due to Salman and Amir being together and making a slapstick that can be termed as mindless comedy. But the sheer amount of stupidity and borrowed dialogues really tries to make you stop the whole thing, but you just survive in order to complete the thing thinking that this is the only time we are seeing these two guys together and it should be funny afterword.This is the trend shown by the film on Imdb as well, where it was the highest rated Bollywood movie at a time and now it's down to a more reasonable 61st position, which is still high given that original good comedies like Welcome don't feature in the list, but the rank is sure to increase once more people see it in search of good cinema and find it underwhelming.Jaane Bhi do yaaro was much better just on the fact that it at least came before this and hence was more original.",

            "content": "This film is one of the few truly avant-garde comedies out there, not caring whatsoever to follow any standard conventions of filmmaking, in the same exact way that avant-garde jazz does not follow musical structure to a T. Instead, this film ebbs and flows as it feels like, taking us on a boisterously funny ride through a bizarro world where rules are broken at will. Not just rules of filmmaking but even basic laws of physics, such as teleportation of characters in and out of the frame for no other functional purpose than to be goofy.As we are taken through this amusement park ride of a movie, Mr. Rajkumar Santoshi never fails to capture and spoof almost every single Bollywood stereotype one could name. We see the hyper-masculine competition, gaming, wooing, and ultimately winning over of hyper-feminine hearts. We see extra-cheesy fighting with a side of guns and stupidly complex crime plots, garnished with amazingly stock punch and kick sound effects. We hear overly long musical songs thrown in with seemingly no added value. We have the typical \"common nothing man\" attempt to rise up well above his caste and \"be something\". We see a slightly exaggerated version of a culture entirely based on BSing one another to get ahead: indeed, nearly every character in the entire film is quite practiced in the art of BS, and not only is it expected but also glorified and even rewarded.One evident con of the film is its hefty runtime, most of which is due to repetition and dragging out of many elements. However, I posit that all of this is for the greater good, and that it serves two functions: one is to keep the parody angle pure since many Bollywood films are this long for this exact reason. The other is that Santoshi employed repetition artistically as a motif throughout. Firstly, the title itself repeats the same word \"Apna\" twice. In line with this theme of twos, every major character has a mirror version of themselves. Amar and Prem have the exact same situations with their respective fathers and goals. Raveena and Karisma share similar romantic situations, but opposite in polarity: one is rich, one is poor, but the message of \"love me for who I am, not for the money\" exists in both -- not to mention this is yet another theme to add to the pile of spoofed cheesy Bollywood messages. Ram Bajaj and Teja literally are twins played by the same actor, and they are morally opposite (\"good\" vs. \"bad\") but just as powerful as each other. Even Teja's idiot goons come in two, by no coincidence. The backing purpose behind this is likely just as bonkers as the entire premise for the film, something along the lines of, \"Hey this is good! Why not double it? Double the characters equals double the fun!\"The soundtrack is incredible and fits perfectly with the '80s low-budget absurd throwback retro vibes. For these reasons, it's good enough to listen to on its own but also was applied well in the film. In the same vein as everything else in the movie, the music just kinda felt like showing up whenever, and sharply ended whenever it felt like it, no big deal we all just hangin' out, ayyy.Andaz Apna Apna is a very unique, unconventional comedy which values fun over form and doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever.",

While some films have been good (Lagaan, Drishyam, Gangs of Wasseypur as examples) there are those such as Andaz Apna that are woefully lacking in merit to be rated as highly as they are. The story line, filming style and sense of humour are akin to the British Carry on movies only with more musical interludes and an extra hour in length. The story line sees our two main characters competing for the love and affection of a wealthy heiress who has recently returned from London. What follows is a series of attempts to get close to her all the while inadvertently avoiding and preventing the death/capture of the girl by an evil criminal! Sounds ridiculous? that's because it is! It's certainly not all bad and there are some moments of humour and slapstick that do raise a smile and there are little parts of the story that are inventive. However overall this film lacks enough genuine laugh out loud moments and there is little to hold the attention throughout, especially when there are some clear directions the story is going in but it leaves you waiting and waiting before they materialise on screen.Don't base this film on a sole judgement of Indian movies, I know a number of people are unhappy at the inclusion of several 'overrated' movies in the IMDb Top 250 however it isn't the whole story, other Indian movies do warrant their inclusion, unfortunately Andaz Apna isn't one of them.",

Its not very surprising that most Indian film buffs know this film by heart. Its a genius work and there is no doubt about it. Never a day goes by when I don't cite some dialog or situation from this film like \"Gurujee Main Star To Ban Jaoonga Na?\", \"Mujhe Dekh Ke Ise Bhee Josh A Gaya\",\"Unhe Bhee Laga Ladke Kee Baat Main Dum hai\". Acting is brilliant but its the dialogs and situations that makes this film. Surely anybody can act with such a brilliant script. Music of the film is very bad and there is a lot of it too. The only bad actor in this film is Karishma Kapoor. Bhalla walks away with the glory inspite of such big cast. Its a gem of a film. One my most favorite dialog from this film is \"Ek Ek Sawal Do Do Jawab. Ek Ek Sawal Do Do Jawab. Sawal Ek Jawab Do.\"9/10.",

We we watch laugh loud at videos where people slip and fall at banana skins, fart loudly in meetings, kick someone between the legs: this does not mean these are to be considered cult classics. Some of the songs are good, but you could easily hear them on your music player or over the youtube. Performance wise, Aamir proves that he can act really bad and weird at times, Salman is not and never was a good actor. However, acting was never a requirement for this movie. They have excelled in the other department ( screen presence). Going with 3 stars because some scenes are funny because, they are so weird.",

Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep over acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi hasn't been able to make this cult classic again!

Karishma and Raveena provide the love interest. There are some catchy musical numbers, a couple of which are surprisingly old-fashioned. The climax is a bit of a letdown with Shakti Kapoor overacting as Crime Master Gogo! Although very long, this film is certainly enjoyable.Overall 7/10",

But that's its charm. Santoshi's Screenplay is hilarious & offers tremendous scope for spontaneity. While he Directs this wacky tale with such freeness & energy, its hard to lose focus at any given time. Watching the nutty protagonists fight for love, money & madness, thoroughly engages you!The Performances are flat-out hilarious too. Aamir Khan & Salman Khan are the comedic duo of, perhaps, all-times! As Amar & Prem respectively, the Superstars are at their funniest best & their on-screen camaraderie is the highpoint of the enterprise. Raveena Tandon & Karishma Kapoor willingly add to the craziness, while Paresh Rawal is mesmerizing in dual roles. Viju Khote & Shehzad Khan are superb too. But its Shakti Kapoor's Tour-De-Force as Crime Master Gogo, that merits the highest praise.On the whole, 'Andaz Apna Apna' is comedic magic!",

The film is really hilarious, at times too slapstick but yet it works out well, Though it's plot is outlandish Director Rajkumar Santoshi after serious films like Ghayal,Damini showed his versatility,though this was started in between of Ghayal and Damini. The film is memorable due to it's chemistry between actors,it's comedy scenes and also it's tributes like Crime Master Gogo being called Mogambo Ka Bhatija.etc and also has digs of Sholay The film at times doesn't make sense too and at times things look too far fetched but then it suits it's genreMusic is good, some songs are made to look straight out of a 50s or 60s film to pay tribute, Illu Illu, Yeh Raat and all songs are goodThe actors have inconsistent looks due to it's delay but it doesn't suffer on performance level. Aamir Khan is superb as Amar, he is simply too good and makes you laugh throughout Salman Khan though does lag behind and tries a bit too hard yet does make you laugh at times, but their chemistry is topnotch Karisma irritates,Raveena is decent Amongst rest Paresh Rawal is hilarious in both roles, Shehzad Khan imitates his father Ajit in a funny way, Viju Khote are too good, Shakti Kapoor gives one of his memorable performances as Crime Master Gogo,Deven Verma has a brief role and is superb, Mehmood has one scene as a fraud director of Wah Wah Productions(Tribute to Pyaar Kiye Jaa).Jagdeep is as usual in a small role,",

The girls Raveena and Karisma were good in their respective roles but this is a movie where they had nothing to do. Of course, the plot is filled with lot of absurdities and is full of loopholes. But that's something you have to expect in a crazy laugh riot like this. Salman's changing hairstyles, the swapping of names between Raveena and Karisma stick out like a sore thumb. The movie took 3 years to be completed and the gap of 3 years was certainly noticeable in the film. Anyways, AAA is a perfect comical masala film which can surely be enjoyed with family.

I would love to know if this catchphrase has the same meaning in the original language.The rivalry/friendship between the 2 lead roles is entertaining, and the tricky schemes that they come up with to get the girl provide a lot of the comedy.The only real criticism I have for the film, is that sometimes it became too farcicle (uncles and evil twins being mistaken for each other, and being bonked on the head), and I think a couple more songs wouldnt have gone amiss.",

This is also a movie that can be seen many times across one's lifetime. Kudos to Raj Kumar Santoshi & Team for giving us 160minutes of 'Pure Happiness'. No wonder, it has achieved a cult status in the comedy genre.",

            "content": "I don't really write reviews, but I felt compelled after reading some of the more recent reviews on this film. First of all, yes there are many people who enjoy this movie due to nostalgic reasons. If you are someone who wants to watch this movie past the year 2015 and you've never seen it before, then yes the movie might seem really outdated. However, I think you need to give it a chance! When the movie first released, it was considered a flop! It began to gain recognition later on. So, one cannot dismiss it based on its release date.I watched this movie when I was a kid and I laughed at the awfully choreographed fight scenes because I thought they looked stupid. Now, I am in my mid-twenties and every time I watch this film, I remind myself that this movie doesn't take itself seriously. So why should I?The performances are great, especially Aamir Khan's acting. Even the \"villains\" are hilarious, and Paresh Rawal is a wonderful actor. I would have to say my favorite character was crime master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor). He is supposed to be the bad guy, but he's pretty naive and every scene of his is wonderfully humorous. I've watched this movie countless of times, and each time I laugh from beginning to the end. It's original, and it's comic genius! Every single scene, song, dialogue, and behavior is intentionally meant to make its audience laugh. It's a silly movie that doesn't shy away from laughing at itself. The best thing about this movie is kid friendly. It doesn't rely on vulgarities to make its audience laugh.If you just want to sit back and watch a light comedy, then this is it!I would like to add that it might not be as funny to those who do not speak or understand Hindi. This movie's humor is highly specific and there are a lot of rhyming jokes that just would not work via subtitles or dubbing. It can get lost in translation.",

I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo,Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal,Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. Its what i call the Hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie.",

            "content": "Andaaz Apna Apna review :\"Do dost ek hi pyaale se chai piyenge...\" suggests one superstar to another in one of their initial and only film together...Andaaz Apna Apna is indeed one of its kind.Considered a cult classic today, the film was a box office dud when it released way back in 1994. I was amongst the few who saw the film as a college kid at the near empty Metro Cinema in Mumbai. I laughed my guts out at antics of Amar and Prem (Aamir's Hai-la perfectly complemented Salman's Ooi-maa) and looking at the then tepid audience response, wondered why such a rib tickling sparkling clean super slapstick comedy fail?Lack of promotion, underwhelming music and then reigning Hum Aapke Hain Koun (1994) occupying most of the theatres were some of the reasons cited for the films failure.Revisiting the movie again on DVD last night with my teenage son, he casually remarked that this film would've been a blockbuster had it released today. It then struck me that perhaps this movie was a few decades ahead of its time and would've actually clicked with today's gen had it come now. Imagine watching Aamir Khan and Salman Khan together in a totally mad caper with unforgettable characters like Tejaa, Bhalla, Robert and Crime master Gogo mouthing hilarious dialogues like \"Tejaa main hoon mark idhar hai...\", \"Galti se mistake ho gaya..\", and \"Aankhen nikal ke gotiyan khelta hoon\". Every scene and dialogue of this Raj Kumar Santoshi (written and directed) venture brings atleast a smile on your face if not LOL.Planned as a quickie, Andaaz Apna Apna took more than three years to complete and there were rumours of Aamir - Salman ego issues being the reason for the delay. However, in a recent interview, director Rajkumar Santoshi refuted these claims though he admitted that getting the actors' dates was a challenge. An additional song (Shola Shola) was recorded but not filmed keeping in mind the film's run time. The makers expected the movie to be a runaway hit but unfortunately, that was not to be..Andaaz Apna Apna is not the only hindi film which attained cult status after failing in its initial theatrical run...Raj Kapoor's Mera Naam Joker (1970) and Guru Dutt's Kaagaz ke Phool (1959) (both my personal faves too) are best examples of the failure turned classic story. Andaaz Apna Apna belongs to that elite club.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni",

The movie later started getting telecasted in indian TV channels and over the years and years it became \"The cult classic of Indian Cinema\" . Whats the reason ? The reason is the subtle moments . When you see the movie for the first time you don't know whats gonna come next and you don't focus on the subtle moments. You see it again and you get few things but still not very great for you. Now you see other set of people praising the movie like hell! You start noticing few scenes which are like a laugh riot for huge group of people but wasn't so for yourself . And when you again watch those scene to understand why others are laughing , that is the moment you get into the minute subtle moments of the film which makes it great. The movie is literally like a red wine which you like more when it becomes older i.e. when you watch it again and again . Subtle moments like Aamir displaying football with the glass and Salman taking a burp while drinking the sharbat , \"ye teza teza kya hai\" remark of Shakti Kapoor, \"Teza mai hun mark idhar hai \" of Paresh Rawal , etc and etc couldn't be enjoyed if watched for the first time by many , but these scenes become the laugh riot and defining scenes of the movie later.",

Anyone who watches AAA will get shocked to hear that it was a flop in theatre.\nThough there were many cult classics like agneepath, lamhe, swades etc, they had its own share of flaws and were not entirely a blockbuster material. But AAA(barring songs) had everything right in it to become a huge money spinner. It had Aamir Khan and Salman Khan as the male leads who were young superstars at that time, Raveena tandon and Karishma Kapoor who were rising female heroines at that time, Third directorial venture and first full fledged comedy film of Rajkumar Santoshi after action drama Ghayal and social drama Damini. But poor marketing and long delay in making turned it into a complete washout winding up within three days of release. Later as it deserved became a huge sensation when it came on DVD and television.\nIt narrates the story of Amar(Aamir) and Prem(Salman) , a lazy guys dreaming to achieve big without any hardwork. When a rich girl Raveena(Raveena tandon) comes from London to India for marrying a suitable groom, Amar and Prem comes and start hitting on her trying mostly to outsmart each other. But Teja(Paresh Rawal) twin brother of raveena's dad wants to kill her and usurp her property. How Amar and Prem saves Raveena's family from bad guys is the rest of the story.\nI loved the performances of Aamir Khan, Paresh Rawal, Shahzad Khan and Shakti Kapoor especially my personal favorite is Shahzad Khan as Bhalla whose peculiar dialogue delivery I love to imitate while watching. I liked Salman's performance in the climax. Heroines have nothing to do other than being a mere spectators of the chaos.\nThe only drawback of AAA is its songs which sounded like 60's instead of 90's. But that can be forgiven for a film which is so entertaining.\nRajkumar Santoshi proved his versatility in handling comedy effortlessly.\nOn the whole AAA till now is the only madcap comedy film till now which instead of scratching your heads will put a smile on your face from start to finish",

How they convince Karishma to fall in love with one of them and how they compete with one another makes the movie, while Karishma is facing threats from a doppelganger of her own father, makes up the movie.One of the most favorite aspects of this movie for me was the music. Each song was a gem, and since I watched it yesterday I have been listening to all the songs on loop. The music was a great call back to the classic songs of the late 70s and early 80s. Wonderful music and I loved the references within the songs to different actors and iconic songs.The comedy of the movie was really good, it was the right amount of fun. I usually find myself bored in a lot of recent Hindi comedies, especially the Akshay Kumar ones like Good Newz and even Welcome. I just find them boring and cringey and too over the top for my taste. But Andaz Apna Apna was the perfect comedy and will from now on be my go to comedy in Hindi cinema. So glad I finally got myself to watch them.The acting in the movie was really good and it was filled with a great star cast. I put it aside a little as I'm not a fan of Aamir Khan, although I mostly watched his post Dhoom 3 movies which had some good movies but bad acting for most part imo. But he was amazing in Andaz Apna Apna, and I definitely want to explore his 90s movies and classics more now. I love SRK because I did this kind of exploration of how he grew through 90s and 2000s, want to do it with Aamir now too. Salman was fine, he was fun to watch with his mannerisms. Paresh Rawal was a laugh riot, love the man in anything I watch, and he did not disappoint a single bit in this film. I was not very familiar with Shakthi Kapoor prior to watching AAA, but now I will remember him forever as Captain GoGo that is the most iconic comedic villain in Hindi cinema for me. I would not at all have minded a spin off after this for Captain Gogo. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor did well in their roles, I liked the twists and turns and the meta humor with their names.Honestly, after watching the film, I was surprised to learn it flopped. But I am glad it reached cult classic status and it will be one of the classic. Overall, a great comedy which everyone should try. Also please enjoy the album, it's such a banger.",

Each of characters are so interesting and funny. The whole premise is ludicrous but you are drawn into it as the movie keeps you interested.I give full credit to the director and producer for assembling such a star cast and manage to get the movie on to production. The actors have all delivered justice to their roles. Let us be honest, these are not oscar winning roles that challenges these actors but there needs to some involvement and seriousness that delivers believable performance.But more than the lead cast, it is the support cast that is memorable. How can anyone forget Crime Master Gogo or \"Rabbit\". That is what makes movie so thoroughly enjoyable.Only thing that I would have against the movie is that not all of the music and song/dance sequence is upto the mark. Some of them are purely skippable (though understandable that it would have been difficult then to remove songs all together given the established norms)In the end, this is a must watch movie for any Hindi movie buff and should be among the various lists of movies.",

Aamir Khan and Salman Khan on the screen gel well together. One of the reasons why every scene of this film has tremendous recall value in India, is because it has been screened an insane number of times on TV, and since its forte lies mainly in scene-to-scene situational humour, one would never really need to see the entire movie to enjoy it.

The plan of kidnap being made by the two boys Jaishankar and Nagesh to kidnap V.S.Raghavan to impress him by getting him released from kidnappers and the plan getting failed and the heroes informing the daughters Sechu and Jayalalithaa that they did plan to kidnap but their plan failed and actual villains have kidnapped their father. The same scenes have been reproduced in Andaz Apna Apna.2) Similarly the scenes where Nagesh acts as mental patient who acts as if he lost his memory and stays in the house of Manorama and Cho Ramaswamy acts as a doctor and uses carpenter tools and hammer to make diagnosis of Nagesh, from the 1967 Tamil film Thenmazhai have been lifted in Andaz Apna Apna. 3)Also the climax scene of Andaz Apna Apna is straight lift from Victoria 203 where Pran and Ashok Kumar fool the villains.4) The scene where in Aamir Khan talks about some old match he was part of which in turn foils plans of Viju Khote to make the main characters drink poisonous drink, is straight lift from Adimai Penn (1969 ) produced by M.G.Ramachandran. In the original Tamil film it was actor Cho Ramasawamy who fooled the villain R.S.Manohar and foiled the evil plans by exchanging the glasses.",

The jokes are hilarious, the references are great, Aamir and Salman, along with Paresh Rawal, and the duo of Bhalla and Robert, and Shakti Kapoor as Crime master Gogo really entertain! All the characters are remembered well and iconic. All of the actors had such good chemistry. The movie has really great comedy and a great script. So many of the dialogues are remembered today, such as \"Happy Birthday Rabbit!\". Many of the scenes are also remembered today, like the cups scene and the Bade Mamoon Chote Mamoon scene. That's how good the script was, along with the directing. I'm really surprised at how the heck this wasn't a hit at the box office, because this film really deserved it! .The story was a common,typical Bollywood love triangle type of story, but the story was played out really well, and that makes you forget about the basic story being common. Everyone should watch this film, I guarantee you will be laughing!",

Visiting this movie on IMDb has made me nostalgic as I can't help myself going back in the year 1994. I was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters. It instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite. How can I say what made this movie my favourite? Was it the excellent writing ( story was OK but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous) Was it the superlative performances? Was it the mood of the film?After thinking about it for so many years I say it has to be a mixture. It is one of those movies which didn't have any flaws not even its music.(the other movie coming up in my mind right now is Sholay)PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee..........",

This is one of the best movies to have come out of the Indian film industry post the new age cinema wave of the 70s. After the dime-a-dozen masala potboilers of the 80s (not to take away anything from the films of that decade: different times, different sensibilities) Andaz Apna Apna was like a breath of fresh air. The antics of the entire cast leaves the viewers in splits. The comedy might be a bit slapstick and the editing a bit shoddy, but the performances seem at ease. I remember watching this movie in the theater: the laughter never died: it was one gag after the other.Even after all these years, I remember all the dialogues in the movie. And like another all time great Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, this movie does come up for discussion each time my friends and I watch any new comedy to come out of the Hindi film industry, serving as a benchmark.P.S. I have watched the movie at least 15 times :)",

This movie released in the cinemas during the peak examination season for school and university students in India (considered a very wrong period to release an Indian movie), and even the music was hardly popular. The result was obvious; the movie didn't last even one full week at some cinemas. But over the years, since the advent of the TV movies and the CD (Compact Disc) revolution in late 90's, this movie became an absolute sleeper hit. There were so many re-runs on TV for this movie, that viewers just stopped by to catch a comic scene. The dialogues of this movie became common punchlines and jokes for everyone. The villains (Shakti Kapoor and Paresh Rawal) are idolized till date, for this memorable role of theirs.Today it is 20 years since the release of this movie, and even till date, Andaz Apna Apna ranks as one of the best comedy movies of Indian cinema. Everything about this movie is magic. The script, the chemistry between the leads (Aamir & Salman), the villains, the side-kicks (Viju Khote and Shehzad khan), the dialogues (extremely witty and timed perfectly) and everything else.This movie is a great watch / re-run with friends, and excellent way to reminisce old times.

For example, the random money that the guys give to shyamgopal Bajaj, the number is also funny, INR 8535.29.
