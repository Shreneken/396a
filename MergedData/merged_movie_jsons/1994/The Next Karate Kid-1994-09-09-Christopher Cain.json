            "content": "I really didn't think The Next Karate Kid was THAT bad. Flawed yes, but it is not terrible I don't think.As I have said, the film does have its flaws. The story is quite predictable and formulaic, though in its defence, the story wasn't necessarily a strong point in the previous three either. Second, the script has its weak spots, it did have its moments such as with Miyagi's humour. Third, there are some unrealistic moments here, the ending especially. Fourth, it isn't as efficiently paced as the first or third films.However, it is nicely filmed, the cinematography is good and the scenery is very nice. The soundtrack is pleasant, and the karate is good. The direction is good enough, and the characters are still at least engaging. The acting is decent, Hilary Swank is a worthy replacement for Ralph Macchio, while Pat Morita elevates this movie to a better level acting who is arguably the best character of the film and giving a strong performance in the process.Overall, it was pretty decent, and better than its reputation. It could have been better, but I have seen much worse movies. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

The story deals with a troublesome teenager named Julie (a newcomer Hilary Swank) , thanks to Miyagi she learns that Karate is her salvation , as she battles an evil nemesis , facing off a violent young group trained by an expert fighter (Michael Ironside) . Along the way, the Japanese Miyagi (Noriyuki, Pat Morita) born in Okinawa teaches his martial arts and to combat at a Zen temple along with some sympathetic monks . Meanwhile , Julie falls in love with a friendly youngster (Chris Conrad) .This enjoyable movie , a sort of female junior version of 'Rocky' , develops a sincere and deep friendship between two protagonists , the rookie young girl and the wise old man . Using more than her fists , Julie learns about herself and the sense of life . Agreeable and likable acting by main actors : Pat Morita and Hilary Swank .

Though not as silly as Part III, this is still not credible either, and marks an unfitting end to a story best left alone.",

            "content": "(Credit IMDb) During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right wayRalph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do?Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest.Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9? Come on, I've seen a lot worse with higher ratings. It's worth a look, but nothing more then that5/10",

New kid in town that struggles to adjust; a Mr. Miyagi that helps to instill self-confidence in the teen; and the climax of needing to use the recently learned karate in a pivotal fight scene. I was taken in both by Hilary Swank's character, expressing the range of emotions and soon willing to be positively formed (the Karate Kid characters are always so kinetic, aren't they?) and Mr. Miyagi as the walking book of Oriental proverbs. I loved it! Slow in some parts, but some intriguing scenes.",

            "content": "I thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. After all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother.I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once.",

First off, I have a hard time believing that this group of thugs would be allowed to go around tormenting students, and sexually harassing girls.

Yea, right. You cant tell me she is the FIRST girl he has tormented, and you cant tell me that no girls went home and told their parents.It appears that the football coach (?) has his own private gang/ army and he allows them, encourages even, to torture others. He says \"If a student throws a piece of paper on the floor, you make them eat it\" Yea, RIGHT! This gang walks the halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, in their tight jeans and tight, matching black t-shirts, and black leather belts. GET REAL! And apparently, they also have the right to wander the halls of the school in the middle of the night. No parent would put up with this crap going on in their child's school. If MY kid came home, told me this crap was going on, you can bet Id be on the phone with state superintendent.The coach (?) beats up his students outside, on the field, in broad daylight. This is okay? My FAVORITE, though, was the coach telling his \"gang\" to blow up that dudes car.This whole thing was a joke. The thug busts out the guys windows on prom night and says \"MEET ME AT THE DOCKS\" OK, see, Id go inside Julies house, pick up the phone, call the cops and SAY\" Some crazy dude in a jeep just busted out my windows and told me to meet him at the docks if I was brave enough\" Then, let the cops go to the docks and find his jeep, and arrest his butt.

Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process. That was very funny! And the classic \"Wax on, Wax off\" scene was different as well. It was funny when Miyagi tells Julie, \"Uh-oh, missed spot\". The set in Boston was a far cry from California. The Militant group in that group, was like the \"Cobra Kai\" in Boston. And Michael Ironside's Col. Dugan was no John Kreese. His group practically deserted him when Julie kicked some serious butt. They all paid the price when they blew up that classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they'll find redemption from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets some morals, unlike the last three, which talked about \"Honor\" and \"Respect\". Hilary Swank is outstandingly hot in any movie and everything else she does.

She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi sort of \"babysits\" her per say, he notices that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.7/10",

Especially because you get some training exercises, that tweak what we've seen before.Also Hillary Swank! I mean come on! She does the teenage rebel so good! You can see her filling the screen, even with a role like this. And I mean that it is not really something that is or demands a lot from an actor. Still with the Miyagisms (that is a word, right?) and a tight story (even if it feels a bit like a rehash from Part 1, switching genders), there are enough differences to elevate this.

Yeah, I'm not at all one of those people.Whatever, no one is going to read this anyway.I do, however, feel the need to give this two stars on principle. I mean, I did remember that they made this film when Part III was (possibly) blocked from my memory to save myself the horror of it all... but that I don't think it deserves that.When I was a kid, actually a Freshman in High School, I kind of had the attitude that no Ralph Macchio meant it wasn't a real Karate Kid film. I'd rather not see it made and I went out of my way not to watch it until I caught it on cable.I'd like to think I've matured since, but they are rebooting Blade and...no Snipes. The same attitude applies. I guess I haven't grown.At any rate, it's not just the lack of Macchio, it's the addition of Ironside doing his absolutely best impersonation of Michael Ironside and over-acting to the point where I'm actually shocked the rest of the cast made it through without groaning. He's kind of like Nicholas Cage without the charisma isn't he?Moving on, Swank does an OK job of selling it physically. I mean, I'm a pretty big guy, I was certainly a big guy in High School, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she could kick my behind from here to kingdom come. Unfortunately, as much as she does sell the physicality of the role, it doesn't take a trained eye to see she doesn't know the fundamentals of even a basic street brawl.She made up for it later in here career, but it still leaves you with the impression that she never threw a real punch in her life.And that, combined with Ironside is enough to really make this movie a flop, even if it had Macchio in it... which it doesn't, and I'm still going to be juvenile and insist it can't be a Karate Kid film without him.",

Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure. Okay!",

The script is terrible, with dialogue horribly shoehorning in \"my parents died in a car accident\" very early on. Plus scenes throughout the film happen for absolutely no reason (inside bungee jump goes unexplained), no motive no consequence.The worst part is the bad guys though, where (clearly adult) high school monitors are led by a teacher (?) who incites murder. His little army have more Hitler Youth vibes than necessary, with the main one's, Ned, first scene getting a bit too rape-y for a family film. Seriously creepy, this muscle-bound man-child seemingly working full time as security, terrorising anyone who won't 'go to the docks' with him (the docks are clearly important to this character). They even dress in their own little black uniform as if they're mix between greasers and Nazis.Swank plays the angry teen okay, but it's not a good character, simply a cliche. Even Pat Morita, who is as good in this as the previous three, couldn't save this one.",

With \"The Next Karate Kid\", the well ran dry.For a basic plot summary, the film sees Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) mentoring a troubled teen (Hilary Swank) who's parents have passed away. A mash-up of Karate Kid I, II, and III then occurs, with themes from each film present but briefly touched upon.Though I could go on and on about why this film is poor, here is the primary reason: the high expectations. The original \"Karate\" trilogy is so incredible, that anything less from the established characters is going to be a letdown. Thus, the whole movie I kept waiting for great things to happen, but they never did. I can't think of one single scene from this film that tops any scene from the first three.The only thing that elevates \"Next\" above a one star is the performance by Morita as Miyagi. As in KK III, he steals the show with his comedy and words of wisdom.I think that the fourth Karate Kid film can be summed up thusly: Had the original trilogy never been made, this film may be looked at as decent. However, when comparing it to the gold standard of that trilogy, it is hugely disappointing.",

Getting back to the movie at hand, its rather funny because, I saw Boys Don't Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank, and in flipping through the sea of channels the other night, I came across the showing of this film and I hadn't realized at the time of my first viewing of this movie that she was in it. The story centers around Julie, just like Daniel, not knowing where to fit in or if she even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help straighten her out and guide her.  I really liked this addition to the series as it gave a good feminine side to the story and yes, even some outfits that Hillary were in kept me, shall we say stimulated.Overall 3.5 out of 5",

(Not surprising, since Avildsen directed the latter film.) But it carried a non-violent message about it that was left behind in the messy sequels.\n1989 marked the end of the series. Well, at least for Ralph Macchio's Daniel. Now, there is Julie (Hilary Swank), a misguided and troubled teenaged girl who is left in the care of Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the legendary \"Wax on, wax off\" Chinese man from the previous installments. Now he is taking Julie under his wing and caring for her, much the same as she cares for a hawk named Angel that she has in a cage above the school she goes to.But soon trouble sparks in Julie's public life, which results in her being suspended from school for two weeks. This gives Mr. Miyagi and her some time to bond and reach a mutual respect for each other. Julie is taken to a Buddhist monastery, where she is taught to respect the religions and rules of others, to stray from violence when possible, and to enjoy and not mistreat life--including the lives of animals. *Yech. *I got the point of the first film. I'm starting to feel a bit of deja-vu. Some sequels are a continuation (\"The Godfather Part II,\" \"Terminator 2\"), and some are retreads (\"Police Academy\" sequels, \"Rocky\" sequels). This is a basic retread of the same ol' material used in the previous films. Whoever thought that rekindling the series was going to be profitable must have had a screw loose somewhere in their ego-inflated head. I mean, honestly, what's the point? Did the third film in the series really make that much extra money? I don't think so. But yet they thought this could work--and it doesn't. The big addition advertised here is that it's about a girl and not a boy. Well, flip me over and slap me sideways--this is seriously original and mind-blowing and worthy of two more sequels like the first film inspired!Not.\"The Next Karate Kid\" is nothing more than straight-to-video material, and yet it somehow made its way into theaters. It bombed, as far as I can tell, but it is starting to increase in video rentals due to the fact that a younger Hilary Swank (\"Insomnia\") practically started her career here, before going on to win an Oscar for the 1999 film \"Boys Don't Cry.\" You wouldn't be able to tell that she is a good actress here. In fact, she's quite annoying. Her character says the dumbest things possible given the circumstance. (For example, she wakes up in the Buddhist monastery and runs outside, screaming for Mr. Miyagi, while meditating monks are disturbed. She finds Miyagi only to tell him that she heard a loud drum outside and wants to see if he'd like to do something today. Is she really playing a mentally-developed teenager, here?)The film has an odd charm about it, and irregardless of its flaws I found myself being strangely attached to the finished film's outcome...but then the warmness dissipated by the time the truly ridiculous ending revealed itself in full idiocricy. The villain of the film is the same type of non-motivated villain seen in \"Part III\"--he takes a vengeance against these young kids and treats them as if they have committed some disastrous offense in regards to him. Quite pathetic, really. And the conclusion (spoiler!), in which the bad guys create a circle of humans and Julie enters to fight one of the teens who has been taunting her throughout the movie, just appalled me. \"The Next Karate Kid\" carries one of the worst endings of all time in cinematic history. This is a series that did not need one sequel. This is a series that never needed three.",

I know at the time Hillary Swank was just starting out and had to take whatever she could get as an actress, so she has a somewhat valid excuse. However, Pat Morita should have given more thought about this script before signing on. After all the character of \"Myagi\" was the best of his career and he should have been more protective of this beloved character. I think where this movie suffers the most is just in the lame writing. The story is just so out to lunch and feels so amateurish that you cant wonder who were the hacks brought in to write it? Give you an example, the scene where Swank firsts meets Myagi. Swanks supposed guardian or maybe it was her grandmother, cant remember, tries to introduce them. She walks away in a huff and says \"My name is Julie and I came here to live because my mother was killed in a traffic accident 6 months ago.\" I mean wow. It was so blatantly absurd.

For example, there is no reason why Miyagi would train Julie. Because Miyagi's family Karate is passed from father to son, and Daniel was like a son to him, Miyagi even gave Daniel the headband that he wore, only in this movie to take it back and give it to Julie.Also, why is Miyagi so eager to train Julie? He wasn't eager to train Daniel in the first place! And we're supposed to feel for Julie even though she's incredibly mean to Mr. Miyagi? The only time Daniel was this mean was when he was training with Cobra Kai, and that's because it was part of the movie.Another thing, remember when Miyagi said that Daniel watched too much TV when he said he thought Karate was from Buddhist temples? Well, on this movie, it is!!! Miyagi takes Julie to a Buddhist temple to train, because the brat is to full of attitude to wax on wax off.Now the villains, oh the villains. The main antagonist is Colonel Dugan, played by Michael Ironside. Who is John Kreese on super steroids. They really wanted a villain similar to Kreese but they made him an evil high school security captain. Okay, a High School security Captain is allowed to kill students? When? How? And how is he not busted in the first place? Did anybody look at his resume?There's a reason why this movie got a 7% on Rotten Tomatoes. It's very bad, it's so bad I was willing to spend extra money on Amazon to buy the Third Karate Kid seperately so I wouldn't be stuck with the Next Karate Kid. In my eyes, this movie will never be canon, and Hilary Swank should not appear on Cobra Kai. I'd rather Jaden Smith appear that her, and that's saying something!!",

The girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local ROTC...which I'll explain in a minute, has it out to get her. You know the drill...Miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.Its hokey, its cheesy, its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. My first case of \"huh?\" is why is there a \"military division\" in high school? I thought that stuff went out in the 1960's, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? The thing I noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom, blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movie.....Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like \"um...no\" If you're gonna do pathetic face turns, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank....corny but nothing to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 movies.I will say for its own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, I can accept it being more or less a spin off...but I can't accept the whole military thing, way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach, THAT would have been more believable.Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK...the rest are the same as anything, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, THAT was cool 4 out of 10",

            "content": "Not entirely sure what inspired this flick other than they put a spin on the tale to be a young girl instead. At this point, Mr. Miyagi exists in some universe where wayward kids get to learn discipline. He should actually start a school. I'm sure Hillary Swank looks back on this with some curiosity. Having to take the baton from Ralph Macchio is a pretty big ask considering he had already been through three movies. And as of 1994, we were all expecting something much more interesting. Gone is John G. Avildsen. Who, in my opinion, is a very under spoken about director. Enter Christopher Cain, whose claim to fame was the \"Young Gun\" flick.This movie seemed lazy. And may be the template to rebooted series in 2022. It's not that it was catastrophically bad, but when you make a paint by numbers movie, based on a very memorable one, it's hard to take it seriously. I think they missed the point of the original one, in that it was about father-son relationships. The dynamics of father-daughter don't seem as resonant. Specifically because the previous films are alluded to, but somehow seems dismissive. The audience has come to identify these movies more with Daniel LaRusso then with Mr. Miyagi. There's no grand tournament in the end. Just a lost girl in a new town. This familiarity breeds contempt. Yet somehow, I feel this one plays more genuine to the spirit of the Karate Kid series than the true reboot with Jackie Chan. That felt like a universe which was bizarr-o world in which the characters seemed like the previous one but slightly off.",

            "content": "The IMDb voters have been unusually cruel to this film. While it isn't by any means great, I like it and find the 95 minutes or so to be very enjoyable. We now know that then 19-year-old Hilary Swank later won an Oscar for her performance in BOYS DON'T CRY, and here she was already a beautiful young woman and a credible actress. As usual, Pat Morita is perfect as the gentle, stoic martial arts expert who always prefers avoiding a fight, but says, \"If you must fight, then win. (wink and smile).\"some SPOILERS follow, read at your considered discretion...Young Julie lost both parents in an accident and is mad at the world, her only connection seems to be an injured hawk that she cares for on the roof of the school building. Mr Miyagi was her grandfather's pal in the war, and offers to help young Julie cope with life and school. She gets expelled for two weeks on bogus grounds, but she and Miyagi use the time to visit monks and there she perfects her Karate skills.Back at school, she gets a prom date, Miyagi buys her a pretty dress, teaches her how to waltz, but the mean kids hassle them, leads to a showdown on the piers, they burn his car, Miyagi and Julie show up, she kicks the bad kid's butt, Miyagi subdues the teacher, martial arts instructor, and everyone lives happily thereafter.OK, it is greatly contrived. You can't become that good in two weeks at a monastery. Julie just too easily falls under the guidance of Mr Miyagi. The tough kids at school are too much of a cliche'. But the overall message is good, the need to find yourself, to look for the good in yourself and others, to respect all life, even the cockroach. Most of us like a story where the bad guys get put in their places. And the pretty but sad young girl becomes happy. Swank and Morita are a joy to watch, and I will watch it again.The DVD picture and sound are fine, nothing special. No meaningful extras.",

            "content": "In 1984, The Karate Kid had some charm to it, even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas, producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise, yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?Wait a minute. Next? Yep, Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, though, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before, of course. Lucky for her, she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.All those factors ad up to seven clich\u00e9s, and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does, thankfully, have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster, but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite enjoyable in the sequels, but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the \"wax on, wax off\" gag is stillborn. As for Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but that's hardly a stretch.So, is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty, but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.",

But, after reading some fairly favorable reviews...from some IMDB watchers...I spent $1.50 and rented it at my local video store. Need I go further...when I say....this was a buck-50 lost. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. First off....I realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old Macchio in this film.....But, why could'nt they have had Miyagi read a letter or something from Daniel-san...maybe explaining what happened to Daniel...hell, they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something. But, no...and to compund the already bad script....they added those stupid monks...I thought monks take a vow of silence...guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously...hehehe. The training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid...and the paramilitary group of young males....were a confusing concept to say the least....this was far from even being a martial arts movie...with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene....and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once...by the male fighting her....give me a break...she would have gotten hit at least once....I guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one. I could go on and on...but, basically...I'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad....even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at(she was sorta \"butch\" looking)....I can only think of a handful of movies that I have sit through...that compare to just how bad this flick was.....DON\"T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE..........",

There's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me.  You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself.  In this movie, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid.  You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.Not to say this movie is not without it's problems.  Unlike the first one, Mr Miyagi appears to be a little to eager to get Julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in fighting.  It almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie.  Also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks.  The movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life, and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot-line.  The villains are also a bit questionable, even though truly hateable bad guys.  I also have a suspicion about Martial Arts movies that end on prom night.So maybe this isn't a perfect movie.  So maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on a Friday night.  However, in more ways than one, it's a guilty pleasure.  Hillary Swank is just so loveable, and the story, even though unoriginal, works.  In a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air.  Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a movie about the spirit and the heart.  There are some people that need movies like this, and we'll take whatever we can get.

Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is a little clich\u00e9-filled but still super endearing and likeable. A young Hilary Swank, in her first major film role, brings a solid performance as Julie. At first I wasn't convinced, but by the end I felt like I saw a positive journey with the character.In my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's 'The Karate Kid'.

I was all set to begin today until I saw The Next Karate Kid on the site I'll be watching Cobra Kai onThe Next Karate Kid is a fantastic and underrated movie that perfectly captures the heart and soul of that the first three films are all about. Once again, Pat Morita nailed it as Mr. Miyagi, the very wise and more dignified version of Master Roshi from the Dragon Ball series. After attending his war team's reunion and visiting his deceased friend's wife, Mr. Miyagi befriends a troubled teenager named Julie Pierce played by newcomer at that time, Hilary SwankJulie is an angry teenager lashing out at the world and those around her while still grieving over the lost of her parents, her only friend in the world is a beautiful hawk named Angel who she looked after and help nurse back to health. She also befriends and later falls in love with a guy named Eric McGowen while also fighting off unwanted advances from Ned Randall. When Julie's grandmother decides to take a break at Miyagi's suggestion with Miyagi staying behind to look after Julie, at first Julie and Miyagi's relationship is rocky due to Julie being so hostile. However, that soon changes over time as Julie and Miyagi not only become close friends, but Miyagi also trains Julie in Karate. They end up staying with a Monk Monastery for not only Julie's training but to help her grow as a personAfter her spending time with the monks and undergoing Miyagi's training, Julie and Miyagi return home. But it isn't long until Ned and his friends lead by the true main villain of this movie who is very similar to John Kreese with his Cobra Kai students named Colonel Paul Dogan whose actor played Lois Lane's father in Smallville begin making trouble for Julie and Eric. It all leads to one final showdown at the docks where not only Julie and Miyagi kick some serious ass, but Ned and his friends see Dogan for what he really isI see from some of the comments and reviews for this movie that people hated this film or saw it as unsesscary which is fine, that's their opinion. I for one loved this movie and find it very underrated, it deserves a lot of love because it does capture the heart and soul of the first 3 films and what we saw from the close relationship between Daniel and Miyagi passed onto Julie and MiyagiFantastic film overall",

This young woman is a bit of a challenge to Pat Morita (what else is new). There are some new rules for her to become what she needs to become and that is the gist of this.

I grew up with the Macchio movies, but never had the pleasure of watching this train wreck of a movie.We meet Swank's character, and with no regard for subtlety, we learn her story: teenage girl, parents died, mad at life, no respect, looks like a dude. To show her defiance, she sneaks out a lot. Where does she go? That's right. Swank visits an injured hawk on the top of her school building that she feeds raw meat to every other day. Genius.Jester from Top Gun is the Faux Cobra Kai's sensai. It's depressing to watch Michael Ironside's career take a nose dive (get it) with each of his scenes. \"Absolutely.\" The FBK is pretty ridiculous. Somehow they get away with trespassing, vandalism, arson, property damage and assault because they are some sort of pseudo-ROTC. And what was with the prom-night bungee-jump scene? The love connection between the two homosexuals (Swank and Conrad) is entertaining. As is the first fight scene at the gas station. Miyagi taming a vicious Doberman, and the owner of the dog picking a fight with him because of it? . And of course, watching Swank perform Karate moves is nothing short of hysterical.Best Line of the Movie: Miyagi explains to Swank, \"Your Grandpa saved Miyagi life... a long time ago... so Miyagi tried to say thank you... teach him karate. He love Karate. He teach your father. Your father teach you.\" To which Swank replies, \"And then they died. Everybody died.\" Awesome. It was this scene and the delivery of that line that I learned the real range of Swank's talents. I also projected what I was drinking out of my mouth across the room. How this was the jump-off to Swank's career, I have no idea.It's just sad this movie was the last thing we will remember from Pat Morita's acting career.

I also found the film to be a nice change of pace for the franchise, by centering the story around a teenage girl this time. I really enjoyed the subplot involving Mr. Miyagi training Julie in the Monk Monastery. The Monks themselves get a lot of standout moments in the story.

In this installment Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, already having been in one too many of the episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's WWII buddies. Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. In steps Mr. Miyogi to set things right. True to formula, there is a group of neo-Fascist bullies, called the Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move, called the Praying Mantis. As I said before this movie is a mess, and should be avoided.",

Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable. I found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees. The camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. The Zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the \"Zen Bowling\" scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious Zen archery scene earlier on. The quality level of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing \"Listen to Your Heart\". The lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over-glorify the fighting part. All in all, I enjoyed it.",

In addition, she is fit and agile enough to do the kick and for sure she is charming and polite\u0085 To work, the team needs also a sincere mentor and Pat Morita is just perfect: always simple, straight\u0085 The zen Japanese session they took in the country may be unlikely like all the story with the always bad and grumpy Ironside but I don't care as you can find breath and wisdom. In fact, it's almost a zen movie: just a simple story with little things and that's what life is about\u0085 For sure those who seek violent bloody fight are surely disappointed but I think that the final confrontation was indeed perfectly done: it's about focus and will and not about bruises\u0085 I expect to find bad reviews about it but I don't care: in a medium filled with stupid violence, a movie like this one can't be welcomed and it's a real pity!",

Why? because you never saw him training Daniel fight moves like spin-kick and different kinds of punches. and July does them all the time.

Of course, one expects a similar treatment of the Julie Pierce (Hilary Swank) character to that of Ralph Macchio in the earlier picture, but it came across as somewhat contrived and forced. Given the script, I don't think anyone cast in the female lead would have made it much better, and Swank didn't help her cause by smiling so much once she came under Miyagi's (Miyagi) wing as a karate student. Her transition from an angry teenager who lost both her parents didn't comport well with the complete turnaround she made in such a short time. As well, there were some feeble attempts to connect with the first film in the series, like the 'wax on, wax off' car polishing scene, and the way Julie took out high school thug Ned (Michael Cavalieri) at the finale using the same high front kick to the face. For all of it, it didn't seem like Julie had to go through all the rigorous fundamentals Miyagi made Daniel-san endure before he even began teaching him some actual karate moves. Fortunately for Hilary Swank, her growth as an actress took off from here and resulted in a couple of Academy award wins as Best Actress in 2000's \"Boys Don't Cry\" and 2005's \"Million Dollar Baby\". If you absolutely must see this film to complete the Karate Kid series, do so, but you'll be better served as a Hilary Swank fan with the other two movies.",

This movie is directed by Christopher Cain (Young Guns) and stars Pat Morita (Karate Kid), Hillary Swank (Million Dollar Baby), Michael Ironside (Total Recall), Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight) and Michael Cavalieri (The Last Man Standing). The storyline for this is very fun and delivers a consistent and unique take on the karate kid storyline. The philosophies and life lessons are still good as are the analogies. The script is entertaining and well written. Ironside is the perfect villain and the fight at the end is fun and well executed. This is far from a perfect movie but is better than Karate Kid III and a maybe a hair worse than Karate Kid II. I would strongly recommend this family flick, it's definitely worth a viewing.

This movie is very underrated and I would consider it to be better than kk3, which was a poorly written, poorly acted(the villains were just way over the top and Daniel just seems to be nothing more than a punching bag for the bad guys). The girl did not even become a love interest for Daniel and was just there to be there. In contrast, The Next Karate Kid is quite enjoyable and is a pretty solid movie--not great, but not bad either. Hilarly Swank and Pat Morita do a great job in their roles. Pat Morita gets more screen time than the others and he makes the most of it. You could make a checklist list of all of the wise and funny phrases which he says. Adding a girl makes for an interesting dynamic and besides, I much prefer the character Julie over the wimpiness of Daniel. The transformation of Julie being a jerk and angry to having a more positive outlook on life was nice character development. The monks were funny and good lessons were taught there. The response that Miyagi gave to Julie when she said it was stupid that the monks preserved prey mantises was very powerful. \"Nations and people fighting and killing each other because of greed, anger, revenge and differences is stupid. Respecting all life and giving it the opportunity to live is anything but stupid\" (this is not the exact qoute, but you get the idea). The arrow catch by Miyagi was cool and the scene with him picking her out a dress was hilarious. The monks controlling the bowling the bowling balls brought me to laughter. Miyagi walking in on Julie demonstrated the difference between handling a girl vs a guy. The scenes with the hawk were well done and I found it touching when it was released and Julie had to say goodbye. I also thought the guy who played the main bully did a nice job playing his part. Michael Ironside, while definitely no John Kreese, did a fine acting job with what he had to work with. The guy playing her boyfriend did a fine job as well and certainly made for a better romance than the 3rd film. The soundtrack was excellent and the cinematography did not disappoint---from the eagle soaring in the air, the environment in and around the monastery, to the car blazing in flames by the dock, it was a visual treat. This movie was my personal favorite of the four, but ranking in terms of movie quality it goes KK1/KK2, KK4, KK3. In conclusion, while far from a perfect film and admittedly flawed in some areas \"The Next Karate Kid\" is not nearly as bad as some people say and is a pretty enjoyable movie. Don't listen to the extremists and haters, this movie is definitely worth your time and is arguably the funniest of the four. I rank this a 7/10, but give it 10 stars to make up for those ridiculous 1/10 ratings.",

This movie is not that bad at all. Hilary Swank is the on the spotlight and she did a good job. The Japanese guys are okay, they should've speak more instead of vowing their heads a  lot. The white dress that old guy bought for her for her prom does not look good on her. She looks like an old lady on that one, the costume designers should have cudgel more about it. The near ending one, when Hilary is kicking this guy's butt. I was like \"It's about time you kick their behind instead of letting them stomp on you.\" She should've give all those guys a piece of it instead of just one guy. I thought someone's going to die but no one did---NOOO!! I didn't really like the eagle scenes, that was just a waste of time. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.",

Seeing how Cobra Kai has found a way to bring back nearly every character from the first three movies, I wanted to better understand this story and Swank's Julie character, in case they convince her to make an appearance in Season 5 or Cobra Kai. I now see no value in bringing her in to the new show.The Next Karate Kid is, in my mind, an insult to the series. Swank's character is annoying, bratty, and seriously unlikeable. Morita's Myagi has much less of the charm he had in the first three movies. There is little plot, other than time passes and Swank gets into a fight at the end. In fact, the writers really glazed over how the two of them ended up together in the first place. How convenient that, in one 15 second scene, Myagi and Julie's grandmother switched places with the grandmother going to Myagi's home in California and him staying in Boston with Julie.About the only enjoyable thing about this film was the comic relief provided by the monks in the monastery (there's a sentence you don't often hear). But, honestly, their part in the movie was filler, not really adding much to the real plot, what little plot there was.The original movies with Ralph Macchio were enjoyable (even number 3), because the real storyline was centered around his and Myagi's relationship. This movie tried to repeat that theme, but you never felt that bond between Julie and Myagi.Thankfully, Cobra Kai has revived a lot of that original feel and allowed the series to continue more respectfully. It's sad that The Next Karate Kid ended up being Morita's last time playing Myagi. He deserved better.",

Mr. Miyagi enters the scene quickly, as the grandmother decides to put him in charge of the young firebrand for a few weeks while she tends to his dwelling back in CA.  It turns out Miyagi taught the kid's grandfather karate, and you can easily guess what will happen next.  Given the new feminine spin, the film should have been better. The movie is completely predictable in plotting and all of the manufactured conflicts -- particularly the vendetta of evil disciplinarian Michael Ironside (this guy is allowed to work with kids in a school?) -- are ridiculous.  There is nothing offensive (aside from the general insipidity) about the flick, and children under ten will probably enjoy it.",

But the thing is that it got its own immortality by changing the form, the structure, the characters, environment, time.. or whatever could make it new as well as amusing. So the shocking truth here is that there aren't new original meanings, there are only new original forms. Hence, when you make the same meaning, in the same form, once more, that would be disgracefully shocking. As someone wise said once: \"Repetition Is Hell\"!But they loved hell in Hollywood, as long as it brings them money, like the situation which we have here. (The Next Karate Kid) it's part 4 from the very simple yet effective hit (The Karate Kid - 1984), so you knew so well from the very start that it's another \"Karate Kid\", and another \"How to be a Karate Kid\", and it's the fourth one already, though you sat to watch!They played by the original formula to make more money and nothing else, being a remake for the first one, but this time it's not the boy it's his girl. And despite some great lines, nice moments, good acting, It's FIRSTLY the repetition again, and SECONDLY the lower level too, since (Hilary Swank) looked so unconvincing at the action parts, the direction messed some clever dialogues and scenes sometimes, and of course the foolish third act when the hard trainer went crazy to blow up the boy's car, home, school, and city.. Sorry, I got carried away! But you know what?! The producers may carry away as long as THAT can make the box office's millions!They could treat it like they used to do all along by the very formula and by the very commercial thinking all the times. So we would have: (The Next Karate Bully) where the bad rival opponent became the student, and to stand with the good kid and his girl against the crazy trainer. After that, (The Next Karate Crazy Trainer) as that negative mentor became (Miyagi)'s student, so they can stand together against the evil of the city or whatever God knows what; to have (The Karate Family), (The Karate Family 2: Full Throttle), (The Karate Family 3: The End Of The World) and so on: (The Karate Family In The Space: The Ultimate Conflict), (Miyagi vs. Yoda), (Miyagi vs. Miyagi), (Miyagi: The Beginning) as a prequel, (Miyagi: Once Upon A time In The East) as further prequel. And then the usual: (Miyagi)'s video game, comics, cartoon, and of course (Miyagi)'s sitcom. Some saturation, then again but in a TV production: (Miyagi's School) as the pilot for (The Karate Hero). Then the spin off (The Son Of Miyagi), so cinema presents (There Is Something About Miyagi) The parody. And the indie Movie: (The Dark Face Of Miyagi), the graphic novel (Miyagi in Sin City), and the low budget pornographic movie (The Karate Potent), and the lousy sequel (Miyagi's Bed). Then the long soap opera (The Karate Kid & The Beautiful), and the TV movie about all of that (Behind The Camera: The Karate Kid's Story), then some network will replay as a correction for all the flagrant mistakes of that movie in (The Karate Kid: The Real Events). To have the award winning documentary (Karate Kid's Saga). And some play (The Days Of The Wax), and the musical (Bring Back Miyagi). Some saturation while (Miyagi)'s TV early morning show. Then suddenly some smart producer will do it: (The Karate Kid) again as the remake. So no wonder when we'll have at that time (The Next Karate Robot), (The Next Karate Dog), and (The Next Karate Alien)!Let me thank God that they didn't make a fifth one already!",

While there he meets the widow of one of his fellow comrades who invites him to stay with her in Boston for a few days before he heads back to California. He agrees and while there the widow \"Louisa Pierce\" (Constance Towers) briefly introduces him to her teenage granddaughter \"Julie Pierce\" (Hilary Swank) who is still having issues with her parent's recent death in a car accident. Not only that, but she is also having a great deal of trouble at school due to an extremely out-of-control security counselor named \"Dugan\" (Michael Ironside) and his equally arrogant teenage proteges who emulate his brutal methods of enforcing his rule. However, as his brutality escalates, it soon comes to the attention of Mr. Miyagi who feels obligated to help Julie out-with serious consequences for those who continue to harass Julie and her friends. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, other than a few cosmetic changes here and there, this film didn't have anything of real substance to offer over the three previous films in the series. Yes, the location and the gender of the main character was different, but other than that I didn't see much of anything that was noteworthy and I have rated this movie accordingly.

And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as I made it out to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever.

            "content": "After three very interesting films, the \"Karate Kid\" franchise had to continue, and a fourth film was made, this time with a young girl in place of the apprentice (Ralph Macchio was too old for the character, and he had no interest in calling more his image and career to the universe of martial arts films). It was a risky move, but necessary if they wanted the franchise to continue... but the public didn't buy in, despite the movie itself not being as bad as they say. In fact, I even consider it to be better than its immediate predecessor. With a weak box office result, largely as a result of the public's loss of interest in karate films, the film killed the franchise for a few decades, but I have no doubt that it was able to end it on a positive note.The script is simple, but not without its flaws: Miyagi attends a military ceremony honoring the dead of his military unit, and ends up meeting the daughter of an ex-comrade-in-arms, Julie. She is a withdrawn young woman, with problems and angry due to the death of her parents in an accident. He decides to take her as a karate apprentice, it being obvious that she has a series of problems with other violent teenagers and will have to use martial arts to defend herself, but predictability is an agenda present throughout the film, which is not brings nothing substantially new to the franchise. The film basically contains the same ideas and structure as its predecessors. The end of the movie is pretty hard to believe.Despite the problems, the film brings back Pat Morita, who has already won us over with the friendliness and good humor of his character, and with an always very committed interpretation. He has always been fundamental to the success of the films in this franchise, and his funny and charismatic presence is even more important here, in a film where he assumes even more presence and protagonism. Hillary Swank is still extremely young in this film and is a long way from the glory days she will live in years to come, but she shows charisma and presence, and a latent talent that needs to be polished. The film also has the participation of Michael Ironside and Michael Cavalieri, in the role of the two main villains, both of which are predictable, flat and underdeveloped, but still worthy of our dislike.Technically, it is a very discreet film, which invests more in discreet effects and in a clear sound and image than in more flashy things. The movie's pacing is slower than its predecessors, and that takes some of the fun out of the movie, makes it more sleepy, but it's not a serious problem. The cinematography and editing are good enough, as are the choice of filming locations, the design of the sets (in particular the monastery) and the costumes. Finally, but just as importantly, the action and fight scenes were good enough and very well choreographed, and while some thought they were too sparse, I thought they were more interesting than the two preceding films in the franchise.",

Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. I personally don't care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. But still, look how Karate Kid 4 launched her career into orbit! She won a freakin Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile where is Ralphy?? He should put out some amateur porn tape like Screech or something.Anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for Judo... but thats kinda gay. So for the purposes of accuracy, I think they should have stuck with another male for this role. I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it requires.Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow Mr. Miyagi. He will give \"Wax on wax off\" a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you!

Not that I am crying my eyes out watching this movies, but there is definitely way more emotion pulling at my heartstrings here than in the previous sequels!Further, unpopular opinion or not, Julie's backstory and problems hold much more weight than Daniel's and she has way more to lose. Daniel was just a poor kid, in a new town, who was getting bullied. Julie lost her parents, has major emotional and behavioral problems, desperately needs to feel safe and to get direction in her life AND she was getting bullied.Also those that are complaining that the group of thugs is unrealistic obviously haven't seen the previous movies where the group of thugs is also obviously unrealistic...this movie is just following the KK equation with that.",

Well the hell did they make this? Obviously, they only made it because they knew it'd make good money. Pat Morita should be ashamed of himself for making this horrible sequel. Surely he must've known that this ruined the original trilogy, which is why he probably has no career now (or at least a good one). And Hilary Swank is no match for Ralph Macchio. I figure if they were going to make a 4th Karate Kid, they should've made it about Daniel and Miyagi, not the annoying Julie! Oh well. At least I still have the fond memories of the originals and try to forget this horrible sequel.The story is that at a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II, Miyagi (Pat Morita) meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaugther Julie (HIlary Swank), an angry teenager who doesn't get along with anyone and is still upset about the death of her parents from an accident. Miyagi decides to teach her karate and help her out, both in school and life. And there's another karate gang that bully Julie and eventually they take it too far, so Julie and Miyagi have to do battle with them.The performances are fine, but this movie wasn't nessercary at all. It's a shame that this didn't continue the story of Daniel and Miyagi, but I guess that story didn't really have anywhere to go since Daniel was grown up by then (even if they did, he'd be more like a \"Karate Man\" and that'd probably be crap too), so they changed it to focus on Julie instead. Miyagi and Julie sort of mix together, but not in the way that Daniel and Miyagi did. I wouldn't say this is one of the worst movies ever (films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) would be in that department), but it's far from being the best either.Rating: 2/5",

Let's face it, The Karate Kid was kind of geared towards boys (most things were in the 80's). That's not to say girls didn't like the films, but it was mostly marketed to boys. And so, the audience would be mostly boys. So imagine, you're a young kid in the 90's and the new Karate Kid was out.

I just think because its not like the others they don't like it. But I did and it was enjoyable watch for it was. The cast were all pretty good and it was nice seeing hillary swank in something less serious and more light hearted.",

The script is better, the dialogue is far less silly, and who could possibly object to the absence of Ralph Macchio?Pat Morita is given a chance to be on screen more, which gives everyone a rare opportunity to discover what a good actor he is. And Hillary Swank is particularly toothsome in the title role. The glimpses of Buddhism are somewhat risible, but the Zen monks provide what comic relief there is, particularly when they dance to the Cranberries' song \"Dreams.\"One special moment comes when Miyagi teaches the girl to dance to an old recording of the song \"Fascination,\" convincing her that her years as a tomboy haven't hindered her femininity. For what it's worth, I happened to catch this movie on video with my fianc\u00e9e and her mother a week before my wedding, so perhaps I am biased.",

            "content": "Many may wish to give this film much criticism for various reasons, and yet there are actually moments of true beauty in this too, and that's what I want to mostly concentrate on here.The premise is clear and obvious to all even if they have not seen the original. What we have here is an ode to the wonderful Pat Morita playing Mr Miyagi for the final time in the series. This character to many of a certain generation is the father and mentor they wish they had, and love him for it. His wisdom, humour and support is humbling to the rest of us.This film returns to its roots as we see Mr Miyagi mentoring a broken girl who is at the stage of graduating to adulthood. Future Oscar winner Hilary Swank is the young lady, her debut movie, and she and Pat Morita strike up an incredible family chemistry that is just so beautiful. She is a perfect stand in as the new student, and becomes like a surrogate daughter to Mr Miyagi who himself has a lot to learn about young ladies too.The story may be clich\u00e9d, events contrived and the acting often poor from the bulk of the cast, but the best moments are touching.I really recommend you to watch this film for at least the 'Miyagi Waltz' scene, which personally I think is one of the most beautiful yet simple scenes I've ever seen, and is worth it for the movie time alone. Another is a bowling scene which allows Pat Morita to show his perfect comic-lite touch and wisdom, aided by a group of humble monks. It's just old school light hearted humour.Despite the title, the martial arts is negligible and not of much value in this film (forgettable even), could even have been left out.The music is surprisingly poor (compared to the previous films) and overall the film has the feel of a Sunday afternoon TV movie. This could have been so much better in the hands of a better director. Disappointing as with the lead two stars there could have been so much more in making a more memorable film.For all the film's flaws, there are still moments to admire, and to watch the understated genius of Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi for the final time is a treasure. We'll never see his like again but he is immortalised in this role and will be cherished for eternity for it. He'll never fully know the positive impact he had on the lives of so many with his most important on-screen role. My thanks.",

Probably because people were over the Karate Kid craze and it was seen as dated by its 1990s audience.I found it a beautiful story about a tragic girl with intense anger issues, finds peace and happiness through karate, a road trip and good ol Mr Miyagi's words of wisdom.I enjoyed Miyagi's fathering role where he chops up a cucumber in front of the boyfriend on prom night and warns him to treat Juliesan with respect. And when he buys her a dress, reminded me of \"Anne of Green Gables.\"The film is full of hilarious humour, some of which was unintentional. The writer had also confused 1990s America with 1930s Nazi Germany, where black shirt thugs police a high school. And Juliesan's boyfriend is an underage teen who works as a security guard??? I've never heard of a high school being that dysfunctional.I also enjoyed Paul Dugan, a true psychopath who is far worse than John Kreese. He's probably an old friend (or enemy) of Kreese. They should introduce him into Cobra Kai as a violent psychotic police officer who abuses his power.",

            "content": "\"The Next Karate Kid\" (1994), for years, I've heard many people complain about this film over and over again. So, one day, I finally wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I watched it, and it's not quite as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But, it is still a bad movie in it's own right. This film has an uninspired ripoff of a story and average to mediocre acting. The plot does sound interesting at first glance, Mr. Miyagi befriends a girl named Julie whose parents have died in a car accident and is suffering from personal problems. She knows a little bit of karate, but she wants to enhance her karate skills and Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach her. On the one hand, it is interesting to see a female Karate Kid. But, on the other hand, it has a similar plot line to the first movie, just in different context. The friendship between Mr. Miyagi and Julie is genuine and it really does work here in this movie. Probably the weakest aspect in this film are the villains. They did have potential, but they are way too unrealistic and over the top. In some movies that does work, unfortunately, it doesn't work here. Plus, the buildup is not nearly as strong as in the original Karate Kid trilogy. The story did have potential, had the writers just read the script again and maybe did a rewrite, it could have possibly worked. As for the acting, it's just as weak as the storyline. But, not all of the performances were bad though. Pat Morita is perfect, as usual, playing Mr. Miyagi, Hilary Swank does a decent job as Julie and Michael Ironside is fun to watch, but still bad, as the main villain. The rest of the acting is just plain mediocre, which is most likely due to the subpar script. It's a shame, because I've seen the majority of these actors and actresses in other movies and shows. They all can act in other media! What happened to them here? Now, let's get to the positive aspects of this movie. As far as the sets/locations go, they are great and give this film a decent atmosphere. All of the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of fantastic. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers and this soundtrack is no exception. Bottom line, \"The Next Karate Kid\" is sadly just a cash-grab. That being said, it does have a few good elements. But it's still, by my standards, a bad movie. I rate this movie 3 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 6 out of 10 IMDB stars. Three stars is the point on my rating scale where it splits the difference between a film being good or bad. \"The Next Karate Kid\" may be bad, but it's still eons better than the worthless 2010 remake!",

            "content": "'The Next Karate Kid' where do you fit in in the 'Karate Kid' universe?What are you?Let's try and salvage something positive from this movie.This is only the third time I've watched this.Well, I have to ask straight out, why was Ralph Macchio not part of this movie's direction? Who were the brains behind omitting Daniel-San from a Karate Kid storyline and going in a completely different avenue with someone else?Did they not have the smarts for a continuation with the Mr Silver/Barnes storyline?Was Ralph Macchio even consulted about this? A Mr Miyagi movie without Daniel-San? (I'm halfway through reading his \"Wax On\" book and he's only mentioned 'The Next Karate Kid' once in passing. Can you believe Charlie Sheen auditioned for the role of Daniel-San?)Julie, or Susan, is introduced and full of angst as it's that time of month, I think.We're in Boston by the way and not California. She breaks into her own high school to tend to a broken eagle (fang) wing.There's no mention in this movie, or reference, how Mr Miyagi's \"Little Tree\" shop became liquidated and placed in the hands of administrators. In fact, there's no references of 'Karate Kid 3' at all in this movie.I love in the 'Karate Kid' movies how they quickly write out the mother figures as they're an inconvenience to the storyline apparently.My mistake, it's a hawk, not an eagle. Hawk's look like eagles.The baddies in this are the Alpha Elites. They're no Cobra Kai. They're more like Columbine High jock thugs who are unlikable and leave no impression. Weak baddies.Miyagi's got his hands full with Maggie Fitzgerald as she's pouty, immature and fiery. She slowly falls for some beefcake and that story takes up a large portion of the movie.Hey, didn't Swank give birth to twins only two weeks ago?So, let me get this straight, Julie-San's grandmother leaves her in the care of Miyagi and the old lady is ordered to travel to California to paint Miyagi's fence & house? Work hard, lady! Sand those floors! What is Miyagi paying you for?Perhaps this movie should have dropped the Karate Kid title and been its own entity? What would it have been called if something else? 'Karate Girl Meets Miyagi?' 'High School Karate Bird Girl?'As if that Dobermann wouldn't have defended its owner.(And I'm searching for something positive in this review?)What's-her-name looks like Taylor Swift at times. I feel she was a tad too old to be cast in this... for a high school student, that is.Praying Mantis' are cool. I once saw a movie where a Mantis was a sensei to some skinny guy and taught him all these stick moves and forearm actions. And I mean an actual insect holding a Bo stick that Donatello uses.Elvis was a black belt? I was unaware of this fact.\"I can't believe I'm about to eat a cake with chopsticks.\" Is that even possible? A crumby sponge cake would be hard to maintain but a sticky date pudding is a possibility.My cat, Bungus, is captivated with this releasing of the hawk scene.Pretty clever how Miyagi incorporates karate into a dance lesson.I wonder how many years after the 'Karate Kid 3' this movie took place? And what was Daniel-San doing in that time? (Is that when he converted to his car business in the 'Cobra Kai' series?) So, with this realization are you telling me that Daniel-San and Miyagi actually parted ways? After everything they had been through? Did they part on bad terms after part 3? To think that Miyagi's dream of owning his own tree business failed and went under in only months.The problem with this movie is that there's no build-up.There was no tit for tat reason to have any showdown at the end. Swank wasn't bullied enough to seek any revenge. It's paper-thin.This whole diving off the roof at the ball is embarrassing to say the least. This scene is straight up stupid. What purpose did that serve? Here everyone was having a good time like 'Back to The Future's' Enchantment dance and these nimrods pull some bungee stunt and act like children to show bravado and disrupt everyone's enjoyment?Michael Ironside is a PE teacher at a school and he condones criminal behavior?Brandon - a boy who doesn't cry - takes on whoever the Alpha Elite antagonist is at the end and there's some 'Bloodsport' blindsided moment she learnt earlier in a barn and uses it to justify her assault on whatever this guy's name is. (Actually she does cry in this movie. )And look how quickly Ironside loses his composure at the end against Miyagi. Not one person landed a single hand on Miyagi in any of these movies.I detest the three British songs used in this movie. Woeful choices that don't blend.This movie failed because it didn't include John G. Avildsen's directing.The only returning parties I noticed were Miyagi and Weintraub.All in all, this movie, in the 'Karate Kid' and 'Cobra Kai' universe, is an undercard fight at the start of a pay-per-view event with no audience in attendance to witness it. It lacks soul and body. It's almost like its targeted audience is intended for 5 or 7-year old's.You know what? I just thought of something. It's too late now, I know, but this movie \"may\" have worked had it been filmed in the same settings and school as the original 'Karate Kid.' To give it \"that\" feel.Other than Mr Miyagi, none of the surrounds in 'The Next Karate Kid' are 'Karate Kid' related. They're out of their element. Which is a shame.I try to enjoy this movie but it has the 'Karate Kid 2' factor about it in that Sato had to put aside his differences to mourn the loss of Miyagi's father and show respect for a little while. And since Miyagi is in this, I try to put aside my hatred for 'The Next Karate Kid' only out of respect for said person. But, like that washed-up log, I wanna break this movie in half at times and I only watch it out of sympathy because Miyagi's in it. (\"DON'T YOU SAY THAT!\" You're not gonna cry now, are you?)\n'The Next Karate Kid' doesn't possess the magic like 'Cobra Kai' does.'Karate Kid,' with its two sequels and 'Cobra Kai,' have to carry this movie.",

We do get a brief idea of who Mr Miyagi was as a soldier during a World War II commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army and understand Julie's connection with Mr. Miyagi who is the granddaughter of his commanding officer who saved Mr Miyagi's like during combat. The movie is a recycled clich\u00e9 and underuses its main characters including Michael Ironside who just plays out to be another Kreese. Poorly written and poorly filmed along with poor acting from some of the films bullies, I wasn't sure if this was a teen B show or a theatrical movie. Very uninspiring and cheesey moments including the monastery scenes where you see the monks dancing. Yes there were funny moments including the monks playing tin pin bowling - but why?? Why put it there in this flick? There was a cool concept around letting go of hurtful memories which was actioned with letting go of the injured eagle and where Mr Miyagi connects dancing and karate. But the bully gang walking through the school halls together, dressed like a bunch of 1950 throw-back thugs, was just too much. The movie was lame and there was no creativity, overall 4/10",

It has also funny situations as Swank's birthday and, talking this two times academy awards, her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when Miyagi is taking her to a Buddhist temple, and how she, slowly, is changing her mind.

Never mind!On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what Daniel's were. Julie is much more wild than Daniel was and needs taming, something which Myiagi finds very challenging; she's quite a troubled girl and a rude, obnoxious brat!It was very satisfying to watch the transformation in Julie as she warms to Myiagi and gets to understand more about Karate and her life in general.

Of cause they do not replace Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi as this would be much too harmful. He is the focus point of the franchise and Daniel LaRusso\u2019s story can be considered finished as he has mastered the critical (life) lessons in the last 3 movies (Until Cobra Kai at least;-). I am in the minority that thinks this is a quite good movie with some mistakes that drag it down. Also I think the first movie which is a cult classic set the bars to high for all the prequels. Sometimes there is a peak that is nearly impossible to surpass or even reach. Again the movie uses themes from an underdog story, teenage drama, clashing philosophies and martial arts. The story starts with Mr. Miyagi traveling to Boston to attend a commendation for Japanese-American soldiers. He visits Louisa Pierce who is the widow of his friend and former commanding officer. He meets Julie who is his friends granddaughter and struggles because of dealing with her parents death. He decides to help her which is the start of a new adventure. The set up is nice and fitting. The later parts are weaker with some exceptions. I would say they try their best but could not reach the appropriate levels to make this a hit or like the first movie. It is not a failure more a case of to much use of the fast forward button for the viewer. Character wise we got good and bad performances. For Hilary Swank this was her first big role and breakthrough. She got recognition and many praised her performance. I agree to that as she fully delivered her role and is a highlight of the movie. Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi is a staple of the franchise. Always delivering a truly good performance. I cant remember a weak moment in all movies. I am divided for Michael Ironside as Paul Dugan. He does a good job but his character does not fit that good into the movie. Maybe a bit to overdone or cliche (or not enough if you go more into parody territory). I like the monks, Louisa Pierce played by Constance Towers and Michael Cavalieri as Ned Randall with some bad scenes. In total it is a solid performance but in combination with the script there are too many weaknesses. To be fair other were far more critical here and I see their points. Maybe I am far less critical but I can not prove that my opinion is more valuable than theirs and vice versa. Overall the movie was not strong enough to safe the franchise. I liked it but it has some weaknesses that drag it down. I think that I enjoy the two main characters saved the movie for me. I am however not sure if I can recommend it to others.",

I quite liked this one.There may not be anything outstanding, or even massively good, about 'The Next Karate Kid', but I actually felt content with what I had just watched when the end credits came along. It turns into a sweet story, even after a fairly rocky start.The villains are meh, a little iffy but fine... far better than those from 'The Karate Kid Part III', that's for sure. Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) is a little clich\u00e9-filled but still super endearing and likeable. A young Hilary Swank, in her first major film role, brings a solid performance as Julie. At first I wasn't convinced, but by the end I felt like I saw a positive journey with the character.In my opinion, it's the best sequel to 1984's 'The Karate Kid'. That's a big surprise, considering the downward trajectory of the preceding two. Don't get me wrong, it's close to being a not so good film. However, for me, it just about floats above the required marker. I like it, can't lie.",

I love the Karate Kid series and I've seen the whole trilogy, and I've seen the Cobra Kai series, so I ended up picking this up to get the full thing. I don't regret it because I got to see Mr. Miyagi again, which was nice, but that's about it. The story was pretty much nothing for me. The location wasn't great either, although the monastery was still more interesting than Okinawa in my opinion, but still not much. I just don't get it. I take it that it was simply a case of milking the brand and they wanted to make some more money from the series. This was so unnecessary. For me, a bad movie that I don't recommend even to fans of the franchise.",
