            "content": "Kevin Smith has delved into action (\"Mallrats\"), drama (\"Chasing Amy\") and philosophy (\"Dogma\") in his Askewniverse, but Clerks, the first film of the series, is still the best.Shot on a ridiculously low budget, using mostly friends and relatives as the cast and crew (see the line in the credits where \"Boom\" is credited as \"whoever happened to be holding the pole\"), \"Clerks\" is such a great film just because it doesn't try to be more than it is. You get the sense that this movie is in black and white not to be pretentious, but just because it's a prosaic look at prosaic lives.Kevin Smith's real gift is writing funny, witty dialogue, and that's what carries this film. From Star Wars debates (did the destruction of the second Death Star in \"Jedi\" cost innocent contractors their lives?) to perfectly serious debates about sex (\"Thirty-seven???\"), this is the ultimate movie for anyone who's ever been going nowhere and doing nothing. It's a day in the life of the guy working at the corner store, no more, no less. But it's absolutely brilliant.People either love or hate Kevin Smith movies. Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then you'll enjoy \"Clerks\". His brand of humour isn't for everyone. This is his first film and it's flawed, to be sure. But in my humble opinion, it's still Smith's best.",

            "review_title": "A witty, hilariously profane cult picture",
            "content": "Clerks is one of those movies everyone knows everything about even before they've seen it. The most fascinating aspect is probably the back-story: Kevin Smith sold his comic-book collection to finance it, shot it in the convenience store where he was working at the time, and cast his school friends in the various roles (two of them wound up playing three or four characters each). The film became a huge hit at Sundance, and is now widely (and justly) considered one of the best independent movies of all time.The plot is quite easy to sum up: nothing happens. It's just a \"regular\" day in the lives of a few people working in or outside a Quick Stop convenience store. The fun starts immediately, as Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is asked to replace a sick colleague. This upsets him a lot, since it's supposed to be his day off (\"You know what the worst part is? I'm not even supposed to BE here today!\"). So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who \"works\" in the video store next to Quick Stop. Together, they discuss things like hermaphroditic porn or, Tarantino-style, which Star Wars sequel is better (Jedi or Empire?), and also try to find ways of not working, or at least make the day less boring (as Randal puts it:\"This job would be great if it wasn't for the f**king customers\"). Between these discussions, they also interact with Dante's present girlfriend Veronica (whose sex life causes heated debates) and ex Caitlin, who's apparently engaged to some Asian design major. And let's not forget Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself), two drug dealers consistently located outside the store.Smith uses these characters to reference his favorite movies (the previously mentioned Star Wars, as well as Jaws and Indiana Jones) and talk about any subject in the filthiest way imaginable. Some incredibly outrageous stuff is mentioned (\"jizz moppers\", necrophilia, \"snowballing\"), but unlike John Waters, he never shows the events discussed by Dante, Randal et al. Everything occurs, or has occurred, off-screen, so all we get to do is have a good laugh, because no matter how crude it gets (the film is rated R for \"Extensive Use Of Extremely Explicit Sex-Related Dialogue\"), Smith's writing remains genuinely funny. Randal, in particular, steals every scene with his existential musings (\"I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.\") or very politically incorrect antics (the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby).If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status. It has priceless dialogue, wisecracking characters and loads of swearing. What else can you ask for?",

            "content": "In 1994, an ambitious filmmaker named Kevin Smith was left nearly dead-broke by his commitment to his low-budget debut feature, \"Clerks.\" Shot in black & white and filmed in and around a New Jersey convenience store, \"Clerks.\" is genius on celluloid despite little change of scenery, wooden acting (none of the actors are professionals), and a shoe-string budget; it's also pretty damn funny. \"Just because they serve you, doesn't me they like you\" became an immortal tagline for one of the best independent comedies of all time, which also launched the career of its director. There's nothing PC about this debut feature, and the relentlessly explicit sex-related dialogue got the film its original certificate, the dreaded \"NC-17\" rating, which was later dropped down to an \"R\" rating on a successful appeal by the filmmakers; the characters harass their customers, leave the store during the day to tend to personal matters, and hang-out with girlfriends - not the stuff of responsible employees - and definitely NOT something you would see in any Hollywood production today. In an era rife with censorship and political-correctness, \"Clerks.\" would undoubtedly receive the scorn and protests of the fundamental religious Right and Left. The film features Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), two bored New Jersey convenience store employees who are both called in on a Saturday (Dante is especially upset because it's his day off) and the two break every rule in the book as they meander through the day and encounter all sorts of colorful characters. Throughout the day, Dante complains about about his girlfriend Veronica's (Marilyn Ghigliotti) sex life, Randal shirks his convenience store duties by shooting the breeze with Dante, philosophize about their daily predicaments, play hockey on the roof of the store, and observe unruly and bizarre shoppers. There's little plot but it's pure fun all the way to the ending with plenty of laughs too. But if you're the sensitive type, you should stay as far away from \"Clerks.\" as possible, as the dialogue will certainly make you squirm in your seat. \"Clerks.\" also contains many Smith trademarks including \"Star Wars\" talk, references to Spielberg movies, comic books and hockey, all qualities of which would do Smith good in his so-called \"New Jersey Trilogy.\" P.S.: Watch out for Smith in his iconic role as Silent Bob with sidekick Jay (Jason Mewes) as they loiter outside the store and hassle customers.10/10",

            "content": "Clerks (1994) **** (out of 4) Kevin Smith's cult classic about a two store clerks (Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson) who have nothing to do except be bored and deal the cards life gives them. It's hard to believe this film is now fourteen-years-old as it seems just like yesterday when it made a splash on the indie circuit. This was my first time watching this in at least six or seven years and it hasn't lost any of its magic. I still think Smith hit on something truly great in the fact that he manages to take this type of job and show all the hassles and frustration that comes with it. I believe it was Roger Ebert's review that mentioned movies never deal with jobs unless the job is that of a cop, robber or something like that yet here we get to see the life of a clerk who is stuck at a job he hates and surrounded by people that can't really add too much to his life. The real key here of course is Smith's screenplay, which I'd call downright brilliant. To have 90-minutes of nothing but dialogue speaks a lot for his screenplay as it remains so constantly entertaining with the majority of the jokes working. The politically incorrect nature of the humor from the \"37\" to various other sexual things is downright hilarious and that includes the surprise in the bathroom. The performances in the film have taken a lot of unfair heat in my opinion because while they aren't perfect I do think they fit the roles just fine and mixed with the B&W it makes the film seem all the more like a documentary.",

            "review_title": "An honest and humorous film",
            "content": "If you have seen American Pie and think of it as being honest and real about sex and the way kids talk, then Clerks is right up your alley.  I don't think a movie has pleasantly shocked me more than this one has.  And make no mistake about it, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.By now we've all heard the story of how Kevin Smith somehow scrounged up $27000 to piece this rag tag film together.  It was at a film festival and some film executive saw it and offered him a generous amount of money. They fixed it up and before you know it we have the best indie film ever made. Kevin Smith is now a recognizable name in Hollywood and that alone should make you want to see this film.Dante and Randal are best friends.  They work at a small convenience store and a crappy little video store respectively.  As a matter a fact, the video store is so inept that Randall actually goes to one of the bigger video stores in town to rent his movies.  Anyway, Dante is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend that cheated on him and he has a present girlfriend that is wonderful to him.  That is the basic premise for the movie.  And that is all you need to know about the plot.  Because what the film is really about is how these characters really talk to each other.  It is a bunch of clever anecdotes pieced together hilariously to form a movie.  But some of the scenes are just so damn funny that Clerks stays with you for a long long time.Take for instance a scene where Dante and his girlfriend are discussing the various responsibilities of a man and a woman in sex.  Each has an obvious gender biased view of the act but listen to how honest it is written, it gives meaning and much hilarity to the scene.  From here, the two end up discussing how many people the other has slept with.  And we all know that is an absolute no no in relationships.  Because no matter how many or how little the number is, it is too much.  But that would be too easy for Smith to end it at that.  No, he takes it a step further.  From here Veronica ( the girlfriend ) explains that she has only slept with X amount of guys but she has gone down on 36 others.  Dante is mortified.  How can she do that? And she explains that when she \"does it\" it means more than when she goes down and that is supposed to make him feel better.  It of course doesn't and the pay off in the scene is brilliant as Veronica is walking back to her car.  And that is just one of the scenes that makes the film work.  There are dozens of other scenes similar in nature that are so humourous yet painfully honest that you laugh but when the giggles subside, you realize that it is so true.The obvious strength of this film is the writing.  But beyond that, Smith establishes himself as a director that can get a performance out of his actors.  Almost every major character in here is so well done that you think they had 20 attempts to get it perfect instead of the 3 or 4 that the budget would allow.  Dante is well played by O'Halloran but it is Anderson as Randle that I think steels the picture.  He is so honest and natural in every scene that he is in that it actually bothers me that he has not established himself in the game.  Is it because no one wants to give him a role or is it that he has no interest in movies?  I don't know, I just wish he was around again because he is electric.Jay and Silent Bob are funny as well and Bob provides the film with one of the funnier moments as he dances out of nowhere and then he shocks us with his only line of the film.  And what he says may as well be Socrates talking and not a simple street hood.  It really works.I love Clerks.  It is such a fun movie and if you haven't seen this gem, check it out.  Like it for the funny film that it is, but love it for whats behind it.This film has heart.  And Smith is an inspiration to anyone that wants to do what he did.  After all, he proves that nothing is impossible.  He is living proof of that.",

About three years ago a friend of mine came to school one day raving about the funniest movie he had seen on late night. He talked about this black and white low budget movie about two blue collar losers who talked endlessly about sex. From that description I wasn't anticipating a masterpiece but I decided to rent it anyway. It was probably the best surprise I have ever had. I was laughing the entire time, so much so that I nearly woke up everyone in my house. For months afterwards my friend and I would endlessly talk about and quote this incredible film. Everyone I have recommended it to has loved it and I can easily see why. I know that some people attack the movie as being vulgar and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper). In short I absolutely love this film and it gets better and better with every viewing. Rent this film as soon as possible if you haven't already.",

            "content": "Everyone has to start somewhere. Kevin Smith started his popular Jay and Silent Bob series with Clerks., a $50,000 film whose soundtrack cost more than the actual movie cost to make. It's poorly done, it's monochromatic (which actually works to its advantage), it's cheap, but it's funny, and that's all that really counts. The story is more than I thought it would be, and it's continuously funny throughout the whole short runtime. Many of the crude adventures of Dante and Randal are now legendary.Dante (Brian O'Halloran) works at the Quick Stop convenience store. He's called in on a day off. His friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) works next door at a video store, but sporadically closes it to hang out at the Quick Stop. Throughout the day, various things occur, such as a gum representative trying to get people to stop smoking and chew his gum, a rabbi using the employee's bathroom (with an unexpected twist at the end), disrupting a wake, and the now-classic scene at the video store with \"Happy Scrappy Hero Pup\".This movie has non-stop humor going for it. Whether it's Dante's or Randal's confrontations with the unruly customers (who seem over-the-top yet regular), their conversations about nothing (especially Star Wars), or their departures from their respective stores to play hockey or whatnot. I can see that Clerks. is to minimum wage earners as Office Space is to office workers. Dante's always a little timid when it comes to dealing with the unruly customers, but when Randal takes the stage, it's a lot funnier.Although the parts about Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) and Cairlin (Lisa Spoonhauer) weren't that interesting (except for the 36...make that 37 people), they were necessary, and seemed to create a plot out of this, basically, sketch comedy. It succeeded, and turned it into a great all around film. Most of these people had never acted before, and although it does seem like they're just reciting their lines (there's almost no break in between the dialogue), they do a good job at it. Sometimes it seems a little too scripted (for voice and diction, etc.), but for a bunch of first-timers, it's not bad at all.Considering the rest of the series (besides Mallrats, which I haven't seen), I'd say Clerks. is close with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back for the funniest Kevin Smith movie. They're also the two crudest, and the first and last in the series, respectively. But Clerks. will always stay as it was when it was released 10 years ago-revolutionary. It showed that money and action aren't important to make a movie funny.My rating: 8/10Rated R for extensive use of extremely explicit sex-related dialogue.",

This movie to me was as moving and compelling as Passion of the Christ was for some Catholic people i know. In fact, in some moments, it even brought me to tears. The film is about a guy who works in a convenience store. He comes across the weirdest and most annoying customers that, ironically, don't shy too far from those in real life that I, myself have come across. This clerk is visited by his girlfriend and regularly visiting by his distraught and careless friend who is a clerk at the neighboring video store.

Maybe this movie has a cult following that I don't get.Firstly, the acting was atrocious. Now, that could have been the intent, but if so, I never got that impression. The dialogue was delivered so mechanical, most times it seemed like the actors were reading directly from cue cards.Secondly, this movie had no direction. Where was this movie going? Again, maybe I missed the intent, but was it just to capture the dull and pathetic life of a clerk and those around him? I don't expect every movie to have a mighty and life altering message, but at least have a loftier aim than go to work, have a screwed up day and go home.Finally, there was entirely too much profanity. It was to the degree that it had no more impact. If vulgarity is going to be used, then using it sparingly can make it funnier and have more of an impact on the script. The flagrant use of profanity in this movie just made the movie juvenile and childish.Overall the movie just didn't move me. I laughed very little, there was nothing to think about, and there were no magnificent or even decent performances. I did like one scene though, and that was the different take on \"The Return of the Jedi\". I thought that was an interesting and funny take on the movie, but I also think that-that could have been done in a short film.

The motifs and character development were both wonderfully crafted. Kevin Smith showed no signs of struggle in his directorial debut. Fittingly he was also able to deliver one of the best lines of the film \"they are a lot of beautiful girls out there dude, but not all of them bring you lasagna, most of them just cheat on you.\" It was Silent Bob's only line of the movie, and it was a doozy. It caused Dante to have a revelation (at least he thought that he did; I thought that it was only momentary, likely to fade quickly).Although the movie itself was saturated in comedy, it held a semi-serious tone throughout. Both of the clerks are intelligent and seemingly capable of holding far more prestigious jobs. Dante is frustrated by his place and life, but places the blame on anyone but himself, refusing to accept responsibility for his problems. Randal has underachieved, not because he blames other, but because he is easily content. He would rather hold a job with no responsibility than assume a hapless position in which he is ruled by a condescending and controlling boss.Smith introduces an interesting take on the different personalities that lead the 2 friends to similar places in life. Randal has a more enlightened perspective on life that allows him to be happy, and it is his insight that eventually helps Dante see things more clearly. The final conversation indicates that both friends are capable of achieving higher in life, and they can help each other to do so.",

The inspiration for the setting was clearly Tarantino, but using the Saturday Night Live formula of episodes about losers. You would think with all these clever influences, plus panache, a watchable film might result.I came to this because I did not think I appreciated `Strike Back' as much as I should have, and thought that by investing in the askew world, I'd get better registration. But this seems so unoriginal, so shallow in concept. I understand that Kevin peaked with `Chasing Amy.' Got it right here to watch next. But if true, it seems a very short productive life for a filmmaker, and the only thing he has to offer is a view of slackers that is not based on grossout humor. Well, in comparison, I suppose that seems intellectual and explains why some IMDB viewers have pushed this into the list of top 200 films of all time ever, anywhere.Jarmusch finds fascination with the pathetic, but he does do by honestly entering their world, a la Truffaut but with more commitment. Jarmusch's camera spends a lot of time in the silences, which reduces the distance. Kevin tries the X ironic route, wanting it both ways. He wants us to enter this world as equals in the fashion of jarmusch, but he also wants us to get some laughs at the same characters. Can't have it both ways, at least not at the level of talent we have here.Tarantino inherits gravity from the past by casting prior film tropes in biblical terms, using them with respect. That inheritance from the film world is what gives Pulp Fiction its richness. Kevin also uses a classical framework, Dante. But it is all skewered: the 37 episodes are called blow jobs and treated as such. (I was missing this bit of key information when encountered with the primary motif of blow jobs in `Strike Back.')The film references are blunt: one of the clerks works at a video store (as did Tarantino) but goes to another to rent his own video -- a porno film featuring hermaphrodites (both ways again). There is a discussion by proles about proles being incidentally murdered in a blockbuster film. The rooftop hockey game shows signs of being a reference to `Slapshot.'

He also has to deal with the annoying customers that come in, not being able to play hockey, a customer dying in the bathroom, getting a citation for selling cigarettes to a 4 year old, hearing about an old girlfriend (Lisa Spoonhauer) getting engaged and than having her show up to talk, and Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes & Kevin Smith) who hang outside the door and deal drugs.This is the first film of Kevin Smith who actually worked in the same video store that's portrayed and after a viewing of \"Slackers\" was inspired to be a director. The script and story are loosely connected to \"The Divine Comedy\" by Dante Alighieri (note the first name) and it's 9 rings of hell which is represented with 9 chapters in the film. The film is largely constructed around the character Dante and the conversations that he engages in and while many critics consider this provocative I think it falls more in line with being reverent. While much of the film demonstrates silly scenarios and odd characters I think it's very funny that a young filmmaker like Smith could actually intertwine \"The Divine Comedy\" for Generation X! I'm not one that thinks this is some groundbreaking independent film but it does show that Smith has a good knack in terms of writing dialog and that he's a young filmmaker that we would continue to hear from.",

            "content": "Clerks is simply a day in the life of two friends, Dante and Randal, who work side by side in a convenience store/videostore. Throughout the movie, we see how they treat customers, how they view their lives, and how they view pop culture. Clerks is not worth the hype it receives, but it most certainly deserves everyone's respect.After hearing for ages that Clerks is an amazing movie and it's one of the funniest movies out there, and with the recent release of Clerks II, I decided to check Clerks out. I was let down to say the least. It was slow moving, even boring in parts. I didn't find it nearly as funny as I heard it was. There were only three points in the movie where I laughed hard. Through the rest of the movie, I just kind of chuckled. I chuckled because the entire concept of the movie was amusing. Two clerks that talk and act like the smartest people in the world, when really, why are they working at a convenience store? The reason I said you need to respect this movie is because Kevin Smith and all the people involved are nobodies, just a bunch of friends who got together with $20,800, and a camera and shot a cheap movie that became a cult classic.Clerks wasn't the great film I heard it was, but it certainly shot Kevin Smith into super stardom, and the \"New Jersey\" films he's made since have gotten better due to this experience. Clerks got a few chuckles out of me, and it had some classic dialogue, but overall it was a little dull. I recommend that anyone who likes the other \"New Jersey\" films views this one first.6.5/10",

            "content": "Rarely is a script so clearly the star of a movie, but \"Clerks\" is clearly a product of the unique mind behind it, Kevin Smith. This is a filmmaking debut with a clear idea of what it wants to say and how it wants to say it, namely in the form of casual conversation that ranges from profane to profound.The vessels by which these thoughts and ideas are delivered go by the names of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), 22-year-old New Jersey convenience and video store clerks, respectively, who are pals despite drastically different attitudes toward their \"dead-end\" jobs. The film predominantly follows Dante over the course of a day at the Quick Stop, a day that he was never supposed to work in the first place. In addition to persistent stop- ins from Randal, he is visited by/chats with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), grapples with the news about of a couple other ex-girlfriends and deals with a host of unusual customers, not to mention the shady characters who hang out outside the store including Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith).\"Clerks\" plays out as \"scenes at a convenience store\" for the majority of its runtime to the point that it could've been a play and almost worked just as well. Film, however, feels more fitting; there's something about the context of this actual dinky convenience store location and the way Smith carefully selects his shot angles in each scene (shot in black and white) that brings everything together. The \"theater\" would betray the down-to-earth New Jersey reality of it all, even though so much of the film centers on dialogue.What Smith is able to convey in a series of conversations, most filmmakers have to construct elaborate scenes in order to communicate. He can take a conversation about blowjobs or something even more inane and turn it into something much bigger. That's a hell of a skill. The only pitfall is that none of the actors can reel in the cleverness and timing of Smith's words. In some scenes the acting sort of just dissipates leaving only dialogue \u2013 these poor actors have to make these quip-filled exchanges sound like natural banter between minimally educated middle-class slackers.Nevertheless, the script carries \"Clerks\" to the notoriety Smith has earned over the last couple decades. It's an entertaining tennis match of dialogue that's sharp, occasionally satirical and most importantly, taps into the core of what young people struggling to do something with their lives all feel. And he doesn't just go there with the conversations; he illustrates it in the various seemingly mundane dilemmas and conflicts Dante encounters through the course of his day.Maybe most significantly of all, Smith speaks for the outcast in \"Clerks.\" He speaks for the guy living in his parents' basement, the guy working a convenience store job, the guy who spends his days loitering outside convenience stores or playing street hockey and other characters society frowns upon for not \"doing anything with their lives.\" He points out that despite their disregard for societal protocols, they still have smart things to say and above all, like \"the rest of us,\" still yearn for meaning in their lives.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Dante opens up the shop with a little help from his friend Randal in the video store next door.  The discovery that his ex-girlfriend is engaged is just the start of a bad day involving mix-ups and difficult customers.Kevin Smith's first film is very funny and indeed very rude.  However when you see his later films you can't help but notice that he got better as he went on.  The basics are all there \u0096 the pop culture dialogue, the quick, rude wit, the movie obsession etc., however he lacks a certain structure and he hasn't yet realised the strength of his other characters.The lack of structure is OK since this is an indie movie \u0096 but watching it now I wanted less crudity and more humour.  I also wanted more of Jay and Bob but only because of how they were used in other films.  It's unfair to judge this by later standards.  I first saw this in 95 in the cinema and laughed to death but seeing it 7 years on it was not quite as funny.However the film is still very good and the weaknesses can all be explained by the budget.  The whole thing is shot at night due to the shop being open during the day but the external shots and the explanation of the shutters make it unnoticeable.  The weakness in the cast is understandable but it tends to make the dialogue slightly more believable.  Fans of Jay and Bob will be disappointed with their input if you're watching this after watching Smith's other films.Overall this is very crude and very funny.  The weaknesses can be put down to the budget but this should be enjoyed as Smith marking out his territory and moving from nothing into the big time.",

Once the generation of maturity retarded losers that praise this film comes into power, civilization as we know it will cease to be. Watching this film (home movie?) is like sitting in a junior high school locker room listening to 11 year old boys play grab ass. Seriously, if this film is entertaining to you, all I can say is you have had the bar set so low in your life that it is unlikely anything good will ever come out of it, save being really good at Limbo. I have read here many people praise this film for its brilliant script. All I can say about that is: \"Don't Bogart that joint, my friend!\" To the sober minded, the script is simply stupid. In one scene dope dealer Jay sets clerk Dante straight with a diatribe about how selling soda for 78 cents more than a supermarket is tantamount to pushing drugs. Excellent point, ... DUDE, WHO SMOKED THE LAST OF MY 'METH?! If this script speaks to you all I can say is stay away from neighborhood dogs.Forget the horrendous acting, forget the crappy camera work, the unintelligible dialogue, the murky sound work, the fact that it didn't really have a plot of any kind, forget, even, that all of this is agreed upon by even the fans of this film, (in other words, forget the fact that this is a crappy film), can anyone quote me any memorable lines that a person over the age of 12 would find interesting, let alone brilliant? The script is pedestrian at best. Some have praised this film as being one of the funniest of the 90's. I suppose if you consider predictable bathroom humor and dick jokes, delivered with the finesse of an drunk uncle, funny then this is a masterpiece. I found it pathetic. I don't mind crude comedy if it is done well, as in Animal House, Caddyshack, Bevis and Butthead, et. al., this film has none of that. It is hack. Bevis and Butthead mocked the idiots they portrayed, this film celebrates them. The slight (very slight, I never laughed once) amount of comedy provided by Jay and Silent Bob and sometimes Randal, are never enough to save the movie, let alone their scenes, and even these are presented with such stumbling insecurity it feels like watching a really bad stand up on amateur night at The Apollo. In that regard one might say a joke or two were kind of funny, but how could you say that amateur had one of the best sets you have ever seen? Looking over the user comments here on the IMDb it appears many of the fans of this film do not have the capacity to do anything other than presume those who didn't like the film just didn't get it. I got it, you are the one who does not get it. Unfortunately, by the time you realize that you will be sucked so far into the vortex of the downward spiral you call your life you will be doomed to emulate the losers of this film. From the generation that made popular Jerry Springer, eating vomitous putrefactions for a prize and wearing pants around your thighs, comes the hallmark movie for losers: Clerks. As Butthead would say: \"Stop, in the name of all that which does not suck!\"",

It is much more subtle in its comedy, more chatty, which is fine, but somehow I like Smith's more slapsticky stuff, like MALLRATS AND J&SBSB, a lot better. Still, the annoying customers and the dead guy in the bathroom incident are very funny.I didn't like the alternate ending, so I'm glad it was left out. I guess it would have made a thoughtful statement about the irony of life and how it can suddenly end after a crummy day, but to me, it was just depressing and took away from the light mood of the film. The regular ending was good enough. Dante and Randall are great characters, and this is their film, and they provide most of the laughter, so I guess it's okay that Jay and Silent Bob weren't in the film as much as I thought they were going to be. Kevin Smith created a little \"community\" where you get to see more of Jay & Silent Bob as they interact with people around town, and God help you, if you want any \"in between\" stories of their lives, the comic books are great!!!

There's nothing wrong with student films per se, it's just that I don't think we need to see them if we're not film studies professors.Besides one magical moment noted below, the only deeply funny thing about 'Clerks' is that (at the time I'm writing this) it is listed as one of the IMDb \"top 250\" of all time. Fortunately, as of right now it ranks at #249, so happily it will drop off the list quite soon.SLIGHT SPOILER BELOWThere is one moment of magic in the film --- when Jay and Silent Bob are standing outside in the dark, with Jay dancing to the boom box and, completely unexpectedly the theretofore impassive SB leaps in to the dance.

            "content": "OK, here's a film with everything going against it: minuscule budget, amateur actors, first time director, static shots, dimly lit, episodic structure, little plot, foul language; and yet it is extremely entertaining. The main reason? The sharp and witty dialogue from a truly gifted writer, Kevin Smith. Smith is not the most visual of directors (although he has improved with time); his strength is in character and dialogue. Like Tarantino, his films are laced with pop culture references and profanity. Unlike Tarantino, they are filled with a lot of depth and heart.Clerks, of course, is the story of a day at a soulless job. Dante and Randal are clerks at a convenience store and video store, respectively. They hate their jobs, or at least their customers. Dante whines about it, Randal gets even. Meanwhile, outside the store are Jay and Silent Bob, two pot dealers, who act as a sort of cock-eyed Greek chorus. Dante is completely lost, stuck in a job he hates, no direction in life, doesn't appreciate the girl he has, but longs for the girl who has treated him badly. Randal just wants to watch movies and hang out. Most of the customers want a pack of smokes.The film is often over-praised, but is an important one in the indie film world. Smith proved that good writing and a unique voice could be the basis for a film career, and that entertaining films didn't need large budgets, studio involvement, or even camera movements.The acting is amateurish and often self-conscious, but it serves to deliver the jokes and insights. Within those limitations, Smith is able to construct entertaining characters. Most seem like buddies from high school, or people in the neighborhood, with more interesting conversations.The look of the film is bland and dank, which fits the setting beautifully. Smith will never be mistaken for Ridley Scott or Michael Mann, in terms of visuals, but he gets the job done.The film is definitely worth viewing, if nothing more than as an introduction to a director's career. It is often very funny, depending on your sensibilities and tolerance for some of the more sophomoric humor. It tells a story of real people in a real setting, with a little added \"color\" for entertainment value. If nothing else, it gave the world Jay and Silent Bob, the funniest pair of stoners since Cheech and Chong.",

Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is an unhappy clerk at the Quick Stop, a convenience store in Leonardo, NJ. After working late at night, he has had to fill in at 6:00 AM (to 12:00 noon) the following day (Saturday, on his day off) because an employee has called in sick. Also, he wants to play a street hockey game at 2:00, and feels he won't be sharp because of little sleep. Dante's friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) nonchalantly runs the next door video store; he is not above offending his customers. Randal even rents his videos from another store! Throughout the film Randal comes over to the Quick Stop to chat with Dante about life, careers, and girlfriends. The men are dissatisfied and bored, and their lives are going nowhere. Besides the bizarre customers, the two main female characters, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) and Caitlyn (Lisa Spoonauer), wander into the story. Veronica is Dante's current girlfriend. Caitlyn, Dante's ex-girl, is engaged to be married; Dante still seems to like her. Meanwhile Dante's boss calls to say that he cannot make it in by 12:00 so that Dante has to man the business until closing time. He is reduced to playing hockey on the roof. This flick without a plot, made on a shoestring budget of less than $29,000, won the Filmmaker's Trophy at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival. It eventually grossed over $3 million. Some consider the film to be artistic. For instance, the black-and-white shooting and murky sound apparently represent meaningless lives. Nevertheless, it will not appeal for all tastes. For one thing, the humor is off-color, raw. The cast, unseasoned at the time of filming, uses ribald language. Also, the conversations are rather pointless and usually boring.

Anyone who ever heard a class clown in the 6th grade bellow on and on about the unfairness of being stuck beneath their abilities by a cruel and uncaring world has just heard every line from Clerks. To heap further abuse upon his audience, Kevin Smith can't direct, either. The performances he wrings out of his actors are sub-par and wooden, his choices for shots are peculiar when they're not just plain bad, and for those who suspect I am merely being contrary, Kevin Smith has himself admitted to his shortcomings as a director.This movie does have its good points, however.

Rabdall understood what slacking was all about and was cool with his life. It was Dante that seemed to be in a quandary. A lot of the film was Randal trying to straighten him out. Their banter was exceedingly funny.Of course, Dante has a problem with Veronica and Caitlan, played by Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonhauer. The women appear to be much more mature than their love interests. Their lives are going somewhere, but they are still attracted to the slackers. What's up with that?

How anybody, even the depraved critics, could rave about this is a telling statement.All this cheap, independent film features is talk and more talk - all vulgar - between a couple of clerks, one from a convenience store and the other from the nearby video store. They are the kind of guys filmmakers love: ultra-profane, low-life, 20-something-year-old punks. The movie mainly is a series of comedy skits featuring these two guys. As someone said, a more apt title would have been \"Jerks,\" not \"Clerks.\" And it gets ultra-raunchy when \"Veronica\" enters the movie.\"Clever\" is how the dialog is described by many critics, who gravitate toward anything nasty in tone.

Maybe learning a thing or two in a, sort of honest, day's work.\" \"Sounds boring.\"The people that truly appreciate Clerks in its entirety are people with an open mind, a sense of realism, and an appetite for a different side of cinema. Not people who expect constant humor, nudity, or any form of the comedy films that come out in present day. Clerks will not bring a regular person the type of satisfaction and laughter they would get if they turned on The Hangover this very second. It isn't that type of film.The dialog is what truly makes this movie an absolute shocker and an absolute winner. The simple, yet cherished, character to character dialog as if they are real people and not actors. There doesn't even seem to be a script involved. Any Hollywood actor probably could not have played the part of Dante more believable than Brian O'Halloran himself. Literally stunning and without a doubt incredible to see a nobody at that time talk and have on screen conversations like a normal human being with the absence of a script.The plot: Dante (O'Halloran) is a twenty-two year old, independent convenient store employee who is forced to work on his day off by his boss. Reluctantly he agrees to open the store, which he feels like he runs. Most of the day is spent socializing with his best friend Randal (Anderson) who works in a video store neighboring him. The day's antics include an angry cigarette rally, idiotic customers, rude behavior to innocent patrons, a funeral, and hockey on the roof. Both Dante and Randal are unsuccessful socially and in their relationships. Dante finds out from an article in the paper that his ex girlfriend Caitlin (Spoonhauer) is marrying an Asain design major. Shocked and outraged because constantly talking to her she never brought this up, it adds to Dante's stress level as he tries to keep his current girlfriend Veronica (Ghigliotti, who I had the pleasure of meeting in 2010) happy.It is normality and just another day in the View Askewniverse which is why I adore Kevin Smith's film so much. They are basically focusing on regular guys who get themselves into quirky or hilarious situations unintentionally. The only Kevin Smith film I didn't like as much as his others was Zack and Miri Make a Porno most likely because it was different and not on par at all with Smith's previous work. I even called his negatively received film Jersey Girl \"a work of heart.\" He really satisfies me on every level of filmmaking. Something no other director does to me.Clerks also includes one of the most powerful and fitting soundtracks to any film. Motivated by Alice in Chains, Love Among Freaks, and Soul Asylum, Clerks manages to use most of its $27,000 budget on music rights rather than actors, who were all part of Smith's family or friends, and location.It is truly amazing what can be accomplished with a small amount of money, two great leads, and a script that never fails. Never does a moment of Clerks seem boring or too long. No runtime for this film could make it too long. It is simply a film that has no rules and just wants to be a realistic film on behind the counter life. How often do we see a movie about cops, pimps, and drug lords? How often do we see a movie about behind-the-counter life? Because of its oddball style, its premise, its actors, its fun, and everything else, Clerks stands as my favorite film.Starring: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonhauer, Jason Mewes, and Kevin Smith.

            "content": "There are a lot of people in this movie trying desperately to look cool. The main character does several times, Randal does constantly, and Jay and Silent Bob are poster boys for trying to ber cool. And lets not credit how the biggest kiddie superego, Kevin Smith, tries to sell this image of how cool he is. But the fact of the matter is that it all looks really quite foolish: if this movie hadn't been hyped so much, it would be the flick that if Smith showed it to his friends, they'd point and laugh AT it, instead of with it. Nothing here works right. Several attempts at romantic subplots just don't seem convincing because they don't sound real at all. Smith apparently has some philosophy that apparently all women are sluts or sexually maladjusted. The non-story isn't very compelling because Dante and Randal, our resident leads, repeat what has happened over and over and over again, just in case we might have missed the nothing we've been watching. Another way Smith shows arrested development is that, frankly, the guy has some weird animal views: a cat is shown in a litter box for absolutely no reason aside from pleasing the stoners, and a dog is shown drinking from a toilet. This sort of scatology made me want to stop the tape twice, but I was sure with the reputation this has, something \"smart\" has to happen. I have heard so much about this movie's intelligent dialogue. I'm sorry: I've read wittier stuff in bathroom stalls. It isn't very natural sounding when characters break out in prepared monologues, and how several characters speak exactly the same. If this is the movie that defined Generation X, Generation X was a joke.",

For every jerk, there's two weirdo's, and for every one of them, there's somebody who insists on trying to tell you how to do your job better. Having done a variety of customer service jobs years ago, I've had my share of strange and experiences, and I had to move on simply to avoid further destroying my faith in humanity.This independent black comedy has received a huge cult following, and in watching it for the first time since I left that cow pasture, oops I mean field, I am reminded of the reason I turned to dancing the paper shuffle rather than serving a demonic humanity. This gives the best of the worst, focusing on a convenience store with passing reference to the video store next door. I have personal experience from working in the now defunct video store industry, and those scenes are particularly delicious to me, especially a scene where the clerk orders a children's video in addition to more than a dozen nasty sounding porno movies as the young mother stands by in shock, holding her baby daughter. The cast of unknowns do their best to slam both sides of the counter. Thr humor can get a little blue at times, but there is a subtleness in the filth that brings on some genuine snorts of laughter. This goes out of its way to show how stupid the most obnoxious of customers can be. The clerks aren't that brainy either, although a lot of their responses to ridiculous requests are pretty smart. I don't care for deliberate rudeness, but sometimes customers go out of their way to get a confrontation started. Gum company representatives try to get smokers to quit, shell shocked guidance counselors go out of their way to find the perfect dozen eggs, and overly sensitive whiny cry babies get offended over the silliest things. Deliberately dumb inquiries just make you roll your eyes, but oh boy, how true this screenplay is.This is filled with so many memorable sequences, the highlight being an old man who purchases dirty magazines then asks to use the restroom in the convenience store. A spontaneous hockey game interrupts the boredom of serving the locals. If this movie teaches me one thing, its how not to act when I go into a store. Fortunately, many of my local stores have added automated checkout machines which I prefer over the phony cheeriness of clerks today which in New York City makes me feel like I've stepped into an alternate universe.",

As a writer, Smith definitely has a bead on the youth culture of the Nineties and it wasn't soon after this picture came out and his name was popping up everywhere. The principals he put together here were perfect for their roles, and Smith's own Silent Bob character is a blast.

            "content": "Great comic actors possess excellent timing and perfect delivery\u0097qualities that either come naturally or that have been developed over time. Judging by their stilted performances, the majority of the cast in Clerks were not born with these skills, nor did they have the opportunity to develop them before being cast by director Kevin Smith in his low-budget debut.Of course, successful comedy also requires really funny material, and fortunately, Smith's script for Clerks is bristling with enough witty, well-observed, and often very crude dialogue that it's possible to forgive the performers' awkward deliveries.A day in the lives of Dante and Randall, two unambitious store clerks who would rather play hockey, watch porn, and sleep than serve their customers with a smile, Clerks is the epitome of 'slacker' comedy, and is destined to be a cult favourite amongst layabouts and movie geeks for years to come. Consisting of a series of funny vignettes in which our direction-less wastrels discuss\u0097amongst other things\u0097life, death, the joys of hermaphroditic porn, the construction of the Death Star, blow-jobs, and the working conditions of a jizz mopper (see urbandictionary.com if you don't know what this is), the film's success relies almost entirely on Smith's writing abilities, which, thankfully, are easily up to the task.It's not often that a comedy actually succeeds in making me laugh out loud; since Clerks managed this feat more than once (the Happy Scrappy Hero pup scene is wonderful!), and because it also features the screen debuts of Jay and Silent Bob, I'll turn a blind eye to the film's weaker aspects, and rate it a very impressive 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Writer / director / co-editor / supporting player Kevin Smith made a Hell of a breakthrough film with this fresh and funny comedy, which spans one whole day and night. Brian O'Halloran stars as Dante, a convenience store clerk who reluctantly reports to work on his day off. Discontent with his lot in life, he's frequently visited throughout the day by his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson). Randal is supposed to be working as a clerk at the video rental shop next door, but he can hardly be bothered to show up there. The movie shows what happens as Dante deals with the melodrama in his life, and deals with the assorted troublesome customers that come into his store.The main draw in this effectively paced movie is Smiths' often hilarious dialogue. Now, the dialogue ensures that the easily offended, or those people bothered by excess profanity, will be annoyed, but there are still some DAMN funny lines in this. Loosely based on \"The Divine Comedy\" (with nine breaks in the movie to represent the nine rings of Hell), it's all breathlessly performed by Smiths' capable cast of newcomers. O'Halloran is very engaging as a rather uptight guy who needs to learn to take some responsibility for his lot in life. Anderson is hilarious as his more carefree buddy. Sexy ladies Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonauer have plenty of appeal as the women in Dantes' life: Spoonauer is Caitlin, the ex- girlfriend whom he continues to pine over, and Ghigliotti is Veronica, the patient current girlfriend who encourages him to better himself, and does nice things for him, but whose sexual history becomes a sticking point for him. Jason Mewes and director Smith himself debut their slacker characters Jay and Silent Bob, who became fixtures in Smiths' filmography. Some of the various eccentric convenience store customers are amusing with their particular quirks. Shooting in black & white may have been a budgetary choice, but it gives \"Clerks\" a definite low budget charm.It's all made even more enjoyable with the eclectic rock soundtrack, including one of this viewers' favorite bands, Alice in Chains. That \"Berserker\" song is pretty damn priceless. And it's wrapped up in a rather tidy but satisfying fashion.Eight out of 10.",

The day never goes right for him, for starters he isn't meant to be at work, on top of that there are constant bickers with his girlfriend and not to mention his video store sidekick Randal. Whereas Dante is dislikeable and at times annoying Randal is the comic relief. A genius character, who doesn't give a damn about his work. The two characters work off each other brilliantly, the picture and direction may not be great but the script is genius, extremely funny and witty, which makes it one of the funniest movies of all time. Kevin Smith rocks!The charm of this film resides entirely in the dialogs and in strange and sometimes weird (even creepy) situations. The conversations between Dante and Randall cover a large variety of topics, including but not limited to \"Star Wars\" and life in general... The conversations they have with various customers are even better... Two small time marijuana dealers, Jay and Silent Bob, who make their sales in front of the two shops, intervene in a couple of occasions - they don't say much, but their contributions are important. The language is very strong and the humour occasionally doesn't fly very high but still, this film has considerable charm and some gags are simply irresistible. Cynical and lucid Randal is a character somehow more appealing than Dante, on whom the whole story focuses, but ultimately I grew fond of both of them. Bottom line, this is an excellent, quite clever little comedy, with certainly a lot of strong language (but ultimately not so many \"F\" bombs) and a little bit of necrophilia, but ultimately surprisingly tender and gentle.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",

It opened with some controversy--it was given an NC-17 rating for dialogue alone--which is kind of silly. There IS a lot of swearing and tons of sexually frank talk but I've heard worse in big budget studio movies like \"Casino\" or \"Scarface\". The rating was appealed and lowered (with no cuts) to an R.I like the film--to a point. It is funny (if very crude) and the script itself is just great--full of very interesting lines about sex, love, life and movies (Randal's talk about \"Revenge of the Jedi\" is hilarious). After a while though it wore me down. The black + white photography is grimy, Smith is not exactly a great director and the character of Dante was such a wimp I got annoyed at him. He's treated like dirt nonstop and takes it. Also his buddy Randal was just cruel and unbelievably anti-social. Also the original ending (which actually works good) was cut. It had Dante being shot dead by a robber. It was left out cause it was too depressing--but it DOES make sense in the context of the movie.So--I did (sort of) like this and recommend it.

The closest he would come would be with Dogma and Chasing Amy, both highly recommendable films, but even then, they both lacked the poignancy of Clerks, and the quiet understanding reverberating from the audience.The movie isn't perfect. It's a bit rough around the edges. I won't lie and claim that Kevin Smith is a great director. Similar to Tarantino, he bases his own career on those of other (better) directors \u0096 i.e. he is a major film aficionado and thrives on cinema. Unlike Tarantino, however, Smith often just comes across as a regular guy who picked up a camera and filmed some of his buddies cracking jokes in an empty convenience store. Both directors constantly reference their idols \u0096 for Smith it is John Hughes \u0096 however in my opinion it's Tarantino who really has the workings of a \"great director\" whereas there is nothing particularly notable about Smith's actual direction.His strength lies in his writing. Clerks is full of wonderful dialog, and Smith pauses long enough to let his characters expand through verbal actions as opposed to the more brash physicality inherent in most comedies.Clerks has a few good sight gags but most of the major laughs derive from clever word plays or discussions \u0096 such as the construction workers of the Death Star in Star Wars and whether or not they were innocent or part of the Dark Side. It takes a kind of uncommon genius to be able to evoke laughter from such material. (Or, perhaps, just a really bored movie buff who's recording his own past conversations with friends onto paper.) The film follows the misadventures of its protagonist, Dante (Brian O'Halloran, whose character is a reference to the classical literature Dante's Inferno), whom is called into work at a local New Jersey gas station convenience store on his day off. Abandoning his girlfriend and plans for the weekend, Dante endures annoying customers and the next-door video clerk, Randall, who never seems to do any work at all and just lounges around discussing stupid topics with Dante, who most of the time seems utterly uninterested.The acting isn't great. The direction, as aforementioned, isn't worth noting for any particular reason.It's the conversations that are so funny \u0096 and the film's casual, observant attitude. Smith manages to take a rather \u0096 let's face it \u0096 boring topic and turns it into a freakishly funny cult comedy (would it be suitable to name it a classic?).

It has become a cult classic, a 'must have' on the movie shelves of college dorm rooms far and wide, and one of the very few films that a person can watch over and over again without growing tired of it.Contrary to popular belief, however, Jay and Silent Bob are not the tandem that drove the film's success. From a moral standpoint, I had a hard time accepting two drug dealers as the \"lovable losers\" that Smith would have us believe they are, but beyond that, Jason Mewes isn't all that talented. He speaks every line as though he's in need of adenoidal surgery, and his long hair and droopy clothing no longer disguise the fact that he's over thirty years old. Mewes basically plays himself in every one of his roles, and should probably consider himself lucky to have a famous friend willing to write entire movies for him to star in.The dynamic duo who ARE most responsible for the film's success are Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson playing Dante and Randall, respectively. O'Halloran was brilliantly understated in his role; he is sympathetic without ever directly appealing to the audience to be seen that way. When his girlfriend Veronica claims that he's wasting himself at a dead-end job, we can believe it because of his penchant for subtle humor (\"I assure you, we're open!\" and the \"pay by honor system\" were both priceless) and his educated vocabulary. Randall was sufficiently smug and condescending to customers, treating them the way many would love to deal with dim people asking inane questions. And to top it off, the dialogue between Dante and Randall just could not have been better: it was snappy, witty, and realistic from start to finish.\"Clerks\" is a film intended primarily for college guys (Is there a dorm room in the country that doesn't hold a copy of this film?) but that somehow also appeals to people from all walks of life. Educated people can enjoy it for the vocabulary (\"Perspicacity\") and incredibly smart writing. Low brow folks can love the off-color humor and graphic controversies regarding Dante's two girlfriends. And anyone who has ever worked in the convenience/fast food industry can appreciate the moronic situations that customers present, along with the ways that Dante and Randall deal with them.It is easy to become a Kevin Smith fan simply from watching this movie alone; however, he has not even come close to this standard of excellence since, making several truly wretched films ('Mallrats\", \"Vulgar\", \"Jersey Girl\") in the process. If you're thinking about becoming a Kevin Smith follower, do yourself a favor: rent \"Clerks\" again instead, sit back and watch it for the umpteenth time, and wistfully ponder how good Smith used to be.",

            "content": "A day in the life, a Saturday with Dante (Brian O'Halloran), Dante's day off certainly means some plans yet the Saturday began to be an unusual one when his boss said that he need him working in the store, certainly not any more a normal Saturday however is still a day in which nothing very strange should happen, a work day that will still allow Dante to do his plans, the most important for him: his hockey game. So this Saturday should not be more than just an unusual day because Dante is working yet it will be an unusual day for many other reasons. My title is a dialog of my favourite character of this film, a dialog of Jeff Anderson's character Randal who like Dante is a clerk and who is Dante's best friend. Clerks, they share many things certainly like for example they must deal with the classic annoying clients (very funny stuff, from the man who for a reason tries to stop clients that want to buy cigarettes to the man who wants something to read since he is going to the bathroom). But of course they are different from each other, while Dante respects the clients Randal spits on them, is very unkind and stuff. Well Randal is in the video store he attends just very few times, he opens late, he is with Dante most of the time, he goes to other video stores, he spits on Dante's clients, well you get how Randal is. So it may be sort of like this: of the two friends we have on one hand the responsible one, in short the good one and on the other hand well Randal. But here the thing is that Dante basically does things that are even worse than the things that Randal does, Dante is always saying how unhappy he is with his life because his girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) has sucked 37 dicks, because his ex-girlfriend who he still can't forget will get married, because he is working on a Saturday and stuff but he always is the victim for himself, never taking his responsibility. So the \"big\" thing in Clerks happens when Dante's ex-girlfriend arrives, at one point Dante will be like \"my life is a s***\" and at other point Dante will blame Randal for ruining his relationship with Veronica, in both points Randal says nothing but true things, certainly after all Dante was the one trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend without saying a thing to his girlfriend. This was an unforgettable day, very important for Dante, he started it with a girlfriend, he ended it without that girlfriend but finally getting rid of his high school love past, at the end of the day he knows that he loves Veronica, he finally saw that Veronica loves him. Randal also had a crazy day, by the end he is like he was at the beginning, which is good for him, after all at one point he says that he is satisfied with his life. After some years of only knowing about its existence I finally saw the debut film of Kevin Smith almost two weeks ago. I also knew Kevin Smith just by hearing and reading stuff about his movies (this one and Zack and Miri Make a Porno being the ones I heard about the most) and with Clerks I had my introduction to his work. I was certainly expecting a whole lot from it, it was a real must wanted film for me and I was really glad when I came across its DVD. Clerks is a terrific debut of Smith, great and very memorable dialog, I didn't feel disappointed at all and I hope soon I can see Clerks II.",

It's unconventional, it's experimental, and some people have stated that it's actually barely a movie, which leaves me with little rebuttal. However, this grainy, black and white recording about nobodies doing nothing is hypnotic in a way, and most of all strangely funny. Having Jay and Silent Bob (both seldom seen) dance is one of the most random things I've ever seen in a movie, but it really cracked me up. There isn't really a plot, and nothing is ever resolved, but this doesn't matter, cue off the wall dialogue about hermaphrodite porn. I have no idea why I laughed, I have no idea what I've even watched, but this is really good stuff. A milestone in low-budget art-house film-making.",

            "content": "Shot on a shoestring budget of $27,000 worth of credit card bills, Clerks remains the pinnacle of Kevin Smith's filmmaking career.  The plot is engaging and is very simple but very original.  The story chronicles the plight of Dante, a young man called into work on his day off and the problems that follow.  The cast, comprised of total unknowns at the time it was shot, is absolutely perfect.  Brian O'Halloran is spot on as the disaffected, eternally frustrated Dante.  Jeff Anderson is great as his best friend who prides himself on being the ultimate slacker and @$$hole.  And of course, this is the film that introduced the world to the infamous drug dealing duo Jay and Silent Bob.  What makes this film work so well is the great combination of comedy and drama.  Contained with in are some of the funniest situations and dialogue ever put on screen.  But beyond that, it provides characters who are interesting and realistic.  It also provides some very truthful and honest commentaries on life in general.  We can relate to Dante's relationship struggles and his unsatisfying job, and the relationships between the central characters are very believable.  Ultimately, this movie is effective because it is both hilarious and honest.While Kevin Smith has created some very funny films in the time since Clerks., this is the one he will be remembered for most, and rightfully so. Perhaps the very small scale is why.  In a movie with such limited settings and so small a budget to work with, the weight must be carried by the actors and the script.  In this case, both came through magnificently, and the end result is one of the greatest cult classics ever made.",

The much ballyhooed writing is just simply not as clever as it thinks it is, basically amounting to a bunch of stuff that would be funny if you said it to your friends but pretty lame when delivered, without the slightest hint of inflection, into the camera. Of course, people will say that they laughed their asses off, but people will say that about \"Tommy Boy\", too. Outside of that, we have charmless, inept actors (are real actors that expensive?  So many would do it for free, just for the exposure) and a complete lack of cinematic grace or technique. The basic shot in Clerks is a nailed to the floor camera honing in on non moving actors.  Absurdly, Smith claims this was based on the Divine Comedy (the lead character is named Dante, get it?) but this structure is pretty much meaningless, and has precious little to do with the film as it stands.This is certainly not Smith's worst film.  If you think that his handling of comedy is shallow, you should see how he handles drama in the laughable \"Chasing Amy\".  But it is his most overrated, and downright odious.",

            "content": "Being from Europe, it was really hard for me to get to see this movie. I'd previously seen Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob, so I was eager to see how it all started, but there seemed to be no way for that. The film could not be rented or bought on neither DVD nor VHS and in the five years since I first saw Mallrats on TV (and it has been rebroadcast two times) Clerks was never on TV (not on one of the twenty eight networks I receive). So, what was I to do? Well, being a big fan of Jay and Silent Bob, I decided to do what they sometimes do, something illegal. I guess you know what I mean. Yep, I downloaded the film from the internet and I would hereby like to apologize to everyone involved in the making of this film, for ripping their film illegally off the internet. I would like to apologize to Miramax and of course mostly to Mr. Smith. I'm deeply sorry, but I can assure you all, that I did not copy the film, that I did not multiply it and sell it and that I do now have it on my hard drive anymore (so I cannot be arrested for copyright violations). Anyway, so there I had this black and white film, that was about 8 years old and I watched it on a 15 inch monitor. Was it any good??? Well if you really want to know, keep on reading!Actually this film was pretty good and a lot like I'd imagined Kevin Smith's first film would be like. Despite the fact that this is a cheap film, it is definitely a Kevin Smith film. Jay and Silent Bob are on the same trip they always are, Jay is annoying and lashes out with a lot of explicit language while Silent Bob holds his tongue. But when he speaks it is words of wisdom and meaning. The laughs in this film are mostly generated by Randal (Jeff Anderson), who seems to be very individualistic and does not care about anyone else. He and his friend Dante (Brian O'Halloran), who is (I hope) not having a normal day, are the center of this film, which features a lot of talk about sex, girls and nasty stories.Despite all of this, the film is not really good although it still entertains. The fact that the film was almost shot at one singular location 'The store', is not working in the films favor, nor are the scenes, which appear every now and then and gave me the feel there was no story there. It was kind of disturbing the dialogue, hopping from one conversation to the next. Also the film is not really hilarious (although there are some funny scenes) and I felt that it was too lengthy at the end. All in all: one to be enjoyed but not one that needs to be seen for someone not into Kevin Smith's Jersey films.7 out of 10My top five of Kevin Smith's Jersey films from best to worst:1. Mallrats: 8 out of 102. Dogma: 8 out of 103. Chasing Amy: 7 out of 104. Clerks: 7 out of 105. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back: 6 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused.

He must put up with some obnoxious customers at \"Quick Stop Groceries\" in New Jersey. From a nearby home video rental store, fellow clerk and slacker Jeff Anderson (as Randal Graves) visits frequently. New girlfriend Marilyn Ghigliotti (as Veronica) also appears. She explains the sexual practice known as \"snowballing\" and upsets Mr. O'Halloran by revealing 36 partners in the related act. From college, old girlfriend Lisa Spoonhauer (as Caitlin Bree) also visits. She is engaged to an Asian design major, but may still love O'Halloran...This is the first feature film written and directed by Kevin Smith, and it's a winner. Upon release, \"Clerks\" was considered so raunchy it originally received the restrictive NC-17 rating. Although no sex act ever occurs on screen, the language is relentlessly naughty; yet, it always seems natural for the characters. We do wonder how the film's most uncanny sex act could possibly have happened, but this is, after all, a comedy. Our \"snowballing\" lesson is fun and educational. Although it's shot in old-style black-and-white, the film reverberates with originality. Most importantly, Mr. Smith's ideas \u2013 including, of course, the classic stoner team \"Jay & Silent Bob\" formed by himself and Jason Mewes \u2013 are fresh.******** Clerks (1/22/94) Kevin Smith ~ Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Marilyn Ghigliotti, Lisa Spoonhauer",

Dante Hicks gets called into work on his day off, so his day is spent in the purgatory of serving a succession of customers while bemoaning the fact that \"I'm not even supposed to be here today.\" His best friend, Randall is less dedicated to his job at RST Video and usually spends most of his time going next door and bothering the customers at Quick Stop and to hang out with Dante. So the whole day goes on with many turning events from playing hockey on the roof top of the store to Dante getting stuck between his current girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) and his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Other than the turn of events this is the movie that introduces the debut of our favorite stoners, Jay & Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) who enjoy hanging out in front of the stores selling weed.

Though he cares about doing a good job himself, his girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) is convinced that he is wasting his life and should return to school. His friend, Randal (Jeff Anderson) runs the video rental next door, his distaste for the job is only outmatched by his dislike of the customers. The pair are in for quite a day.A decade or so, I think I'd probably have put \"Clerks\" near the top of a list of my favourite films. Watching it again now, it has slipped just a little bit, but I wonder if that's more through familiarity than anything else. Certainly, the performances were never great, the leads are OK and Jason Mewes is a force of nature, but many of the supporting characters and, noticeably this time Ghigliotti, aren't great. It should be said that these weren't professional actors at the time and some of the cast haven't really been in anything that isn't directly related to the View-askewniverse. It doesn't look great either, as the black and white shooting, which feels in retrospect like an aesthetic choice was rather to keep the costs down.The real star is Smith's script. A profane, pop culture laden riot - though this is where I think the film suffers on this viewing, through me having seen it too many times. I know what's coming and so punchlines don't hit like they used to.

Endlessly quotable, grotesquely talky and undeniably self-indulgent, Clerks is all about words - how the characters talk about themselves, to customers or just waxing lyrical about a few favourite past times, be they Return Of The Jedi or hermaphrodite porn, and has the kind of lexis that would make Chaucer blush. Low on action, big on talking, but what talking! Dante can't seem to catch a break: He's been sent to work on his day off by a boss who ends up going to Vermont for the weekend, has a girlfriend who reveals more about herself than he was prepared to handle, and is in love with his recently engaged ex-girlfriend. He is also best friends with the biggest slacker in the world, who seems to be making things worse (if not altogether more entertaining) by doing things like selling cigarettes to four year olds and knocking over coffins at funerals. In the mean time he deals with the customers.In terms of plot Clerks is basically a series of vignettes, mostly showing how our protagonist and his wastrel sidekick Randal react to the various buyers-to-be and their strange habits (mostly buying cigarettes, but occasionally searching for the perfect dozen of eggs or using the bathroom for rather dubious activities). There is so much charm in the performances, and spot on humour in a script that some of Hollywood's finest directors could only dreaming of possessing that it never feels like a continuous loop. The various stages in Clerks manage to add something different to the last one, like small gimmicks and observations. One scene has Dante lying in the back of his store with his girlfriend, whilst giving customers the notice to take the right amount of change. Or indeed Randal's newly-acquired video featuring acts of unspeakable hideousy playing in the background during Dante's discussion with ex-flame Caitlin. It's these little nuances which make every segment fresh and different.It's one thing to be inspired to make movies by once being a clerk, it's something entirely different to make a film about Clerks - in the store where you currently work! Hats off to Kevin Smith for making it this way, and always sticking to his independent roots. It is somewhat of a disappointment that his later works have never truly seen themselves as the Pulp Fiction to his Reservoir Dogs, but glibness aside you cannot take anything away from a man who risked huge debt to make one of the most influential cult movies of the 1990s. Every bit as crude, fresh and hilarious as it was in 1994, Clerks should be seen by a wider audience than the cult it already has. With Clerks II on the way, it may well find it.",

Note how carved-out-of-stone his expression is, during the secondlast (randal's psychobabble) scene.\nThe two good things about this movie are 1) the dialogues/events *are* funny on occasion and 2) I got to see it for free.

I just wish we could see more of the same genre, rather than go to glitz and glamour. Clerks is simple and has no pretense, but people turn up their nose at any movie that doesn't have special effects, big names, and a 100 million dollar budget.

He shot it in black and white because that's probably all he could afford. Considering all the limitations, there is a lot to respect about 'Clerks.' However, I give the movie a very low rating. On the IMDb scale of 1 to 10, for me it is a '4', and I feel I am being generous. My main objection is all the profane situations and all the profane dialog. While I understand that people in certain areas, and walks of life, speak that way, about those things, it is not something I welcome into my home, nor into my viewing habits.

Also, the man who played the old Jewish man (Al Berkowitz) was by far my favorite actor. I wish I could see him in some other role.Many have accused this film of being unnesessarily profane and disgusting, but I feel that intermittent f-bombs and terms like \"jizz-mopper\" are crucial elements of the character's identity, and quite frankly are words our society DOES use.

The rot sets in when Smith decides he's had enough of the unrelated sketches and tries to weave things into a story of some kind.  Then the movie just falls apart; and the faster Smith tries to glue the pieces together, the faster it falls apart.  Some of the later bits of extended dialogue feel as if they're just taking up valuable time, even though it's not clear what they're taking up valuable time from.The characters also turn out to be a let-down.  Dante, the hero, is poorly defined.  He's sympathetic because he's so put upon by the world, but neither actor nor writer could quite decide whether he's a doormat or simply a nice guy, so we get both interpretations in alternate scenes, and neither quite rings true.  Randal, his friend, is someone you want to see painfully injured.  (He never is.  Even when Dante has him by the throat he manages to wriggle out alive.)  Yes, he's meant to be annoying, but I don't think he's meant to be quite as annoying as he is.  If he WAS meant to irritate the audience beyond endurance, I can't see how that makes things any better. The effect is the same.Smith gambled his life's savings and more to make this on a shoestring budget, and it's in low resolution black and white.  So, people seem to reason, it must be much better than the later movies where he had a better camera and spent more money.  This is absurd.  Attend to the script, the performances, the story, to whether or not it's any GOOD.  `Clerks' is worth watching largely because of what followed it.",

I like his characters and sense for dialogue, but his films tend to sprawl all over and there are long sequences that feel like insufferable navel gazing.  `Dogma,' for example.  The angels were fun, but the rest of it felt like someone dramatically declaring their utterly unshocking views of rigid Christian orthodoxy.  `Clerks' can feel like that at its lowest moments.  But mostly I feel real affection for this movie.  I've been a clerk or at least worked in coffee shops.  I've had to choose whether or not to censor a conversation for fear of offending some customer I didn't care about who might take the time to endanger a job I desperately hated.  I chose to be vulgar and rude.  I was offered a promotion to manager.  And that's one of the things I loved about this movie - dramatizing that self-destructive ennui that is ultimately futile.  Because as long as you have a mild sense of responsibility, are slightly sane and can count to ten, it's almost impossible to lose a clerk job.  But the boredom forces you to test the limits of how irresponsible, insane and stupid you can be.I also loved seeing how people just don't care how they behave in front of someone on a cash register.  I loved how the whole movie happened despite the fact that Dante wasn't scheduled to work that day.  All those day-to-day details of that essentially sub-human interaction of two people divided by a cash register made me almost forgive the whininess of Dante.  I see the Divine Comedy structure, and I especially love Virgil in this, but by the last fifteen minutes of the film I really disliked Dante.Very funny and original.

Yes Working behind the counter encountering some of the strangest creatures on the planet. The general public is a difficult breed to deal with. I've had days were I made record sales and yet all it took was one bellicose customer to ruin that special day. And by the way I wasn't even suppose to be in the store that day. The movie Clerks falls along those lines of the bizarre. Opening scene shows a messy bedroom. So messy you can't even see the floor cluttered with at least two weeks worth of laundry. The centerpiece in all this agglomeration is a male person fast asleep, his dormant body lying halfway along the floor and protruding out of the closet used as the headboard. A phone rings and our exhausted person first has top find the phone and then trace the line to answer among the debris. Apparently a co-worker on the other end tells our sleepy friend he has to work today. Our sleepy friend is the the main character and focus throughout this movie Dante (Brian O'Halloran). Brian, a college drop out is trying to buy some time working in a convenience store in Central New Jersey. Reluctantly Dante hauls his tired frame over to his place of employment. To his frustration, the locks on the store, (mainly the riot gates,) where filled with glue . Luckily the front door lock was not, so he enters the establishment and makes a sign out of a sheet and black shoe polish saying that \"We Assure You We Are Open!\" The film is shot in black and white which gives you an unappetizing feel toward the store. I wouldn't even order a coffee in that establishment. Mainly the store itself has a confining feel, cramped and cluttered. Another words like being in purgatory. The director Kevin Smith does a fine job slowing the pace with his characters showing a lack of enthusiasm mainly Dante and Randall (Jeff Anderson). Those two blokes experiencing the slow daily grind and drudgery of the colorless world of retail. Right from the beginning Dante encounters an anti smoking salesman played by Scott Schiaffo, To add to Dante's agitation his domineering girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) pressuring him to go back to college and improve himself. Then telling him that she is busy with other men intimately. One of many independent films that show sub standard acting yet the dialogue is funny and on point. Kevin Smith shows the underbelly of retail i.e., Weird customers taking cartons of eggs out of the case and comparing them. Dante having Veronica polishing his finger nails behind the counter. Closing the store down for roller hockey on the roof. An under aged youth purchasing cigarettes. Then a little while later Dante is approached by an administrator of cigarettes who slaps a fine at him. An elderly whiny man asking to use the restroom in ways I never imagined with startling results. Most of the energy and jocular dialogue comes from next store neighbor and video clerk Randall who claims if it wasn't for customers this job would be easy. All is not lost as the two spend the down time eating cupcakes and cheese doodles while reading distressing news out of the local paper involving Dante ex-girlfriend who announces her engagement to a successful designer. Later they lock up their stores to attend a wake. Even the visit to the funeral home isn't without controversy. I was on board from the start being a retailer and seeing the similarities in this independent film from my own personal experience. Jay and Silent Bob are playing vagrant drug dealer greeters of the store so to speak. These were two guys that Kevin Smith found in the Neighborhood and saw something special about them. Smith expanded the franchise by making a few films about this strange duo. .There is death and drugs not shown. The only thing missing was a dispute over exact change. There is much more about a day in the life of a convenience store manager but you'll have to sit through an hour and a half shift to absorb the absurdities of retail life. A must see for anyone who worked in retail.",

They discuss they're jobs, the costumers, and growing out of the adolescence of high school. They also spend a lot of time discussing Star Wars. They also encounter two of the most brilliantly written characters in cinema history. Well, one brilliantly written character, and one silent one.

While his boss promises him it's only until noon, Dante ends up spending the entire day there dealing with inane questions or encounters with customers, complaints against Dante's friend and Clerk at neighboring RST Video Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), and getting into a series of misadventures while Dante reconciles his conflicted feelings for his former girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonauer) whom he still carries a torch for, and his current girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) who routinely tries to convince Dante to take more control and direction with his life.Released in October of 1994, Clerks was the inaugural writing and directing debut of cult filmmaker Kevin Smith. Made for $27,575 Smith had scraped together from various sources, Smith utilized the same convenience store he worked at during the night over a 21 day shooting period and pushed himself to bring the movie to existence. Critically well regarded in its day, and financially successful making $3 million dollars against it's final $250,000 budget, the movie has been rightfully praised for its vulgar true to life dialogue, its memorable characters, and its all too familiar approach to the tedium and inanity that comes from working thankless clerk jobs.Brian O'Halloran is really good as our focus Dante Hicks. Although Dante isn't all that likable as he spends most of his time complaining about his life while doing absolutely nothing to make it better, and his indignation as Veronica's previous sexual partners while he's been secretly talking to his ex, Caitlin trying to rekindle their relationship from high school makes him pretty difficult to like. But while the movie doesn't ask us to \"like\" Dante, it does ask us to understand him. The movie gives an insight into Dante as someone who's comfortable being miserable and rather than try and find any sort of happiness or take any initiative or direct control of his life, it's his irrational attachments to the past (such as Caitlin) and his attributing of blame to every one else that allows him to excuse himself from responsibility by letting himself be subject to external whims. Throughout the movie Dante routinely says \"I'm not even supposed to be here today\" and when questioned by his friends as to why he's there he never has a good answer. Jeff Anderson is quite entertaining as Dante's friend and fellow clerk Randal Graves who has as much disdain for the job as Dante does, but is more outward in his expression of it often closing the video store to hang out with Dante at the Quick Stop and casually insulting the customers because he often sees himself as the \"smartest guy in the room\" and to a degree he is, but he's also working at a lower tier video store and doing a terrible job of it.The writing by Smith is really sharp with the movie filled with really fun exchanges as Dante and Randal kill time commentating on various customer interactions or talking about the innocent contractors who were killed in Return of the Jedi due to the second Death Star still being under construction. Clerks came out the same year as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and like Pulp Fiction the dialogue has this layered \"reference\" based approach that rewards the audience for their knowledge of ancillary material not related to the plot, but it's also augmented with that acerbic and vulgar approach that makes it feel real. As someone who used to work retail, the exchanges Smith crafts in the film can sometimes be uncomfortably close to interactions I've had or been privy to with customers in those environments. The movie does have some of the expected quirks in a first time film such as issues with the audio, some pretty obvious recycling of actors playing different characters throughout the day, and some of the tangents aren't all that funny or memorable, but aside from those very minor points Clerks is a solid slice of life that rings true to minimum wage tedium.Clerks is a strong debut effort from Kevin Smith and shows his craft with character and dialogue that overcomes some of the rougher elements that happen with first time projects. The cast is filled with memorable performances and characters who engage in equally memorable exchanges and if you've ever worked retail you know people like this exist.",

            "content": "Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) are employees of Quick Stop and RST Video, respectively. They may not love their jobs, but they do not necessarily show it, having as much fun in one day as you could possibly imagine. Playing hockey, attending (and ruining) a funeral... and much more.This film came about after Kevin Smith was inspired by independent filmmakers of the 1980s and 1990s like Richard Linklater (particularly \"Slacker\") and Jim Jarmusch. Before making your own movie was an easier prospect, he ran himself into debt, took a risk, and it paid off big. He may not have the talent of Linklater or Jarmusch, and will probably never have a film in the Criterion Collection, but he brings i nthe box office dollars.I do not know what to say here. My favorite film of all time is \"Mallrats\", which would not exist if it were not for Kevin Smith's success with \"Clerks\". Now, I love \"Clerks\" and have long found it to be one of the funniest films out there with numerous insights into life. Though, now I am not so sure. Having watched it again a few days ago, it seemed much less funny to me and the crude acting really stood out, as well as the questionable shaky camera and overall juvenile tone.This is not to say that \"Clerks\" will not go down in history as an important film, but I am starting to think that it will lose its timeless nature if it has not already. In many ways, it is a time capsule of the mid-1990s, for better or worse. Kevin Smith as a whole is waning, it seems, with more failures than hits these days... and once he fades into the background, his films will not be far behind. I cannot fault the man for what he has done... but almost wonder if he was better off making his mark and walking away.One of the more interesting things about this film, in hindsight of twenty years (as of November 2014) is whose career took off and whose did not based on this film. Kevin Smith obviously became huge, and took with him his crew of Scott Mosier and David Klein. Jason Mewes, of the actors, has probably been the most successful. Brian O'Halloran has done alright, and Jeff Anderson has a career more or less completely reliant on Smith. Perhaps the strangest thing is that Lisa Spoonauer, by far the most photogenic of the \"Clerks\" alumni, more or less never acted again.If you have not seen \"Clerks\", see it. Especially if you are younger, and can appreciate what it is like working in a thankless dead-end job. You may wish to follow it up with \"Clerks 2\", though that film is vastly inferior. Go for \"Mallrats\" or \"Chasing Amy\".",

It's absolutely hysterical, and one of the most quotable comedies out there.This is a very well-written film. Not only is the plot coherent and interesting, but the dialog is incredible. When you watch films like Clerks or Pulp Fiction, what fills these movies out is the outstanding dialog. Even the elements which aren't germane to the plot itself. Whether hearing the characters wax over fan theories in their favorite films, or lament on the annoying customers that they have to deal with. It's hilarious and fun. And maybe what I like about it is also how it captures what I knew about being a young adult in the mid-1990s, even if I was still growing up myself.But Clerks isn't just a silly movie about working in a party store. It's also an example of how to correctly make a film about disaffected young adulthood. The plot primarily concerns one of the main characters dealing with his frustrations with his job, his relationship, and his station in life. His friend and coworker Randall proves as a contrast to him as well: Off the cuff, no filter, and free wheeling. Whereas Dante is generally uptight and frustrated. It's a well-done take on The Odd Couple for sure.But Clerks also has a great lesson as well. This is captured by how Randall isn't afraid to challenge his friend on the mental prison he pretty well chooses to lock himself in to. The central moral that I picked up from this film is taking responsibility for one's actions, and finding the motivation to change the things you have the power to do.Clerks is an all-time classic. Great dialog, plot, memorable characters and scenes. One of the greatest comedies of all-time.",

Mastermind of this subtle comedy, Kevin Smith, plays Silent Bob. He stands outside the store as the side kick of dope pushing Jason Mewes.

But there comes a time where you stop and move on!\"Clerks.\" is probably his best effort so far and that being his first and 10 years ago is a shame as I hoped he would progress more than he has within the Hollywood system.Poor acting is covered by Smith's excellent script. Dialogue is Smith's gift and long may he keep using it!You learn to associate and like Dante and everybody knows an a**hole like Randal!!!

It's a fun average-joe story that lives up to its tagline: Just because they serve you, doesn't mean they like you. I didn't realize how goofy that line meant until I had a part-time job and saw this movie. Clerks has so many inside jokes in that area that anybody who can relate will be roaring in laughter at some points. The main characters pretty much do everything that we would get fired for and to be honest, it's great fun to watch. Although it never would've left me expecting a sequel, I have to say Clerks is a smart comedy that's starting to grow into a trilogy and I'm dying to see how the animated sequel to Clerks II is going to turn out in a few years. Clerks will overall leave you rolling in laughter, and making you feel sick with laughter inside.",

The video store clerk is always in the convenience store talking to the convenience store clerk, while locking the video store during open hours. It's really funny. The things they talk about are just off the scale funny and humorous.Also, the throughout the film, all these weird mishaps and incidents keep happening. One customer in the convenience store keeps inspecting the eggs (like a physics experiment) for hours, trying to find the perfect egg, a chick sleeps with a dead old man with a post-mortem boner, and the list goes on and on.Another thing I liked about this movie, is that it's real life. It is very genuine to everyday people interaction. There's no need to look for any special effects or plot in this movie. It is very unique to its own.

Probably not much. Brilliant dialogue, very low budget, a triumphant independent film and yada, yada, yada. So I'll just say what Clerks means to me personally. What is it about this movie that I love so much.First of all, I've seen all of Kevin Smith's movies and this one is still my favorite.Let's start with the characters. I think Dante and Randal are the best characters that Smith has written. Their personalities are so different, yet they manage to have some of the best chemistry I've seen screen buddies have.I read the script before watching the movie, and while I really liked it, it's the actors that add that extra realism and feeling to the characters.Brian O'Halloran's Dante Hicks is perhaps my favorite character. Yes, he's the straight man, he's not very funny, he's frustrated and upset throughout most of the movie, but he's just so real. Being the serious guy in a comedy is not easy, mostly because you're probably gonna be labeled as \"the boring\" or \"not so funny\" guy. Dante Hicks is one of the most relatable characters I've ever seen. His concerns, his attitude and his personality are so well-written, he's so true to life.Randal Graves played by Jeff Anderson is definitely the most popular character of the movie. The slacker, the cool one, the funny one. Randal is a very funny character, no doubt about it, he's just hilarious. But it's the Dante/Randal relationship what I truly love. I don't think Randal could be a leading man, and I think he wouldn't be as popular, funny, or cool without Dante. The two characters compliment each other so well. Of all the pairs of friends Smith has created (Brodie/T.S., Holden/Banky, Bartleby/Loki, Jay/Bob) Dante and Randal are my absolute favorites.The rest of the characters are great as well, from Dante's girlfriend Veronica to Rick Derris, every characters has something good to offer.As for the story, well, one day in the life of Dante and Randal. The movie doesn't need a plot to succeed. The reason I keep re-watching and loving this movie every time is because of the characters and the interaction between them.You're closed.",

It makes a lot of the little it has. It also includes two characters, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) who appear in Smith's other movies and have a cameo in Scream 3. They appear in this, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Clerks the Series, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob strike back, Scream 3, and the upcoming film, The Passion of the Clerks. This movie is the best Smith film, and the nastiest. The other ones have sex, nudity, and some crude content. This one has out and out vulgar dialouge, including about ten different ways to say penis, vagina, and masturbate. It sounds bad, but for what it is, it's great. The funniest part is probably when an old man needs to use the restroom, and then dies with an erection. Starring: Brian O' Halloran (plays the same guy in Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back but is in all the films), Jeff Anderson (same character from Jay and silent bob...., cameo in Dogma), Marilyn Ghigliotti, Jason Mewes(in every Smith film including doing the voice of Jay in Jersey Girl, briefly), Kevin Smith (Just guess), Lisa Spoonhauser and Scott Mosier(Plays Steve-Dave in Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob..., plus Clerks:the Series) Great movie, even if you don't find it funny, you should enjoy it.

The fact that the film was shot in black and white was perfect as was the realism to the flick, this one isn't just funny, it's RELATEABLE-reeally relatable by any kid growing up.These are real people, in a sense, we are watcing, it's almost like watching a comedy-a HILARIOUS comedy about-just hour to hour daily life.I only know a very rare few who didn't like this flick and that was mainly because of the vulgarity. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE-Clerks IS vulgar-VULGAR, at times OBNOXES,at times CRUDE-all mixed in with edginess, unforgettable characters (many of whom are customers who make a minute or 2 appearance),constant bizare situations arising, coupled all through with an amazing tonge in cheek hilarity that's completely unique, all the while being watched in black and white. Clerks on a scale of 1-10 easily gets a 10.The only other \"young people\" comedy that I've ever appreciated at this level is \"fast times at richmond high\" and you realy can't compare the two because their 2 completely different movies.

It is only now, after 15 minutes of trying, that I realise it cannot be done.From an objective point of view this is not one of the greatest films ever made. I wouldn't even consider it Kevin Smiths finest work and I think sometimes that people overplay the importance and influence the film had in the industry in general. The humour is, at times, crude and offensive and there are serious flaws in the way in which the film was made.In spite of (and maybe even because of) this I will say that I bloody love this film. When I first watched it it had such an influence on me in both the films I watch and the humour I use. I recall watching this film in the late 1990's and laughing myself silly. I knew at the time that this was my type of film and that I would, from that day on, be a devout Kevin Smith fan.It was the first film I watched where the dialogue represented the conversations I had with friends. The humour replicated that of my peer groups - a potent mixture of sarcasm, quick one liners and outright gross out humour with a little surrealism thrown in as well. It captures and connects to a particular moment in the life of the writer, director and audience and will be a film that fans will want to come back to time and time again; it speaks volumes to each and every person that makes that connection with it.There were no inhibitions in respect of the film Smith made, either. It was done on his terms and it provides a very genuine end product.For these reasons I can look beyond the obvious flaws in production, direction and editing. I can look beyond the sometimes over crude language and the at times dreadful acting. And I can do this because I am 100% subjective and proud of it.I am happy that there are large sections of society who will not get the film, who will bemoan it for its offensiveness. To them I say yes. You are right. It is offensive, thats where the humour comes from. BUT scratch the surface a little deeper (as with all Kevin Smith films) and you will find a whole level of depth that isn't at first apparent.My happiness comes from knowing that I fall within a (relatively) elite group of 30 something film lovers who related to this film as teenagers, fell in love with the humour and understood it on the level that it was meant to be understood.To anyone who wants to hate the film, great. Go for it. Your choice entirely and (objectively speaking) I can see why that would be the case. But if you are of a certain age, have a certain outlook on life and a certain appreciation of humour then this is a must see film for you.",

            "review_title": "\"Clerks\"- The quintessential 90's slacker movie still rings true twenty years later, though its low-budget and rough presentation feel more blatant with age...",
            "content": "The 90's were a strange and unique time in American popular-culture. While mainstream, Hollywood-backed films seemed to become increasingly bogged down with trite stories and loud special effects, the world of indie-cinema was at its peak, and delivered a plethora of incredible works from incredible storytellers. It was the decade that gave us wild and imaginative minds like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, after all. And among the quality independent filmmakers to emerge from this ten year period was Kevin Smith, with his breakout hit \"Clerks.\"It's almost pointless to delve into Smith's story or the film's production, because it's a tale that has become almost legendary. But in essence, it is the tale of a typical Jersey slacker who enjoyed reading comic-books and writing comedy skits, and was eventually inspired to make a movie about the things he knew in life. That film became \"Clerks\", an award winning indie-darling that struck a chord for audiences the world over with its frank and open analysis of the life of a typical, aimless 20- something working a dead-end job while spending his time discussing life, love and pop-culture. It was one of those rare films that seemed to capture a painfully realistic slice of true life while also managing to entertain and enthrall with sharp humor and clever dialog. And it paved the way for bigger, better things for almost all involved.Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), a retail clerk at a New Jersey convenience store, is called into work on his day off. Condemned to spend the day behind the counter serving the clueless public despite his repeated cry of \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\", Dante tries to make the best of it by shooting the breeze with his carefree best friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) and wasting time discussing movies. However, a series of events throughout the day threaten to shake Dante's world, including an argument regarding his girlfriend Veronica's (Marilyn Ghigliotti) sexual past, the re- emergence of an old High School flame (the late Lisa Spoonauer), and a peculiar old man who asks to use the store's bathroom. All the while, a pair of trouble-making stoners known as \"Jay and Silent Bob\" (Jason Mewes, director Smith) cause a ruckus outside...What made \"Clerks\" work so well back in the day and what makes it continue to work more than twenty years later is the razor-sharp and wickedly clever writing on the part of Smith, in addition to stellar performances from all of our leads. Produced on a micro-budget and filmed during the night using rented equipment on 16mm black-and- white film, \"Clerks\" is most certainly not particularly pretty to look at. It's dark, gritty and dirty. But that really doesn't matter because the characters are allowed to take center-stage and shine while delivering some of the most deliciously funny and surprisingly insightful dialog imaginable. It's a movie almost exclusively about what makes the characters tick, and their interpersonal relationships, while being punctuated by laugh-out-loud gags and strong observational humor. And anyone whose worked a job where they had to serve the public will tell you... this feels just like real-life. It's absolutely sublime in how it is structured and paced, and you could swear they just filmed real people on a real work day, save for the few crazier moments peppered in to progress the plot.The cast is electrifying, giving performances that feel grounded and true. O'Halloran is endlessly engaging as our sort-of \"hero\" Dante, although the film does cleverly make him something of a troubled figure, giving him added depth. He doesn't always do good things, but we can empathize with him and recognize his struggles. Anderson frequently steals the show as the clever but often infuriating Randall Graves. Randall is that guy we all know- nothing bothers him and his attitude is strictly \"I don't give a crap.\" And yet, despite his callousness, there's still a human being underneath. Ghigliotti is charming and highly sympathetic as Dante's long- suffering but supportive girlfriend, and though her screen time is limited, she's always a welcome addition. Spoonauer's role is fascinating and unique, as she represents a sort-of idealized view of the past and future, and she does the role justice. And of course, Mewes and Smith, along with other minor characters played by friends and acquaintances of Smith, add a lot of cheeky fun. Though Jay and Silent Bob haven't been quite defined yet as characters.Unfortunately, the film is not without its fair share of issues. Much of the film feels dated in a way that does occasionally distract, especially when revisiting it after some time. It's hard to hear some of the references or see some of the settings without feeling a certain aesthetic distance. I also found that the low budget and rough-around-the-edges production is more noticeable with time, and can get in the way of some key scenes. Perhaps it's unfair, but living in a time where a $500 DSLR and a decent knowledge of lighting can produce high quality imagery that would fit right in on television... it's sometimes hard to watch older films that were so crippled by low budgets. Finally, despite Smith's keen ear for dialog... you can tell the film was written by a 20-something whose trying a bit too hard. Some of the exchanges come across as pretentious, and the inclusion of verbose, 5-dollar-words as \"chapter titles\" feels contrived.Still, that cannot diminish the fact that \"Clerks\" is an indisputable classic of its time that for the most part still rings true even to this day. The low-budget production values and occasional poor judgments in the writing can be a bit tedious, but the phenomenal performances, good humor and sharp dialog more than make up for these minor flaws. \"Clerks\" easily earns a fantastic 9 out of 10, and I still give it a very high recommendation for those who have not yet had a chance to check it out!",

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)This is an indie film (VideoHound gives a $27,575 budget) filmed in not so glorious black and white that is strikingly original, and I mean strikingly, and funny. Depicting the early twenties slacker set in suburban New Jersey a decade ago, it focuses on convenience store clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran), who is adrift in that never-never land between high school and Making Something of Himself. He still pines for his high school hottie Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), especially when he learns that his current girl friend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) has, shall we say, had intimate rocket knowledge of thirty-seven different guys, although she had sex with only three of them, including him. Ah, well, what's a snowball or two between friends?Next door to the convenience store is a video rental store clerked by Dante's best bud, Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson). Randal scares off the customers, rents his videos elsewhere and just generally slacks off and offends at all times, except when giving career and sexual advice to Dante. Hanging out outside and dealing are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). Kevin Smith also directed and wrote the script and probably did the catering and clean up as well. He is one very clever and talented dude who told it like it almost was while mildly satirizing the New Jersey denizens and the slacker mentality, but with affection and a kind of light-hearted aplomb.There's some absurdity, Caitlin making love to a dead man and not realizing he's dead, the guys playing stick ball hockey on the roof of the convenience store, Randal selling cigs to a four-year-old who lights up, etc., mixed with the pathos of making minimum wage and going nowhere, and some sight gags and a whole lot of spiffy, crude, and dead-panned one-liners. Nothing is taken too seriously, including Kevin Smith and his film, so that when they run the final credits we are pleased with this slice of indeterminate life in the Garden State.I was reminded of some other low budget films made about the same time including Bang (1995), Floundering (1994) and The Unbelievable Truth (1990), especially the latter, but none are as outrageously funny as Clerks. Incidentally, this is currently ranked in IMDb's Top 250.",

The two clerks spend most of the day dealing with annoying customers and talking about Star Wars, relationships, and sex. Of coarse, they take breaks too. They close the store so they can play hockey on the roof and then close it again to attend Dante's friend Julie's wake. Most of the movie is spent on Dante and Randal while the other half is spent on Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers that deal infront of the Quickstop. These two are the ones that provide most of the laughs. There are plenty of laughs too, but the greatest ones come from Jay. While this is not Kevin Smith's best movie, it is one worth owning.",

            "content": "Before Jersey Girl and the short run animated version of Clerks, Kevin Smith was aspiring to be a director. He had a vision of a story about two average Joes that work at a convenience store and video store in New Jersey. With $27,000 on his credit card, he forged ahead and produced one of the funniest films in cinematic history.None other than Kevin Smith could give us the story of Randall and Dante and their social commentary on everything from gatherings to Star Wars. Speaking to the nerd in all of us, these two characters embody the brilliance of the minimum-wage worker. The over educated, yet heavily under paid. They embody the workers that think that their jobs wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the customers. Like other Smith films, there is a portion of this film that will speak to anyone that has ever worked in the Customer Service field. While this is no Office Space, it does realistically create the lazy, film watching geek in all of us.The best part about this film is the words that Smith wrote that go into the mouths of Dante and Randall. Without these intelligent 'quips', this may not have been the film that it is today. I loved listening to everything that these two 'heroes' had to say. I also love repeating the lines to friends as we pass each other on the streets headed to our respective jobs (yes, I am one of those guys). In my eyes, this film represents the epitome of the 'cult' classic. Clerks, for lack of a better description, is a social commentary on our country, and everyone should enjoy the fruits of our Gods, Randall and Dante.Grade: ***** out of *****",

            "content": "It's hard not to admire a laugh-out-loud comedy that was produced on a micro-budget and has more intelligence than films that costed ten times more to make.  Kevin Smith makes an impressive debut with this wacky comedy that sticks out in people's minds and received a good cult following probably because it was...well...different.  It was original!  And though the humor is sometimes vulgar and the profanity is excessive at times, it's handled in such a smart, disciplined fashion.  Most comedy writers nowadays put vulgar material on screen and assume the audience will laugh just because it's vulgar!  It's not handled with any sense of structure.  The jokes in this movie (the confession Caitlin makes to Dante is a prime example) are handled with great structure.  Smith knows HOW to deliver a joke.One flaw that I found in this movie and Smith's upcoming movies is his use of dialogue.  Smith can definitely write great original dialogue.  But sometimes he embraces that gift a little too much.  The dialogue often works and sparks big-time laughs; other times it just doesn't flow and sounds more written than spoken.  I also thought he could've made the plot a little less implausible.  There are scenes in this movie that are based too much on coincidence, and it ruins the film's rhythm, giving it a bit of a forced plot-driven feel.  And of course some scenes are just so out of the ordinary that you just stare in awe.  The guy who checks the quality of every egg? It turns out he has a disorder only rampant among guidance counselors, because their jobs are so pathetic.  There has to be a truth to every joke, and jokes like that are just plain goofy.However, those are minor flaws, and if you consider the high-budget crap that's been thrown in our faces year by year--this movie is a masterpiece in comparison.  It's original, hilarious and smart!  How often do you get all those qualities in one comedy?So if you haven't seen \"Clerks\" yet...I suggest you check it out.  You'll have a ball.My score:  7 (out of 10)",

            "content": "Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot.Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did.The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. \"I'm 37?\" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.",

While this statement is debatable, what is NOT debatable is the fact that Smith has turned out better quality work since this.  Hughes has not improved since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. Clerks concerns a day-in-the-life of Dante and Randall, two rather sophisticated employees at the local Quik Stop.  What intelligent conversations they have!  The most intelligent my days at 7-11 ever got was who was dating who and whether or not the Red Sox would win the World Series.  BAH!  Smith certainly loves injecting pop culture whenever he can, whether bashing unbearably stupid movies (\"Ooh! Navy SEALS!\") or questioning the ethics of Star Wars in ways the George Lucas certainly never thought of.  He might not be Shakespeare and his chatter can get downright clunky, but there is no doubt that he works the ideas for all they're worth.  A lot of Randall's delivery is totally off in contrast to Dante's, maybe he should've spent less time reading porn and more time on the script.  Watch the short \"The Flying Car\" for a sample of what they are capable of concocting.Unfortunately, the story is a grab bag of ideas and images reminiscent of Kentucky Fried movie that make little sense in the long run.  By the time Smith actually tries telling a story, the audience doesn't care anymore because they are too engrossed in his little skits.Jay & Silent Bob are the highlight, but they don't have much to do until the end.  I consider this a waste of ideas and ability, but the narrative that Smith constructs with them makes up for that fact.  No wonder he always brings them back.On the technical level, this is NOT Terminator 2.  The camera is always dead-on and treats the topic as more of a stage play and less of a movie.  I will give bonus points to that.  The editing is decent, but many scenes lack the securing touch that hold them together with the rest of the movie.Overall, comedy fans should like it (as should anyone else who's tried working at a place like this), but sensitive reviewers should pass off since there is no topic or idea that Smith isn't willing to try.  Social satirists might also get a kick out of it.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",

What I found was a very interesting low budget black and white film that talks a lot about relationships, human nature and all kinds of crazy stuff. I guess the film is most notable for introducing to the world the characters Jay and Silent Bob, and if you don't know who those guys are then you're probably reading the wrong review! But more of that later, here's a short plot summary before I tell you want I really think.Dante works in a convenience store. It is his day off but his boss has called him in to cover for him. The day starts normally enough, but he can't open the main shutters because someone has put gum in the locks. His girlfriend, Veronica, comes in to see him on her way to college. She thinks he could do better and tries to persuade him to join her at college. Dante is stuck in his ways and is happy to stay at the store for the time being. After she leaves, Randal arrives to open the video rental store next door. He spends most of the day closing the video store so he can go and hang out with Dante. It transpires that Dante is still holding a torch for his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin and has recently been in touch with her. When the pair, Dante and Randal that is, discover that Caitlin is engaged to be married, things get really interesting. Throw in a hockey game on the roof, a funeral, a death and the lamest fight scene I've ever seen and that about covers it.I will admit I did find the character of Randal pretty annoying although he did talk a lot of sense in the end. The performances were pretty good although not as polished as I'm used to. So honourable mentions go to; Brian O'Halloran as Dante, Jeff Anderson as Randal, Marilyn Ghigliotti as Veronica, Lisa Spoonhauer as Caitlin, Jason Mewes as Jay and Kevin Smith as Silent Bob.Although it's not the best comedy I've seen for a while, I can see the appeal of it. There are a lot of crazy characters and some pretty good one-liners that raised a laugh or two. Over all I pretty much liked this film\u0085 I can't say exactly why, maybe it was Silent Bob's words of wisdom, but over all, it's recommended.My score: 6.7/10",

It's easy to shrug off the performances (unpolished is putting it lightly) with dialogue this pleasing and I find myself glued to the screen as the characters exchange banter; an unlikely bromance between the line-toeing Dante and the agitating Randal.\"Clerks\" is instantly relatable for anyone who's toiled in retail, it's pretty much emblematic of Gen Xers; right down to the somewhat anthemic \"I'm not even supposed to BE here today!\". As an employee, I was always Dante, and always wanted to be Randal; maybe that's the eternal conflict in every working stuff. Hell if I know.

            "content": "Clerks is a bold, bold movie. Kinda sad that people intelligent enough to appreciate it are driven away by the foul language and sex jokes, and the people worldly enough to understand it are driven away by the lack of action (\"F***ing boring, man, it's just two guys quoting Star Wars and swearing at each other at a convenience store.\"). Watching the film in either of these contexts will give you the wrong impression, for what Clerks is, more than anything, is a uniquely American take on the French art film. Not an incredibly masterful art film, mind you, but the attempt to bringing something like this to an American mass audience in perfectly serious non-parody is ambitious. What people don't understand about this movie is that it isn't just a bunch of guys doing nothing and telling dirty jokes. There's a subtext to this film--not an incredibly deep subtext, and subtle enough to go under the radar of the lowest denominator (whom, sadly, this film was marketed to), but powerful and thought-provoking nonetheless. Every seemingly pointless conversation, every seemingly irrelevant reference to oral sex contributes to the sense of ennui and despair that the protagonist Dante experiences. Everything that happens to him, every person he meets, illustrates a miserable existence in which he does little but sacrifice his own needs in order to protect empty obligations to guilt-tripping, passive-aggressive people. Dante's delinquent, happy-go-lucky foil Randal, who is in the exact same situation and quite satisfied with it, the Millerian Biff to Dante's Willy (WOOOOO! OBNOXIOUS LITERARY REFERENCE AND DOUBLE ENTENDRE!), constantly reminds Dante that he has the power to leave his thankless job, that he has the power to turn his life around--a power that Dante's complacency forbids him from exercising. It is a feeling that will hit close to home for anyone who has experienced the boredom and the meaninglessness of working in a convenience store. Crude? Yes--but that's what it's like when you're spending ten hours a day bagging groceries and self-superior ass hats are giving you crap because they have higher paying jobs. This is not a film for people who believe that people in low-paying jobs are there because they belong there, it is a film against these people.The directing style borrows from New Wave auteur Jean-Luc Goddard's bag of tricks; the extremely long takes, little camera movement, black and white film stock, minimum of sets, and occasional jump cut create a feeling of ennui and despair absolutely forbidden by go-go-action-action keep-the-lowest-denominator-on-their-toes Hollywood. The sick jokes and nasty humor are more than mere character development; they build the tension of the movie and drive it along at a leisurely pace. Dialogue, not action, drives this film, and the abusively friendly relationship between Dante and Randal is one of the most interesting and genuine Hollywood friendships since Riggs and Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon--no small feat for Brian O'Holleran (Dante) and Jeff Anderson (Randal), who pull through in spades, portraying an absolutely convincing pair of convenience store workers fresh out of college. This film hits you right in the gut--it is the cold, hard reality of the American working class told in the authentically crude language of the working class, told in possibly the most pretentiously inaccessible format ever. France has always chided America for not understanding subtlety. It's a shame they were right.Four stars out of five.",

            "content": "When one looks at Clerks, it's pretty easy to realize that it's a bit overrated. It's not to say it is a bad movie, but considering how much respect and a cult it has created in its wake, it seems a bit too much. The film was a major hit in the '94 Sundance. I guess people were captivated that a man who worked in a convenience store was able a movie greater than most people make in the entire career.Now don't a Shakeperean story here. It tells the story of Dante Hicks (Brain O'Halloran), your everyday clerk whose brought in on his day off. Throughout the day, he and his best friend/worst enemy/co-worker Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) several obstacles in a greatly monotonous job. This includes screwed up customers, girlfriends, and stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Director/Writer Kevin Smith).What probably got to audience the most was the film's no-hold bars, raunchy dialog that threatened it with NC-17 rating. Kevin Smith holds no qualms in creating some of most sexual-explicit situations in film history. Many times it feels forced and over the top, usually putting me in an uncomfortable place.That being said though, Smith is able to write some amazing characters. In most days, studios and filmmakers try to usually to cram the films characters down our throats so by the end of the day, we're suppose to feel for them. Smith doesn't do that. He just lets the characters play out, putting them situations that relate to the audience. These situations include be stuck in a dead-end job, yet never having the courage to leave and start a real-life. Smith makes us feel whatever we want to feel for the characters, which they're usually soon in the positive light.The film's looks is also something to be admired. Usually, independent films pride themselves for their artistic vision. The opposite could be said for Clerks. The movie is so artistically challenged it gives it a grainy, poor look that puts the audience in a world unlike most others.While not nearly worth the years of hype, Clerks remains a wonderful and nicely done comedic-farce.",

Getting the idea of \"I can do that\" from Slackers, he went out and did what he knew best and what he had access- an advice that Robert Rodriguez gave out to young filmmakers. Although surely also to older ones - no age shaming here.That being said, almost everyone could identify with the characters here. Either because many worked in similar jobs or at least knew the enviroment - to put it mildly. Now the main focus here are the dialogs and the \"jokes\" sometimes just visual. The dialog though does contain a lot of vulgar language ... you may have issues with that. Because while there is no nudity to speak of, there is a lot of sex talk. Including some very graphic descriptions ... if you have issues with that, the movie will very much offend you.The target audience loved it though ... they felt represented on screen. I do not condone certain things that are being done or said here, but for the movies sake I have to admit, they work quite nicely. There is a reason the movie still holds a very special place in many peoples hearts ... and Kevin Smith is such a loveable nerd - it's almost impossible to not like this.

Brian O'Halloran isn't bad at all, but the rest of the actors are terrible (no fault) and have obviously in many cases not learned their lines (no excuse). The writing is only fair at best - sometimes funny, often dull, frequently obviously \"writing.\"It's interesting to contrast this with another zero-budget personal film, Mark Borchardt's \"Coven.\" Borchardt has a surprisingly good visual sense and is a much more imaginative writer, but he apparently doesn't have the personal organization or support to pull off directing a feature-length film.

            "content": "Clerks. is the debut film from Kevin Smith, an independent film that came out of nowhere in 1994 and made Kevin Smith an icon in the indie scene. The film is shot in black and white, is very low budget and reeks of first film production values. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.Running just over an hour and half, the story concerns two employees of a convenience and video rental store, Randal and Dante, respectively. Taking place over one day, it begins with Randal being coerced into work on his day off. What follows is less of a plot and more a series of vignettes that tell the story that unfolds. Hockey, sex, smoking, drugs, death, the doll drum of life, the predictability and annoyance of work, friendship, love, and lots and lots of cussing make for one funny movie.The humor is really what makes Clerks. work. Smith's writing is on fire, hilarious, realistic and on the nose. Some of the dialogue is destined to, and has become classic. Trying not to give anything away, remember these words (for those who have not seen this movie yet): 37 and Star Wars. The writing and humor, as mentioned is the strongest part of Clerks., so take that away and what are we left with?Super low budget, almost student film like, Clerks. actually at times feels like a student film. The acting is, not bad, but not great. The editing, pretty doldrum. In fact, the editing makes the acting seem stilted to a certain degree. The cast gives it their all, Jeff Anderson, who plays Dante, is laugh out loud funny but like the rest of the leads, he comes off as slightly amateurish. Jason Mewes (Jay) and Kevin Smith (Silent Bob) fare the best, while not Oscar worthy they are the only two that move past the 'film-school' sense of acting and possess a sense of 'skill'.Not that the rest of the acting is horrendous by any means, but what can you expect when a film is made by a few guys straight out of film school. As I said before, the editing is rather ho hum, with glaring inconsistencies, bad jump cuts and very slight issues with pacing. The film could maybe be trimmed by a few minutes, but for the life of me, thinking back on it, I can't think of what. It just seemed a tad sluggish.Another issue is Smith's directing. A word to describe the direction of Clerks. is: Static. That's right, static. What do I mean? Well, like the story, where not much is happening, so to is the direction of the film. The camera rarely moves, the people rarely move, and the action rarely moves from one location; everything is still, there is no flow, there is no sense of style, again the word to use is static. It's almost as if Smith just pointed the camera and shot, making the direction seem cold and rigid.Now don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. It was original, and funny. Very funny. I watched this for the first time two days ago (Feb. 12/2012) and enjoyed it immensely. I thought the writing was superb, and although there is not much of a story, I was compelled to the end, laughing all the way. The writing really does elevate this movie to higher place.The static direction, choppy editing and 'film-school' acting was a mild deterrent, as was the ever so slightly sluggish pace. But Clerks. screenplay is so good you forget about those problems for most of the film. If you want to laugh for an hour and a half, you can't go wrong with Clerks.Film Rating: 70%Breakdown (How Clerks. scored 70%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 7 out of 10 Re-playability: 9 out of 10 Originality: 9 out of 10 Directing: 5 out of 10 Editing: 5 out of 10 Script: 10 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Sound: 6 out of 10 Music: 6 out of 10",

            "content": "Clerks is the one film that put Kevin Smith on the map--whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, that is for you to decide. With an extremely low budget and a cast of actors and actresses that for the most part had no acting experience whatsoever, it was amazing that the film was made and is as popular amongst the indie crowd as it is today. Grossing over 3 million dollars at the box office, soon it would launch a wave of lower-budget movies about people and their jobs and the lives that intertwines with it, most notably Office Space and Waiting. Unfortunately, I was unable to see what the big fuss is about with Clerks. While it is mildly entertaining, there are much better low-budget films out there with better dialogue and more humor. It's quite an achievement to get so much success when considering how little he had to work with, but aside from that it was a rather mediocre film.Dante is this low self-esteem, bitter, unappreciative clerk that has to fill in for someone else while his boss sneaks away to another state. As the day progresses, a large series of events adds and subtracts from his obviously-gloomy mood, ranging from his girlfriend's past, to his ex-girlfriend getting married, to a hockey game gone wrong, and more. Dante is joined by his sly, fast-talking Randal and outside the store is the odd yet inseparable duo Jay and Silent Bob that offers a few interesting moments. Throughout the film Dante and Randall try to figure out things that happened in the past, why they work such awful jobs, and also argue as to which Star Wars movie had the better ending.With little money and few places to film, the movie relies pretty much all on the dialogue and the interaction amongst the characters. Clerks is a mixed bag in multiple ways: the movie is a mix of comedy and a bit of drama, and also sometimes the movie is very smart and very funny, and at other times it's just a bit of a bore. Jay and Silent Bob really aren't that big of a deal in this film, especially when compared to Dogma. Dante's personality is quite annoying, he is always nagging, complaining, whining, and really doesn't give the actor much to work with. Randall on the other hand, provides the best lines, provides the best laughs, and also seems to have the most fun in the film. His moments in the video rental place where he works are priceless, as he takes no bull from the customers and just doesn't care.While the females in the film do not get much screen time, they are available for the biggest laugh and the most depressing moment. Marilyn Ghigliotti (I list this actresses' name because I was most impressed by her performance) as Veronica provides a wonderful monologue basically putting Dante in his place after discovering something that he was going to do. Meanwhile, Caitlin, Dante's ex-girlfriend winds up doing something so unexpected and off the wall; it will throw you off for quite a bit. Either way, it's a hit-or-miss movie, and this does indeed hit for some laughs and some thought-provoking scenes but then sort of misses with jokes that weren't' funny or repetitive quotes or pointless dancing.Bottom Line: Not as good as everyone makes it out to be, but it is indeed a film that gives filmmakers with no money hope that someday they'll make it big without needing a ridiculously large budget. The acting was very good for inexperienced actors, the writing was pretty clever, but there isn't much more going for it after that. Being in the quick service industry, I could relate to it a little, but at other times Clerks just sounded like a long complaint captured on film.

There is also a spot of necrophelia in there somewhere! You just don't know what is going to happen next, or what sort of lunatic is going to walk in through the door and harass Dante. \"I'm not even suppose to be here today!\" Becomes his mantra before long. This guy just can't catch a break, but he does himself no favours. To add torment to what was supposed to be his day off, he finds himself caught in a love-triangle between his current girlfriend and his ex.

            "content": "Clerks is a great way to kill 90 minutes. It's a hilarious, and very addicting movie that can be watched over and over. Kevin Smith is easily my favorite filmmaker, and I doubt that anyone will ever top him. Kevin Smith, as you may have heard, is a master with dialogue, writing some of the funniest, most insightful and quotable dialogue you'll ever hear. Made on a budget that would only allow such a thing, Clerks is barely anything more than a series of conversations.The whole movie is a day in the life of a video store clerk, and a convenience store clerk. Over the day, they discuss many things (sex), play hockey on the roof of the store, deal with, and occasionally dis the many jackass customers. One of the best bits in this film is at the beginning when a customer talks a bunch of other customers out of buying cigarettes, by showing them a blackened lung. I dare you not to laugh when his true intentions are revealed. There is a hilarious discussion about Star Wars, which proposes a question never answered in the series, and never asked in here. Some of the conversations are extremely sexual. I won't go into detail, but let me just say, you'll snicker every time you hear the number \"37.\" The main characters are some of the best ever created. Dante is a total straight guy who just wants to be responsible. He wants to do something with his life, but completely avoids it. He's an everyman who has almost constant problems with women, and is clearly full of stuff he'd like to say to many people. But his judgment is so good, that he lies about how he really feels, hoping to avoid trouble whenever possible. The reason it often wouldn't be possible is due to the other guy, Randall, who says what's on his mind, and frequently gets Dante into trouble. He is one of the funniest characters ever created (especially the exaggerated version of him in the animated series). He mouths off to customers, abuses his authority, and constantly closes his store to talk to Dante. Strangely enough, as stupid as Randall comes off, he is actually very insightful about many things, actually more than Dante. His speech toward the end about how pointlessly pessimistic Dante is is absolutely brilliant. Dante represents who most of us are, and Randall represents the person most of us wish we had the guts to be. If it were socially acceptable, the world would be plagued with people like Randall. I'll bet even Dante has the mentality of Randall deep down. For a low budget film about people going to work and talking, these characters are very deep, and very well developed, probably among the most well developed characters ever created. That right there, is what makes Kevin Smith so brilliant. He can take no substance, and turn it into substance with his characters.Clerks is a truly outstanding, and inspirational film, that can be watched over and over, and you'll never get tired of it, as long as this kind of movie appeals to you.Clerks is rated R for Extensive Use of Extremely Explicit Sex-Related Dialogue and Strong Language.

The situations might be played up but anyone that's ever been in a retail space can tell you this level of nonsense absolutely happens. To paraphrase MIB, \"The person is smart, people are stupid\" and there are a lot of people in the world. What always amazes me is the simplicity of this movie. It's made on a nearly nonexistent budget with an, at the time, unheard of director and his buddies playing the parts but it's so smartly done. They was Smith uses his limitations in his favor rather than letting them impede the process. He might not have had the best actors but there's a reality to what's happening and the dialogue is on point. I have absolutely sat around in a store and had conversations with coworkers on par with the Death Star discussion.Overall, I love this movie and I do think this is one that everyone should really check out if they've missed it. As Office Space was the rallying cry film for office workers, Clerks is the unifying movie for retail personnel. It's a perfect indie movie and definitely worth the time.",

            "content": "Clerks seems to stand in everyones minds as one of the best comedies of the 90's. A debut for not only Kevin Smith at director but also the View Askewniverse in films. Clerks is what got everything started for Smith and in my opinion remains as his best work of comedy to date (with Mallrats in a very close second). Just that freshness the first I saw it enters my mind every time I manage to catch Clerks on television. Clerks remains as a great comedy.Filmed in all black and white, Clerks follows the day of Dante Hicks, a clerk at a New Jersey convenience store, and his pal Randal Graves, who is the laid back clerk at the neighboring movie store. It follows mostly Dante as he worries about his relationships, confronts strange customers, and takes his job too seriously. Randal stands by as the other main character who often times convinces Dante to take chances. Randal proves to be the funnier of the two with his sick humor, laid back personality, and little care for anyone beside his close friend Dante.Brian O'Halloran makes his film debut as Dante. Brian makes Dante out to be exactly what he is suppose to be. Too uptight, always a push over, and always unsure on what to do in life with himself and his relationship. O'Halloran isn't exactly funny, he is more of the set up guy for Randal whenever he is in the scene or the bearer of the comedy from most of the characters. Needless to say he causes few laughs but his serious face is needed for the other characters to bring the comedy in scenes.Also making their film debut is Jeff Anderson as the ever hilarious and now famous, Randal Graves. Anderson portrays perfectly the typical slacker. Randal rarely cares what is going on, even when he is at his job. He watches out for Dante but rarely cares about anyone else. Anderson is hilarious as Dante just based on how relaxed he is when he says things, even the most disturbing parts he is laid back and says it as if he is constantly thinking it. Anderson is the man of many laughs in Clerks and without him as Randal, no doubt the film would have failed.Being as the film is the first for practically everyone in the cast and crew it is amazing the amateurism did not show. The camera work is steady and solid, the writing is superb, and the setting (a convenience store for 99% of the movie) is perfect. The film introduces the now famous Jay and Silent Bob who harass passer-byers and deal drugs. Most of the cast will not be recognized but they are amazing. For a film that only cost $27,000 USD to film, it goes down as an amazing comedy.The major turn off for most who do not like the film is its obscene humor and various explicit sexual references. People remember this is not a kids film, keep kids away and you'll have no problem. The comedy is not slapstick humor, it is mostly laid back humor written in such a way that a person will never see the joke coming. What long stands out in my mind as the genius of this film is Caitlin Bree and the bathroom though I won't reveal anymore. Just watch this film. You will not regret it.4.5/5 stars",

But after watching it many more times, it does dawn on a viewer that a lot of things are amiss in this movie. First there is the acting, where nearly ever character has at least one take (that made the final cut) where they have a noticeable pause because they either (A)forgot their line (B)got tongue tied on the dialogue Kevin Smith wrote up. The dialogue itself is the second major flaw in this movie. It's really hard to count this as a definite flaw when it does so much for the movie, but at the same time it is obvious that cons of the dialogue: (A)covering too much essential material too briefly (B)statements that are too long and elaborate for the given actors to do them justice (C)unrealistic detail and stream of conscious in the character's statements; out-weigh the positive aspects: (A)humorous anecdotes and tangents expressed through tirades (B)unique character interaction. This is not to say in any way that this movie is poor, but these attribute bring it considerably below the mark of 7.9 that IMDb voters have given it.",

            "content": "Clerks is Kevin Smith's first feature film and, in my opinion, his best so far. With this movie, he inaugurates the so-called View-Askew universe, whose places and characters will be present in many of his later movies. View Askew is the production house behind most of his following flicks, and it is formed by none other than Smith himself, and Scott Mosier, who we see in Clerks appearing as Snowball. At the time of shooting, Smith used to actually work at the convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey depicted in the film. He worked at Quick Stop during the day, and filmed Clerks at night, so that, for the three weeks necessary to shoot, he was getting something like one hour sleep each night. The main characters impersonate that kind of comic-books and mainstream sci-fi movie fanatic, who will be present in many of his films, and is quite common in real life, as the nerd type. The roughness of the film, resulting from the low budget, which Smith managed somehow to put together himself, is definitely an attractive factor; in fact, stripped of all the pretence, and apparently nonplussed by the minimal scenery and (sometimes) heavily improvised props, the acting flows beautifully and the jokes acquire that much depth. We can appreciate more the directive skills of Kevin as a one-man filmmaker, and his ingeniousness, considering he also wrote the screenplay, and appeared in the movie as Silent Bob, the grumpy and taciturn partner of Jay, who dispenses gems of wisdom the few times he actually speaks. The black-and-white assigns lyricism to some of the scenes; for instance when Jay and Silent Bob dance at the sound of their ghetto-blaster, while Dante talks to Kaitlin inside the store. All in all, Clerks is a witty and ruthless comedy about anti-conformism, friendship and youth, where the diverseness of the characters helps us to grasp what actually are their common grounds, and appreciate the film that much more.",

            "content": "\"Clerks\" is a 1994 comedy written and directed by Kevin Smith starring Brian O'Hallorann and Jeff Anderson. I definitely know who Kevin Smith is and what major role he plays in the modern pop culture, but aside from his small role in \"Die Hard 4.0\" I've never actually come around watching his other films, especially his directorial works. After learning that this movie inspired Jason Reitman, who literally \"grew up on the set of Ghostbusters\" to become a director himself, I knew that this flick must be special in it's one way. I'm anything but disappointed with the outcome, because this film is the perfect example for cinematic minimalism. It can't be denied that it is a cheap production with an extremely low budget, but it's outstanding that it still manages to reach greatness. In this case it's the credit of Kevin Smith's excellently written screenplay that makes this flick what it is. Every single line of dialogue that's delivered in the course of the runtime has sheer and quick-witted brilliance in it. They are absolutely snappy and full of sarcasm and absurdity, but all the while never leave the extraordinarily high level of intelligence. Another achievement of the witty writing are the absolutely loveable and sympathetic main characters who definitely could exist like that in reality. Dante is totally relatable with his indecisiveness and carries the audience with his absentminded nature. Oh, and then there's Randal. With a friend like him you don't need enemies, no kidding. He appears to be an immeasurably incapable sociopath who still manages to live his life happily and hands down, at times says the absolute truth that's shaped by his own destructive world view and odd philosophy. But it's what makes it so enjoyably fascinating. The themes illuminated on this flick are mostly perverse and geeky, but conclusive and comprehensible at the same time without going into a too infantile direction. The plot is a loose adaptation of the Dante Alighieri story (no, seriously!) and is constructed episodically, into scenes that gave me the same feeling as classic sketches at time and honestly, gave me some of the most genuine laughs I've ever laughed in my entire life. It has running gags, one liners and hilarious situation comedy that totally match my sense of humour. It's also notable that it even features some more serious tone that gave the characters even more depth in the end. Smith knows how to create unique characters, without a doubt. I think this film had such an immense impact simply due to the fact that it examines so many important aspects of the lives of simple men, in this case hard working but underpaid desk clerks. It's a film from the simple people for the simple people. All in all, this minimalistic gem proves that a brilliant screenplay is all it might take to produce an iconic comedic gem. It's inspiring and relatable and matches my type of humour and is one of the most hilarious and original comedy flicks I've watched in the recent months. Absolutely funny experience I hoped will not be damaged by the sequel. Till then I enjoy it even more!",

We follow him and his various encounters over the course of this day.This is the debut film of writer/director Kevin Smith. It's probably the best film of his that I've seen but in all honesty, I haven't liked any of them. This one is much like the others, yet has some charm and sense of place which I felt gave it some plus points. Shot on grainy black and for the tiny budget of $27,000, it truly is a small-scale affair that made an impact. As such it quickly developed a cult reputation with the slacker generation who empathised with its two central characters Dante and Randall. One of my main beefs with the film is that the latter character is played by Jeff Anderson who is truly one of the most horrible actors I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Every appallingly delivered line by him was like a low to medium strength punch to my face. And bad acting is something that I am generally ambivalent about, I mostly don't even notice it but Anderson really was so biscuit-takingly dreadful that it made me feel moderately unwell. The film's main strength is its script which does show some ambition on Smith's part but I felt it was mostly much less funny than it thought it was and some of the humour was downright rubbish. Overall though the production does have a certain ambiance and real-life feel which was its main positives I would say. It was followed up with other films which also featured the two, inexplicably popular characters Jay and Silent Bob, two examples being Mallrats (1995) and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), both of which I thought were banal and quite terrible. Clerks was better than those, which is faint praise but praise none-the-less.",

And the script sometimes focuses to much on...nothing that it almost becomes intolerable to watch. Not even the directing is that good in this movie, but I think I speak for all Smith fans when I say that we are willing to forget and forgive most of this when it comes to clerks.Making a movie about two guys talking crap behind the counter of a quickstop is a very original and funny idea, but Smith does not pull this of all the way. He focuses to much on duologue, duologue that you know is very rehearsed, every line is presented with the utter most perfection which makes it less believable. But not all of it is bad, as I said before the idea is very original and some of the jokes really made me laugh.And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive.

Brian O'Halloran's Dante and Jeff Anderson's Randal are two of the most interesting characters you'll ever come by, especially Randal, who delivers a great and moving monologue at the end that is great for any actor to study.

Smith's first film, often times very funny, but tends to drag on a bit and some of the acting is slightly bland. Some laugh out loud moments, such as the offscreen sexual encounter between the main character's ex-girlfriend and...well, I won't spoil it for you. But offscreen is indeed where it belongs once we find out the messy details. The big-screen debut of Jay and Silent Bob, who play drug dealers who spend their days outside the stores (but business seems to be very bad). Originally rated NC-17 for sexually explicit dialogue.

So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250.If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality!Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all.People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction.Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies.Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy",

This guy Kevin Smith comes out of nowhere with this cheaply made film that he financed himself and knocks the socks off the indie world, while taking some prizes at Cannes \u0096 it was everything that any of us had (and still in some ways do) dreamed of.  Remarkably, until now, 10 years later, I had only seen bits and pieces of it, though I had (unfortunately) sat through his next three films.Watching Clerks was like being in film school again.  The grainy black and white cinematography, the horrible acting (by actors who, for the most part, had no prior film experience) and the general feeling of near chaos that accompany a student film.  What sets the film apart however, is the incredible script.  Even when dished out by less than great actors, this script is a punchy plethora of pop culture delivered with rapid-fire pacing. I am a huge fan of Kevin Smith because in my opinion, he is a Gen X version of Martin Scorsese in that he doesn't just make films, he lives and breathes them, and seems to enjoy furthering film education.  Unfortunately, while I respect Kevin Smith the man, I'm not a fan of his films post-Clerks. (Although I did really enjoy the short-lived Clerks animated series.) Clerks, however, shows raw talent and is definitely a ground breaking piece of work that was and probably continues to serve as inspiration to fledgling filmmakers and film geeks alike.  --Shelly",

Some of the humor in this film is genuinely funny and actually quite hilarious, but some of it is just the same gross-out jokes that you've seen in numerous other films these days.  I'm not sure why the film was made in black and white, but I guess the director has his reasons. (Cheaper maybe?)The story (or lack thereof) is pretty interesting, and as far as I can tell, pretty original.  As I mentioned above, there are some great scenes in the film, for instance; I love the conversation between Dante and Randal about the Star Wars Death Star and which film is better, \"Empire\" or \"Jedi\". Great stuff!Some of the acting is sub-par and obviously scripted, but at other times, the acting is quite good.  For the most part, the actors all did a fine job.The characters in the film are mostly pretty interesting, and well done.  I really liked the characters of Dante Hicks, Randal Graves and Silent Bob. Veronica and Caitlin were ok too, but nothing special there.  Personally, I can't stand Jay, or maybe it's the actor Jason Mewes, I'm not sure.  I know he's supposed to be annoying, but he's just too annoying for me.  He can't keep from swearing an absurd amount of times, has no respect for anyone and is incapable of making a funny joke.  Silent Bob is great, only Kevin should find a new side-kick for him.  Some of the other (insignificant) characters were just plain stupid in my opinion.  The one I have in mind is the \"Perfect Dozen of Eggs\" guy.  What the heck was with that?  DUMB!  Not only was the idea for the character dumb, but the character looked stupid as well.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone.  I'd probably first recommend watching some of Kevin Smith's later films (\"Mallrats\", \"Chasing Amy\", and \"Dogma\") and if you like any of those films, then give this one a shot.  If you don't like any of those I seriously doubt you are going to like \"Clerks\".  Well, in any case, thanks for reading.  I hope you enjoy the film should you see it.-Chris",

Needless to say, Clerks is legendary for starting both Kevin Smith's film career and its comically low budget which amounts to less than 30k. Thankfully though, Smith is able to achieve exactly what he needs to throughout the film to make it work, making for an oddly entertaining and subtle little comedy masterpiece. It has its flaws from time to time, it may talk a little too much about sex at times, and it can be a bit heavy handed- but it also proves to be quite a brilliant satire on the mundane and average working class of the world- and somehow manages to make it fun and interesting as well. The actors throughout are pretty good, my favorite of the bunch being Jeff Anderson as Randal- who can seem a bit one note at times- but has enough charm to spare. Brian O'Halloran also provides a good performance, and the two have a great chemistry throughout the flick. In the end, Clerks is a rather brilliant comedy that shows that not only anyone can make a movie, but with enough dedication, anyone can make a good movie too.My Rating: 9.5/10.",

Throughout the course of the day, they meet some strange customers and endure some crazy experiences. And things get even crazier for Dante when problems with his current girlfriend coincide with a renewed relationship with his ex.Kevin Smith is an extremely divisive personality in the film world \u2013 he is either lovingly (and sometimes obsessively) revered, or treated with a lot of disdain. I fall somewhere in between, mainly because I thought 'Chasing Amy' was just alright and really enjoyed 'Dogma'. And, truth be told, I decided to watch 'Clerks' because this was seen as the quintessential Kevin Smith movie. If you like 'Clerks', you'll probably be a Kevin Smith fan.Well, I did not like 'Clerks'.Now let me preface this by saying that, at times, this movie is very funny. Kevin Smith is very good at writing dialogue, something he proved in his later films but had nailed from the beginning. Some of the conversations in the film are so fun to listen to, mainly for their zippy nature and outrageous subject matter. Pretty much everyone working on the movie are Smith's friends, and that chemistry is so evident in the scenes. You can feel the fun on screen.But that's also the inherent problem with 'Clerks' \u2013 it's so ridiculously self-indulgent. A lot of Smith's friends aren't very good actors. Jason Mewes is a cult legend but he's not very good. Same goes for Jeff Anderson. The Randal character is a great one, don't get me wrong; but someone with better acting abilities could have really made it spectacular. Tellingly, the two best actors in the film (O'Halloran and Ghigliotti) are not part of that friendship group.Another issue with 'Clerks' is that it's written for a particular generation. Smith was writing about himself and his friends, those young people living in 1990s New Jersey. So if you were young at that time, 'Clerks' was extremely relatable. But, in 2013, maybe not so much, especially if you're from England. While I'm able to appreciate that films can be good without necessarily speaking to me, the films need to be good.As a blueprint for what came later in Kevin Smith's filmography, this was a perfectly acceptable movie. You can see how the experiences on 'Clerks' has inspired what he does now. But as a film in its own right, the film is nowhere near as good as some people make it out to be. It's also definitely not the legendary cult movie it has seemingly become. I wouldn't say watching 'Clerks' was a waste of time; it was a disappointment though.",

Getting almost no sleep between working and filming, Smith shot his movie in 21 days (or rather, nights) straight.Clerks was the result.There simply aren't movies being created quite like this anymore \u2013 funny, smart, grounded \u2013 And even if there are similar works, they're nowhere near as high in the ranks as this cult hit. Smith's writing is so naturally clever and gritty that it's undeniably a classic, worthy of all it's praise and critical acclaim.Throughout the movie there is a sense of realness, all of the characters are genuine and believable. Having worked with customers myself, I can absolutely tell that Smith was writing from experience. The silly questions, blindness and stupidity of people that can occur when working in such environments consistently shines over numerous occasions during the perfectly bookended screenplay.Due to the incredibly modest budget, the movie was shot on black-and-white film, and edited together roughly. But this only adds to the realism and gives the movie its personality. A few of the characters were also played by Smith's family members, which is barely noticeable unless you were told beforehand. Others will go on to return in future instalments in the View Askewniverse including Clerks II (and Clerks III in 2018).All of the actors do a brilliant job and really bring the story to life, regardless of how simple it is. Highlighting O'Halloran and Anderson in their wonderful portrayals of Dante and Randal, which are my favourite characters by far. Smith features in a smaller role as Silent Bob, who also returns in future Askewniverse projects, as he subtly steps back and allows everyone else to take the stage.The music used in between various scene breaks is thankfully fitting and seamlessly matches the characteristics of our main leads. It's also interesting to read that Clerks is one of the few movies in which the cost of obtaining the rights for the music was higher than the overall production costs.Verdict; Clerks is a must-watch comedy cult-classic, which focuses on the very mundane lives of those working in convenience stores, in the most perfect way possible. This is one of Kevin Smith's finest pieces of work.Clerks \u2013 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (9/10)",

Basically most of the action takes place and outside of the Quick Stop convenience store in New Jersey, with clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) called in to work on his day off, Saturday, and his fellow clerk friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) working in the video store next door always bothering his customers. Dante is not just undedicated to his job, but he is having numerous problems crop up on this day, such as his current girlfriend Veronica Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) bugging him with college plans, and admitting to giving thirty seven guys blowjobs in the past, but doesn't count it as getting with them. There is also his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer), who he may still love, getting married, the store shutters stuck, a scheduled game of hockey at 2 o'clock, it is the last day he has to attend the wake of a dead ex-girlfriend, and having to deal with unintelligent customers. But more than anything what is the biggest problem for Dante is that that he is not meant to be there at all, hence the phone calls asking for a replacement, and having to take the blame for unintentionally selling a child cigarettes, which he did without noticing. With the encouragement of Randal, he does bend the rules a little in order to do what he needs to and have a bit of a better day, of course he still has his complaints and negative attitude to many things. Throughout the day, outside the convenience store, we also see stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith, also writing, producing and editing) doing their usual marijuana dealing, and Jay doing most of the talking about his womanising and other dirty talk, Silent Bob only speaks rarely with wisdom and one liners (that's in the other Smith films too). The film ends with Dante forced to work the entire day shift at Quick Stop, with Vernoica angrily breaking up with him having found out about his feelings towards ex Caitlan, but he says he will try to talk her back later, and Randal leaves with him to flip the \"closed\" sign. Also starring Ernest O'Donnell as Rick Derris and Kimberly Loughran as Heather Jones. Besides Jay and Silent Bob, who obviously became more and more popular in continuous Smith films, O'Halloran and Anderson make a fantastically funny duo as they ramble and discuss various meaningless or opinionated topics, such as sex, food prices, more sex, videos, even more sex, Star Wars, and lots more sex. The film is built up on a brilliantly witty, dry, and sometimes wincing script, the blowjob discussion and Star Wars chat are definitely the highlights, the black and white somehow adds to the affective feel, but there are the sensitive moments as well, so all in all it adds up to a wonderful comedy masterpiece.

Called into work on his day off he spends his time talking to the slacker video store clerk, Randal, and his girlfriend, Veronica, daydreaming about his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin, playing roller-hockey and generally trying to be responsible while all those around him are not. Then there's the local drug-dealers, Jay and Silent Bob...Writer-director Kevin Smith's first movie...and what a debut it is. Hilariously funny at times with some very clever dialogue, skits and turns-of-events. A wry look at everyday life. Some pretty cool random scenes too (generally involving Jay and Silent Bob).Good performances from all involved, none of whom were name-actors at the time (and none of them have really made it big since, which is surprising).Only downside is that there is a fair sprinkling of juvenile humour and this cheapens the movie. It is also a bit disappointing when Smith has to resort to cheap/shock-value laughs when the rest of the humour is so intelligent.",

The black-and-white presentation doesn't really add much as an artistic device, the crappy garage band music doesn't really fit, and the dialog is too rushed. This film has its moments and is definitely worth renting once, but this is one of the most overrated films ever. The dialog goes by unnaturally fast, as if both people in the conversation had a magic eight ball and already knew what the other person was going to say. It's very hard to pull off a movie that's mostly talk and little action...Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs barely pulled it off, while this one doesn't. This hour and a half movie crawled by and doesn't really have a sense of pacing, something which all the money in the world can't fix.

The long dialogues were sharp but delivered like high schoolers (or worse) practicing for a school play. I could almost see the script in Randall's hand as he spoke (he spoke like he was reading it straight from the script). I tried to forget the bad acting -- really, I did. It was hard work. But I couldn't make it through.\nThe actors who played the customers (who only got a couple of minutes of air time) were much better than the stars of the film.I'm going to try Kevin Smith's other movies next.

Kevin Smith is a god.Being a student of film I love the way Kevin Smith uses what some people may call useless banter to pull his plot and characters together. He also uses it to deconstruct several social flaws. He is not ashamed to do this and it is not a hidden agenda, it's just there in your face. Yes there are sophmorish hijinks in this film as there are in all great comedy's, but that is not all this film is or ever will be. Every time I watch this film I think I may have gleaned yet something more, that I didn't see before.And as a side note if you haven't seen this film before and plan on doing so now, go rent all the Kevin Smith movies, no buy them.

With a hockey game at two, and his girlfriend still hacking him about going to back to school, Dante begins to get into a bigger frenzy when he learns his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin, is getting married. With his always late accomplice Randall strolling in to work at the video store, Dante is left with no choice but to bend the rules a little with work, customers, and most of all his love life. But can he get away with it all........Even though I didn't laugh once during the movie, I still found it to be a pretty humour out insight to the banality and mundaity of being part of a working class pecking order, doing the same thing day in, day out, but all the while knowing that you were supposed to be something better than what you are now, even though you can't be bothered to do anything about it.But here, what only adds fuel to Dantes and Randalls metaphorical fire, is the moronic and ignorant attitude of the customers that they face every day. And believe me, Smith has hit the nail on the head here with his depiction of customers, because no matter how intellectually superior you are to the customers, or your management, they still pay your wages, so like it or lump it.The black and white film stock makes the film feel even more grimy and mundane than their working lives, and this only adds to the overall feel to the film.I know, well everyone knows that it was a small budgeted film with lots of Smths friends at hand to help, but some of the acting is disgraceful, and really takes you out of the coherence of the narrative.The worst offender is O'Halloren, but only at the beginning. The scene where he falls out of the cupboard has to be one of the worst opening shots in the history of cinema, and it could have easily killed the film.But Smith has given us a beautifully written, and spot on look at everyday life of the working class.",

Warning, the acting can be annoying on watching it again so it is better to look at it as adding to the clerks questionable character. I have the soundtrack, mainly for the great version of \"Go your own way\". It also makes me chuckle at the sound clips from the movie. Smith's labour of love definitely made an impression on me - it was shown on Sky movies during an independent movie slot (used to be every Sunday night I think). This movie made me pay out hard-earned cash, mainly for that slot. Also, I seen Dogma in NYC the day it was released..there was a great atmosphere, almost like a big sporting event so obviously Smith's films have done extremely well from these humble beginnings. I think Smith may have decided to make his later movies more mainstream. However, they all share an interesting slice of life, his view askew.

            "content": "Around 20 or so years ago I watched the low budget, unconventional and in many ways innovative independent film Clerks. I think I was about 18 at the time and I remember thinking very highly of it. I laughed a lot.20 years later I gave Kevin Smith's cult debut a re-watch - This came after recently watching MallRats for the very first time - And frankly, I thought that was utter garbage and was surprised it was Smith's following film. I had to see how Clerks held up now - Was it still that hilarious ingenious ride, I remembered it being?Conclusion: Well... No.That's not to say I still didn't see a lot of its imaginative and insightful components. It is still a relevant film to this day and maintains buckets of sharp-witted dialogue. The DEATH STAR conversation is timeless - For me, easily the pearl moment of the film. Most of Smith's dialogue in his debuting script is clever and insightful - so kudos for that.However - I didn't enjoy the film anywhere near as much this time. That will no doubt have a lot to do with me being 20 years older. Nearly all of Smith's work has an immature vibe to it, and Clerks is no different. Also 20 years ago this film was original and fresh which is of course it doesn't have going for it now.The budget - That also brings the film down, some what now. Its a shame, because the film is still a staggering achievement for the shoe-string it was made on. The film couldn't afford any established actors, and whilst the leads do a decent job, the lack of professional acting, soon becomes prevalent - and at times, takes away the films authenticity.On the subject of authenticity - Some of the scenarios in the film are damn right ridiculous. Most notably the scene where Caitlin MISTAKES an old DEAD guy in the shops toilets for her boyfriend Dante - And ends up 'accidentally' having sexual intercourse with the old DEAD guy - because the lights don't work and she couldn't see well in there. I mean REALLY. It's way to stupid to be funny - and I sincerely hope I didn't find it funny 20 years ago. The scene should have been omitted. Full stop.Ok I've been harsh. Perhaps not my cup of tea now - but this film DOES still at least deserve its place as a cult classic. I've not seen all of Smith's films, but from what I understand this is still the best of them. IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE.",

            "content": "Shot on a shoestring budget yet lacking neither creativity nor quality, Kevin Smith's feature film debut is an expertly crafted, smartly scripted, brilliantly directed, cleverly humoured & finely performed indie that's filled with genuinely funny moments, idiosyncratic characters & many wonderful homages to succeed as one of the finest comedies of the 1990s.The story of Clerks is set at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey and covers a day in the lives of two store clerks. First is Dante; a retail clerk who is called into work despite his day off. Second is Randal; a video store clerk who hates his job just as much as Dante. The plot follows the two & their acquaintances as they discuss movies, play hockey on the store's roof & annoy customers.Written & directed by Kevin Smith, Clerks marks a solid debut for the then-young filmmaker and manages to be one hell of a ride from start to finish that still hasn't aged a day for there is a lot to admire about it. The screenplay is an absolute gem, its transition on the screen is even better, the camera captures the drama in crisp black-n-white, the pacing isn't an issue and the deadpan humour plus its timing is spot-on.Coming to the performances, the cast mostly comprises of newbies but they all chip in with excellent work here. Dante & Randal have a very authentic, grounded & convincing life-like quality, Jay & Silent Bob leave a lasting impression of their own no matter what scene they are in, and the rest of the cast does a good job in their given role(s). But the film's biggest strength is the hilariously tragic moments it keeps coming up with throughout its runtime.On an overall scale, Clerks is a highly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining & deeply satisfying R-rated comedy that, despite its limitations, manages to work amazingly well and is one of the worthy specimen of the 1990s independent cinema circuit. A vastly underrated example of its genre that hasn't lost one bit of its charm & wickedness, and can certainly benefit from a wider audience, Kevin Smith's breakthrough feature comes delightfully recommended to all who love to laugh.",

It is, however, an independent film, made a little outside of what traditional circuits and big studios are, and the budget is limited. If we consider all this, I think we can understand the film better.The film basically accompanies a day in the life of two commercial employees who hate their jobs but need them, like any mortal. They work closely together and are friends, but the day promises not to be easy for either of them. The film is based on jokes of a very rude nature, sometimes also on the inelegant manners of the characters. There are a lot of allusions to pop culture throughout the movie as well, and I didn't always get that. It's not the kind of humor I really enjoy, though the film has its moments. Perhaps this style of humor works better with young people and teenagers than with someone more adult...The cast features a number of actors that I don't really know. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson had their most relevant work in this film, from what I've seen. The film is quite restrained in terms of costumes and scenery, and I believe that real stores were used for the production. What can be considered a weakness, the low budget, was to some extent an advantage, taking into account the type of film they preferred to make here. The cinematography is very good and well used, and is perhaps the film's most artistic feature.",

            "content": "I am not too sure when this movie was released but it is strange in a sense. Basically this movie seems to be a very well done amateur production. If you watch the credits you will notice that a lot of the jobs have doubled up and that actors play a number of roles. There are two main characters, and they are Dante, the guy working at the quickie mart, and his mate who works in the video shop next door. His girlfriend pops in every so often but is much more of a supporting character.Clerks is about Clerks. People who spend their time sitting behind the counter serving customers. We probably don't think much of them but we get to see here what the are like and the weird customers that come through. This is not an average day, but it still looks at the weirdness of humanity.In the credits there is a thankyou that runs like this: To God, who without this could not have been done. Now there is possibly some Christian themes in this movie but I would be very doubtful that Kevin Smith is as really serious about his faith. The movie is incredibly rude and extremely crude. There is no nudity or anything like that but the language that is used is just not something that I would even consider coming out of the mind of a Christian. A director makes a movie, and he may be trying to show the really disgusting side of humanity, but there are other ways he could have done it.Still there is a lot in this very low budget movie. This is actually an example to Low Budget movies because I think they have made a pretty good movie on an incredibly tight budget. I would believe that the movie would have cost at most $5000, yet here it is sitting on the shelves of our video stores.One of the themes is responsibility for our actions. Dante spends a lot of time complaining about how life has kicked him in the teeth, and I must admit that sometimes things happen that are not his fault, such as his friend selling cigarettes to a four year old girl, but there are a lot of things that he does do. Probably the classic is that he has a girlfriend that does everything for him, like remove a very annoying chewing gum salesman and making him lasagne for lunch, yet he is pining over Caitlen, his ex-girlfriend who cheated on him almost every night. Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith) says at the end of the movie, \"there are many pretty girls, but only one who will make you lasagne.\" This line encapsulates almost everything. What good is a pretty girl if all she is going to do is cheat on you? Even though the language is really bad, and I will not even try to explain it away, it still is a good movie. It is interesting how when Dante and Vanessa are talking about their ex-partners and who they slept with, both of then are very critical at the number of people that they slept with. It is like they do feel betrayed when they find out the truth.

            "content": "Clerks (1994) is the directorial debut of longtime director/writer Kevin Smith. The film examines one day in the life of two 22-year- old New Jersey residents living in the exciting world of retail. Dante (Brian O'Halloran) is called in to work at his job at a convenience store on his day off; Randal (Jeff Anderson) works at the video store next door. While they share a friendship, they have little else in common. Dante hates his job but rejects the entreaties of girlfriend Veronica (Marily Ghigliotti) to return to school, and worries about leaving the store unattended. Randal, meanwhile, shuts down the video store whenever the mood strikes him, is openly hostile to his customers, and goads Dante into taking more chances. Dante also obsesses over his ex-girlfriend Caitilin (Lisa Spoonhauer), whom he has just discovered is engaged.Made for a paltry $36,000 by writer/director Kevin Smith, Clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish. Jeff Anderson in particular reads his line like a student in a high school production, and his big emotional speeches are pitched at about the same level as his sarcastic banter. Smith's direction is simple, but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting. Clerks when it came out has receive many backlash for it's NC-17 level near dialogue. However, since a few editing, the film does contain much profanity and is not easily accessed for everyone's taste.",

            "content": "Low budget, nobody actors, set in one place and done in black and white. It must be a debut independent film and that's exactly what it is. Clerks. has quite a few things going for it throughout and these are put across through dialogue, mostly, but there are other little things to look out for such as the amusing posters and notices posted throughout. These include a large one outside saying something along the lines of 'Yes, we're actually open' despite the fact the shutters are locked shut and 'If you're thinking of shoplifting; don't!' stuck to the side of the till. This is some clever use of mise-en-scene props as not only do they add to the realism of the setting aspect, but they also make us laugh. The dialogue is also very original and the one-liners that finish off the conversations at the end of certain scenes leave a nice taste in the mouth as we move on to the next situation.In fact, this is pretty much where the goodness of the film begins and ends. Any scene which is dialogue driven is a good one. It's funny, smarmy, cynical and most importantly; it's real or at least it feels real. The discussions are interesting but the arguments are interesting as well as entertaining. There are a few flaws with this however. The rate in which the characters swap lines is a little too quick. The takes are very long and obviously, they've had to do it a few times. It seems they've merely rushed it out after the umpteenth attempt and this shows as the characters don't reply to one another, they 'snap' back. Given the fact this is set 90% of the time in a shop, the setting grates a little and the black and white seems to bizarrely loose quality as the film's run time roles on. This is twinned with the fact that the shoe polish and cigarettes gags are piled on a little too much.One thing I found frustrating was the fact they were willing to close the shop to play hockey on the roof. Yet, if you're willing to close the shop anyway; why not just actually go to your scheduled hockey? Another annoying thing was the character trait/flaw Dante had; he was too weak. In one scene, he realises his boss has left the country and yet, he STILL chooses to remain at work. At this point, I feel he would've left the place after all that he'd so far been through.Clerks. is entertaining enough and at some points will make you laugh out loud. If you've already been in any of the situations these characters face in the film, I can only imagine that it would be even funnier. What I fail to see, however, is how people have managed to miss the annoying things this film has underneath it. It's obviously trying to be clever and for the bulk part of it, it is, but Clerks. tries a little too hard at times and as a result, shouldn't be labelled as a 'great'.",

            "content": "I first saw \"Clerks\" when I was nineteen. This was in 2013. At the time, I thought it was quite impressive. I looked at it as being a prime example of a \"don't wait, create\" kind of film and even though I still hold it in that kind of regard, I can honestly say that after just five years since I first saw it, \"Clerks\" has become less impressive and its flaws more glaring.\n1.) Acting. It's not good. Even for amateurs or even \"non-actors\", the performances simply aren't good. Everyone delivers their lines in a rapid fire manner and the conversations don't flow naturally as a result. It doesn't help either that little emotion is evoked. Save for maybe a scene or two (moreso towards the end), no one uses any facial expressions or body language when they talk. Couple this with the super fast line delivery and the acting becomes more annoying than anything else.\n2.) Cinematography. Poor. Very poor. Ultra low budget or not, Kevin Smith could've moved the camera every now and then. So many scenes are shot through one angle which only makes it more obvious that this is an amateur flick. Add to this you have black and white colors to avoid the tedium of color timing (which Smith himself admitted) and the virtual lack of proper lighting, it makes for a disappointing visual experience to say the least.\n3.) Dialogue. Now I get stylized dialogue. It has its place and can enhance a story if it fits the overall tone. But in \"Clerks\", which is supposed to be a semi realistic portrayal of life as a convenience store employee, it just doesn't work. These characters, who are supposed to be careless losers that never even attended college, all talk like scholarly poets without the slightest interruptance. It just doesn't work. At all.\n4.) Plot. What WAS the plot? \"Day in the life\" type movies have always kind of bugged me because they seem like cop outs. The idea that, \"hey, let's make a movie with no story, no arcs, no character development, but thrown in some random half funny jokes and call it a movie.\" It never works for me. \"Clerks\" might have even been able to pull it off if Smith had bothered to base his screenplay upon real life stories. The kind that people in this line of work can relate to. Myself having worked retail in the past, I can tell you there are so many more interesting stories that could have been included in this movie that Smith didn't even touch. Instead he opted for a ten minute scene about contractors working on the death star. Yawn. Also, if Smith had used his original ending where Dante gets shot and killed, THAT would've at least given meaning to the rest of the movie. There were even several lines of dialogue that foreshadowed that ending. Alas, we got the alternate ending of nothingness which rendered the entire movie an exercise in futility.All this said, the movie still has its redeemable moments. Some of the jokes are genuinely funny, the characters are interesting to a point, and it's the type of film that can inspire young filmmakers to go out and make their dreams come true. It's just too bad that Kevin Smith never made another passable movie after this one.",

Sure, one or two scenes in the film are massively exaggerated, but even they have some basis in reality (far too often men will buy porn and sneak off to the toilet). I've encountered many fans of this film, some I would never be proud to count as fellow fans and others who can relate to the film on a very real level. Jay and Silent Bob may just generally be slackers and, let's be honest, losers, but the other main characters are all real people, authentic, 100% real people, not some stupid Hollywood copy, just guys like myself at one point in my life (and at the moment, to a degree). The conversations are authentic- long, rambling, often bizarre. The customers are portrayed not doing what they're actually doing but doing what they appear to be doing to us working these jobs- the egg and milk people may be exaggerations, but that's really how one tends to see these people when you're working such jobs. One need not exaggerate video store customers, though, they really are that bad.\"Clerks\" is not a well-directed film at all. At the time they were shooting the cast and crew really did not believe that the movie would even be released, and even Smith's later, more refined efforts as director show a minimum level of competence. With \"Clerks\" Smith is really directing at the level one expects from a first year film major who is still studying mainly theory (not that Smith was all that much older than that when he made the film, and he had no more than a month or two training at a film school), but the script is so strong here that one doesn't really feel the need for the film to be sophisticated on a visual level. If it was it may very well have been one of the best films ever made, but as it stands it is a completely average film on a technical level but also hands down one of the best comedy scripts anyone's ever written. I've also decided that the low budget look and feel lends the film even further authenticity and realism, as a glossy look might have made the film feel significantly different (see the $5 million dollar \"Clerks II\" for proof of this).I don't know what to say about \"Clerks\" except that its script is absolute genius- authentic, hilarious, real, and featuring well-drawn, ultra-realistic characters I can really relate to. I honestly don't think the script is flawed, not for a second. Smith's work here as director, though, is not especially good. This would be a perfect stage play, as a movie I can't quite decide what to rate it. There's something to be admired about this average white kid who made it big on a budget of $27,000 (which includes the rights to music, I believe, so the shooting budget would have been substantially lower) and a script he didn't have a clue was really any good. Good thing he didn't keep the original ending.10/10 for the script.",

            "content": "Kevin Smith's Clerks plays like a cross between Waiting for Goudot and The Divine Comedy with excessive c*** jokes thrown in for good measure. Dante (Brian O'Halloran) is coaxed into working the morning shift at a convenience store by a boss we never see. Suffering through a duo of wisecracking drug dealers (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), a parade of annoying costumers and his lazy best friend's antics (Jeff Anderson), his only solace is his doting girlfriend (Marilyn Ghigliotti) who occasionally brings him lasagna. But when he discovers an ex is about to get married, things start to spiral out of control with hilarious results.The cinematography of this film leaves little to be desired. Shot in grainy black and white, the camera is planted firmly on the ground as the actors populate the tiny store and play out the scene. Additionally O'Halloran and Anderson who share most of the screen time give it their all but try as they might, just aren't very talented actors. For all its supposed faults however Clerks comes across as endearing; like a seedling that's just pushed through fertile soil destined to change the tree-line.What rises this film above the fold is the script. The raucous conversations between the two leads manages to make the mundane world of minimum wage counter-jockeying palpable. The film's instantly quotable dialogue may be unassuming to some today but back then it was new and exciting and to some quite threatening (the MPAA originally gave the film an NC-17 based solely on the script).Without Clerks, the film industry wouldn't have realized the potential of the raunchy comedy genre and films like There's Something About Mary, American Pie and Borat would have had a harder time making it to the Cineplexes. Additionally Clerks tapped into an audience demographic that has up until then not been recognized, i.e. fanboys. After all, who else would talk at length about the virtues of the Star Wars Trilogy? With a budget of approximately $27,000, the film grossed $3 million at the box office and has since become a cult favorite. How much of a cult favorite you ask? The film schools of today are cluttered with those who were inspired by two major auteurs; Tarantino and Smith.

One side of me loves what the characters are saying and the story while the other side of me dislikes everything else. It is shot on grainy black and white film, the sound quality is poor, the acting is hit and miss, there are continuity errors galore, and the humor is so gutter that it gives the gutter a bad name.I like \"Clerks.\" because the world the film portrays, what the characters say, and the nuggets in the murkiness, allows me to overlook the \"hey kids lets get out the camcorder and make a movie\" feel to the movie.You want to hate this film with all the being in your body but it wears on you like an old friend at a bar.I first saw the film when it first came out on VHS. I rented it and while it had its funny moments it just didn't thrill me after all the hype I had read or heard about it then. It wasn't the worst movie I'd seen but it wasn't the best either. It did lead me to see the other films Kevin Smith made in later years and those I did like very much.I had a chance to revisit \"Clerks.\" and it may have been maturity on my part but I could appreciate the art and passion put into the film. You don't have to work in the service industry to understand the film or the story. Anyone with a job knows a Dante or a Randal. People know about the crew at the Quick Stop who are rude and pretentious for no other reason than they can be. After all they are working at a convenience store, if they really had the answer to life, they wouldn't be working in a convenience store - right? The thing is they don't want to be there but they can't think of doing anything else.There are thousands of us who hate our jobs but we go to them any way because we won't take the chance on any thing else. Our sucky job is comfortable - like an old shoe. We know there is better out in the world but we know what we are doing at our jobs now - why take the chance? That is Dante's issue in the film.Kevin Smith took a huge risk - even Dante wouldn't take such a risk - to make a film he wanted to make with no planning past the film festival it first screened at in 1993. Filmmakers always say that if you tell a good story success will happen but what they fail to tell you is luck is 50% of the process. Luck would it have that Bob Hawk was at the screening and saw the potential in the film and in Smith and used his contacts to get the ball rolling for Smith that led to Sundance.Without luck \"Clerks.\" would be gathering dust in Kevin's closet, unseen but by a few.What \"Clerks.\" means, outside of the issue and story in the film, is what happened in the process from writing the script to it being released to theaters by Miramax. They took a risk on a first time filmmaker and bought a film that while better than most, still lacked the polish most movie goers expect and in return we got someone who makes personal and real films with dick and fart jokes.For me independent film doesn't mean some arty, non-linear, pretentious snob flick that only those who think they know, know what it means and if you don't you aren't \"cool\" - which is what 90% of art house films are today. Independent film means making a film you are passionate about and don't care who sees it because it is something you HAVE to do. You take the risk for yourself and no one else. That is what Kevin Smith and company did and it shows.I like \"Clerks.\" and I think you should too, but don't take my word for it.",

He figures on being a part of his weekly Hockey game,but sure enough,he's called in and agrees to work. From there,his day only gets incrementally worse. His best friend is a self-satisfied porn loving,philosophizing dude named Randall(Jeff Anderson) who works the neighboring video store(at his own leisure). He slips in and out of the store Dante works and seems perfectly content to sell cigs to kids and discuss hard-core magazines with complete strangers. In a cavalcade of work hassles--from a guy trying to mount an insincere campaign against tobacco to an elderly gentleman who disappears into the bathroom for(ahem)some reading--Dante and Randall basically fire across dialog between each other,with DAnte coming to various revelations about his life. All the while,Dante stews over which girlfriend he wants more: his current,Veronica(Marilyn Ghigliotti) or his ex Caitlin(Lisa Spoonhauer),who just happens to be getting engaged and who broke up with him three years before.A truly personal film for Smith,who casts entirely friends and family and has at least a few of the crew double their duties,this movie is especially impressive if you consider that Smith's dialog,which is hardly simple stuff due to timing and rapid-fire references,is being spat out with little or no seams. Given that Kevin is a notorious stickler for his scripts being read ver batim,that couldn't have been easy stuff to get to film on one or two takes!

He has trouble with his love life, with his girlfriend, Veronica, pestering him at the store about how he should be going to college instead of working there, and revealing a very dirty secret! Dante has a dimwitted, lazy friend named Randal, who is a clerk at the video store next door. He often drops into the convenience store to talk to Dante, and his behaviour costs the store some customers! These problems are certainly not the only ones Dante experiences while on the job, and he isn't even supposed to be working today! Some gags in this movie are priceless, probably starting with the one early on with the secret Chewlies gum representative in the store, hanging around and discouraging customers from buying cigarettes, giving them lectures on the effects of smoking and encouraging them to buy Chewlies gum, instead! (You might have to see it in order to know what I mean.) More hilarity follows, sometimes involving Randal annoying certain customers! However, Kevin Smith's low-budget, black and white feature-length film-making debut also has its shortcomings. It doesn't have much of a plot at all, there isn't quite enough humour to prevent that from effecting its quality, and some of the conversations may go on a bit too long. I also think that it may sometimes get a little TOO juvenile, especially during the part where it is discovered that an elderly man has died in the store's washroom, and what caused his death! It's obvious that some would hate this film with a passion, due to all the filth. It could also bore some viewers (it bored me at times, or came very close to doing so). Personally, I found enough laughs in \"Clerks.\" to give it a 7, and since many have definitely enjoyed it more, looking at the IMDb rating, I must be missing something. Some may find a lot of the dialogue more amusing than I did. If extremely raunchy, R-rated comedies with heavy sex jokes, toilet humour, offensiveness, tastelessness, etc. disturb you, \"Clerks.\" is definitely NOT a movie for you, as that's just what it is! However, if you have a sick sense of humour, this may or may not turn out to be a great comedy to you, but either way, I think you'd probably like at least SOME of the gags.",

            "content": "I put off watching this movie for over 10 years. I guess I'm always the late-comer to every party, but I couldn't see what the big deal was. Then, for whatever reason, I decided to watch the sequel. I rarely watch sequels before I watch the original movie, but it was on, so I checked it out.After that, I immediately went out and got a copy of the original. Honestly, I was not prepared for what I was about to see. The sequel was polished, and frankly it wasn't a whole lot different than a lot of other R-rated teen flicks. The original, however, is on a whole different level.Clerks is the textbook of example of the power of the script. You can keep your special effects blockbusters. Most of them don't bother to tell a competent story. Clerks not only tells a competent story, but it does it in such a way that you end up not caring that the movie doesn't have color, that the acting is admittedly bad, or that the scenery doesn't really even change. That's the power of the script.I mean, who hasn't been Dante, at least at some point, right? Crappy job, uncertain relationships, wiseguy friend who gets you into trouble, getting called in on your day off... that's all of us, right? And Randall? We've all had that friend: the guy who you know is bad for you to hang with, but who makes your boring life a little bit more fun than he probably should.Forget the profanity. That's how people talk in the real world. I heard lots worse than that in high school. You introduce me to a guy who works at a convenience store who doesn't cuss, and I'll show you a guy who hasn't worked there very long. Overall, Clerks is a competent and extremely enjoyable movie. Excellent script, passable acting that is saved by brilliant dialogue, believable characters, and an interesting take on everyday life. Keep it out of your teens' hands, because they won't get it, but if you're the average working schmoe or ever have been, you'll enjoy this one.",

            "review_title": "A comic masterpiece",
            "content": "The first film in Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse, this is a comic masterpiece. The film was made on a budget of a mere $27,575, probably less than the catering costs on most Hollywood films, but you don't need a big budget if you have a great comic imagination and a gift for writing wonderful dialogue, both of which Smith has in spades. I have been aware of Smith and his films for years now but I decided to check them out when he and Jason Mewes guest starred as themselves on the Canadian teen drama \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\", to which I am addicted, and I thought that they were both very funny. Smith is a huge fan of the series' predecessor \"Degrassi Junior High\" and Caitlin Bree is named after one of its main characters Caitlin Ryan.The film charts a particularly eventful day in the lives of two clerks named Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, played to perfection by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson respectively. Dante is a dogged nice guy who is torn between his current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, and his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree. Veronica wants him to pull his socks up and go to college so that he make something of himself but Dante takes her for granted and spends most of his time pinning over Caitlin, whom he learns has just gotten engaged to an Asian design major. His relationship with Veronica is stable but his relationship with Caitlin was marked - well, defined - by frequent infidelity on her part so it was not exactly a match made in Heaven in spite of the fact that he seems to devote most of his life to reminiscing about it. Veronica and Caitlin are played very well by Marilyn Ghigliotti and Lisa Spoonhauer, who was later briefly married to Anderson incidentally. As the film progresses, however, things go a bit pear-shaped for all concerned. Dante means well but he has a tendency to screw up, though much of this can be attributed to the less than helpful efforts of his best friend Randal.Randal is the archetypal apathetic Generation X slacker and pop philosopher who works at a video store and makes no effort to hide his disdain for the customers. He spends most of his time at the convenience store Quick Stop where Dante works so he leaves the video store unattended for about 45 minutes out of every hour. Randal regularly insults the Quick Stop costumers as well, leaving Dante to try and salvage the situation. He devotes a great deal of his energy to pointless gossip, causing trouble for Dante and thinking about things such as the politically neutral independent contractors who were more than likely killed in the destruction of the second Death Star in \"Return of the Jedi\". Randal is without a doubt the best character in the film and gets all the best lines, which may have something to do with the fact that Smith originally intended the role for himself.The first 20 minutes of the film are certainly very funny with the biased anti-cigarette gum enthusiast and Dante and Veronica's discussion of their respective sexual exploits but it reaches another level of hilarity when Randal makes his first appearance. O'Halloran and Anderson have great chemistry and they deliver their exquisite dialogue in a very natural fashion, particularly when they're together. Like Dante, Randal means well. He is very protective of Dante but he royally screws things up for him without meaning to at the end of the film. He's is basically the best friend from Hell but he and Dante nevertheless have a great brotherly relationship.Over the course of the day, Dante and Randal have to deal with numerous odd and/or difficult customers and these interactions are likewise hilarious. Smith worked at a convenience store at the time that the film was made so I am guessing that some of them were based on people that he met in his day job. My favourite customer is certainly the old man, played by Al Berkowitz, who needs to use the \"terlet\" at the not very aptly named Quick Stop and comes back to haunt Dante (and Caitlin!) later in the film. Most of the cast members in the films were friends of Smith's or family members such as his mother Grace who played the \"milkmaid\" and his sister Virginia who played the, uh, animal artificial insemination specialist. Jason Mewes and Smith himself are very funny as Jay and Silent Bob, two of the most colourful characters in the film.Several actors such as the film's producer Scott Mosier and Walt Flanagan play multiple characters. While this was probably done mostly to save money, it serves to emphasise the fact that Dante and Randal's jobs are extremely repetitive. It is not often that an entire film concerns the lives of people with ordinary, boring jobs and that makes the film stand out. The characters are of course exaggerated but I know people who remind me of Dante and Randal and I'm sure that that is true of many others. I can't imagine Randal's work ethic doing much for his employment prospects in a recession though.Overall, this is an absolutely hilarious film which is a testament to what a filmmaker can achieve if he has a very small budget and a first-rate script. It is without a doubt the best ultra low budget film that I have seen, putting even \"The Blair Witch Project\" to shame. I shall be looking for ways to work \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\" into conversation from now on. I would try with other lines from the film but sadly many of the best ones cannot be repeated in polite society! Impolite society is another matter entirely.",

            "content": "Clerks is an odd, and quirky comedy from Kevin Smith. The story of Clerks is fairly simple; Dante Hicks, a convenience store clerk, gets called into work on his day off. Throughout the course of his day at work, Dante is constantly interrupted by his rude friend Randal, who likes to heckle the customers. Together they go through many odd trials and tribulations while working on this not so ordinary day. In the end the story ends very much how it started, with all of the characters the same as they were in the beginning, but that is part of the unique charm of Clerks. The film never takes itself seriously - even while dealing with Dante's love life - which is a large part as to why I truly enjoy this film so much.Clerks is the first film from writer/director Kevin Smith, and still stands as his greatest work; the script in particular. The screenplay is always witty, there is never a single joke in the film that did not feel like it was not well thought out before being included in the film. As well the dialogue's unique style was something that I have never really seen many films do, which is actually write dialogue the way that real twenty-two year olds talk. To put it quite simple the script is amazing, but the actors are who bring it to life. The actors, ranging from Brian O'Halloran as Dante, to Kevin Smith himself, all play their respective roles well. Which brings to mind another great point about Clerks, the characters. It is rare to see a film that creates characters that are so memorable. Each character, especially the unforgettable Jay and Silent Bob, are all so unlikeable that they are likable. Another thing that makes this film a must see for all film enthusiasts, is the simple fact that this movie was made for only $27,000, that right there is truly remarkable, it proves that you do not have to be rich to make a good film, you just have to have the passion to tell a good, entertaining story.Overall Clerks is a highly fun and entertaining film. One word of caution though, this film has a ton of foul language in it, and if you are offended by sexual references or curse words, you should definitely skip this one; it definitely earns its R rating. With that aside, I hope you enjoy this film as much as I have.I give Clerks a 10 out of 10!",

Dogma was clever, but this is pure tripe. To make a cult film about adolescence you don't need to be so desperate to prove your directing chops, as Kevin Smith was. Almost famous did a much better job of encapsulating teenage angst and subcultures, whilst maintaining an air of 'cool'.While the visuals are all there for a 90s movie, with a b&w lens, the dialogue is just so unnatural and forced from sub-par actors that it become unwatchable. Anyone who claims that this is a gem and underrated work of genius needs a massive reality check and should stop reading media studies.

            "content": "The beauty of Clerks is that it realizes that its main characters are losers and thus doesn't even screw with a plot because quite frankly, when's the last time a Store Clerk shared an entertaining story that encompassed more than, `A real freak came into the store today, and . . .'  These guys have no lives.  We don't care about their lives.  So Clerks shows off anecdotal moments from a day--strange customers, weird moments, conversations with no point that lead nowhere . . . and that's the film.  And you know what?  I like it more than most comedies out there.What I find frightening is that the Clerks cast has more development than most epics, tragedies, dramas.  The characters don't have the plot to trip over, so everything in the film builds towards the characters; what's even sadder is the fact you wouldn't want \u0096these- two losers to be some of the more developed characters you'll find on the rental shelf, but they are. \nEveryone wants to rave about plot and how important it is and put all your focus into just the plot, so it's kinda queer that we don't have more good plot driven films.  Then when the plot is actually good, the characters are mediocre because everything was put into the plot . . . so we have a plot we don't care about because we hate the characters.  When is the industry going to wake up and realize that storytelling is more than just one or two elements?  That you have to combine everything together roughly equally?With that said, why do I still like Clerks since it has no plot to speak of? If it had a plot, would I have cared about it with these two losers at the helm?  Kevin Smith knew better, and set out with a different agenda . . . plot wasn't the point of Clerks.  This is one of the rare times when someone goes to the other end of the spectrum without being offensive, but just goes to show how overrated the `plot' can be.  As idiotic and worthless as the Dante and Randal and the people in the Clerks environment are . . . it's still entertaining without a plot.  I wouldn't want my collection of DVDs to all be like Clerks, but the film is a nice film to pop in and ask, `How important is the plot when everything is said and done?'",

Kevin Smith made his feature film debut with this kitchen sink,black & white film,that may remind some viewers of some of the early Jim Jarmusch,or Hal Hartley films (who both get an acknowledgment in the closing credits), with a (then)no name cast,shot mostly in a convenient store (with some extra footage shot in a video shop next door). The plot has Dante Hicks (played to the hilt,by a damaged looking Brian O'Hallorin),who is experiencing what has to be the absolute worst day ever in his life. He is called into work on his day off,when he is supposed to hook up with his pals to play some hockey. His lazy,good for nothing slacker of a friend,Randal,who works next door in the video mart (yeah...right!), manages to be nothing short of a major thorn in Dante's side by being obnoxious to customers. The various weird customers that Dante hates dealing with. Among others,Dante finds out his ex girlfriend is getting married,which launches Dante into a downward spiral of depression. Toss in a couple of equally obnoxious pot dealers (Jason Mewes,as Jay & Kevin Smith,himself as Silent Bob,who lives up to his namesake)to up the ante,and you have yourself the makings for a caustic comedy that will turn some off & attract a cadre of followers. This film had a bit of controversy,due to the fact that the goons at the MPAA wanted to slap this film with an NC-17 for the nearly non stop barrage of vulgar language & crude sex jokes. In the end,though, Smith appealed & got the 'R' rating he wanted. This is the film that would spawn a sequel, an short lived animated series (only six episodes,although only two were ever aired on ABC),not to mention turning Jay & Silent Bob into an icon of pop culture.

            "content": "Clerks is one of the funniest and most memorable Comedies of all-time and an excellent and hilarious Comedy Cult Classic that combines fine direction,a good cast,a terrific script and a wonderful soundtrack. With those elements Clerks is a great Comedy,a classic of Independent cinema and Kevin Smith at his best.Set in Leonardo,New Jersey,Clerks tells the day in the life story of Dante Hicks(Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves(Jeff Anderson),two twenty somethings and best friends who work at a Quick Stop convenience store and video store next door to each other. While at work,Dante and Randal have to deal with hilarious situations involving offbeat and annoying customers as well as dealing with themselves. There is also a Marijuana dealing duo named Jay(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith)who hang outside the stores and add to the insanity.Released in 1994,Clerks is a brilliant and hilarious low budget Comedy that marked the directorial debut of writer-director Kevin Smith who sold his Comic Book collection and maxed out credit cards to make the film on a 27,000 dollar budget and in Black and White. Clerks not only was a critical and commercial success but also a Cult Classic that was the first in Kevin Smith's View Askewniverse Comedies which also included Mallrats(1995),Chasing Amy(1997),Dogma(1999),Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back(2001)and Clerks II(2006)and also introduced the famous stoner duo Jay and Silent Bob. Clerks is one of those films that is a Comedy classic from the moment you first watch,a funny and offbeat film that gives viewers a outrageous tale of what it's like to work at a convenience store showing how dull and boring the job is with moments of bizarre and weird things. The Comedy and laughs in Clerks are hilarious and will make your stomach hurt and cry your eyes out because the humor in Clerks has a great balance between going over the top and being realistic with the over the top nature being with the characters and dialog that gives the Comedy a stylish feel that is in a world of it's own and the Comedy is at times cynical and in your face but not mean spirited. The Comedy is realistic(and demented)in showing how the characters Dante and Randal deal with customers and their work place how the two really don't want to be there at all. The Comedy in Clerks would also be the beginning of Smith's signature style that would be in Smith's other View Askew movies:pop culture references to the Star Wars films and other movies,Comic Books,Superheros and sexual related jokes and all of started here in Clerks and would continue in his later films. Clerks is a movie that is not only funny but also at times(due to it's low budget and Black and White photography)has a gritty fly one the wall style that isn't pretty or beautiful but real and accurate showing viewers a world that exists in our everyday life even if the world of Clerks is silly. I also love the fact the movie takes place over the course of one day because when a film is set on one day anything can happen. The main characters Dante and Randal are classic characters from Kevin Smith's mind the classic example of the straight man and funny guy. Like I said before,Dante and Randal don't want to work at their corner stores but feel like they have to be there because they have nothing else to do with their life and have no ambitions. With Dante we see that the character is miserable and in a funk he's a College dropout,he has to deal with the relationships in his life whether it's Randal,his present girlfriend or ex-girlfriend and the way the relationships are handled is funny. Randal is different person from Dante because where Dante is miserable and upset about his life,Randal loves the way things are for himself and doesn't have any high ambitions for his life and does things his way not giving a crap about the customers or about what anyone else thinks. The friendship between Dante and Randal while hectic and crazy feels genuine and real and you will feel that despite their differences the two care for one another. The relationship and banter between Dante and Randal is one of the things that make the movie a classic and a great film. The screenplay by Kevin Smith is terrific and funny,with Smith giving the movie and it's characters dialog and scenes that are raunchy and offbeat and done in a way that is profane and ironic only way Kevin Smith knows how(so profane that the Clerks originally received an NC-17 from the MPAA). The ending of Clerks is amazing because while it's funny it also makes you think with a hint of truth and depth. A great ending.The cast is good. Brian O'Holloran is wonderful and funny as Dante,with O'Holloran playing the laughs in a straight manner. Jeff Anderson is terrific and hilarious as Randal,with Anderson stealing every scene he's in. Marylin Ghigliotti does a good job as Veronica,Dante's girlfriend. Lisa Spoonauer does a fine job as Caitlin Bree,Dante's ex-girlfriend. Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith are fantastic and laugh out loud funny as Jay And Silent Bob,Mariuana dealers that hangout in front of the store.The direction by Kevin Smith is simple but great,with Smith pointing the camera and shooting and at times using handled camera movements to a nice effect. Fine direction,Smith.The soundtrack for Clerks(which was more expensive than the entire film)has great songs by Soul Asylum(Can't Even Tell),Alice In Chains(Got Me Wrong),Bad Religion(Leaders And Followers),Corrision Of Conformity(Big Problems),Love Among Freaks(Clerks,Berserker)Girls Against Boys(Kill The Sax Player),Stabbing Westward(Violent Mood Swings),Bash & Pop(Making Me Sick),Seaweed(Go Your Own Way),Supernova(Chewbacca),The Jesus Lizard(Panic In Cicero)and Golden Smog(Shooting Star). Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Kevin Smith,Comedies,Independent Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Clerks,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Comedy/Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "\"Clerks\", was a film I liked even more watching the second time around. If there's anything to say about Kevin Smith's filmography, is that a majority of it will eventually grow on you. Brought to Sundance 1994, and made on a shoe string budget of 27.5 grand (All shot at the convenient store where Smith worked, filming only at night during closed hours). \"Clerks\" remains a tour-de-force of Independent Cinema.Kevin Smith has become an entertainment giant over the last couple of years. I am an avid listener to his pod-casts, comic books, approach on writing and overall court jester dissection on pop culture. \"Clerks\" represents a fantastic debut for a man not so perfected from a directing standpoint, but for a writer anyone who has read his scripts can clearly see a passion.The story follows a day in the life of Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), two slackers who work in rundown convenient stores next to each other. Throughout their work day they deal with random customers, proceed with recreational activities and put up with obnoxious yet lovable pot dealing duo Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith). As well as just trying to get through the day, they also discuss very important issues, such as whether or not the contractors deserved to die while rebuilding the second Death Star in \"Star Wars Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\" (1983).Wonderful 20's angst dialogue, mixed with acting that is very good considering the movie is made up of local friends and family. It put them all on the map, and paved Kevin Smith's name in the concrete of todays very popular Independent genre.Final Verdict: Ultimately it's the movie for the MTV generation, and a wonderful film made by a man in his early 20's. A very earnest and ambitious beginning from a guy who clearly chose the right profession. 8/10. Props to the soundtrack too (That cost more than the film to produce).",

He has several encounters with his girlfriend, his best friend who runs the video store next to his, a past lover, a bunch of unconventionaly hilarious  customers and the ever so popular Jay and Silent Bob who have appeared in all of Smith's movies to date. The script is very harsh and sexual graphic and although this may tunr off some more closed minded viewers it makes the movie much more effective. The movie also touches on serious issues as marraige, cheating and death but never taking itself to seriously as to become boring.

I like the influence he has had on independent cinema. 1994 certainly proved to be an important year for it, with the smash successes that independent studios had with 'Clerks' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I hope he sticks to directing films that he himself writes. I have the feeling he wants to expand his horizons but isn't quite sure how to go about it without alienating his huge fan base. I have great confidence in him, and feel that if he puts his heart into it, he can be a great filmmaker, instead of a good one. I think for him to do so, he could do himself a great service and read a few less comic books and watch a lot more movies, particularly by the Hollywood greats from the Golden Age, such as Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Raoul Walsh and John Ford.

Most people can identify with Dante's fear of advancement and Randal's anti-authoritarian creed.There are numerous technical flaws and some unexplained gaps in the plot, but all limitations aside, Smith and his crew did an amazing job at telling a very funny and relatable story with very little resources.

The film was shot in black and white film because it was cheaper than color film back in 1994. Today the film would be shot in color using a digital camera. \"Clerks II\" is definitely better than this film because it looks professionally done, and the acting is somewhat better, and \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" is by far the best of the three films.If it weren't for \"Clerks\" we probably would never have heard of Kevin Smith, and heck he might have still been working at that store. Critics at the time seemed to have had the same fascination that they had for Diablo Cody when \"Juno\" came out. \"Wow, she's a former stripper who wrote a screenplay.\" \"Wow, Kevin Smith actually works at the Quick Stop,and made a movie.\" He is basically a comic book nerd who got extremely lucky because of this film, and his fellow comic book fan boys have catapulted this film into the stratosphere.",

            "content": "After seeing `Clerks,' I am reminded of the feeling I had after seeing the classic `Un chien andalou' in my college cinema class many years ago. While Clerks, certainly, was nowhere near as expressionistic and surreal as the Bunuel-Dali classic, it certainly leaves one with a realization that one has just watched a well-constructed work of art on a bizarre and grotesque canvas.This was my first Kevin Smith production and I had no idea what to expect. I still had no idea what to expect until very late in the film. Reviewing Clerks is even more of a challenge because it is NOT the type of film I typically watch. This is being written by a reviewer who considers the original `12 Angry Men' one of Hollywood's greatest films and someone who looks back mournfully to the days when Hollywood still made family films.I would dare say that many who know me would assume I would hate this film, if I ever somehow wound up viewing it. I have to admit that the constant graphic language \u0096 especially in the early-going \u0096 grated on my nerves a bit. Still, this was a most original and inspired project.Tracing a day in the life of two convenience store clerks in the same black & white footage that the store's security camera might be shooting, might not sound particularly inspiring. Yet Smith packs some wonderful dialogue, lots of humor and irony and a sense of poignancy as we take a glimpse into the life of two young losers,  Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson).SPOILERS AHEADThe film obviously is more than the sum of its parts and it is obviously making a deeper statement than `Boy hates job; boy plans to dump girl; boy is dissed on all day; boy meets old girl; old girl is hospitalized after seducing a corpse; boy loses both girls; boy closes up shop.' Dante is a loser with the potential to do something with his life \u0096 and perhaps with a latent desire to do so. Randal takes what life offers without complaint. At times the two are reminiscent of Wally Cleaver and Eddie Haskell. Randal constantly manages to talk the semi-conscientious Dante into doing things that go against his better judgment, like closing the store to play hockey on the roof and to go to a friend's wake (then getting them thrown out by accidentally knocking over the coffin!). He happily insults his own video customers, as well as Dante's, gets Dante fined and breaks up a romance for him. Yet in the end he turns philosopher \u0096 maybe just a tad too much so for the film's credibility, but who's counting?Dante, in turn, is a loveable loser who has trouble saying `no' to anyone \u0096 a customer advising other shoppers not to buy cigarettes; an old man who need to use the bathroom; his hockey teammates; and, of course, his ex-girlfriend. Both his current and former girlfriends, he discovers, as the movie progresses, have led much wilder love lives than he ever realized. Humiliation after humiliation is compounded, but he winds up shrugging each off.  In the end, it is not evident whether he has made up his mind to improve his lot \u0096 or again resigned himself to staying put.In the meantime, Smith's dialogue and rapid-fire cast of customers (many cast members playing more than one) lead to some hilarious moments. Although the dialogue is often vulgar and constantly profane, Smith nevertheless shows a master comedy writer's deft touch. O'Halloran and Anderson are outstanding in their roles and very believable.I'm not sure if I'm a Kevin Smith fan yet or not. I will definitely seek out at least one more Smith film, though. His effort in Clerks merits that. This is not so much an entertainment movie as it is an artistic statement. Those of us who complain about Hollywood cranking out inane sequel after sequel (indeed, now cloning entire COLLECTIONS of sequels for NEW series of sequels!) and teeny-bop junk with no depth, cannot simultaneously rip Clerks for its earthy tone, vulgarities and less than flattering look at the seamier side of today's drive-through society. For all its potential draw-backs, Clerks has one definite thing going for it. It is a work of art.",

The director Kevin Smith manages to keep the viewer glued to the screen, despite the fact that there is no substantial progress in the story as such. The script uses a lot of time to establish the characters, while maintaining the charm of the movie. The director has managed to keep the whole picture simple and realistic. The best bits are the parts of conversation between the two leads. Its no surprise to me that the movie caught up with the 'Cult' status instantaneously. The characters are exquisitely portrayed by all actors. It seemed like the actors are in real life like the characters they played, which made the acting seem so natural. Probably the reason why many of the characters are immortalized. Funny characters, simple script and cinematography blend with a some profanity in language is probable one of the most famous mantras to make a 'low-budget, high-rated cult classic'.",

            "content": "Out of all the writer/directors that I have seen films from, the one that sticks out the most for me is Kevin Smith.  I think he is the best filmmaker on the face of the Earth and he has five really funny and biting movies that to back up that title.  His best film IMO is \"Clerks\".  Although it is not my favorite movie of all time, it is in my Top Ten (#8 while Dogma is #9) and it is the best comedy I have ever seen.  \"Clerks\" takes dead aim at dead-end job sector with brutal honesty and almost unnerving satire.  Some of the topics that are explored in \"Clerks\" would probably make a dog gag but it helps to show what it is like to work in a job where the pay would qualify as slave wage and respect for the worker is nonexistent.  Even though all the characters are exaggerated to a certain degree, they are portrayed as real people who have feelings.  Because of the state of their lives and the hatred they have for their jobs, they take their frustrations out on the customers.  Since the movie is filmed in black and white, it gives you the perspective that you are watching a security camera video. The purpose of \"Clerks\" is to show what life is like as a person who works in the dead-end sector from day to day.  It makes for a very watchable and very likeable film.  Not to downplay great work by established kings like Lynch, The Coens, Soderbergh, Tarantino, Verhoeven, Gilliam and Curtis Hanson and relative newcomers like Shyamalan, Wes Anderson, Richard Kelly and Troy Duffy, Kevin Smith's work, for me, is the epitome of modern filmmaking.  \"Clerks\" should set the standard for all new comedies and even all new dramas that will be made in the coming years.  In short, \"Clerks\" will live on for generations to come and Kevin Smith will be remembered as one of the great filmmakers of all time.  I give all his movies 10 out of 10!PS:  Kevin Smith should have been nominated and won two Oscars for \"Clerks\". \"Mallrats\" shouldn't have been dissed by critics and moviegoers. \"Chasing Amy\" should have been in wider release.  \"Dogma\" should have been nominated for Best Picture at the 2000 Oscars.  \"J&SBSB\" should've been on every top ten list in 2001.Here ends my rant! :)",

            "content": "Kevin Smith, director and writer of Clerks, hit upon a great idea in 1994. A network TV sitcom does not require fancy camera angles, great sets or special effects. In the sitcom the camera mostly stays put while the actors do their thing. What a great discovery for an independent film maker because this \"TV\" style could obviously be used to make very low budget movie. Smith then uses an obvious advantage that film has over network TV. Movie comedy can be much more biting and raunchy. This is the setup for Clerks, R rated comedy in a TV sitcom style but it presents a big problem. Network TV comedies are designed to run in 10 minute segments broken by 5 minute commercial breaks and usually last for 30 minutes. Longer than 30 minutes and a TV comedy can quickly become very boring with the static camera angles and small sets. So how did Kevin Smith solve this problem?He does it very well because overall Clerks is terrific. Everything here depends on the script and Smith delivers a great one. To avoid a too static feel, Clerks is divided into small segments that are titled like separate episodes. But more importantly is Smith's comic timing. The jokes in Clerks build with one punch line after another reaching the right climax. On top of this the humor is often off the wall which feels fresh. While there are plenty of laughs here, I smiled throughout the entire film because I liked many of these characters and the goofy situations they are put in. This was also because I began to care about our \"heros\", Dante Hicks as the put upon hapless \"responsible employee\" and Randal Graves as his slacker sidekick. You can add a whole crowd of oddball supporting cast members who create \"local color\" to my list of why I really enjoyed Clerks. Being in black and white worked because this gave a convenience store harsh neon light look. The soundtrack is good and fits right in. Kevin Smith adds a twist to the plot that is unexpected. What is the relationship between Dante and Randal? Does Randal have a crush on him? It is only touched upon but it adds a little depth to the fun. (Such questions are more fully explored in another Kevin Smith film, Chasing Amy.)\nI have only one slight quibble. Clerks rolls along staggering from one laugh to another but it does not seem to know how to end. I wasn't too disappointed because Clerks is a slice of life type of story and life is not neatly tied together in a bow. If you looking for a clever, gritty comedy, Clerks will deliver.",

I laughed so hard at Clerks, i lost breath twice. I've worked retail. Dante and more so Randal say almost everything that a retail clerk would want to say. They get away with it as well. Kevin Smith proved himself a genius. Raunchy humor, endless sight gags, and the best use of a small cast i've ever seen. Something to offend everyone, and that's what makes this room so great. Another thing that makes so film so great was that it spawned sequels without them being true sequels. It was a series of movies that all tied in with each other. Even having the same actors play other roles. Not something that main stream Hollywood had done. Clerks made Hollywood take notice, and for awhile, they stayed away from the cookie cutter approach to making movies. No movie as important as Clerks had been made in a great while.

He likes life the way it is, simple.  Although as you will see, life is far from simple for Dante Hicks.  The basic idea of the movie is Dante is called in to work on his day off. He agrees to come in because he is under the impression its for a little bit, but is dead wrong.  Nothing can go right on this day.

The first of director Kevin Smith's New Jersey films is one of the best as it follows a day in the life of a clerk at a convenience store.  Often hilarious, and thoughtful at the same time, this is what I wish big-budget Hollywood productions could live up to.  The film is a lot of fun and features the cinematic debut of Jay and Silent Bob, the pot-smoking duo who steals the show in every one of the Smith films.  Mallrats is the next movie in the series, and if you want to see some funny, enjoyable films,  the Kevin Smith movies are as good a place as any to start.  My highest recommendation.",

It entwines the intellectual genius of director/writer Kevin Smith with comedy and drama. Frankly it's a gem and easily one of the best movies made in the last 20 years.Some may view it as a quasi-documentary as it delves deep into the life of an actual store clerk. While some \"incidences\" are taken out of proportion for the audience's enjoyment, there is a layer of realism without being too forced or scripted. Overall 3.5/4 stars, 8/10",

            "content": "I watched the first cut version of \"Clerks.\" I was prepared to be mildly amused and not much impressed. I ended up enthralled, deeply moved, and with a ton of admiration for Kevin Smith's direction. I tend to like low-budget movies more than polished, expensive ones, in part because my tastes are classical, and simplicity attracts me. I also admire the inventiveness needed to make a good film with simple means and not much money.This film, for me, succeeds 100% in meeting those goals. Yes, there are moments, several of them, that are contrived, but there is no indication, from the first scene, that the film is intended to be naturalistic. The director later had misgivings about Dante falling out of a closet, presumably because he had to sleep there due to the dog taking up the bed. I think it was a stroke of genius, for it \"warns\" the viewer that strange things are apt to happen in the film. They certainly do--abundantly.SPOILER FOLLOWS:When it came to the last scene, I had a sudden sense of foreboding, and then came the awful ending to the film. I felt shattered and yet I felt that this was exactly right--in keeping with what city life really is. Is it still a comedy? Yes and no. I will be reflecting on the contrast between the body of the film and its horrific ending for a long time, and don't expect to find any easy answers.The friendship between Randal and Dante, who can neither stand each other nor do without each other, is so well portrayed with such simple means that I marvel at the psychological perception required, and used. Randal really is a guy who genuinely wants to help others, and this is slowly revealed through the film. He's clumsy, he's rude, he can be obscene, but he basically has compassion that wins out. I think this is one of the best characterizations I've seen anywhere.I rated this a ten. Before I watched it, I figured it would deserve maybe a four, from what I'd heard of it. I will be watching this one again.",

This proves to be one of the worst days of his life. Things start off with a cigarette revolt and don't get any better from there. I like how Kevin Smith makes the movie around one big line repeated by Dante: \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\" It's just cool to see how one persons life can be ripped to pieces when: your boss lies to you, your ex-girlfriend is \"getting married\" your best friend shows up late for work as usual, and you have to come in on your day off, among an array of other things I don't want to spoil.

            "content": "Clerks (pronounced Clarks) is an old American film that had been lost in the archives for decades. The story goes that when written it was so rude that no distributer dared release it. Fast forward 50 years and we find young American slacker Kelvin Smith who works as a cleaner in movie studios. He accidentally fell into one of the cabinets which contains all Hollywood's movie reels which revealed a secret hole in the wall. Looking inside Smith found the long lost Clerks movie and stole it. After watching it he realised he could become a fat millionaire if he released it- it was the nineties and this was just the sort of comedy that people flocked to see. Being an amateur filmmaker himself he spliced in a couple of scenes starring himself and adding a couple of his favourite songs to the track. Taking his movie to Caines (the Southern French town owned by Michael who runs a yearly film festival there) he hoped his movie would be successful. Low down and behold, he was right! Clerks kick started a new wave of funnies, where people talked about their favourite movies and comics with toilet metaphors and sexy treats thrown in.Clerks (pronounced Clirks) is about 2 friends who work in a shop in Kansas. One works in a Video shop, the other in a greengrocers, but both just sit about bored all day and make fun of the customers as they have a higher intellect. Observe the following exchange: Customer: Excuse me, can I buy this milk? Randy (sighs and tuts): Uh! You f*cking idiot! Of course you CAN buy this milk as long as you have tree fiddy. You should be asking MAY I buy this milk. You are an imbecile. Customer: F*ck you! Randy: Oh\u0085 wow! You must have a Shakespearean grasp of the English language and a huge brain to have thought up such a witty and well developed response. (Customer walks away) Randy: Yeah! Yo Momma!Between customers they climb onto the top of the shop and play an American version of the English game Chess, known as Roof Hockey. Occasionally they argue about their favourite films: Randy: Which did you like better- Police Acad3my 3 or Police Academy 4? Dainty: 3 Randy: You blaspheme! Dainty: Nein! 3 Was when Zedd finally joined the good guys, he screamed at the door and made it fall down, all the other recruits were training again to further their policing skills, and Mauser was much better than Harris. Randy: Idiotte! 4 had tones of great new recruits, hot air balloons, yumma yumma yumma yumma YUM-MA! And Tony Hawk. All 3 had was a bunch of Muppets.So goes their lives. The film is a series of loosely connected skits either dialogue or slapstick based, all revolving around brown jokes. My main problem is that the film is too American. I didn't really get most of the obscure movie references and a lot of the words used are foreign to me. A lot of the time I don't understand the accent and it is made worse by the fact that it is black and white. The film therefore is clearly very old and out of touch with today's language and society. I did enjoy a couple of parts, like when the wench goes into the traps and Spacs up an oul chump, getting a mouth gift in the wrong place. Broxn!Best Scene: When the popular comedy due Joe and Salient Burt are dancing outside; that one scene explained more to me about America in the 1940s than any text book ever did.",

Kevin Smith, the director and writer of this film has realized a vision, broken down walls and demystified the filmmaking process all in the act of making an entertaining film that just happens to be a low-budget, money-making miracle.The film is shot in black and white. OK, so this is going to turn off the kind of people who actually LIKE the colourization of old films, which to film lovers like myself is tantamount to updating the clothes on the Mona Lisa with a halter top or putting a Bic lighter in the Statue of Liberty's hand.The language is at times offensive. Alright, I'll give you that, it doesn't bother me particularly, and doesn't seem excessive given the characters and the situation. Certainly no more cursing than can be found in \"Pulp Fiction\", yet everyone calls attention to the violence in that film, a lesser of two evils sort of thing. But you probably don't want to have this film playing with kids running around.The film is a first effort, and the actors are not the greatest in the world. The script is tight and obviously born out of experience as it's elements are convincingly realistic, and if nothing else, proves that even from a mundane job like a variety store clerk, you can achieve your dreams if you have the courage and desire to make them come true. Kevin followed up these films with what is often referred to as the \"New Jersey Trilogy\" among his fans, with \"Mallrats\" and \"Chasing Amy\". I enjoyed these films to varying degrees, but still find \"Clerks\" more inspired and entertaining than even the hit \"Chasing Amy\", which by all accounts displays the improved techniques of a more mature filmmaker.",

Yet, in my opinion, what the director tried to accomplish (successfully, I may add) is not a realistic depiction of the everyday life of a working man, but rather a SURrealistic approach to the repetitive reality of the common man, which can be tragic, hilarious, or some of both. The fact that the main character feels constantly oppressed by the people surrounding him and by the environment where he works is not emphasized throughout the movie pointlessly; the message that the director wants to get through to us is that no matter how sucked in we are by routine, we still have the potential to change the way we live. And the means the director uses in order to get through to us is comedy. Clerks is a film of high value. Watch it with friends; it will bring up various issues to discuss later...

The story is about Dante a guy who works at a convenience store and his friend Randal who works at a movie rental store next door, and their dislike for customer.I can relate to this film since I worked in a grocery store as a meat cutter for about 2 and half years. While it's not the same as working in a convenience store, I still had to deal with people face to face. There were a lot of customers who I disliked with a passion, because they treated me like a 2nd class citizen at various times. Now doing customer support over the phone, it is still a pain because people still treat me poorly and do not listen to what I have to tell them, because they feel they are better than me.This a great film to watch. The film was made in black and white, which even if it was done in color would have not made a difference. This film has some of the best lines that I have ever heard in a movie, and this is very low budget. The acting is stellar, and is some of the best acting that I have ever heard. There is also some very funny lines and some ones that are just plain genius. Slient Bob only has one line in this film, but it was the best line ever \"You know, there's a million fine looking women in the world, dude. But they don't all bring you lasagna at work. Most of 'em just cheat on you.\" I will say though that this film is not for everyone. If you don't like profanity, than stay away from this film, because it is full of it. If you don't like hearing about porn then stay away from this film. If you never worked a customer service job, or have never had a job before than don't watch this film, you will not understand it.

Perhaps it was the first bit of Kevin Smith that they saw, which lends to nostalgia.  Looking in retrospect, \"Clerks\" suffers quite badly due to mediocre to complete amateur acting. The timing is a little bit off.   Some jokes seem to fall flat, if at all intended to be funny.In comparison, Smith's \"Mallrats\" and \"Dogma\" are laugh-a-thons that also have wit.    Chasing Amy has humour and heart.  Clerks doesn't give too good of a message, and its unclear to me if it even has a plot!As a first film, it's a good effort, but has no comparison to his other features.",

The script is excellent, managing to be outrageously funny at times yet dead serious at others. This movie will make you laugh your ass off then make you ponder things like the meaning of life and the age old question of \"Where do I belong on this Earth?\" The dialogue is from heaven...it's witty and intelligent to the point you can never be bored no matter how long two characters just sit around and talk. It takes a lot of talent to be able to hold an audience's interest on the screen while two characters just chat for 3 to 4 minutes while doing nothing. You will never be bored. The acting is also great because it's just so natural-looking...everyone here gives a performance that makes you believe they really are these people. It doesn't feel like acting.This may not be the best movie ever made and it's certainly an acquired taste...some will ever love or hate it, but it is a damn fine example of what can be accomplished when you have lots of talent yet no money.

Clerks is the beginning of what some may consider a destructive career for Kevin Smith. Some believe that this film is quite possibly the best movie ever made. I, on the other, do not agree with either extreme statement about this film. I believe Clerks has had a dynamic impact on our world, not only entering our pop cultural reference system but also changing the way dialouge is written. I myself believe this film is an incredible deep journey and a mirror on the youth of america. At least that's what I thought when I first saw the film in 1994 and I still stand by that opinion, sorta. My love for this movie decreased a little last year when JSBSB came out and everybody was in this Kevin Smith phase. People totally ripped the movie to shreds, only enjoying it because of quirky toilet humor. Now yes I admit, a good ole' having sex with a dead guy is classic humor, But it's not as great as most of the rest of the film . If your a self-proclaimed movie buff and believe that because you've seen and memorized all of Jay's lines from The New jersey trilogy, then here's my advice to you, sit down, watch this film, and really fully understand.",

Here, it is both.This is a movie that the MTV-generation would only get. Perhaps not ONLY the MTV-generation, but they would get the most out of this film. But to get a full understanding, you have to go beyond that. To look at yourself and others like you and laugh at the absurdity of it all. After all MTV isn't God. It's a multimillion-dollar company hypnotizing teenyboppers across the nation. Old suits  in the sheep's wool of GAP and ABERCROMBIE & FITCH.But back to the movie. Kevin Smith, working on a subzero budget gives us a grainy black & white \"art film\" that the mainstream kiddies wouldn't think they would enjoy. But Kevin Smith, undoubtedly a better writer than he is a director, throws in the crude sex jokes, the ironic situations, the strange customers walking in Dante's convenience store, trying to count the 'perfect eggs' or selling their gum by showing the teens buying cigarettes pictures of cancer patients, etc.We even get our new cult heroes, Jay and Silent Bob! Who, as you probably already know, appear in all the Kevin Smith films so far.This is the first of a trilogy of films set in Jersey, all involving slackers of all creeds. This one involves the main characters, Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson), whose performances are somewhat subtle and very hilarious. But the performances or even the characters don't really matter. Because, like in the next two Smith films, there is always the straight man trying to take the best things his unsatisfying life has to offer and finding true, true love. There is always a comical sidekick who makes all the jokes, the comic book and STAR WARS analogies and looks at pornography all day. These two are both unknowingly doomed(for comic effect), yet there is always a little light at the end of the tunnel.But I'm not saying this makes CLERKS either bad or dumb. Because it's very intelligent, very clever, and very witty. Most of the film either takes place in the convenience mart or the video store next door, but you're never bored or restless watching it.The inside joke is how an ex-video clerk who is obsessed with comic books can make a small movie and kick butt at Sundance to become one of the most well-known and inspiring young filmmakers in America.

I saw this in seventh grade, while my mom was making dinner or something (I don't know I can't quite remember, let's say that she was making chili dogs because those are a good dish). The funny thing is that she didn't start acknowledging the movie until she heard 37 d@icks (I just threw in an 'at' symbol). Why wasn't she paying attention to the movie before, was it because the movie was in black & white and that sort of movie provoked no interest for her, but when she saw that her 12 year old (i might have been 13) was watching a dialogue with 37 d$icks as its topic, she gave a \"look\". When she was recognizing its demographic, she told me that 'you are not buying this movie' (it was a rental, i rented it after I saw the cartoons--another worthy watch) So as such, since the DVD was a five-day rental, I was watched 'Clerks.' every single day of that 5-day period. And each day, the movie just got better and better--it was sweet. Each time I watched it, I felt like I was there, it was a 3-dimensional world of 'clerkhood' that surrounded innocent little being. I loved it and I was even a mature a$$hole just yet. So, if ever you want to see 'Clerks' and take in all for what it is and more, make sure you watch it when you are in the seventh grade, that is if an inexperienced, newly-introduced to the styles of masturbation-6th grader is reading this piece of crap.I sorely recommend this--so sorely that if it must make me embody an irritating zit on your a$$ to persuade you.This was ichabod_crane1899",

It holds one's interest, keeping one wondering what weird thing is going to happen next. But it is not entertaining. Not funny. Not entertaining. So then, what is it? It is a promising first effort by a budding directorial talent. It is good enough to prompt me to watch Kevin Smith's more recent movies, and find out if he has begun to bloom, but not good enough to watch twice. With genuine talent like this, I hope Smith doesn't do a \"Tarantino,\" and wither early on the Hollywood vine from hot flattery and arid vanity. 6/10And speaking of flowers, Clerks is oddly reminiscent of Bridget Bardot's engaging but unfunny 1956 screwball comedy, Plucking the Daisy.\nFor a movie about two laid-back guys that is both witty AND funny, both engaging AND entertaining, go to your video store and check out Midnight Run.",

It's flawed at parts, and it gets slow towards the middle, but a very hilarious, disturbing, and overall shocking scene towards the end pretty much makes up for it. The story takes place in one day of the life of a man named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) who works at a convenience store, who comes to work on his day off. During this period of one day you meet the most interesting, funniest and strangest costumers known to man. Dante works there with the sleazy Video Store employee Randall (John Anderson) who works next door to Dante. Other major characters are Dante's girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) and Dante's ex-girlfriend Caitlan (Lisa Spoonhauer), who broke her engagement with her fiancee to be with Dante. Also, this is the first film to introduce the hilarious duo, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith - who is also the director and writer of the film). If you see this and like it, also rent Kevin Smith's other films Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back.

And I like how it never really goes too far.None of the dialog is there just to be there, it's quite believable that these two guys would say all this. Maybe not in one day, but it's a film after all. Entertainment is more important than realism. For anyone who is still empty headed enough to think the clerks at your local store are just slack jawed idiots, this film should be a real eye opener. Kevin Smith himself was a clerk, and the movie was shot where he worked on a shoestring budget. He's also Silent Bob.The only reason I don't rate this a 4 is simply because I doubt I'll watch this movie more than once.

But the movie also has some of the best one lines in the film all spoken by Randal and also some very funny moments like Dante and Randal playing hockey on top of the Quick Stop store roof, the old man dying on the toilet from masturbating too hard and you can't forget the Jay and Silent Bob scenes.

Things only get worse when bestfriend/worst nightmare Randal(Jeff Anderson) comes in andcontinuously insults innocent customers(Although some of themdamn-right deserved it!).

It is stuffed with insight into the world of movies and sex and life its self. My favorite is Randall's speech on why the end of Return of the Jedi is so wrong because of all the independent contractors that the imperial armyhad to hire to build the death Star quickly and quietly were casualties of a war they had nothing to do with when Lando Calrizzion destroyed the death star unlike when only evil was vanquished at the end of a new hope when Luke blew up the first fully operational death star.DO NOT BE CONFUSED. this is completely different from the cartoon Clerks which is based on the movie but is still not the same.

Again, Wilde comes to mind. Each exchange involving Randall proves to be humorous, as do exchanges involving Lord Henry in Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Grey.\" But it is more than writing style which has aided in the establishment of Smith as a great dramatist, writer and director (something of a Triple Entente of talents), moreso, it is his complete lack of restraint.In this film, as with two of his others (those being \"Chasing Amy\" and \"Dogma\"), he risks blacklisting to push social boundaries and what has been established as \"proper\" behavioural conduct. The dialogue between Randall and Dante, about roles dictating behaviours, comes to mind.And so, for establishing a depth in his story which I find simply amazing (intended or otherwise), Smith's hit the jackpot with this one. Solid gold. 10/10",

Having done the job myself, I can attest that much of what goes on in this movie is not too far removed from real life.  Even its crudeness and vulgarity add an element of realism.  This is a shabby business.While many wince at its profanity, this is the way a great many young people actually talk.  Smith's raunchy sense of humor fits perfectly into this setting.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!This film also shows why most convenience stores have NO public restrooms. This is one of the wildest, most uproarious, darkly comic scenes ever.Lastly, Clerks provides some keen insights, especially on the difficulties of finding oneself.  Dante, the main character, really has a problem deciding what he wants to do with his life.  Obviously, it should be something better than working here.  He also needs to decide which girlfriend he desires (an enviable choice, but it would be an easy one for me).

Well it was a good experience until they hired a new boss. Boy, was she an ass, and a Jewish one at that. But that's another story.When I first watched this movie, I was cheesed that it was in black and white. But after seeing Jay appear on screen, I was hooked. Not only was the dialogue very detailed and odd, but it made real sense if you ever thought about it deep enough. The whole death star dialogue scene with the indie contractors. LOL, what a great way to sum up Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.This was a clever type of humour, almost a black comedy, but not quite. Thanks to this movie, It gave me inspiration into going to film school. Sure, I won't take the same career path by going to that over-priced film school in Vancouver, but I am going to Canada's greatest technical college at Sheridan. And it's all thanks to this movie, more or less. Well, really, it's thanks to the special feature dubbed \"The Snowball Effect\", which is a biography documentary about Kevin Smith, and how he came to fame, it's gonna help me with the report I do on him for Careers in Media.I'd say this movie is a true cult classic. 20 years down the road, we'll still remember this movie and still laugh at the jokes in it. Why? Because we can all relate to these kind of experiences whether you work in retail or not, it's an everyday part of life. I bet that you talk to yourself sometimes when you think deep enough about the world or about one specific topic. You probably even have that kinda analytical conversation with a friend.Gotta love Clerks. I hope to work with you someday, Kevin Smith. I would really love to do a comic book/video game movie with you based on a Star Wars tale. 10/10 for pure originality, dialogue and great amateur cinematography. You know some of you guys make fun of Kevin Smith, even on the show Entourage. But he's the one who set a standard to how an indie comedy should be made. He made a cult classic on a 30k budget. 30k!

From Dante and Randal's talk about Randal's \"head over heals\" cousin in a car, to a man looking for the perfect dozen of eggs, to the seemingly endless parade of insulted customers, this is a classic that was made for only $27,000, most of which Smith himself funded.

Everyone does justice to their characters, but none of the acting rises above mediocre and at times it's obvious that these are only people reciting lines. The camera work is decent, though, and the style helps the acting feel more natural.Even though the quality of the shooting and acting makes it seem like amateur hour-and-a-half, the writing is very good. The dialogue is clever and hilarious, making Dante and Randal seem like real, likable people. They'll discuss things like the deaths of the roofers working on the Death Star in Return of the Jedi and then deal with laugh-out-loud situations like staging a hockey game on the roofs of the stores. Even though most of Clerks is just watching people talk, it's actually interesting and manages to keep up a constant string of laughs.Where it does falter is during Dante's girl troubles, which feel like feeble attempts at drama and, as a result, are boring to sit through and devoid of humor. It should be mentioned, too, that Clerks was nearly rated NC-17 for its highly profane language. Anyone easily offended should stay away.

I wanted to make sure that was out in the open before I tore in to this film.I saw Dogma -- twice actually.  And loved it.  So, with the animated series launching on ABC recently, I thought I'd see what the original movie was all about...My opinion -- a great film.  Why?  Witty dialogue... lets face it -- this film had some great one-liners, but just as many monologues which were well performed.  Reason number two?  I was tired at the end of the film.  A good film will have me tired out by the time I have to press \"rewind\" on the VCR or when I walk out of the theatre.  Comparing this to the indie-style \"Being John Malkovich\" (which, by the way, I walked out on), Clerks keeps the viewer running -- there's always something happening on the screen -- no wasted time.  Malkovich, on the other hand, takes the better part of a bag of popcorn to get to the heart of the plot.  The plot in Clerks is very simple... you don't need to be a brain surgeon to figure it out.  It's there, its of the classic film genre.  (I won't reveal it because if you want to know so bad, go out and rent the film.)I'll wrap up with this -- Smith got me in the tent with Dogma.  I'm going back for a refill on Clerks.  Time to head down to the local video store and check out his other flicks because he's two for two in my books.10/10",

Caitlin would have had to be brain-dead to think an old dead guy was Dante.  But trust me, everything that happened up till that was TOTALLY believeable.",

It is about two drift-about clerks who talk ironically about a myriad of issues as they watch life (and customers) pass by.  It's humor is brazenly audacious, and it is so smart with its attitudes towards apathy, pop culture, and urban life, that you forget you are watching a film by a 24 year old shot for 20K.  Its humor comes not only from pop culture, but from Kevin Smith's perfect understanding of the dilemma that young people face in regards to career, sex, and social life. All that, and it has the funniest demonstration of ironic detachment ever captured on film.  It is as enjoyable a time as you can have watching people do nothing.",

            "content": "I've seen this film way more than 20 times and I'm writing this after having watched it yet again and reading a good portion of the comments.First of all, I understand that one of the reasons this film was done in black and white was because it was all they could afford at the time.  So, what's wrong with black and white films?  I don't know any serious movie or TV show buff who doesn't think it's an abomination to colorize such classics as the original \"Miracle on 34th Street\" and \"The African Queen\" (What's next? Colorization of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton?).  We also know that it would have been \"Just Plain Wrong\" for David Lynch to do such movies as \"Eraserhead\" and \"The Elephant Man\" in color.  As far as artistic value is concerned, I think color would have ruined this film pretty much because as it takes place in a convenience store and video store, the black and white almost gives the effect that you're watching your average neighborhood clerks and all the goings-on through the stores' surveillance cameras.Second, I'd like to mention that it's stupid to think that one would have to be from New Jersey or at least the East Coast to understand anything that's going on in this film or that this satire is a representation of just these areas.  Even before travelling all across the States and Commonwealths of this country, I didn't see or hear anything in this film that was remotely alien or exotic.  Are there really people in this country who have the single-digit-IQ mentality to think that New Jersey is the only place on the face of the planet where people work in places like this and have this kind of attitude towards life, let alone the customers and other things satirized in this film?  Having had the misfortune of working in a video store, I know what it's like to deal with customers who are looking for totally mentally devoid movies, don't know what section to look under when they want a comedy, and other things as well.  Even worse, as is mentioned in the film, is the stunning and embarrassing notion that some people have that working in such a place is anything more to be proud of than landing and maintaining the highly prestigious career opportunity of delivering newspapers or scooping fries. It's something to do for money, start your work ethic, and that's all. Unless, of course, you're the owner of the place.  So, having had the indignity of working in such places, Kevin Smith has delivered us the perfect satire of what it's like being there, plus shockingly silly dialogue of things we all know about but hardly talk about, let alone see on the screen.  Along with that are also the many outrageous, off-the-wall, no-holds-barred lines to remember from this film (i.e. \"So your girlfriend f***ed a dead guy, big deal.  My mom's been f***ing a dead guy for years ... I call him Dad.\")By the way, if you watch the other films first (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma), a really hard critic may find this film to be weak in comparison to the others or just plain weak as a movie by itself.  But remember, this was just the foundation of things to come as Kevin and the View Askew crew developed and matured.  And the others wouldn't have been able to be developed had it not been for the success of this film.Excellent!",

They had a couple of modestly interesting scenes, and that's it.Black and white? Please.Towards the end of the movie it took itself far too seriously.

            "content": "What some consider a comedy classic, Clerks is a great film. While it isn't hysterical fall on floor laughing type of funny, it still has the cases of the funniest, blackest humor there is. Even though this movie has literally no violence or graphic sex in it, this movie was still labeled as an NC-17 by the MPAA due to the great amount of sexual dialogue. If this kind of thing bothers you, then forget even bothering with Clerks, I doubt you'll like it.What Clerks does very well is take nothing but dialouge scenes and turn them into an entertaining movie. While this movie can get a little old and slow after a few viewings, it is still oddly entertaining. It focuses around a day in the life of a convenient store Clerk. Like the tag line would suggest, everyone who enters the store is a complete moron. On top of that, this clerk is torn between his best friend and two women... and he isn't even supposed to be there today.The storyline moves on as two pot dealers, the infamous Jay and Silent Bob, keep causing problems as well as several other ordeals to pop up throughout the day. Smith takes the very simple concept and makes something classic and memorable out of it. I hold Kevin Smith in the highest honor as a comedy director. This movie is a student style of a film, obviously shot on a very poor quality camera, and the actors are great, though young.Again, most of the humor is either a strange sex joke or a piece of black humor, but it's still great if you like that kind of thing. Clerks is recommended to every guy (or girl) looking for a good time with your buds (and I mean that in more ways than one).",

People had raved about the dialogue in the film, this film came 2 years after Reservoir Dogs, and in the same year as Pulp Fiction (Tarantino himself worked in a video store) - these films have good dialogue (Kevin Smith take note).The \"acting\" in the movie looked like a bunch of guys from high school got their hands on a camera, read through the lines together, then released the film. Not a single reaction from any character, plus stumbling through lines does not a good film make.If you want a quintessential '90s movie, refer to the above. Clerks also shared an award with the film \"Fresh\" - watch this instead and see the difference in quality. Who cares if it has a low budget? This film is just low quality.",

The dialog is great and the tempo of gags and insights is non-stop.  It's a straight, unprocessed slice of New Jersey in the Nineties.  One of the best recommendations I can make for a comedy is that it was hilarious stone cold sober.  Go out of your way to catch this movie, it's worth it.The only reason I'm giving it 9/10 is the poor sound.  I expect something made on a low budget to have bad sound, but at some parts it makes the dialog unintelligible.  If you watch it, turn up the treble and turn down the base.

Most of the outbursts and whining of the main characters don't seem as realistic as they should.  You get the impression that they're reading cue cards as they play the roles.  However, the screenplay to this low-budget independent film is brilliant.  It is one of the most unique plotlines that I have seen.  It's original, which is one thing that makes this movie great.  I tend to read into movies too much, but I see nihilism in this movie.  The main characters' lives lack purpose and thus director Kevin Smith seems to be saying that life has little meaning.  Also, the pessimism is interesting too.  Dante keeps getting dumped on.  His life seems to be crashing down, getting worse and worse, and yet he wasn't even supposed to be there.  The movie also seems to show the incredible stupidity of people in general.  I found Randall's comments about the idiots who rent movies to be highly humorous and cynical yet frighteningly true.  The big-budget-bad-acting-no-purpose movies tend to become the popular ones that win awards (i.e. Titanic) while quality movies like Clerks go unheard of.

Smiths character work is perhaps his forte.While they never really seem to have much depth to them(the films revolve around one key issue-usually a relationship crisis)he makes them innately lovable.(think Mallrats's Brodie,or Chasing Amy's Banky-Jason Lee- A God) The situations that Dante is forced to endure(the egg guy and the chewlies gum guy)are ingenious.The slick patois between Dante and Randle is ingenious,its achingly funny while also wickedly intelligent.(it also gets the point across)Clerks never goes so far as to be unrealistic,staying just this side of the fence of credibility.Even the underdeveloped female characters are well written,and although they are little seen,they form the basis for the story,around which all the other s**t revolves. A special mention for Jay and Silent Bob,for while they are hardly difficult roles to portray,it shows just exactly why Jason Mewes is more at home behind the counter of Smiths comic shop than in front of the camera.Despite being very funny(he's given some cracking dialogue by his friend)the amount of times he stutters and stumbles over his lines is laughable.Still,credit where its due,Mewes does improve vastly over the course of Smiths next films,and by the time of Dogma,(where he's given a lot more to do)his comic talents are impressively honed. Clerks is moving proof of what can be achieved without huge studio backing,acres of custom built sets and huge superstars with inflated ego's(and even bigger cheques to sign.)It is intelligently written, and downright hilarious.Just a shame Mallrats couldnt be as good.",

            "content": "When was the last time you had a day at work turn into an existential crisis? If you work in retail or any other service industry for that matter, it's likely more often than you care to admit. If you're Dante Hicks, it was on your day off. Played by Brian O'Halloran, Dante gets called in to cover for a sick co-worker at the Quick Stop convenience store. Dante is joined by his articulate slacker co-worker, Randal (Jeff Anderson), who mans the video store next door, albeit poorly. In between closing shop to play hockey on the roof and getting thrown out of a wake for knocking over a casket, the duo encounters a revolving cast of exaggeratedly eccentric characters; including the loitering drug dealers, Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and writer/director himself, Kevin Smith. An already trying day only gets worse for Dante as he finds himself caught in between his current girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) and his ex, Caitlin (Lisa Spoonauer). Dante is forced into self-examination, with plenty of witty and profane commentary from friends and patrons along the way.Are we defined by what we do for a living? This question seems to be ingrained in almost every scene. Throughout the film, many of the roles are characterized by the person's job. They define themselves by what they do. Each with a different standard for what it means to be happy or successful. Education, sex, relationships, physical appearance, and dealing with fears or anxieties are all addressed in some way, but none more so than occupation. Each customer with substantial dialogue relates via their employment; the Chewlie's gum rep. that incites an anti-tobacco riot. The roofer who weighs in on the Star Wars debate. The personal trainer who insists Dante is out of shape. The most eloquent and insightful, however, comes when a customer states \"It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. That's why I manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination.\"Dante and Randal's outlook and subsequent behavior in this regard is wildly different. Dante believes his job defines him but is unable to change his situation for the better. Begrudgingly, he performs his job duties, for the most part, in consideration of his employer to maintain some semblance of being good at his job. He is obedient and non-confrontational. On several occasions his passive subservience is explicit in his attempts to pacify customers for their inconveniences; letting an old man have a roll of softer toilet paper and a nudie mag to take to the employee bathroom, or refunding money to a customer Randal spits on. When Veronica suggests he quit and go back to school he avoids the notion by saying \"the last thing I need at this point is a lecture\" followed by his oft exclaimed \"I'm not even supposed to be here today\" (Smith, 1994). Randall, on the other hand, either doesn't believe his job defines him, or doesn't care if that is how others perceive him. He is insubordinate and impulsive. He disregards his responsibilities and is content in his deficiency. He confronts Dante, saying \"You overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job. You push f#%kin' buttons! Anybody could waltz in here and do our jobs. You're so obsessed with making it seem so much more epic, so much more important than it really is.\"Shot on a tight budget, and its setting limited almost entirely to the convenience store, the film was shot in black and white as a solution to lighting issues and as a cost saving measure. However, it adds to the overall film by allowing the viewer to focus on the characters and on-screen action without diversion. Efficient and creative use of camera angles keeps the setting from becoming dull. As a result, the film has a unique and pleasant texture and following the characters for the entirety of their workday ties in nicely with the theme.Ultimately, Clerks doesn't offer any profound insights, or even really tackle the question asked by its theme. None of the characters really change in an appreciable way, and for all the trouble they go through, seem likely to continue their lives unaffected. That being said, Dante and Randal are convincing and relatable, the dialog is witty and memorable, and the caricature exaggeration of the customers is genuinely funny, especially to anyone who has had the joy of working in customer service or retail. I think we could all agree with Randal when he says, \"This job would be great if it wasn't for the f#%kin' customers.\" Clerks is a satirical observation of the customer service industry much like Office Space (1999) is of white collar careers, but with its own uniquely charismatic style. I've seen this film at least a couple dozen times now, and it's still hilarious every time.",

And Kevin Smith has done this with piercing precision, with an ear for natural dialogue that matches that of Mamet-esqe perfection. And, for those who find the vulgarity offensive, take a job at a convenience store like that one and you'll see pretty quickly that this is simply incorporating the kind of coarse dialect that is more commonplace in society today than it has been in decades before. As they say, art imitates life. And this is about as true to life as many people have seen on the big screen before.",

            "content": "Clerks is a story about Dante Hicks, played by Brian O'Halloran, a convenience store clerk who gets called into work on his day off. Whereby he is subjected to the daily routine of customers, stoners, a cigarette fine, finding out his girlfriend has more experience in the bedroom than he thought; finding out his ex -girlfriend is getting married to an Asian design major; and finding out his girlfriend from high school died. Not to mention he must figure out how he will make it to his hockey game at 2 pm after the boss flakes out and doesn't show at noon as promised. It's most definitely a dark comedy drama, opposite Dante is his best friend Randal, played by Jeff Anderson who works (more like slacks off and messes with customers intentionally) at the adjacent video store. Randal is a bold, crass, and witty character that doesn't care for his job, but doesn't' hate it anywhere near as much as Dante, he just hates the customers. \nRandal: This job would be great if it wasn't for the f..king customers. (Clerks, 1994)\nThe primary theme of the film is the every- man. The film itself is loosely based on Dante's 9 levels of hell. Do yourself a favor and watch the X anniversary edition of the film with the original ending where Dante dies so you can see both versions to appreciate the fact that you may have never had the rest of the View Askewniverse. Kevin Smith and Mosier create a wonderful microcosm with this film that will span into what is known as the Jersey Chronicles including films like Mallrats and Chasing Amy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and others.\nThis is Kevin Smith's first film and yes, his roughest. Therefore, some would say that some of the dialogue is rushed, or they cannot get past the \"no plot\". I have also heard some say that film quality is low, or editing was not done well. I would argue that the budget plays heavily into that. It was $27,575. He paid more for the soundtrack. Second, Clerks speaks to a generation who grew up in the 80's and 90's youth culture in a way that nothing else out there does. It also speaks to the everyman who has ever had to deal with working with the public and seeing weird stuff, or having that best friend who you argue about random things with. It hits it spot on. As for pacing and rhythm, occasionally, those conversations between friends can become overly passionate sometimes whether it's about their fandoms or music, or life in general. Therefore, speaking rushed when trying to get your point across, or having dialogue \"spew out\" seems wholly appropriate at times. I've had those conversations. I see this as true to life. I think the pacing of the film was done quite well, as was the dialogue.\nThe scene breaks into 9 was a great reference back to our main character Dante and likening it to everyman's Hell, and the original Dante and the divine comedies. Sometimes going to work on your day off can be just that, personal Hell, nonetheless funny. That's just what this movie does it hits the funny on spot. Low budget or not. I can watch it and laugh every time. The dialogue makes the film. It is a great introduction into the View Askewniverse. Well done.",

The idea that a movie can have nothing going for it but a brilliant script, and still turn out to be such a masterpiece, has encouraged other movies to do the same.Clerks is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, a true cult classic that cuts to the core of culture that defines \"Generation X,\" so much so they've never even heard of it.  The dialogue is sharp, right-on-target, wildly inventive and purely hilarious, and the movie's serious side is more profound than a lot of movies not a tenth as funny as this one is.

            "content": "About ten years ago, convenience store clerk Kevin Smith was working at a little place called the Quick Stop when he decided he wanted to make a movie. Lacking a big budget, he shot a film at the place he worked on a very low budget... Ten years later, he has a cult following that no one predicted. Add to that, he's a busy man. Shooting films, commercials, skits and doing a cameo for the recent 'Daredevil' movie, he never has and probably never will run out of steam (Until he retires which he says will be when he's 40). There are also two unique groups of fans. The first are the much smarter group that discuss his film universe, the metaphors behind his films, and the films themselves but the second group are more unfortunate. Usually of the teenage variety, they love the film for their potty mouthed humour and dirty talk and really don't get what's going on and more often than not are a pain in the back side. That's not to say all teens are like that. Some are actually more mature the 20 year old+ fans of Smith's but those are the fans and they are here to stay probably because of one movie that at first was just a small budget pet project then next minute, a huge cult classic. Looking at Smith's films, this film does still feel like his best. It's lacking any real story but in the end, it's really just about a normal day for the unfortunate Dante (Brian O'Halloran). It's also very smart. Filled with obscure literature references and the whole film seems to be loosely based on the play 'Waiting for Godot' which is frequently discussed in the fascinating book 'An Askew View: The Films of Kevin Smith'. Although, in the end, the two things this film is most famous for is the swearing (Although much less than I expected) and the infamous 'Star Wars' discussion which proves to be one of the highlights of the film. In the end, it's a film about a lonely convenience store clerk looking for love and some sort of normal life in this crazy world. All his customers seem to be near psychotics and his best friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) is very depressing most of the time just adding to Dante's wounds. Either way, this is an amazing flick that is useful for two occasions: Feeling phylosophical? Watch this film! Feeling in need of a good laugh and cheering up? Watch this film! It's an amazing piece of work.",

In the end it's not just a great comedy, it actually manages to deliver something that can be called \"a message\", when, after main character Dante has survived possibly the worst day in his life, he has to admit that it wasn't all just bad luck but also a broad hint that he could/should change his life as a clerk.",

We trekked all the way into the ghetto to catch its last theatrical showing at the dollar theatre.  I had never seen it, but one in the group was celebrating his birthday and absolutely loved this flick, so he urged me to make the nine o'clock showing.  We got there, and we were promptly told that Vampire wasn't showing until ten.  This disappointed us all, but my friend was so pumped about seeing the LAST ever showing he went to a nearby Dairy Queen to bide time.  I was not enjoying the bleak ice cream experience of a rainy, hood night overturing me gettin' a sugar headache so I headed solo back across the street.  I was a little embarrassed that I would abandon him so quickly, but he didn't care really. I said I might see another movie, since there were 5 other features showing. No one objected, so I went to the box office, scanned the marquee, and spotted a film entitled CLERKS.I had seen a spot for this movie on a MTV news break, a very short blurb about its nonchalant style of both directing and dialogue.  I was leery seeing a film in all black and white, but since this was the only \"new release\" at the theatre, and since it was only a buck, I bought the ticket, picked up some popcorn, and sat down. . .completely alone in the smallest theatre they had available to experience Kevin Smith's 1994 homage to all things floating in his head while working minimum wage jobs all his life.Five minutes in, and I was hooked.  Every other line I thought to myself two things,\"I gotta get everyone I know to see this.\"and\"Why isn't this a full house?\"Dante Hicks' starts out accidently subbing a shift at his workplace one fateful morning.  But what he doesn't know is that by going in for work that day, he walks in belly-to-the-beast to a very traumatic day.  His best friend Randal doesn't help matters either.  Not only is he constantly breathing down his neck while neglecting his video store responsibilities, but he challenges Dante to be a man he is not while faced with a relationship  .  Clerks is set in one day's time, opening till closing, and packs just about as much great, memorable scenes as it can into all of its 100 minutes.Not only is the camera work simply a forumn for the actors to tell the story (as, at its basics, it should be), but the coziness of the scenery makes you feel like you could pick up a pack of cigarettes from the very place.  I feel honored and privileged to feel like I've been with Kevin Smith's career from the very beginning, because he is without question my favorite director, and I will be forever indebted to him, if not for the connection he's given me, for the haunting significance of the number 37.See also the technical prequel, Mallrats and the final film in the Jersey Trilogy, Chasing Amy.\"Jay and Silent Bob will be back in Dogma.\"",

Dante faces girlfriend dilemmas, accusations of being a nazi and selling cigarettes illegally, the constant mindless yet perversely well-thought out ramblings of his friend and co-clerk, a hockey game, a funeral and a corpse...all with the added sting that he wasn't even supposed to be working that day in the convenience store.  I think the alternate ending was definitely the worst possible ending for the worst possible day, and therefore perfect.The film is definitely strong on the language and crude topic side of things, but beyond that you have a very funny film and a very witty look at the underside of suburbia.  9 out of 10.",

Although the dialog was probably shocking at the time, it has lost its edge over the years. While the plot (really more like \"content\" since there is no plot per se) is interesting, the actors all seem like they are reading the script for the first time. It is no wonder that none of them have had much of a film career since. The film was made on a low budget and certainly looks like it. I saw Chasing Amy years ago and loved it, and wanted to see where Kevin Smith got his start. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed in what I saw. Maybe 10 years ago on the big screen it would have had a bigger impact. But 10 years later on DVD, it has lost whatever edge it once had. Time has not been kind to this movie. I think if Kevin Smith were making his first film today, he might have made Napolean Dynamite, which probably owes its genesis to Clerks. I guess you could say the primary reason for seeing Clerks now is purely historical.",

This film is filled with delightful qwerky conversations and situations, and despite some suspect acting at times - is often hilarious. With lines like 'I hate people, but I like gathering, isn't that ironic?' and the in depth discussion about the morals behind The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Not forgeting the superb debut, of once of the best comic duos in film history - Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith respectively)This is Kevin Smiths debut film - and all the potential, clever ideas, and character studies of the lowlifes with nothing to do all day - is followed nicely in Mallrats and Dogma. Along with Chasing Amy - which is a little more mainstream (well by his standards).If only there were more films like this. Rather than the Armaggedons, Rocks, Mummys etc of this world. Which had the refreshing change of actually making a film where some thought went into it- and wasn't just about following some recipe to make money. I'm waiting for the time, when good films become popular - well according to current life expectancies I've got about 58years to wait, it might not be long enough.In summary- WATCH THIS FILM - (p.s. it can take a little time to get into it)",

It's more amazing that heactually evolved into a legitimate film maker with such complete\"real\" films as Chasing Amy and Dogma..Clerks will survive in film history as monumental in the field oflow-budget indie film.  Kevin Smith will hold his place in filmhistory because he gets better with each of his films.  Clerksintroduced great dialogue to the world of indie comedy and it is toSmith's credit that he ended up adding a talent for directing andcasting to the mix in the rest of his films.

            "content": "I have to place this Kevin Smith picture in a class of its own.  It has that raw feel proving that you don't need a big budget to make a fabulous and witty movie.  Full of great dialog, hilarious jokes, and on screen antics drawn out by a perfect yet unknown group of 20 somethings that make up the cast.  It's not too hard to figure out what this movie is about.  A day in the life of a convenient store/movie rental clerk.  This one really put Kevin Smith on the map.  Most people swear off black and white films, but this format doesn't take away from the story one bit.  More or less adds to the effect.  Dante and Randall are known as the two main characters of the story.  And it is all about the people and situations they are confronted with.  When you see this film, you can really relate to the people that frequent the store.  From the milk maids, rude customers, and boneheads who pose such idiotic questions.  The role of Dante was written for Kevin Smith, hence Dante having the best dialog.  But Smith realized early on that he could do a much better job on both sides of the camera by just simply playing Silent Bob.  Another member of the cast would be Jay, Jason Mewes, a long time friend of Kevin Smith.  It is obvious that this guy is burnt around the edges, but says and does some of the funnies things in the movie. Some of the big thumbs up of this movie, are Olaf Olafson, the Russian metalhead, the nagging toilet paper/porno mag customer, and a song appearing on the soundtrack by Alice in Chains.  Can't really add too much more, for you have to see the movie for yourself.  But I can say that the movie is divided as Dante's Inferno.  Full of continuity and teleprompting, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect.  I have seen this movie ten plus times and listened to the director's commentary over three times.  Clerks cannot be compared to any other Kevin Smith project.  I give this movie a 5/5 for being witty, fast paced, and laugh out loud hilarious.  Can get this one fairly cheap at almost any department store.  It is an honor to have this as part of your movie library.  And be sure to check out the deleted scenes to see the shocking alternate ending which was shown early on at some of the film festivals.",

And I always loved Corman and lower budget movies in general.(Even Mark Borchardt's COVEN) That love does not, however, extend to this movie.To give the movie even more slack, I liked Brian O'Halloran's portrayal of Dante: a likable guy who I was actually rooting for, even as he is ready to dump a perfectly good girlfriend for a questionable one. I think the opening of this movie is great, and like pretty much any scene where it's Dante and his girlfriend. (The cigarette thing was really forced humor in my opinion)Then starts the march of the assholes, Randall and Jay (Silent Bob really isn't a character, so i'm not classifying him as either) Jeff Anderson, I guess, isn't such a bad guy, and I guess he is actually trying in this movie, but I spent the whole movie wanting something to happen which removed him from the plot. His scenes where he demonstrates his fixation with semen and penises don't even seem to be trying to be funny, except to Middle Schoolers who think the word \"shit\" is funny in any context.I wish most for two modifications to this movie: A. Kevin DOES use his robbery ending, B. he pegs Randall instead. Same for Jay. While Jason Mewes may have had a really horrid life (If what I heard about his mom from Kevin is true) that doesn't make his Jay character any more than the annoying bastard who you just want to leave. While I'm all for loading movies like KIDS with these guys, they aren't funny. And when you get down to it, it's no surprise to hear than he was stoned or drunk most of his performance. As for the rest of the movie, Smith's allegedly brilliant dialogue is, i think, overrated. I can only guess it was called that because people think he's some kind of little guy. I think there's only one good line in the whole thing( it's from Randall), and that's only because I hate my dad too. (Well, Dante has some good ones, but they aren't funny)The premise of guys at work just getting through a day, however, I find to be the best possible premise a movie could have, and I much prefer black and white film stock to color. (though there's not enough contrast in this movie)Incidentally, Smith can cram the cartoon that comes before the movie up his ass. (This might be because I've met people who have been molested, so I guess people will say I'm biased against having a good time) In short, watch if you think cum is hilarious, don't care that a movie seems to be trying to be a lot of things without really being any of them, has a good premise it doesn't pursue, a few interesting characters scattered amongst endless ranks of unfunny schmucks, is in black & white and cheap.",

            "content": "More often than not, I will watch a movie for a second time in a row because it exceeds my expectations; the more you think about it, the more you like it. Clerks is a film that is proven to do this upon your first two or three viewings.About 10 years ago, I watched Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back for the first time, and stumbled upon what's known as the View Askewniverse, a series of films created by Kevin Smith. This legacy began with the film \"Clerks\", and the story behind how this film was made BLOWS MY MIND.To fund the film (which was made on a $27,575 budget), Kevin Smith cashed out his life savings, unspent college funds, insurance money from a flood that destroyed his car, maxed out 8 to 10 credit cards with $2,000 limits, and even sold the majority of his priceless comic book collection. Smith shot the film in the span of three weeks at the convince store he was working at in real life during closing hours overnight (10:30 pm to 5:30 pm), as he was not allowed to film inside the store during the day. He lost copious amounts of sleep in the process, as he worked from 6:30 am to 10 pm during the day, and shot the film every other hour, starting at 11 pm and ending at 4 am. He only got ONE HOUR of sleep every night for THREE weeks. If that's not dedication to work, I don't know what is. Not to mention at least most of the finished budget went towards the rights to the soundtrack.As an adult who works at retail, Clerks is a movie that I can relate to. It's a movie with a zany variety of weird and clueless customers (played by Smith's friends), store clerks who feel as if there is nothing going on in life and want more, and discussions on the topics of philosophy, ideals, and popular culture. It's the story of Dante (a put-upon clerk torn between two women) and Randal (A wisecracker who holds his own against said clueless customers) as they slack their way through the day, playing hockey on the roof and going to a wake, all while Jay & Silent Bob deal drugs in front of the store.The acting is pretty well done, especially considering that almost everybody involved either film was an unknown. Clerks made stars out of these people. The dialog is pretty well written (and it was vulgar to the point where Clerks nearly received an NC-17 rating), with editing and cinematography that, while a trifle choppy, nonetheless add to the film's grounded and realistic atmosphere. This approach is complimented by the use of a Black & White camera, which was primarily utilized for to the fact that the film was a REALLY on the cheap affair. This then brings us to the story.The story is pretty well written for something that was shot on such a small amount of cash (cash made from pawning off every asset Smith had in his pocket, as well as an additional $3,000 from his parents when the camera could only be rented with cash). Dante is a man torn between a woman he once dated in high school and a woman he is currently dating who wants him to go back to college. He works at a convenience store with his friend Randall who runs the video store next door. Randall is a carefree young man who causally rebuffs his customers, rude or not. Throughout the day, they encounter every last type of customer a customer service associate could encounter, while going on a handful of misadventures once Dante's boss inexplicably leaves town for a while.In conclusion, Clerks is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for people who have worked customer service jobs, have a desire for filmmaking, and/or love raunchy comedies. I personally am all of the above. If you haven't watched Clerks yet, give it a go.",

Clerks is by far Smith's best film, and one of the best low budget flicks of all time. The script is not so much what works here, but it's the dialogue that does. There is no real A- B-C plot. We follow two twenty-something guys working at register jobs they hate in New Jersey as they take in a day's worth of ignorant and annoying customers. The genius of this movie is Smith's razor sharp dialogue, like something out of Ben Hecht's mind. The dialogue goes back and forth with such enthusiasm and explicit timing that we feel like we are watching a 1940's screwball comedy, only this time Cary Grant was allowed to say \"all holes filled with hard c*ck.\" The film truly encapsulates what it was like to be a youth in the early 90's. It defined a generation. Kids are disrespectful and lazy and this film rocks that notion. Everyone has had a job they hate, and helped customers they despise. The beauty of this film is we can all relate to being in their position at one time or another. There are several \"oh I totally agree\" moments (i.e. when the guy asks Randal at the video store if he has that movie with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year?\"). Clerks is a social commentary whether it wants to be or not. It satirizes how dumb the average citizen is and how lazy the average twenty year old is. Every customer in this movie does something foolish to get the \"clerks\" to make fun of them somehow (i.e. \"the milk maids\" or the women who keep looking through the milk for that later expiration date, even though it will never be there). Don't expect beautiful cinematography or thunderous direction here. Expect to see a profile of what it is like to be a youth in this country, long monologues of witty but pointless dialogue (i.e. construction workers on the death star, everyone's favorite), and one of the best low/no budget movies you will ever see.",

I looked at these Dante and Randall and I could see myself in their shoes:  people calling in sick on my day off, slacking on the job, being pestered by strange customers(yes, even I got the \"no ice in my coffee, you expect me to drink it hot?\").  The humor is raunchy and thats how I like it.  Jay and Silent Bob are great as the other slacking duo. From introducing Olaf to giving dante dating advice to pranking Randall, what is there not to like?  In fact, I think a good portion of the film is trying to see who are the better slackers, those without jobs or those actually working.  What really stays in my mind, though, is the realization is that Dante and Randall will be working their jobs until they die and they know it.  If that day didn't shake them up, nothing will.  Though its reaching, from that perspective, it could be seen as a $30,000 stay in school message.",

However the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see in a movie so famous.  This is not really a bad thing though, bear in mind this movie was made by maxing out credit cards and going for broke.  The movie really deserves a lot of respect for opening up a sub genre in comedy that excels far and beyond traditional phallic flatulent humor.\nThe downside to the movie though is its aging.  Perhaps it's because I got older; but the characters now seem annoying and pathetic when at first they seemed like legends.  It really doesn't matter though as this movie is just too good.  The dialog is amazing if you get past the acting.\nI recommend this movie to any intelligent person under the age of seventeen, and any average person under the age of twenty five.

It just reflects how when you get that point of your life when you got to figure out how you are going to get through life. Dante and Randell are not going to take any risks, instead they are going to live in their hometown (parent's house) and work at a mediocre job for the rest of their lives.Dante's relationships with Veronica is his path for him to move on with his nothing of a life to maybe a future of taking risks. Then there is Veronica where he is trying to regress to his high school days. It is sad that Dante doesn't realize that she is the past move on. Dante situation I think most people go through a period of not knowing where to go. We got choices to regress or make progress. That is something the movie really got me to thinking.Dante's and Randell's friendship is the beginning of the friendship with two guys that can be seen in Superbad. Randell is hilarious and that is how I will always typecast Jeff Anderson. Least favorite parts: Black and white (it just scares away casual film viewers from watching) There was a whole film sequence that was not film which would be entertaining to see. Favorite Parts: 37, Berserker,Happy Scrappy Hero pupRecommendation: Buy it and then put it on your ipod because of being so dialog heavy",

Evidently from the outset, with the black and white contrasts and shoddy camera work, you could be forgiven for thinking \"oh no, not another poor misguided attempt at hitting the big-time\" but oh, how you would've been wrong if you'd switched off there and then.Kevin Smith utilizes his artistic, comedy and scriptical genius to an extent that shows you really can have a funny, whity and intelligent film which deals with mature issues in a slapstick motif which still gets the message across (the chewing gum promoter guy at the beginning as an example) and genuinely gives you the feeling that these guys know what they're doing. And by god, they're doing it well.  Kevin Smith as Silent Bob and Jason Mewes as Jay are without a doubt the most rudest combo in movie history. But this only suffices to make them more watchable as the stuff they say actually has importance and relevance of moral and political issues which in today's society seem to be all-conquering.  This isn't just some immature film littered with profanity and sexual innuendo (although it does play a major part), it is genuinely a film of maturity beyond its years with fantastic dialogue and intricate and numerous sub-plots which show that the need for big budgets is not all-important in today's modern movie business.I've always said that if Clerks had had a huge budget that it would've been one of the best films ever made and one which would be well known for its improviso methods and personal feelings from multiple angles of different issues which are predominant in today's society.   Kevin Smith is one of the un-sung and un-noticed gems of today's directing world and has shown he is more than capable of mixing with the big boys.Clerks is a must-see, and a must-see over and over again for there's always a sub-plot and a meaning to discover that you never noticed when watching it before.  Quality film despite often \"woody\" acting which can simply be put down to inexperience - just look at the camera work :-)10/10",

I remember watching Jay & Silent Bob Strike back on TV. I loved it and decided to check out some more Kevin Smith movies, which was subsequently when I found Clerks. It cost around \u00a316, which was nearly all of the money I had in my back pocket. I got it home, watched it, and was horrified that I had spent so much money on a black and white, action lacking, initially slow paced movie. I could not help but feel incredibly short changed by the store and almost went back to get my money back. But after watching the second time, I could not help but feel captured by the indescribable aura of the movie. It took me a second viewing to realise that the black and white images, motionless camera, slow paced story, hammy acting and the fact that the dialogue is the only thing carrying the movie was actually what made it so great! It sounds unbelievable but its true and I'm sure it could never be replicated now, ten years later. Therefore this movie has become a cult classic and is definitely worth every penny I spent.The three disc DVD offers a ton of bonus features, and if you're a Smith fan like myself, you will love it all. The almost forced jokes that the amateur actors spout are impeccably funny that will have you howling for days and I can honestly say that this movie deserves all the praise it can get. Buy it.

Like a dirty comedy album, that kids would introduce to others, \"Clerks\" became a staple in my life.  I first saw the 27,000 dollar Cannes film.  I fell in love with this story, these characters, and Jay and Silent Bob!  I was a clerk myself at the time, and the movie struck me as very frank and real.  The film started a whole world of stories and people, known as the \"Jersey Series\", (consisting of \"Mallrats\", \"Chasing Amy\", \"Dogma\", and the untitled final \"Jersey Film\".) First viewing this film, you need to forget that this film is very low budget, you don't know anyone in this movie, (unless you've seen any of the above \"Jersey\" films) but, that will change after you get into the film, it is well put together, for it's low budget, and the story is pretty simple to follow long enough for you to adapt. If you aren't a huge fan of vulger language, and intelligent gross-out humor, than this movie won't apeal to you, but if you can see past that, and you love snappy, witty, realistic diologue, than this movie will impress you.  Kevin Smith (writer, director, actor) put together a wonderful cast. Every one is so well placed, and are treated as an equaly important charactor as the next.

This is indeed a very quality flick, but I can see why it wouldn't be for everyone. But, speaking from the perspective of a video store clerk who quite often has to deal with douche-bag customers, I can sorta relate to this movie, and that reason, and dozens of others, it remains one of my favourites...It's a shame that the Region 4 DVD is just dodgy, and has literally no extra features (short of scene selection :P)anyway, if you haven't seen Clerks, and want a good laugh,be sure to get it out next time you're at your local video store.8.5/10",

It seemed to take forever to get behind the counter. And that whiny \"I have a game at 2\" bit was forced in the opening call. I thought I remembered Jay and Silent Bob in more of it, but I guess not. Maybe the new DVD has more then the Laser Disc had.",

I've never worked as a clerk (unless you count sometimes when I have to ring up some of the customers at the record store I work at now). But I've worked at a couple of different stores, a supermarket and my current job, as a sales associate at - you guessed it, a record store. The idiots in \"Clerks\" are almost as stupid as some of the people that I have to deal with on a daily basis.I don't see how Dante (played by Brian O'Hallaran) and Randal (played by Jeff Anderson) put up with these people without going insane. Especially a man I affectionately call \"The Egg Man,\" who insists who checking all the eggs, breaking them, putting them in his mouth and just annoying the sh** out of Dante, Randal, or anyone else in the store, just so he can get the perfect dozen. Or the \"Milk Maid\" who insists on digging through the gallons of milk in the search for a gallon that \"won't go bad for, like, a decade. And I know what it's like having to deal with f***s who will not go somewhere else to do their dirty deeds, i.e. Jay (Jay Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, who did a fine job of directing the movie as well), though some of their craziness was knee-slappingly funny (yes, in case you haven't figured out, I'm from the South).Made for less than $30,000 AND in black and white, I am impressed with how just totally awesome \"Clerks\" is (excuse my grammar). The script (?) is wickedly funny, the dialouge is witty and the grainy feel is perfect. And, even if you haven't worked as a clerk, say if you were merely working somewhere, you will know where this movie is coming from.\nMy problem (and this is nitpickiness at its worst) is that the women in the cast weren't given much to say and that a good deal of the acting left much to be desired (then again, if YOU only had $30,000, you're not gonna be getting Julia Roberts or Bruce Willis to do your movie anytime soon). But the hilarity of it, the situations and the stupid customers, totally make you forget about the second-rate acting.Highly recommended, though there is some harsh language; so it's not for the weak of heart.",

Kevin smith crafts a funny picture, whilst injecting a healthy dose of introspection, it's theme of age (simply put) and the complexities that surround it.The two lead characters Dante and Randall are instantly personable and charming. Their conflicting personas, both a driving force in the plot but also help flesh out the characters as a whole.The film explores the theme of Youth to adulthood, choice, and certainty. The characters reflect the uncertainty of that transitional period. They deal with occupation/careers, death and adult relationships. There are clearly some characters that exercise more agency than others (eluded to, through the reiterated line \"I'm not even supposed to be here today\") and the fact that it takes place over the course of one day demonstrates how fast one has to \"grow up\" without a guidebook. I don't want to go into specifics, see for yourself, it's not that hard to read but enjoyable nonetheless.However, the film clearly has its failings (understandable given the nature of the process but they can't be ignored). Some of the actors are a little hit or miss and I found myself shouting at the screen because some of the character choices were a tad stupid, going against how that character would act for the plots' sake.

The characters don't develop at all, they are exactly what you expect them to be since they are clerks. They have boring regular lives which is what the director wanted. However they don't develop past that at all during the film. Second there isn't any point whatsoever to this film. All it is, is us watching two clerks do absurd things that a normal clerk doesn't do and see them using absurd language towards customers. This is supposed to be a satire on what its like to be a clerk?? Come on at least make it believable. I've been a clerk before and they don't close down the store nor not have a manager around during the day.The jokes are mostly lame too. I only laughed maybe 5 times during the movie. My advice is skip this movie, you'd get a better satire of clerks if you go to your neighborhood convenience store and sit there for two hours.",

The  feeling you got that Jay and maybe Randall was gay was also clever and very amusing.This is another good example of the decent work to come out of the Sundance festival. Kevin Smith came out of this film shining, sadly the actors could not match his quality.

That is hard to argue with.In my humble opinion, the main beauty of this movie is the dialogue. I don't know if there was a script or not, but it seems as though this entire movie was improvised. It's that funny and flows that easily. Sure the subject matter and language is often harsh, but who wouldn't want to sometimes say to customers what Dante, and especially Randall, get away with saying. The \"title dictates behavior\" conversation is one of my favorites.I imagine some of you work at a video store...who wouldn't want to place an order in front of a customer like Randall did? That was pure classic...again, a little harsh, but pure classic.\"Clerks\" isn't going to be on the top of everyone's list...and I highly doubt that was the goal of Kevin Smith when he made the flick.

I'll wager that there isn't much, so bear with me because I'm sure you've heard all of this before.I love this movie.  It wasn't my first Kevin Smith experience, I ignorantly watched Mallrats first at the behest of my brother not knowing there was continuity within the series.  The first thing that hit me when the movie began was the color, my father pointed out \"is it going to look like this the whole time?\"  I had no big problems with the black and white color scheme, especially when I found out how small a budget this film had.  Which brings me to my next point.  Clerks was made for just under $27,000, an unheard of budget in todays world of overbudgeted, untalented so called epics (Fellowship of the Ring excluded, I love that movie.)  Smith made that money work.  The talent he got to play the main characters Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) were perfectly casted.  There are moments in the movie when the acting seems a bit forced, like they are reading their lines, but for basically rookie actors tackling major roles, they do just fine and those moments of forced acting are few and far between.  The rest of the cast is just as good and the film is littered with rememberable dialogue.How can you not admire Kevin Smith here?  Though rarely named his best film among his fans, Mallrats usually gets that title, Clerks is as great a breakthrough film as you could ask for.  Kevin Smith out did himself here and did a great job introducing us to the wonderful characters Jay and Silent Bob, Randal, Dante, and the Askewniverse which is a character unto itself.  Few minor problems aside, this is a great flick and should be missed by none.  9/10",

Dante is a shop clerk who normally gets in trouble thanks to his friend Randal, a troublesome boy who also works in the shop, for example, Randal showed a picture of a gaping vagina to a customer, he often annoys other customers, and gave cigarettes to a 4 year old, which caused Dante to lose 2 of his friends (I believe). Later on in the film, we discover that Dante's girlfriend \"Veronica\" had sex with a dead body, which became a major impact to me. Dante and Randal are seen wrestling in one scene, seriously injured, but then they make up for all the trouble that happened. There WAS an original ending to the film, which was Dante getting gunned down by a robber, which at first I didn't know it was there, but I was happy that wasn't the original ending, because it didn't have any context to the film, it happened randomly, and it wasn't essential for the film.

They way his characters and events are kept alive throughout the movies, and the range of funny characters he creates, such as, of course, the unforgettable Jay and Silent Bob Jason Mewes and Smith). His films are a bit like, as mentioned in his films, the John Hughes Illinois flicks, except in a 90's way, and with adults. Clerks (1994)was the Sundance and Cannes Film Festival favourite, and the one that started it all.The film chronicles a day in the life of two clerks in Leonardo, NJ, one, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran, who would make himself visible in every View Askew flick yet to come, except maybe a few of the less-known ones) working at the Quick Stop convenience store, and the other, Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson, in his first acting role) at the RST Video next door. Dante is a little pissed that he has to work on this particular day, as he had planned to play hockey with Randal and the others at 2 p.m, however, Arthur, who's shift he is taking, had called in sick, and his boss tells him he will relieve him of his post at 12 p.m. Dante and Randal basically spend the day doing nothing much, except talking about which customers they hate, and why, the average pay of a gizz mopper (you figure it out), the two stoner idiots hanging around outside the store selling pot, how all the prices in end in '9,' among many other things, and Dante and his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), arguing over how many people they've slept with, and how many people she's gone down on, and a spanner is thrown in the works for Dante when his old flame Caitlin Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer) comes back to town to see Dante when she is supposed to be marrying an Asian Design Major named Sang.This film is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. Some people may find it boring, but that is obviously because they can't appreciate Smith's art of making a film verbally funny, and not so much physically. The movie isn't just talking and fooling around the whole way through, there being a few surprises along the way, such as Dante closing the store so that they all can play hockey on the roof, and them both going to the wake of a friend of theirs, Julie Dwyer, who had an embolism pop in he brain at the YMCA Pool while swimming, which would be further explained in Mallrats (1995).I think that anyone with a decent sense of humour will adore this film, and even if you're the most boring person in the world, you'll find something funny in it. If you're going to watch the 5 main Askewniverse films, watch them in order. It doesn't matter quite as much, but it is better.\nFor a film made on a budget of $27, 575, I think it kicks ass. Go and rent it if you're in the mood for a laugh, and look out for Jay and Silent Bob, and notice how much they change between here and when they go on to star in their own film, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).Beau's Rating: ***** out of *****",

            "content": "While there are a lot of great movies that have been made, some are movies that NEEDED to be made (ie.Boyz N The Hood or American Beauty). Clerks is one of these films. A lot has been made of the micro-budget and actors playing multiple roles. Forget that, because it can make people like the film out of sympathy. This film is a classic because it has the two ingredients that every good movie needs: good acting and one of the finest screenplays ever written. Forget Raging Bull, forget Lord of the Rings, this is the movie every director wishes he made.While the events that transpire are hilarious, what makes them so complete is that after the laughter I thought to myself and realised how accurate Kevin Smith's portrayal of consumerist America is.You would also think that because the film is in black and white it takes away from the enjoyment, when in fact, it adds to the charm of the film. Whenever I see the `Kwik Stop' in Smith following films in technicolour it doesn't look right somehow.If you are a brown-nosing, stuff-shirted lover of surburbia then this film isn't for you. it was made for every person who hates their station in life but has the guts to do something about it. The voice of youth truly cries out to be heard in this movie and it is heard loud and clear. One of the funniest films you'll ever see.",

With hilarious outcomes to each different scenario that keeps the audience laughing.

The whole movie is in black and white, despite being made in 1994 but that adds to the uniqueness of the film. Brilliantly written and directed by Kevin Smith (who also gives himself a small role in the film as \"Silent Bob\"), the movie will keep you laughing hysterically for the entire 90 minutes.Clerks was a jump start for Kevin Smith's career and it also introduced us to two characters that would appear in another 6 films together (Jay and Silent Bob), 5 of those directed by Smith himself.Clerks is an hysterical, unique cinematic classic and is recommended for all those who enjoy vulgar comedy.",

The script is flawless with more memorable and hilarious moments than any other movie of the 90's. The movie is truly independent and there's nether any sign of hollywood style (black-and-white, no-plot, unusual plot), shcmaltz etc. It's incrediably entertaining as well and you'll wish it would never stop. The movie is also very thought provocking and intelligent as well. It's quite sad as well in a way but nether depressing. The thing I like about Kevin SMith is his way of making each of his movies into something different. 'Mallrats' his follow up was essentially a slapstick comedy (althogh it was undeniably very funny), while 'Chasing Amy' was a comedy-drama.However my second favourite of the 'Jersey' films is 'Dogma'. Whatever but Clerks is a must for anyone and a MUST - BUY",

I have hardly ever been so wrong. The acting is brilliantly natural, conveying the feelings of people who (and I include myself in this) have done jobs that they need, and are given, very little training or appreciation for. It's lack of commercial draw allows you to expect nothing when you begin to watch it (and it is also one of it's greatest advantages), so you can let yourself become totally involved in it's brilliance without feeling that you have to be enjoying what you are seeing.

Its testament to the razor sharp script and brilliant performances that a film with such low production values and aesthetic ineptitude can be so good. The black and white gives it a slightly arty, yet somehow not arty feel (if you know what i mean. Do you?); In fact, this is as far from an art film as can be. I would include my favourite quote if it weren't so \"screamingly offensive\". My second favourite - \"I do not appreciate your ruse, ma'am\" . I wonder whatever happened to Jeff Anderson (playing Randall). He created the most likable and witty character i have ever seen, the epitome of all that i deem cool if you like, with his simultaneously laconic and impassioned delivery. The script clinches it though. Surely Kevin Smith is a gift from god. Granted Mallrats was a bit lame but had its moments - \"once i've kissed you, you're not the same as before - you're changed.\" and Chasing Amy was great until the melodrama took over (not that the melodrama was badly done, it just wasn't funny...obviously). I've not yet seen Dogma although i'm told its disappointing. But if Kevin Smith wrote the dialogue then there cannot fail to be good moments. In theory... Anyway, Clerks is perhaps my favourite film ever. Well, of the nineties. It deserves nothing less than 10/10. So thats what i gave it.",

Smith seems to me to be like Kubrick in one respect; they both are perfectionists in a single aspect of their work.  For Kubrick it's always the visual sense, primarily the use of lighting in his scenes.  Smith's focus, of course, is dialogue.  Both have also had their successes and failures, and I think these happen mainly when their perfectionism drives them too far away from their audience.  Kubrick with Eyes Wide Shut and Smith with Mallrats are in this light both excellent examples of the same problem, an intense focus on one aspect of moviemaking leading to inattention or a lack of concern for others.  Both of these directors (Kubrick when he was alive) know and knew of their deficiencies.  Smith is admittedly ignorant about framing his shots and lighting them as Kubrick was about scriptwriting.  For both of these guys their strong points are both their key to greatness and their crutch.  The effect is that when these strengths work it's good film and when it doesn't it's junk, no matter the budget.",

Dante and Randall also deliver with awesome lines, notably the Star Wars discussion (always good in Kevin Smith's films).

I love that this has a unique voice, that it is a product from the 90's which in my opinion was the best era of low budget films and I wish other filmmakers today too note. Back then when someone said independent films they meant low budget but now Hollywood has taken that and poured millions into a movie that just isn't the same and yet they call it \"independent\" film. Now we have to ask is it low budget or...? Point I'm truing to make is there is a bug difference between the indie films of the 90's and the indie (not indie really) films of today. To me I like watching someone do something special with little money and Clerks is not only fun to watch it's impressive too. Kevin Smith is also a really cool guy from what I've seen and he doesn't take himself too seriously and that's a good thing.I recommend this film! Have fun.",

It does take extreme talent, devotion, and risk in order to create, virtually out of nothing, A TRUE MASTERPIECE.This film is centered around a day in the lives of two clerks; one working in a small time convenience mart and the other hardly working at a small time video rental store.  The video store and the convenience mart are connected together just like all the characters are connected through their ultra realistic events that bring their lives into contact.  The antics, personalities, hang-ups, and life views of the characters touch on the life making decisions forced on almost all young adults in a very intriguing and entertaining way.  What more can be said about the extreme talent and comical insight of Director/Actor/Producer Kevin Smith.Jason Mewes, Jay, is Silent Bob's sidekick.  Together they form one of the greatest comedic teams ever to hit the big screen.  Kevin Smith has single handedly made successful acting careers for some of the characters in this film that would have probably never considered acting in the first place. As I am told, the only actor in this film with any training or even a small amount of acting experience is the convenience store clerk, Dante. Everyone else in the film, thanks to Kevin Smith, bring out the very best in themselves in order to make this film spectacular.If you haven't seen this film, stop cheating yourself.  You as well as all people are too wonderful to miss out on the best directed, intellectually thought out, and probably best 90 minutes you will ever spend.

Kevin Smith's writing is the real star of the film although like most of his movies the second half is not nearly as well written as the first half. He is a very talented writer and director but for his to prosper in Hollywood he has to get out of the Jersey genre and do a movie without his perennial cast of characters and without references to his previous movies...enough is enough.

That's just where it begins.Clerks is a movie about two slackers (Dante & Randal.) Dante works at an ill-maintains convenience (the kind you dread to enter on a road trip to avoid kooky clerks and a grungy bathroom) but instead the clerk is a slacker (Dante) and the bathroom has no lights after 5:00 P.M. (you'll understand.) Dante is a college dropout he's caught up in an unhealthy relationship with his girlfriend (Veronica) mostly because she's ambitious and he's well a college dropout. Randal is Dante's counter-part and works at a lousy video-store next to Dante's place-of-business. Randal is worst off career-wise on account of he's not even a college drop-out. Reason I only mentioned career-wise is Randal isn't caught up in an unhealthy cycle with a significant-other and isn't physcologically self-destructive.The movie isn't a satire of work but a parody of 'The Divine Comedy,' which is a poem that is credited as one of the first depictions of hell. The reason it's a parody and not a satire is that it shows that not work can be hell but life can be if you make it hard on yourself. Dante makes live a living hell with the words 'I'm not even supposed to be here today!' While Randal makes the best of life and work by renting hermaphrodite porn, or living on his own terms. Another reason it's a satire on Divine Comedy is the main characters have the same name and the story is split into nine chapters. Smith try's to make it clear with Dante's realization that he needs to live life do the fullest with the speech by Jay and Bob. Another hint is much more subtle like the song at the credits with the chorus is 'I may never get what I wanted' artist unknown to my knowledge but is another clear identifier to the film.",

Smith's script combines vulgar, gross-out topics with rants on some things as basic as love and relationships. The two are so seamlessly sewn together, they make the works of one of Smith's biggest influences, John Hughes, seem tame in comparison. The hilarity never slows in the 90-minute masterpiece as Smith manages to involve some plot in what's basically a chat comedy. The film is surprisingly well-acted considering all of the cast's amateur status, with Jeff Anderson as the lead character's sidekick Randal turning in one of the most memorable comedic performances ever. Three films (\"Mallrats\", \"Chasing Amy\", and \"Dogma\") later this remains Smith's most enjoyable work. It's legacy has been firmly stamped as one of the most important and influential independent films of all time and it has landed Smith an army of loyal followers.",

            "content": "\"Clerks\" was the breakout film that transformed director/writer Kevin Smith's status as a virtual unknown to a powerhouse director seemingly overnight. The film started as an independent project starring unknown actors shot on a meager budget, but ended up being one of the most revered cult classic films of the 1990's. The film starred Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks and Jeff Anderson as Dante's best friend Randal Graves. Throughout the film Dante and Randal deal with all sorts of issues common to the Generation X audience this film was intended for. Focusing on the stereotypical slacker image, Smith takes viewers on a one day trip in the lives of store clerks Dante and Randal and the comical, but yet serious, series of events and revelations they encounter that day. Nothing is spared in this film as everything from love, sex, death, friendship, and uncertainty about the future are all touched upon at one time or another. Overall, the whole underlying theme of the film seems to be about how sometimes when you can't find a direction in life, a direction will find you and you should run with it. Clerks also introduced audiences to two other important characters, Jay and Silent Bob. Jay (played by Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith) play the drug peddling slackers that spend the entire day hanging out in front of the convenience store antagonizing Dante and Randal. While these characters provide brief scenes of comedic relief to the film, Clerks provided the groundwork for their own full feature film, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which is a cult classic in its own right. This also proved to be a theme that Smith followed in his future films as cameo appearances of Jay and Silent Bob appeared in many of his future films such as Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Clerks 2. When watching Clerks, perhaps the most immediate thing a viewer will notice is that the film was shot in rough stock black and white as opposed to the more common high definition color used in most modern films. This smart decision by Smith gives the film almost a documentary style feel to it and adds a sense of reality, which makes the comedic performances in the film even more believable and humorous. It was a refreshing change of pace from the highly polished and scripted comedies often seen at that time and adds to the indie charm of the film. It is hard to believe that this film was released nearly 20 years ago and even harder to believe that a small budget indie film such as Clerks would be so relevant then and continues to be today. This film is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and I am glad that it was recognized as such when it was released. The themes present in this film really encapsulated the feelings of the Gen X'ers at the time, but the Gen Y and newer audience will not feel short changed watching this film, as the comedy and issues are timeless.",

He admittedly wrote Dante for himself, giving Dante all the blatantly obvious \"intelligent\" dialog. I mean, the dialog is intriguing and great, however too pretentious for my liking. Just the fact that convenient store workers would translate Star Wars with Independent Contractors personal politics isn't only a pretentious move on Smith's part, but it is blatantly obvious and serves no intelligent purpose. The relationship dialog between Dante and his two girls are very well done, however, and incredibly realistic and performed.

            "content": "First off let me tell you that Clerks is like no other movie of its time. This is definitely a cult classic that should be viewed by all to see the mastery of director/writer Kevin Smith. This is a film that was made during the hours that the Quick Mart convenience store was closed. At the time of filming Kevin Smith was actually a worker at this Quick Mart and would work during the day and film at night with little or no sleep.The story is based around the character Dante Hicks played by Brian O'Halloran and the theme is the day and life of a store clerk. Dante is called into work on a day he was suppose to be off. Throughout the day he deals with numerous problems including dealing with incompetent customers, trying to go to his hockey game, finding out that one of his ex-girlfriends have died as well as another ex-girlfriend trying to hook back up with him, all the while trying to stay with his current girlfriend. The only other characters that play a huge role in this film are Jay played by Jason Mewes and Silent Bob played by Kevin Smith. The two characters of Jay and Silent Bob hang out outside the Quick Mart and just do their own thing throughout the movie. If the scene was not revolving around Dante and Jeff it would be revolving around Jay and Silent Bob. Silent Bob only speaks once in this film and it is to give advice to Dante towards the end of the movie.This movie was shot in black and white and I believe this is what makes this film such a cult classic. Filming it this way really brought you into the mundane lives of Dante and Randal played by Jeff Anderson and what it was like to be a store clerk; Dante at Quick Mart and Randal at the video store. An idea that repeats itself through the movie is when new scenes are introduced the director cuts to new scenes by going to an all black screen with a word in white lettering. These words are used to let us the viewers know what is going to be portrayed in the next scene. You will see this done numerous times throughout the film.The only movie that I can even compare this to is Clerks II where both Dante and Randal have left their clerk jobs at the Quick Mart and video store and are now employees of a fast food chain. Both movies are about the same with Clerks II being a carbon copy of the first but in color and with new jobs.If you can get by all the cussing and all the crude humor of this film which I was able to do this film is ridiculously funny with interesting characters, the occasional unusual jokes, and witty references. A must see for all especially store clerks since they can relate to the theme of a day and life of a store clerk.",

Miramax should've had more trust in View Askew and given it more than 30,000 dollars. That's why the whole film had no color, no special effects (aside from the chapter listing announcing new scenes) and took place mainly in the Quick Stop.

Kevin Smith's debut is black and white in both colour and tone, and markedly full of clear contrasts between 'high' and 'low' comedy, and between the characters that inhabit these easily seperable strands of plot. There is little, or close to nothing actually wrong with the film, except sometimes it feels as if the loose central plot has been blissfully abandoned in an attempt to heighten the comedy. This, in most films would be a severe failing, but the humour is of such a high standard in the hands of Smith's scriptwriting that it feels more like a pleasure than a pain.",

This film is a cult classic for a reason, people can connect with it. The indie film maker Kevin Smith began his journey with this piece of art that even blew his expectations away. I recommend this film to anyone who works retail and understands what it's like to be bored for a living. The back and forth banter between 2 employees of a convenience store is spot on and the lovable stoner's jay and silent bob are a beautiful depiction of what pot smokers are really like. This film was the origin of the well known heterosexual soul mates jay and silent bob, these two have become the icons of weed and every stoner can quote at least one line from a Kevin Smith film. If you want to see pure 90s independent cinema than this is the film to watch. If you find that you can't relate to this film than you probably have better things you could be doing other than watching movies.",

However, the conversations between the characters was one of the first times that I realized that movies, especially dialogue did not need to be \"theatrical\" and overblown. It could be a reflection of conversations I might have with my friends, and it could enthrall! Today this movie may not seem that unique, and that is due in part to the influence that Kevin Smith has had on the industry, but it will always hold a special place in my heart.The story is simple, a day in the life of 2 slackers. Dante works at the convenience store and his friend Randal works next door at the video store (ask your parents what this was kids). Throughout the day the deal with drug dealers, dead people, strange customers, girlfriends, etc, etc.Do yourself a favor and look for the DVD that includes the alternate ending. It is quite a shock and change in tone from the movie and original ending. I still go back and forth as to which one I like better.",

I didn't really know what to expect other than it is in black and white and scripted by our beloved producer but what a hilarious film it turned out to be.The dialogue is typical Kevin Smith work, evident in his later films such as dogma and chasing amy, and might I add work that I thoroughly enjoy. The film was shot on a budget so don't expect anything fancy. No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.It will appear that this film is more appealing to Kevin Smith fans and not really for the faint hearted movie viewers who prefer clich\u00e9s and typical dialogue (including them awful one liners). Oh no no no, this is one fast talking, twisted and very entertaining movie, but one that can only be appreciated when one can lower his/her inhibitions.Give it a shot, it's something different and if it's your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!",

So, I gave the cashier my five bucks and took the movie home for a viewing.I wasn't disappointed, not in the least. In the past, the most hilarious movies I'd seen had had their lulls, periods (usually mercifully brief) in which the jokes aren't as funny, such as the movie \"North,\" one of the few examples when the entire effin' movie was an unfunny piece of trash. \"Clerks\" had no lulls. Almost all of the jokes, from Randall's self-pleasuring cousin to the horny corpse in the bathroom inspired some form of a laugh in me, from a chuckle to an outright belly laugh.The movie has some disgusting, yet amazingly funny sequences. Only Kevin Smith could make this movie the masterpiece it is, writing a day in the life of Dante Hicks gone horribly, horribly wrong, from the gum in the lock, to the fact that his girlfriend has orally serviced thirtysomething men, to the climactic fight between the two stars. It's extreme, it's vulgar, it's crude, it's got my guarantee... you'll love it, or you'll hate it. I hope you love it as much as I do.All in All: \"Clerks\" is unique among all the movies I've seen.

It's a low budget film that uses actors over and over, and even due to low funds, required the crew and their family members to play bit parts. However, budget was a not a problem in creating a perfectly scripted and directed comedy.It's about Dante Hicks who works in a convenience store and the banality of life - the contrary customers, the annoyance when window shutters won't open; the long lost girlfriend who is about to be married; the current girlfriend with a past he'd rather forget; the stoners that hang out outside; a funeral which was more eventful than it should have been and the poor customer who took too long in the bathroom....The script is absolutely fabulous - unparalleled by any other comedy - and the direction is to perfection. I really cannot praise this movie enough. Rent it as soon as you can. Some may find it vulgar but it really is a wonderful pastiche on dead-end jobs. Please - rent it. You will not be disappointed!",

Not only with myself, but apparently with a high percentage of people in my age bracket, it's a true to life, yet wetpants funny, sample of late teen life.The acting ain't great, the lighting ain't great, but who cares - the film is excellent, and thankfully kick started the career of one of the most under-rated film maestros around.",

It follows a day in the life of Dante Hicks, an over-educated clerk. He meets up with his friend Randal, finds out some sexual information about his girlfriend and more. At the heart of the film is actually quite an important message about life. When you see the film you will understand what i mean. This film doesn't really have a plot. It is just the wild adventures of a guy, which ranges from playing hockey on the roof to knocking a casket over at a funeral. Jay & Silent Bob(Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back also make their first movie experience. The writing and direction by Kevin Smith is brilliant, due to low budget restrictions(It was made for 27 000) their is not to much action in the film, but Smith's dialogue is brilliant. You know that if the Hollywood HotShots remade this, they would only take a tiny little bit of dialogue and just put a bunch of slapstick in. Overall, the film is an enjoyable experience. THE DVD:This is one of the best. Any Clerks fan will want it for the infamous alternate ending, but the real thing here is the audio commentary(In which Jason Mewes is drunk).

I thought that I had seen Smith's best in \"Chasing Amy\" and \"Dogma\", but was sorely mistaken after watching \"Clerks\".Dante, and Randal are two characters that I can sympathize with, and actually empathize with. Living in a small town creates conventionalism that surpasses boredom in every possible aspect. When things become conventional they must become lively and unpredictable; which seems to explain my small town life rather well. For 92 minutes I felt like I was glimpsing what my life is slowly becoming, someday being a Clerk in a small town store, wishing I were, perhaps, playing hockey on a rooftop.The unsubtle comedy had me in tears, especially due to the fact that it was for the majority unpredictable. I felt the genius of Kevin Smith's insight seeping through my pores when I got up after the movie. I've been dwelling on it every since; hoping to use the independent film style of Kevin Smith for my movie currently in the making (the script anyways). I don't think Smith could have delved into the lives of two slackers and all of the sudden hysteria that surrounds them any better than he did. In light of that I give this movie a 10, and hope to watch more brilliance jump at me from the screen in the future so that I may experience the same euphoria over, and over.",

The minute that Dante first appeared I was taken with the movie. I loved the grainy black and white, like the movie was being filmed on security camera's with audio.  The dialogue was fantastic.  Sharp, witty, filled with pop culture jabs and inside jests.  Dante and Randal were perfect opposites and played their roles beautifully, Dante the submissive weak willed type clerk and Randal, the rude as hell close the store for an hour at noon type clerk.  Throw in the various plots of the movie, the zaniness of their love lives, and two pot dealers named Jay and Silent Bob and you find yourself holding a clever and original film.

With him for the ride are two stoners, known to other as Jay(Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith), the clerk next door Randal, and a bunch of unpredictable shoppers.

The story is simple,two clerks working in a Quick stop/video store,Dante(Brian 0' Halloran) who constantly complains about he hates his job and yet lets people walk all over him and believes himself to be a victim while Randal(Jeff Anderson) chooses to lash out at the customers. This simple story of two people working in a dead end job works because of the very funny banter exchanged between our two main characters..particularly Randal whose cynical outlook on life often ends with hilarity as his constant abuse of the customers and his long winded conversations about topics such as Star Wars come to mind.I would recommend this to anyone who does not have a problem with bad language as this is in my opinion a Modern Classic.",

The two main characters are Dante and Randall, who work in the Quick Stop convenience and R.S.T. videos stores respectively, and the film follows their exploits through one working day (Dante isn't supposed to working though). Where Smith really succeeds is in his observational humour ; Dante talking with his girl friend about how easy it is for women to get their man off or Randall's indignation when a customer tricks him in the video store these scenes are not only funny but are easier to identify with than a fat guy and a thin guy kidnapping a monkey.

Randal says things to irate customers that I and my fellow co-workers would kill to say. While this movie may be filled to the brim with crude humor and sexual innuendo, it's not exaggerated or over-done: it's reality. And that's one thing that makes this movie so great...it's so funny, yet it's so real and accurate...so, dare I say, human. Honestly...how many of you would love to close the store for awhile just to play hockey on the roof? How many of you might say yes when asked to come on your day off, yet sit there and complain all day that you're working on your day off? Kevin Smith has the ability to capture human emotion so wonderfully, yet he entwines it so well with jokes and comedy, and out pops this fantastically funny movie.

You just don't get any more indie then that.But I digress. The actual movie is based on the Divine Comedy by Dante, so one of the main characters is named Dante. Dante is played to a slacker perfect by Brian O' Halloran. The basic idea of the movie is that Dante is having a bad day. He has to go in to work when he doesn't have to, gets pelted with cigs, and finds out his girlfriend has performed the french perversion on 37 men. All of this happens in the first 15-20 min.\nThe script is one of the funniest I've ever, and while watching the movie it is tempting to wonder whatr the movie would have been like while a \"name\" cast and a bigger budget.The movie does have some flaws. The cast is an assortment of Smith's friends, so the acting is only so-so. Also, because of the small budget, Walt Flannagin has to play like, 6 bit parts. Also, if you are looking for artsy direction, you will be disapointed. Smith is not a visual director, most of his scences are long verbal shots, only sometimes interrupted by the antics of Jay and Silent Bob.

But surprisingly enough, all I've ever seen of Clerks was the cartoon series, until today. For the most part, I believe those who did not like this film, really did not understand what it was. They are the kind of people who need action every five seconds, in bright vivid color. People need to understand Kevin did this with a limited budget (27,000 something).Back to my original point, anyone who's worked a dead end job can relate to this film. It literally portrays the everyday antics society faces today. Plus it helps to have worked in a quick stop like store. I believe, after all, that Kevin Smith did work at that particular Quick Stop (not sure though, and don't quote me on it).All in all, if you're a film student, have a good sense of humor, and/or want to kill some time, go watch Clerks.",

I know: it's a bold statement, but this film proves that you can make a great movie without spending millions and millions of dollars.The charm in \"Clerks\" lies with its unique look (courtesy of uber-cinematographer Dave Klein) and some of the best dialogue ever (written by film-genius Kevin Smith). Where the film lacks in expensive visuals, it makes up with in extraordinary dialogue. While the speech may be crude, it is realistic. It shows what a couple of 20-something convenience and video store workers talked about in the early 90s.Without going into anymore detail (and possibly spoiling the film for future fans), all I can say is that \"Clerks\" is a 10 in my book!",

The far-from-Baby-Boomers, but not quite Gen-Xers get the most out of this flick. Throw in a high school degree and your enjoyment level increases ten-fold.For a movie with such crude puns, the dialogue that runs aplenty in between the one-liners is so clever it demands several trips to the video store. Just make the purchase and save the effort; it definitely deserves a spot in your own collection.New Jersey natives will love the film's various homages, but they are only the icing on the proverbial cake. The conclusion of the film leaves you wondering just how you had such a good time with a \"day in the life of\" plot. After trying Kevin Smith's other works: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, you will better understand. He finds plots (maybe except Mallrats), develops characters, and even moves the camera. Hey, he even grabbed School Ties's & Dazed and Confused's Ben Affleck before he was drilling holes in the moon. The man's got an eye for this film thing folks, watch his stuff and prove me wrong.He also had his creative hands on Drawing Flies, A Better Place, Good Will Hunting, & Vulgar.Watch Clerks and learn the double meaning of the Summary above.

If you're even interested in seeing it (why else would you have looked for information on it) and have enjoyed ANY of his other films, you'll want to add it to your collection.I'll be the first to admit that, considering this is one of the first of his many films, it is quite vulgar; however, if you can get past the use of questionable language and take it simply as common use of \"improper\" words used to express the degree of emotion... you won't stop laughing.Tie it in with the rest of his films, and you'll say.. hey, wasn't that the <guy/girl> in <insert film name here>? etc....",

Follow the zany adventures of two convenience store clerks in Red Bank, NJ as they go through the craziest day of their lives!  From funerals, to rooftop hockey games, to things so outrageous I can't mention them here, they have a hilarious adventure well worth the cost of a rental, if not a buy.Kevin Smith writes and directs this comedy extravaganza, and also appears as \"Silent Bob\".  Brian O'Hallaran and Jeff Anderson also do a bang-up job as the title characters, Dante and Randal.  With Jason Mewes as the zany \"Jay\", you can be sure that the cast is on a one-way course to hilarity!  Matt Crawford shines, with his phenomenal performance as \"Angry Crowd at Door\" - I don't think I'd be exaggerating his performance with the phrase: \"Oscar's got a new butt to kiss!\"",

I couldn't stand listening to Dante's or Randall's voice after a while, they were so friggin' annoying. I can't stand Jay either, he's a worthless character. Silent Bob is cool, cuz I like Kevin Smith, and the rest of his movies are good except for this one. Everyone kept saying to me \"ya gotta see clerks, ya gotta see clerks.\" So I saw it and almost died of boredom and nausea. It was so ridiculously retarded. All the pointless conversations about girlfriends, movies, and other crap was so boring...I've heard all this a thousand times. The whole movie is basically that fruit Dante whining about everything and that monotoned punk Randall giving his overdescriptive insight. Pass on this one.

The Film is extremely well written by Kevin Smith and I think that it's the best movie in the Criterion Collection (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma &  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).Brian O'Halloran plays a very kind and gullible character in Dante Hicks and Jeff Anderson is great as the sly and carefree Randall Graves.  Then with Jay and Silent Bob just outside the Quik stop you have an immediate cast of believable and likeable characters.Clerks starts out interesting and just keeps getting better.  It has many twist and turns that you really don't see coming.  Not only that but the way things happen is incredible in it's own sense.  The ending is also great but make sure, that if you can, to pick it up on DVD for the alternate ending. I give it ***** stars out of 5.

Smith's films had not yet achieved the fanbase nor the level of infamy they now have...since this was, of course, his first movie.  On a mere budget of $24,000, Kevin Smith made Clerks, a movie he wrote and directed, and yeah, was featured in as an actor as well.  The results? Brilliance.Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson play Dante and Randal, respectively, two intelligent but slacker-ish guys in their early 20s.  Dante works in the Kwik Stop, a convenience store, and Randal works in a video store adjescent to it.  Dante is the protagonist of the film, as it is his troubles with the insane patrons of the store and his relationships that form the center conflicts.  His buddy Randal is more or less along for the ride to provide his always entertaining comments and insights, and to kick some sense into Dante when necessary.  The film follows them over the course of one day, not a particularly good day in the life of Dante Hicks.  A whole bunch of stuff happens to them, and I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say-- well, screw it-- they play hockey on the roof of the Kwik Stop.  Yes. Don't worry, I didn't give much away.Jason Mewes and Smith himself also appear as Jay and Silent Bob, the aforementioned stoners who deal outside of the Kwik Stop.  They serve as an interesting contrast to Dante and Randal, not to mention providing numerous funny moments.  And yes, they do end up acting as a voice of reason.The movie is absolutely hilarious throughout, and whether we are laughing at the ridiculousness of Dante and Randal's situation, the unique dialogue between the characters, or the wacky events that transpire, we are laughing... though, there is most definitely a dramatic element to the film, and a powerful realization for many (young) viewers such as myself when we see a little bit of Dante in all of us; his romantic confusion, his inability to incite change, etc.  Throw in Smith's hilariously pretentious scene titles (\"denouement\"), and Smith's comic writing talents, and you've got yourself the best comedy of the 90s.",

It could sound strange, but the film gives a lot of food for thought: you are young, but what to do with the rest of your life. Go to college, or continue in a Mac job in a small shop, where every customer is a wired nightmare. This is an honest story about clerks: \u00abJust Because They Serve You...

And in that respect, it's like most of Kevin Smith's films.The beautiful aspect to this film is the sharp and witty dialogue which permeates it from start to finish. Punctuated by highly amusing anecdotal mini-dramas and Kubrick-esque scene titles (compare \"2001\"), the streams of conversation which can only originate in a quirky and intelligent brain are brilliantly delivered by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson.Periodic appearances by Jay and S.B. blatantly characterize this film as a Smith, but it is the sharp repart\u00e9 and fearlessness to deal with uneuphemistic and outright twisted humour which place the Smith brand on \"Clerks.\"A must-see if you're at least content, if not happy, to sit through a film whose main plus point is its dialogue.
