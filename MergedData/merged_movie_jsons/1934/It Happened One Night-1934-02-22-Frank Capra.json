            "review_title": "The Hero As Comedian",
            "content": "In his autobiography, The Name's Above the Title, Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters, the hero, the heroine, the comedian, and the villain.What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films, the characters of hero and comedian are combined. Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself, especially with that system all her own. But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold.Capra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it. Capra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.The rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves. Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount, ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond. Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in. Gable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night.",

            "content": "This is a pleasant, funny classic that shows it age only slightly, and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it. Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them, and are well-remembered for their performances.  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character acting.The cross-country trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch, with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line. (The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well.)  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself, but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedy.It all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy, with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes.",

            "review_title": "Clean Sweep",
            "content": "Consider this, \"It Happened One Night\" was made in 1933 which gives it the distinction 70+ years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences. And most of the runner-ups for oldest film are 1930's screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the 1934 Academy Awards. The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant. The main reason \"It Happened One Night\" worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable, who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capra's direction. Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production. Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut. Cohn told Capra: \"That French broad likes money\" and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $50,000 (double her usual price) and a guarantee that production would only last 28 days. Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B. Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this film.The film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra, a great script that would play well with small town America, and a good ensemble of supporting talent. The story concerns a spoiled young heiress (Colbert) trying to escape the control of her father (nicely played by Walter Connelly). Dodging her father's private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter (Gable) who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other (brainless brat and obnoxious bully) as an undisclosed affection develops. On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each other.While the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love (one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love), Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film. As another reviewer has written: \"Far from lovey-dovey, the dialogue is witty, sharp and occasionally heartless. We may know the outcome, but the road to get there is paved with arguments, anger and misunderstandings. It's also clever, funny and a bit risqu\u00e9 (for 1934)\" . During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult, motivated by a desire to improve her companion's opinion of her. Gable shows real star presence, playing a confident, charming, and resourceful gentleman. By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partner.After the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director Oscar.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

As here, with Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, where the story is pretty immaterial but the interactions between the pair makes this, to this day, as engaging, charming and funny a conjuring as any you might previously have come across and, quite probably, any you might venture to find in the future.",

            "review_title": "A cute romantic comedy that was a pioneer of its genre",
            "content": "It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic, and on so many `must-see' lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another.  It wasn't until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadn't.The first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony, It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress (Colbert) who marries a shallow, yet dashing aviator.  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation.  Instead, she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York, where her husband awaits.  The film quickly turns into an `on the road' flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable, a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story.  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventure.I'm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy.  Of course, there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone (the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich) but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles.  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies, with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre, Bringing up Baby, as a five.\nWhatever its classification, It Happened One Night is a charming film that backs up its merit as a multiple Oscar winner.  It is one of those films that may not be completely profound or deep, but is important nonetheless if anything, for its place in film history.--Shelly",

            "content": "In Miami, the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is trapped in the yacht of her controller father, the Wall Street banker Andrews (Walter Connolly), who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore. Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter. But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover. She seats side- by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him. He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley. Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward. In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls. \"It Happened One Night\" is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra. The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated, with witty dialogs, and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous. The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple. Last time I saw this classic was on 29 January 2003 and this is the third time that I watch this film, now on DVD from Columbia Distributor, and I highly recommend it as one of the best romantic comedies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Aconteceu Naquela Noite\" (\"It Happened that Night\")",

            "content": "IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, based on a short story \"Night Bus\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams, ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the 1930s, thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable (on loan from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) and Claudette Colbert (on loan from Paramount), with fine direction by Frank Capra, witty screenplay by Robert Risken, and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Gable); Best Actress (Colbert); Best Director (Capra); Best Screenplay and Best Picture. This might have been an \"upset\" in 1934, considering other top-rated films and performances of the year, but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in 1934?This now well-known plot that's been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES (1945) with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT (1956) with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen \"Ellie\" Andrews (Claudette Colbert), spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker, Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas), making arrangements on having it annulled. Following a heated argument with her father, Ellie runs from her state room, jumps overboard and swims to shore. Eluding her father's hired detectives, Ellie, acquiring new clothes, purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley. While on board, Ellen encounters Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a hot-headed reporter recently fired by his editor, Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson). With both disliking each other immensely, Warne, having discovered the \"spoiled brat's\" identity, becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back. Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp, misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car gone.A simple story playing like an overlong \"B\" movie, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated. Highlights include the \"Walls of Jericho\" where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses, particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peter's correct method of dunking a dough-nut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her own.Although IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish (there's no secondary female character, quite rare for its time). Due to the strength of Gable's performance, this has been hailed to be his best comedic role. Gable's character is hot-headed and forceful, living by a moral code. Although he shares a cabin with a married woman, that's all he does. He even tells Colbert's Ellie when she asks if she'll ever see him again, he replies, \"I make it a policy not to run around with married women.\" And when he's hungry, he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling. This is Gable, a role model. Director Frank Capra, whose subject matter is usually on people, captures the many extras, especially those on the bus and auto camps, to make them appear as important as leading players. Roscoe Karns is equally memorable, \"believe you me!\" as the gabby bus passenger, Oscar Shapeley from Orange, New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother (Claire McDowell); along with other passengers gathered together and singing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze,\" to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colbert's shoulder. During it's entire 106 minutes, there's seldom any underscoring. As for the costumes, with the exception of the final 15 minutes, both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their trip.While Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers, plus their reunion in MGM's large-scale BOOM TOWN (1940), it's amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards. There's a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette, the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry, saying that those kind of women don't exist anymore. Gable says this with frankness and sincerity. Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek, coming to realize it happened one night.IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the 1960s and 70s, but on cable TV as well, ranging from the Disney Channel (1980s), American Movie Classics (prior to 2001) to Turner Classic Movies, and availability on video cassette and finally DVD. While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance, it's still timely screen entertainment. There'll never be another film like this again. (***1/2)",

            "content": "Hollywood after all is a town of gosh-darn dumb luck, indeed! I worked there for many years and heard a heck of a lot of stories. This is one of them. Two up and coming actors, and an industrious director willing to roll the dice on a not too shabby Depression era story, all somehow came together, and all turned into the parking lot of a low budget studio called Columbia Pictures. They put their heads together, put the egos in the back pocket, thank you, applied a little elbow grease and with a little luck produced one of the most beloved romantic comedies of all time! How's that for a Hollywood happy ending? IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT put Gable on the map, whose career was slow to start, if not going in the direction he had hoped, and gave a very small studio an undisputed reputation as a can-do organization now open for business! HOORAY! Don't you just love it? The rest is history, of course, but not without saying what an unforgettable story this is and, perhaps, the very first road trip movie ever conceived. It is also, remarkably, a very simple story of young man meets young woman and the adventures that they share together, going at it as best as they can, and let us not forget during the height of the Great Depression. Truly, audiences at the time needed a good laugh and this gem of a film was their answer, which it remains to this day. Also a tip of the hat to a marvelous supporting cast, foremost Walter Connolly as Colbert's frustrated father whose bark is worse than his bite and has one heck of a time in between! Director Frank Capra outdid himself in this one, but when you have a dream and you believe in what you're doing, it just may surprise you in the end. Not to be forgotten, make that cannot be forgotten, because there is a little bit of all of us in this film if you dig deep enough. Surprise!",

            "review_title": "Introducing... the Screwball Comedy",
            "content": "Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films. From It Happened One Night to It's a Wonderful Life, Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds. It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression, when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the 1930s into a world where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed. While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored, an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday life.There were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated. Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal. Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity, you smile and wave at them. Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zeke's wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid. Upon seeing Peter and Ellie's car missing, they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there. They cannot afford freeloaders.In another scene, a child's mother has passed out from hunger, because they have no money to buy food. Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds, but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to them.Despite these instances, the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world. In the throes of the stock market crash, this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy. At a time when the country needed release, they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night. Audiences were amused by scenes in the film, such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut. Or, when forced to share a room, Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellie's beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho,' which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellie's marriage. Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence, which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully, finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts. After he gives up, beaten, Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee. The first car that passes stops, as we see extreme close-ups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brake.A master in his profession, Capra left his mark on the films he directed. With an almost childlike cheerfulness, he maintains a sense of dignity and class. The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind, even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film. Capra's films are still regarded as masterpieces. It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies. It was one of many movies made during the Depression, a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history. It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time.9 out of 10 stars",

            "content": "It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in 1934 by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office. Yet, after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in 1934. Due to the original small nature of the film, the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio. He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert. Capra's film was a combination of many ideals, emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements. The film unfolds the story in such a attention-grabbing and remarkable way that most of today's cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films. Capra used the idea of a moving camera, one that was not fixed upon a box, but on a moveable crane instead. This produced more sweeping shots, more angles for filming and fewer distance shots. It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie. The film also incorporates back projection of images. This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection. Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage. Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film. The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film. The film was also all talk, the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used. The text cards of silent films were completely discarded. Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gable's character for Claudette Colbert's character by depicting her character in a different light. This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship. Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gable's character seeing her in a `different light.' In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time. Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich (King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter) and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society. The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman, the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era. But the fighting and the banter also show a strong-minded and intelligent woman. The two strong-willed main characters balanced each other out.Capra's techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the 1930s captured film makers and film viewers for over 70 years. Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals. When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capra-esc. Capra's imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere.",

            "content": "IHON rightly earns it's place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre, it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.It's a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father's yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father's consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That's how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn't a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic 'no undershirt scene' where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men's undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film's release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene-stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it's faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it's time.IHON won 5 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation. It deserved all of them. Funnily enough, both Colbert and Gable didn\u2019t want any part in the film at first- I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it. It's been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film. A classic, a must-see, a great movie.",

            "content": "Released in 1934, Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood film-making \u0096 the screwball comedy \u0096 and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' and 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991).' As I watch more of his films, Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors, with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy, however, posed a certain problem, since I've never been a huge fan of the sub-genre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday,' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh, but never really inspired any other emotions \u0096 which isn't necessarily a handicap, but doesn't appeal to my tastes.Happily, I'm able to announce that 'It Happened One Night' did surpass my expectations, and I found it to be a wonderfully-enjoyable, very touching romantic comedy. The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain, since it reminded me of just about every other 1930s comedy I'd seen, but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best: he put a lot of heart into the film. After building towards a perfect fairytale ending, Capra suddenly snatches it away, slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero. However, the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending, and, when love finally prevails, it feels twice as triumphant. Of course, crucial to the film's success are the two lead performers: Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable, playing characters of completely polar characters. As story runs its course, we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance, and it never feels forced or artificial (despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onset).The plot of the film was based on the story, \"The Night Bus,\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is the arrogant, spoilt heiress of a wealthy father (Walter Connolly). After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her father's will, Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves, and her desperate father launches a state-wide attempt to retrieve her. It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne (Gable), whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story. Probably one of the best \"road movies\" ever made, 'It Happened One Night' also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature. For example, Ellie's father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon, but is, in fact, shown to be a very kind, reasonable and loving man, who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles (King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss, compensated by a tidy sum of money).Much to my surprise, I'd never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before, but he really was a revelation. Never taking any situation too seriously, and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement, Gable is the laid-back every-man that the audience can relate to, a stark contrast to Colbert's conceited and ungrateful upper-class rich girl. My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road, with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns) threatening to reveal Ellie's true identity. Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands, Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie, threatens to harm Shapeley's family and then chases him into the night. Interestingly, I followed up my viewing of this film with a 1939 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story, introduced by Cecille B. DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert. This recording can be found, if you're lucky, as a special feature on the 'It Happened One Night' DVD, and it's well worth a listen.",

            "content": "Capra's 'It Happened One Night' is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy. It has the 30's feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the 1930s. The camera-work is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness. the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways 'flip' mode. There's always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me. Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive. While the background scene changes, the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors. Needless to add, the film's got fantastic dialogue.Capra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the 30's American society, especially focusing on gender and class status. The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their non-verbal behaviour. Yet, in a way the film is also ahead of its time. Ellie isn't just some clich\u00e9d damsel of the 30s. She is strong-minded, stubborn and smart (albeit slightly naive). She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily. Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status (which was something women were struggling with in those days).The characters are very well etched. Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews (played excellently by Walter Connolly) was written as the rich father who's got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistry.'It Happened One Night' has become an instant favourite, one that I definitely plan to revisit.",

Ellie runs away from her father sets off across country to get to her husband in New York. On the bus she meets a recently-fired reporter, Peter Warne. The two don't get along but, figuring out who she is, and knowing that her father will have every route into New York covered with private detectives, he offers to help her get to a husband. In exchange he wants an exclusive on her story. The two tag along together, getting through some interesting adventures. Over time they even get to like each other...A gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm, and hilariously funny at times, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward, keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.The great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles. The chemistry between them is great and their delivery is spot-on.Both Gable and Colbert received Oscars for their performances, as did Capra for Best Director. The movie was the well-deserved 1935 Best Picture Oscar winner.",

            "content": "I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles. `The Phantom Menace', obviously.  Also: `The Shop Around the Corner' (around the corner from WHERE?), `The Empire Strikes Back' (it doesn't), `The Living Daylights', `True Lies', `Batman Forever', `Species', `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' ... if anyone has any more suggestions, please send them to me.In this case, it happens over several nights, and I'm not sure which particular night is being referred to.  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying.  But actually, Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air.  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end - in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake.  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all.  I, for one, was convinced that right up until the final moment, it could have gone either way.  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I don't suppose it matters: it's results that count.I'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all.  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society, it's almost worth creating a sexist society (and then dismantling it), in order to get the art.  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists, who, by and large, aren't so easily fooled.  Claudette Colbert isn't feisty.  When she DOES assert her independence, she means it.(And, of course, when Clark Gable asserts his dominance, HE means it.  You don't get sincerity like this these days.)Anyway, the ideology of a film, if there is one, is always beside the point, except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film.  Two real individuals, a real story, some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding, constant wit - and, as I expressed amazement at earlier, constant suspense.  And if THAT isn't enough to get you to watch it, note that it was released in 1934.  The Hayes code didn't come into effect until 1935.  Not a moment too late.",

            "content": "Sorry to say but this movie is just a bit too overrated. Especially Capra's directing is disappointing, since it's done in such an extremely old fashioned manner for 1934 standards. Surprisingly enough he still won an Oscar for his directing of this movie though.It's definitely an entertaining enough movie to watch. These type of movies were the romantic comedies of the '30's, the sort of Cameron Diaz and Asthon Kutcher flicks of their time, only done with more class and better actors involved. Nevertheless it's just as clich\u00e9d and predictable though. Dozens of these type of movies got made in the '30's and quite frankly I just can't see what it is that makes this movie a better one than any of them.It's a boy meets girl story and of course they can't get along at first but slowly begin to like each other better and more. What makes this movie its story more special is its adventurous elements being thrown in. It's a movie that involves lots of traveling and therefor also many different characters, which mainly gives the movie its adventurous feeling, without ever really getting a big adventure.More fireworks was to be expected, especially from Frank Capra's directing. It's just too formulaic and at times even just plain poor. It's way too old fashioned for 1934 and it's one of those typical movies that features long close-ups for the dramatic moments. It's a very static made film, as if it was just a job that had to be done and no real passion was thrown into it.As could be expected, the acting is still great though, from Clark Gable and the much more unknown Claudette Colbert. They were good together and luckily shared some good chemistry, which made the movie all the more fun to watch. This was actually the movie that earned Clark Gable his only Oscar out of his career. Ironicly enough non of the actors really enjoyed starring in this movie and also lots of well known actor turned the script down and Claudette Colbert, who also received an Oscar for her role in this movie, even didn't took the trouble to attend the award ceremony at first, until hearing upon her win.Yes, I know I'm making the movie sound horrible, which it really isn't. It's basically a movie I enjoyed watching but is no way worthy of this currently high rating on here. There are way better genre movies and Capra movies, with a much lower rating on here though. There are better and more interesting Capra movies to watch out there, which does not mean that this movie is an horrible one though.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Soon she is out on the road trying to get back to New York when she runs across Peter (Clark Gable), a man who recently quit his job at the newspaper. Peter and Ellie can't stand one another but he agrees to help her reach New York in exchange for an exclusive story.Frank Capra ended up winning Best Director and the picture ending up nabbing all the major awards, which was the first time this had ever been done and it wouldn't happen again until ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST did it fifty years later. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a film that has been copies dozens if not hundreds of times over the years so it's easy to look at it and not see anything original but in 1934 this here was original material and it's easy to see why it was a box office hit and walked away with so many Oscars.It's funny to think that Columbia approached this as a \"B\" movie but it shows what a great director can do with a good story and a wonderful cast. There's no question that Capra's magical touch is all over this film and especially when you see the way it is edited and how it goes for its laughs. There are some hilarious moments scattered throughout the film including the now legendary hitchhiking scene but there's another hilarious and more quiet moment dealing with Gable scaring someone who is trying to work his way in on the reward money.What makes this film so memorable is the fact that you get two superb performances from the two lead legends. Colbert was already a star by the time this came out but she's perfect in the role of the brat who slowly begins to realize that she's been seeing the world in the wrong way. The film also offers up fine support from the likes of Connolly and Roscoe Karns. With that said, it's Gable who steals the picture and it's easy to see why his career never looked back after this. His comic timing is simply flawless throughout and the toughness he brings to this \"charming\" character is something most actors wouldn't have been able to pull off. The chemistry between the two leads certainly make the picture.I do think there are some flaws with the picture including it running five or ten-minutes too long. I think the predictable ending could have happened a little quicker but this is just a minor issue in an otherwise terrific film. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a landmark in Hollywood history and it deserves its reputation.",

In the beginning, she treats him like a servant, but he never knuckles under to this behavior.  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous.  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called \"sexual tension.\"  He takes care of her - does not take advantage of her - but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being, she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect.  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike, and their \"breakfast\" is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find.

And it is not really surprising when you see it... besides, it is Clark Gable and Frank Capra.So, this might not be as outright funny as other films, and even as far as screwball comedies go, it sort of lags behind \"The Awful Truth\" with Cary Grant. But Clark Gable has a debonair charm to him... from the very beginning he has that attitude about him that women mysteriously love. I am a little confused about the laid-back approach to marriage and annulment, but this is a romance, and that is not uncommon... if anything, it shows how fickle the socialite is.Overall, a very enjoyable film.

            "content": "It's a pretty good romance-comedy. I think some of these modern romance comedies, need to have their producers look back at this film as research, on how to make a good film. Still, why the title? Nothing happened one night? The movie takes place over several weeks, it appears. They first met one night, sure, but it didn't take a night settling to have them, fall in love. I like the title to be, Night Bus like the book by Samuel Hopkins Adams, in which the movie is based on. At less, that makes kinda more sense. Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is told through a screwball comedy that has the two leads engage in a funny battle of the sexes where the woman is often dominating and the male character is often challenge in the masculinity sense. You have to love the fast-pace repartee, farcical situations, and escapist themes here. It's hard, not to get into this film. The format came to be, whenever a major film is trying to avoid censorship from the harsh Hayes Code of the time. Verbal sparring between the sexes often serve as a stand in for physical, sexual tension. Indeed, this movie is a sex comedy without any sex. The screwball comedy also serve as a mention in discuss the issues of social classes between the different of the poor to those of the rich. The movie starts with spoil brat pampered Miami socialite, Ellen \"Ellie\" Andre (Claudette Colbert) is trying to get out from under her father's (Walter Connolly) thumb by trying to marries fortune-hunter \"King\" Westley (Jameson Thomas) against the wishes of her father who wants to have the marriage annulled. She wants to run away to go meet up Westley in New York, only to find herself sharing a bus ride with roguish out of work reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) whom is wanting to use her story to get him the biggest new scoop in his life. There are numerous famous scenes throughout the film, that is later recycle, remade or spoof after such as the runaway bride or the famous hitchhiking leg scene. One of the biggest impact, the film had on popular culture was the influence it gave to a certain animator. The scenes with a minor character, Oscar Shapely (Roscoe Karns), continually calling the Gable character \"Doc\", plus the imaginary character named \"Bugs Dooley\" mentioned once to frighten Shapely, and a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, gave the animator, the idea of Bugs Bunny. Other mentions of \"Looney Tunes\" characters from the film include Alexander Andrews and King Westley being the inspirations for Yosemite Sam and Pep\u00e9 LePew, respectively. I do have to say, my favorite scene in the movie is the 'flying trapeze' singing bus scene. While, it's mostly unlikely this would had happen in real life, I have to say the song gives the movie, its charm.I do have to say, while the movie seems lighted hearted; there is several dark humor that is still kinda risking even in today's standards. There is a scene where Warne and Andre act like a hillbilly domestic abuse couple that is a bit disturbing. Then there is a scene where Warne steals a car, after the driver tries to drive off with their luggage. That's still Grant Theft Auto, Peter. You can go to jail for that. It doesn't help his case if he even did go to trial, as he also pretended that he was indeed a gang leader in another scene in the movie, admitting to 'kidnapping' Andre. Still, with his good-natured, street-smart, and breezy performance, Gable would likely be not guilty of the crime, but found guilty on his sex appeal. He did influenced the un-sale of undershirts by taking off his shirt and exposing his bare chest in the film. The acting was pretty good here. I didn't think, Colbert deserve her Best Actress role, as her character wasn't so far off from her real life. Plus, she only took the role because her salary was doubled and she can get a well-planned vacation. Gable was more reluctant participant in the film. It's hard to believe that these two actors are supposed to fall in love with each other, as there was a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert did reading. However, they established a friendly working relationship and found that the script was no worse than those of many of their earlier films. Colbert continue to bark trouble during her time on the set, complaining. There are some critics out there that blame the movie for being a bit sexist. Both, Ellen and Peter can seem like unlikeable character because Ellen is a brat and Peter is pompous. His treatment of her reflects his disdain for her class, not because she was a woman. Her behavior reflects her inexperience with the real world, her disdain for his arrogance, and her fear of being out on the road alone. It's very easy to look back and criticize, the social norms of another era but our standards and culture have changed gradually over time; how can we look back and impose those standards on another. I really don't see the movie as sexist at all. The movie did help the bus system more as travel by women substantially increased as a result of the film. Overall: If a fan of classic movies, this movie is one movie, you need to watch. Show a leg, and get hitched.",

Over 70 years later the magic still works, due to the terrific combination of Gable, Colbert and director Capra.But it almost didn't happen at all.Both Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON. In fact, it appeared no-one in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews. The tiny cash-strapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula, it looked a certain flop. Pfft. How wrong everyone was. IHON swept the Academy Awards, taking home all of the Major Awards, including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert. It established the screwball comedy genre, and the careers of it's two stars and director Capra.Why is it so good? Well, it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy. It doesn't have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience, just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to. It's witty, the dialogue is snappy and fast-paced and the acting is near perfect. So let's have a closer look at the plot of this gem: Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley. Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht. Daddy hasn't counted on Ellie's tenacity and will- fed up with the fact her childish hunger-strike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard. When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip. A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life. Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley. But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in love.This film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up. The parodying of the rich is sublime, you can't help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog. It also has it's risqu\u00e9 elements that I'm surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced. In particular, Gable's sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final 'breaking down the walls of Jericho' scene. When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt, sales dropped off dramatically. This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in film.Some of my favourite scenes: the donut-dunking lesson, the piggy-back ride, Gable and Colbert's mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene. Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesn't have to use her thumb to pull a ride. Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle, much to the horror of Gable. Great stuff!This film almost single-handedly established the great screwball comedy. Colbert's Ellie is the ultimate screwy dame,paving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre, with Gable's Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic 'Nothing Sacred' (1937). This films holds a very important place in motion picture history.Best of all, it's so enjoyable.10/10.",

            "content": "The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards, this film is still popular today. That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes, the two stars go their separate ways (until the very end) and the story gets very stupid.The nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning (for good intentions) but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood, in films of the 1930s and 1940s, loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here, along with yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the \"road\" part of this film going longer - with Gable and Colbert trading barbs - it would have been super. Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own. She looks really pixie-ish and cute, although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens, another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars. One of the film world's most famous scenes is in this movie: the hitch-hiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a ride....and gets nowhere while Colbert, on her first try, gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie history.Overall, this is still one of the best comedies of \"The Golden Age,\" even with its faults.",

While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said \"now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver\" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" happens to be my personal most favorite film ever. It was an adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin), from the short story \"Night Bus\" and was directed by Frank Capra. With a simple story, plot, modest budget and a very short four week production schedule, this film goes a long way. Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it. Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget. This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success. The hopes were low for this film, even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles. Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in Hollywood.\"It Happened One Night\", 1934, had a relatively small budget for it's time: $325,000, of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $50,000 for her role. A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the 1930's. Released during America's Great Economic Depression, the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit. All the right elements came together. It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations. A film where luck and chemistry came together, producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved, including its' director Frank Capra.The film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing. For it's time, this style of film was new. It would be one of the first of a new genre: screwball romantic comedy. Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role, was a first in Hollywood history. Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards: \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\", 1975 and \"The Silence of the Lambs\", 1991.Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying: \"I just finished the worst film ever\" on \"It Happened One Night\". She had no idea how well the film would be edited. The film editing here is subtle and sublime. Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film. Colbert's demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks, because of her vacation schedule, actually created the lively pace of the film, working in it's favor. \"It Happened One Night\" is a fine example of a quality screenplay, some good luck and a lot of chemistry, all coming together, producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classic.Clark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining. The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gable's performance. Unfortunately, he would not be cast in a comedic role again, even after the big success of this film. The studio system of the time demanded stars remain type-casted. For Gable, that meant macho romantic leading action man.To me, \"It Happened One Night\" is the best ever romantic comedy film, a gold standard for it's genre. It's lost none of it's charm and naturalness since it's release in 1934. The look of the film dates it, but it still delivers it's original naturalness, charm, wittiness, timing, pacing and entertainment value. Just about a perfectly made film.",

            "content": "The first film to sweep the main categories of the Oscars (of that time - 1934) was IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. In it Clark Gable plays Peter Warne, a newspaperman who is having problems with his boss Joe Gordon (Charles C. Wilson), when he latches onto one of the big scoops of his time. Willful Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews (Walter Conolly), has fled her powerful father's yacht, in order to reach the man she claims she loves, an aviator named King Wesley (Jameson Thomas). Ellie is very strong minded and snobbish. She has common sense, but her will sometimes overcomes it. Peter hooks up with her on a bus that is going from Florida to New York. He soon lets her know that he knows her identity, but he will assist her if she will allow him to write of the bus trip for the newspaper.Capra movies are fun because he did not hesitate to throw in pieces of Americana into them. Here it was bus travel. The interstate highway system that we know of today really dates back to the 1950s (possibly it was the most useful internal achievement of Eisenhower's Presidency), but more and more roads between states were being built in the 1920s and 1930s due to the growth of the use of automobiles. However, Mr. Andrews (well played by Conolly as a stern but loving father - and a good judge of character: he doesn't think highly of Wesley), concentrates his agents at railroad and seaport (and even airport) depots and stations. He doesn't think Ellie will travel in such a plebeian manner as a bus. The bus is driven by Ward Bond, who has a nice, simple comic scene with Gable where all Bond repeats like a dummy is \"YEAH?\", to which an increasingly confused and befuddled Gable is forced \"YEAH!!\". The passengers are a mixed bag, and include Roscoe Karns as a heel and opportunist, and several others who entertain themselves singing \"The Man On the Flying Trapeze\". Ellie finally shows her humanity giving away most of her money to aid a boy and his mother who are so broke the mother fainted from hunger.Early trailer parks are shown in the film, as well as the rest stops of the 1930s (note a brief moment when a man in great distress makes a very quiet request for information to a waiter - he is told the comfort station is in the back). It's interesting to see a film like this to catch the changing scene in America in the 1930s or any period, and the things that we now take for granted.My one partial criticism of the film as it is it that Wesley is never really built up as a villain - although he is obviously a fortune hunter. He has some celebrity as an aviator (this was the age when men and women of real stature became public figures for aviation achievements: Lindbergh, Earhard, Post, Gatty, Hughes, Amy Johnson, Doolittle, Turner). But even Gable (admittedly jealous after he falls for Ellie) calls him \"the pill of the century\". As a stunt at the wedding ceremony, Wesley lands an auto-gyro on the lawn. Mr. Andrews feels it's silly. But for real villainy in the story, we are left with the treacherous Alan Hale (in one sequence) and Karns as a lecherous and greedy pest.That true love finally wins is to be expected. But the journey of Ellie Andrews and Peter Warne is a colorful one that takes us back to a moment when auto travel on the east coast was still quite a little adventure. The film won best picture, Capra best director, Gable best actor, and Colbert best actress. Ironically Colbert, a fine actress, never won another Oscar, and Gable (whose signature role was Rhett Butler, not Peter Warne) lost that Oscar of 1939 to Robert Donat (and lost the 1935 Oscar for Fletcher Christian to Victor MagLaglen). However, Peter Warne added more than an Oscar to Gable's legend. His scene where he undressed in a roadside motel room in front of Colbert revealed he did not wear an undershirt. Sales in men's undershirts declined precipitously for a number of years as a result.",

Not only that, but it changed the undershirt industry and inspired a famous bunny pose.The story takes place during the Depression, when hitchhiking was common. It concerns an heiress, Ellie (Claudette Colbert) who runs away from her father to join her sort-of husband in New York. On the bus, she meets a reporter named Peter (Clark Gable) who is down on his luck. The strike a bargain: Peter can have an exclusive on Ellie's story if he'll help her get to New York.Though many actors turned down the lead roles, the combination of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is perfect. Gable is appropriately a gruff know-it-all with oodles of sex appeal; Colbert is beautiful, spoiled and uppity. My favorite moment is when she coolly informs the bus driver that she's leaving so hold the bus for her.Any even peripheral fan of the film has heard that when Gable undressed and was wearing no undershirt, sales of undershirts plummeted. Perhaps a little less well known is that Gable's standing by a fence talking with a carrot in his mouth is allegedly the inspiration for Bugs Bunny. The most famous scene, of course, is Gable demonstrating how to hitch a ride and failing and Colbert lifting her skirt to get one immediately.Frank Capra is known for his feel good, idealistic films, but there was much more to this director than that, as \"It Happened One Night\" demonstrates. He gives the film a wonderful pace and gets marvelous performers out of his cast, which includes Walter Connolly as Ellie's father, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale and Ward Bond. It's a comedy, but Capra shades it with earmarks of the Depression. A slice of life in the 1930s, a wonderful comedy - well, in the end, it's a feel good film after all.",

Not exactly on a big profound dramatic level like a lot of other films of the 30s- including Capra's It's a Wonderful Life- but it's got such an air of confidence to its light-hearted comedy, and the winning combo of Gable and Colbert. The story is pretty simple, which is good so as to allow for this odd couple to bond and grow in behavioral terms; Colbert is spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews and she's just tied the knot, and Gable plays reporter Peter Warne. She jumps ship and Peter follows. It becomes a road movie soon after that (including the famous \"leg\" bit that's been a staple of male fantasy even up to today to a certain degree), and Capra gets his fun in showing these two characters as being so right for each other for all the wrong reasons. In that sense it's the prototypical romantic comedy, one that we've seen perhaps far too much today and parrotted without a lick of the whimsy Capra gives it. But it's also a big credit to the stars that they keep this tale uplifting (it was the depression after all), and they're simply magnetic personalities to fill up such identifiable personas. It's terrific.",

It's still got that magic despite the very obvious fact that it is forever imprisoned in that 1930s look of hair style and clothing on Colbert (must have been a tough decade for women to look attractive!!). Or maybe it's the fact that everything looks so antiquated (including the bus) that it only makes the comedy more endearing. And somehow, the two of them having to share a motel room while it's pouring rain and with only that thin blanket between them--well that must have seemed pretty risque back in 1934. Whatever, the dialog is ripe with some witty lines. The doughnut scene is priceless and shows just how fantastic Gable was with comedy. And his demonstration of how each man is different when it comes to undressing is another example of his comic flair. Colbert, of course, matches him every step of the way, reacting with such naturalness to all of his impish behavior.A joy from beginning to end.

            "content": "I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version. This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels. First, it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during 1934. It has won at least best actor, best actress and best director.  So it should be seen just for it's historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form. However, if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy. The  set up is that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) is a rich, spoiled,  independent woman who is running away from her father (in Florida) to  join her husband (not quite a complete marriage) in New York City. She  meets Peter (Clark Gable) on the bus who is a down & out reporter  looking for a big story. They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story. In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed -know it all reporter - Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself.. There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking. There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the 30's about the 30's. This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience. Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character. He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy. However, his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times (the know it all guy). The  character comes across as too simplistic by today's standards. However,  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side. Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations. The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  'white trash' was very funny. Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in 1934. Overall this movie is rated a 9.0 and  is highly recommended. A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however, hang in for this one. Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable (their first scene together) the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera. Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience.",

Also, arguably the beginnings of the screwball comedies, the film is a joy from start to finish, plus with Blu-ray you get to enjoy all those cars and buses and hot dog stands. Whilst the film plays with the idea of coyness, it is more or less pre-code and gets away with many a wisecrack that would have been cut the following year.

            "review_title": "The Birth of Romantic Comedy ...",
            "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" opens with two people profoundly disliking each other, a tough, blue-collar, down-to-earth journalist and a rich, spoiled and bratty heiress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, who both won Oscars for their respective roles, couldn't have played characters that were more opposite in their backgrounds and manners. Yet at the end, following one of the most creative and wink-inducing metaphors in cinema's history, they 'break the Jericho walls' together. Yes, this is an obligatory code of the romantic-comedy genre, but it's precisely because the film is the one that established these very codes.Yet, regardless of its influence on other movies or the predictable ending, there's one thing that makes the film stand on its own as a wonderful classic: it's a director's film and not anyone because his name is Frank Capra. \"It Happened One Night\" marks the spectacular entrance of the most significant director of Hollywood's Golden Age: a Sicilian emigrant who embraced the American dream with such intensity that it would show in each of his films, comedies or dramas. Through \"It Happened One Night\", Capra built his reputation of a talented director whose films would forever display a vision of America never deprived of a humanistic touch.I must say though that I was surprised to read some harsh Internet a user complaining about the way Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) was treated by Peter Warne (Clark Gable). Indeed, all through the picture, she got yelled at, threatened and the icing of the cake: she got spanked. It's very eloquent about today's narrow-mindedness and the way every single thing is automatically associated to a conflict between men and women. It's not surprising because it's the very plot element that would drive most of the romantic comedies today. It did well for \"When Harry Met Sally\u0085\" but it also reduced the genre to bourgeois-like comedy of manners with no other purpose than underlining a sort of eternal opposition between male and women. As for the class struggle, it's now translated to modern fairy-tale format with mixed results, sometimes good (\"Coming to America\") sometimes, not so good (\"Maid in Manhattan\") but always superficial in the end. The class struggle is naturally more significant in 1934 in the context of the Great Depression Indeed, Frank Capra, cleverly uses the comedic story to subtly write a social commentary about the America of the 30's, it's not as militant as his later works but it does provide a slice of life of America's people in a few scenes. Some of them reach very dramatic points, like when Peter gives all the money left to a kid whose mother fainted from hunger in the bus. The film provides remarkable examples of the solidarity that prevailed during those difficult times and that were totally ignored by the rich people who lived in a world where everything, everyone could be bought. Gable strikes the viewer by delivering a very punchy speech against Colbert, and we could read between the lines of his rant, what would constitute the essential of Capra's themes and messages in his next films. This intelligent and thought- provokingly humanistic side is the little flavor that remains after the laughs, but there are still laughs. A few romantic comedies try to mix the humor with social commentaries, and the miracle of \"It Happened One Night\" is that it never contradicts the overall mood of the film, which is very warm and delightful. To a certain extent, the film is Capraesque on the surface but in its core, it's a hilarious and entertaining screwball comedy. The film was one of Columbia's picture major hits and that definitely launched Capra's career: had it failed, maybe we wouldn't have known Mr. Smith or George Bailey, but again, thankfully, nothing ever comes to alter the overall quality. It's funny, romantic and witty. Of course, it's also known for having been the first film to win the 5 major Awards in history, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (coincidentally, all these films won 5 Awards) Well, on that level, what happened that Oscar's night was totally deserved.Capra's directing is very powerful in the way it creates a parallel between the road trip across America and the romance between Peter and Ellie, it's Ellie's immersion into the lives of little people who sing and dance in the bus, who share food, money and laughs, and the realization that she can find happiness in this world. Through Ellie, it's also Capra's way to make us feel for this world and wish people could stand together as they did these days and he makes it through a perfect dosage of wit, of slapstick gags and verbal exchanges, the five minutes of the film about the hitch-hiking are as comedic as comedy can get, with the perfect balance between sophistication and a naughtiness, which is perfect for the romance.Gable is masculine with a very sensitive way about him and Colbert is very strong-willed yet sentimentally vulnerable. There's something extremely childish and endearing in these two characters that seem like constantly playing games, hiding their true feelings, acting tough, as if it was the only possible facade. Like when Gable pretends to be a gangster and then accidentally spits on his sleeve or a more dramatic part where he rejects Colbert's declaration and she bursts into silent tears on her bed. Both Peter and Ellie are like trapped in their own carapace and incapable of making the first step, to our own frustration. But that's the way Capra handles its characters, it's only at the end that everything gets well. See, there are two ways, the easy way, the hard way, and the Capraesque way. It's like the hard way, but wittier.",

The story itself is basically a somewhat fluffy romantic comedy, not unlike hundreds of other romantic comedies that have been made over the years - it's fun, pleasant to watch and more or less predictable. There's no real dramatic tension; the only mystery is how the main characters are going to end up together rather than if they're going to end up together.Colbert nailed the part of Ellie Andrews - a spoiled and rich young woman who married a man she didn't really love just to get out of her father's controlling clutches. He essentially kidnaps her in a bid to end the marriage, and she escapes, trying to get from Miami to New York to be reunited with the guy. On the road she hooks up with Peter Warne (Gable), a down and out reporter who sees the story of Ellie's escape from her father as his way back into the newspaper business. Gable was fun and handled the part well, although to be honest I've seen him in better roles. Colbert and Gable had a pretty good chemistry together, and the supporting cast, while not overwhelming, held up their ends of the bargain well enough.A winner of multiple Academy Awards for 1934, this is a good movie, and certainly Gable and Colbert are the big attractions in it. 7/10",

            "content": "Here I am again, in a quandary over a film's reputation and my own reaction to it. Hailed as one of the great screwball comedies and on many best lists, I just didn't think it was as strong a picture as I was expecting. When I think of 'screwball', I'm looking for snappy one liners and engaging chemistry between the principals, but the film didn't deliver for me on that score. Gable's character came off as rather harsh for my taste, especially in the scene at the cabin when they faked their marriage to convince the authorities that Ellie (Claudette Colbert) wasn't the person they were looking for. There was also that set up at the beginning of the relationship when Peter Warne (Gable) has the 'so there' tiff with the bus driver. I was really expecting a clever resolution to that exchange and it just went nowhere.So OK, the picture swept the Oscars, but take a look at one of the competitors - \"The Thin Man\". Now there was a screwball comedy, with as engaging a couple as you can find in William Powell and Myrna Loy. What was probably needed here was someone like Cary Grant to pull off the male lead, as Gable's approach was just a bit too shrill. In fact, Grant was a newspaper reporter in \"His Girl Friday\", opposite Rosalind Russell, so there's another example. Another would be \"Philadelphia Story\", Grant again with a little help from Jimmy Stewart. The latter two came a half dozen years later, but you still get the idea.As for director Capra, I think he outdid this picture with his 1938 Best Film Oscar winner - \"You Can't Take It With You\", and you can't get any more screwball than that one. And even though the theme is somewhat different, \"It's A Wonderful Life\" stands head and shoulders above this one in my estimation. So maybe I'm missing something, and I'll leave it at that.There were a few things that caught my attention though, like 'Hot Dogs and Hamburgers - 10 cents' on one of the roadside bus stops - there's a bargain! And I had never seen an 'autogyro' before, I thought it would be a helicopter, but seeing it with two propellers going in different directions was really cool to see.But then you had Gable smoking in bed a couple of times. Not a very good example to set when so many people lose their lives in house fires from that very cause. And who thought it was cool for him to beat up a guy to steal his car? Sorry for those downers. But the thing that nagged me the most - what did Ellie Andrews ever see in King Westley to begin with?",

The silent film era had come and gone, films with sound were now familiar to movie-goers and the Oscars had a few Best Picture winners already named. However, \"It Happened One Night\" probably turned American cinema into a business more than any other film before its time. The production was a commercial blockbuster and dominated the Oscars as it won five Academy Awards (sweeping the picture, director, writing and lead performer categories). \"It Happened One Night\" is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy about a young newlywed (Oscar-winner Claudette Colbert) who has been forced onto her rich father's (Walter Connolly) yacht after he annuls the marriage. Colbert has had it with her father and decides to jump ship literally and get back to her new husband (Jameson Thomas). Naturally it is not near as easy as she first expected as nothing seems to go right and she continues to be helped and annoyed by a sleazy tabloid reporter (Oscar-winner Clark Gable) who is just looking for a good story to give to his readers. While at odds with one another, they slowly realize that they have a mutual admiration and love for one another, but will they both realize it before it is too late? Frank Capra (who received his first of three Best Director Oscars here) was arguably the finest director from the 1930s to the early-1960s. His pure style and his deliberate compassion and love for his characters created outstanding film after outstanding film. Still excellent and still a wonderful piece of entertainment, \"It Happened One Night\" is an essential to all lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

It was a huge huge hit and won the Oscar as Best Picture and Capra,as Best Director, and Colbert and Gable as Best Actress and Actor.The film is charming and the \"Walls of Jericho\" fun.

But along the way, it demonstrates a couple theories I have about successful films.The first is that the actors are often the last ones to know what a film is all about. They have a different set of concerns than the filmmaker. Sometimes this is taken advantage of by the filmmaker, who exploits the unwittingness of the actor. The Coens do this all the time: they'll have one actor who is clued in and at least one actor who is not and there is a several-layered goof on the target.Here, Ms. Colbert walked through this picture more or less as the character she played: completely at the mercy of forces around here but believing she was in control; absolutely oblivious to the actual manipulations at work. She thought the picture was bad, a well known story that. But I think that except for the few cases where the actor is the only attraction (think of the bombastic performances of the latter DeNiro or Pacino for instance) the actor and filmmaker are working at crosspurposes.The second of Ted's laws is that nearly all successful stories includes itself in some referential way. This is a (movie) story about a (newspaper) story. The people engaged in the creation, the reporting of the movie are mirrored in the characters engaged in similar reporting. This is a pervasive narrative device, so much so, I've decided to write a book about it.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

Best Actress (Claudette Colbert) Best Actor (Clark Gable) Best Director (Frank Capra) and, of course, BEST PICTURE!! Why was this movie considered so promiscuous and avant garde? Basically because of all the covert innuendos, and the lewd insinuations which gave every indication that, even back then, sex was not just for pro-creation purposes!! When dealing with the demons inside of your typical red blooded American male..What exactly was it that they had to do to assuage their consciences anyway? Now presides the proverbial instance of a \"gentleman\" having his cake and eating it too. This is not really possible!! Not for a \"gentleman\" anyway! The classic scene in this movie was predicated on Claudette Cobert's actions being of her own volition.. The necessary bed sheet in the most classic scene in \"It Happened One Night\" was construed as a case whereby Clark Gable knew the repercussions of such an ensuing fate without the presence of this symbolic divisiveness!! This film definitely delves into the euphemisms which imply that something had to be done to quell such a precariously enticing and comfortably volatile situation!! Without overt barricades, it would be something other than spiritual growth that Clark Gable would have to worry about!! This film broke ground on the wilder side of male's hormonal nature!! The reciprocating movie audience had a thorough comprehension of what the potential chicanery was which loomed on the horizon! Clark Gable's wiles were emerging and ready to surface!! AFI has listed this as one of the top 100 films ever made in the history of the American cinema. This does not surprise me, the issue of carnal desires always evoked a sordid curiosity with the average movie viewer!! The innocence of maverick movie making entertained the movie audience with this film's innocuous approach!! Being candid about the whole situation, it stands to reason that chivalry has to contend with the formidable foes that are related to the innate and lecherous desires of lonely men!! Frank Capra directs this film, and it goes without saying that Capra is a remarkable director... His list of outstanding movies is endless! \"It's A Wonderful Life\" gets the star lighted accolade of being his stellar mantel piece trophy!! The acting in the film \"It Happened One Night\" was fantastic, and the entertaining double entendre to everything made this film very enjoyable!! By today's standards, of course, this film would not be considered sexually suggestive in any substantial manner whatsoever. However, given the fact that this film was made in 1934, \"It Happened One Night\" became the harbinger of things to come with the advent of depicting how sexual indiscretion can proliferate once Pandora's's box is opened!! Wonderful movie!! The talent in this film is utterly astounding!!",

            "content": "Clark Gable dials up the 1934 beefcake with his shirt off in one seen, and Colbert famously stops a car while hitchhiking by revealing her leg, but the movie is quite innocuous, and is better known for essentially being the blueprint for romantic comedies to this day. Colbert is a spoiled, rich heiress who runs away from her family (actually starting this by jumping off a yacht and swimming away from them). Gable is a newspaper reporter who's been fired. They find each other on a crowded train, and are forced to sit together. They hate one another at first, but after spending time on a couple of buses, a car, in the haystack together, and in a hotel room divided by a clothesline with a blanket hanging over it \u0085 well, you get the idea. At one point he carries her across a stream caveman style, over his shoulder, and gives her a swat on the behind as they debate what constitutes a piggyback ride. They confuse each other's motivations and split at the end, Colbert off to wed another (and in a very pretty dress), but we all know where it's heading, and this one is complete with a 'runaway bride' scene. I don't know if the movie was worthy of sweeping the Academy Awards (and Colbert herself didn't think much of it), but it's still sharp with its dialog, and quite entertaining. Aside from the main story line, it has a nice 'Capra' touch in having everyone on a bus (including the driver) singing verses of 'The Man on the Flying Trapeze' to pass the time. I also smiled over this interchange after Gable's character had tossed some newspapers off the bus to make space for his seat:Bus driver: \"Oh, fresh guy, huh? What you need is a good sock in the nose.\" Clark Gable: \"Listen pardner, you might like my nose, but I do. I always wear it out in the open, where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"Now that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"You keep that up, we're not going to get anywhere.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"Ya got me. Yeah!\" (to chuckling from the other passengers)",

            "content": "\"Romance triumphant?\" Well, it gets a decent ride in this amiable, low- octane comedy, which wiser people than I regard as a classic.Wealthy heiress Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is tired of her gilded cage. After literally jumping ship from her controlling tycoon father (Walter Connelly), she winds up in the lap of recently-fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who decides to aid her escape in hopes of reviving his career. Trekking across country without a dime, they find their unlikely union triggering feelings neither is prepared to handle.I've read that \"It Happened One Night\" is the mother of screwball comedies, which is absolutely the wrong way to approach this film. Sure, there's banter, and a \"dizzy\" lady at the center, but what you don't get here is the spinning-plate subplots or the zany secondary characters of true screwball. This is a two-handed rom-com that plays its story straight down the middle.If you love Colbert and Gable, you may well enjoy this film more than I did. Despite the clever set-up, I found the story and the main characters hard to take after the first 20 minutes.Director Frank Capra gets more out of ambiance here, and some fantastic visual language, like the way the rain falls outside the windows of a cabin where Ellie and Peter are holed up. There are some delightful moments, such as when the pair hoodwink a couple of nosy detectives, or sing along with a bus full of passengers to \"The Man In The Flying Trapeze.\"Warne's main comic trait is his cantankerousness. \"Listen, partner, you may not like my nose, but I do,\" Peter tells an ornery bus driver (Ward Bond). \"I always wear it out in the open where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it.\" It sets Peter up well, anyway.Yet the overall experience of their company never feels natural. Peter lectures Ellie about everything from hitchhiking to dunking donuts, and emerges a bit of a bore. Ellie's more interesting, but that's more because of Colbert's beauty than anything her character says. Having him tell her off (\"Ever hear of the word 'humility'\") suggests more of the director's take on class differences than anything disagreeable in her behavior, which is surprisingly docile in the main.Neither lead makes you think anything other than Depression dollars is driving their union. They may play well off each other, but only for laughs. When things get \"mushy\" (something Ellie likes and Peter doesn't), the story falters. The worst part comes near the end, when he abruptly leaves her alone for a night and gets mad when she reacts naturally enough by returning to Pa.There are iconic moments in the film, like when she shows him up as the better hitchhiker, and when she is clearly affected by the sight of Peter without a shirt on, but what \"It Happened\" lacks are the smaller moments that pull you in without feeling manipulated. I counted one, when a close-up of Ellie in the darkness shows only the tiniest pinpricks of light of her eyes as she takes in her situation with Peter. Otherwise, Capra is too obviously pushing me how to feel.I didn't feel much of anything when I was done watching this, just a mixture of appreciation for the cleverness of the story and relief it was over. However well it did at the Oscars in 1935, \"It Happened\" lacks the timelessness of Golden Age Hollywood. Yes, it plays with the conventions, and delivers some laughs, but left me cold all the same.",

The limb is mightier than the hand when it comes to the task of hitching a ride. Problem is in 1934 it was easier to trust strange drivers.5. Very easy to steal cars by knocking people out and tying them to trees. I'm just never going to try it.6. Never leave your bus ticket on the seat.7. You CAN and WILL get to New York on an amount of $4 if you don't buy chocolate, sleep in hay stacks overnight, eat carrots and persuade motel owners you are staying for a week. Of course, it always helps to travel with an unemployed newspaper reporter who has the upper hand threat of black mail. 8. Never be afraid to call home in case of emergency, even if there's not a fortune and fiancee waiting. 9. Blankets are sufficient walls of Jericho to keep the big bad wolf out.\n10. Ignore all of the above. No one is crazy enough to play cat and mouse if wads of cash are waiting. Without a doubt, this still rates as Capra's best award winning success, by being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Oscars, including the coveted Best Picture of 1934. Capra-esque trademarks and some of the most famous scenes are a part of this classic comedy which made screwballs popular. And the screenplay is full of absolutely delicious moments! Gable and Colbert are at their comic best, it would have been nice if they teamed together again. They both deserved their Oscars. Capra's direction was excellent, but he just got even better, picking up another two best director oscars in four years, this success marking his first.\nAlthough my favourite movie of 1934 is still \"The Thin Man\", \"It Happened One Night\" is one of the best movies ever made from the 1930s.Rating: 9/10",

The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of, but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time it's actually very clever, carefully written and touching.------------- Take this scene for instance. Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back. She doesn't notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar.

This was also a time when women's roles were changing in the US: the 'women's suffrage' movement gained women the right to vote in 1920 (19th Amendment), more equality in decision-making, more freedom in dress, gender & sexual roles (e.g., '20s 'Flappers'). \"Screwball comedies\" capitalized and fed on those changes: they typically \"feature farcical situations, a combination of slap-stick with fast-paced repartee and show struggles between\" (central characters of different) \"economic classes. They also generally feature a self-confident and often stubborn central female protagonist and a plot involving courtship and marriage or remarriage\" (\"quotes\" from Wikipedia).A young 30's Gable plays \"Peter,\" a drinking, hard boiled newspaper reporter just fired from his job when he accidentally meets the young 20's \"Ellie\" (a young 30's Colbert) who's increasingly rebelled against the escalating but failing attempts of her upper class, super-rich father to control her. He tries to keep her on his Florida yacht while arranging to annul Ellie's impulsive marriage to a man (whom her father recognizes but Ellie doesn't as mainly interested in her wealth). But Ellie escapes her father's captivity and sets off to NYC to be reunited with her new spouse. On her way, she meets Gable who's initially interested in helping her because it'll lead to his scoop of a newspaper story (and reinstatement of his job). But then--romance eventually, gradually, starts to happen between you know who.My rating: 6 of 10 I found this interesting as a time-traveling experience--early '30s bus rides, clothes, roles, attitudes, etc.-- but all the people seemed to me to be too much caricatures and not enough real characters. (However, many people on IMDb's \"Discussion Board\" say the more often they've seen this film, the more highly they value it--many saying it's among their most favorite films of all--so maybe familiarity breeds appreciation?) FWIW: Neither Gable nor Colbert wanted to be in this film; MGM \"loaned\" them to Columbia Pictures, then a 2nd rate movie company, for this movie as punishment for each being too \"uppity\" and/or violating MGM policies. But, after this film gained such outstanding success (lifting Columbia's rank to among the majors) and substantially helped both Gable's & Colbert's careers, they came to appreciate it.",

It recently was on a list of top movies, and my local public library had a copy of the DVD so I snagged it and watched it.As history records it, this Capra movie was made almost on a lark, with actress Colbert just available for 4 weeks, and she demanded twice her normal salary in a mild effort to discourage the producers. They made the deal, started shooting right away, made it in 4 weeks, and it swept the Academy Awards for that year.Clark Gable is Peter Warne, reporter, in a different role for him. He is a boozing, wise-cracking reporter who tells it like it is, and doesn't hesitate to call a spoiled rich girl just that.Claudette Colbert is the spoiled rich girl, Ellie Andrews, who had eloped but her father was determined to get the marriage annulled. Her father is Walter Connolly as wealthy Alexander Andrews.As the story begins Ellie and her father are on their yacht in Miami when she gets tired of his telling her what to do and jumps off the boat, and manages to get away. (Colbert was 30 during filming, it seemed she was a bit old for her father to try so hard to control her, and always calling her \"baby\".)Most of the movie is a road trip, as Ellie takes a bus back to New York to be with her beau. On the bus she meets Peter, her suitcase with money is stolen, so he sticks with her, and then realizes there may be a great story here, as all the papers announce that she is being looked for.Predictably Peter and Ellie begin to care for each other, and she starts to doubt whether she wants to be married to the other guy.Good 1934 movie, and my favorite Clark Gable role. I watched it again in August 2020 on the Movies TV network and enjoyed it as much this second time.",

Ellie runs away from her father sets off across country to get to her husband in New York. On the bus she meets a recently-fired reporter, Peter Warne. The two don't get along but, figuring out who she is, and knowing that her father will have every route into New York covered with private detectives, he offers to help her get to a husband. In exchange he wants an exclusive on her story. The two tag along together, getting through some interesting adventures. Over time they even get to like each other...A gem of a film from legendary director Frank Capra. I was expecting a rather standard romantic drama but It Happened One Night is so much better than that. Warm, and hilariously funny at times, it's certainly not your average romantic comedy. Dialogue is incredibly fresh and snappy and even the romantic side is not straightforward, keeping the schmaltz to a minimum and taking some unpredictable twists and turns.The great direction by Capra and the solid script are aided by wonderful performances from Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert in the lead roles. The chemistry between them is great and their delivery is spot-on.Both Gable and Colbert received Oscars for their performances, as did Capra for Best Director. The movie was the well-deserved 1935 Best Picture Oscar winner.Though not Frank Capra's first movie, not by any means, this was the movie that put him on the map and kick-started a run of creativity that would see him make such classics as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, You Can't Take It With You, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Arsenic and Old Lace and, of course, It's a Wonderful Life.",

The unhappy daughter of a wealthy banker flees daddy's yacht in Miami, intent on getting to New York City to be reunited with the man she married against her father's wishes; a recently-fired newspaper reporter attempts to befriend the spoiled heiress on their journey by bus. Wafer-thin material stretched to the breaking point, with a rollicking first-half (in buses and roadside motels) let down by less-funny second and third acts more concerned with a quasi-introspective study of character. Robert Riskin won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar; Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert also won for their performances. Indeed, their rapport is easy and free of gimmicks, though some of the sniping grates. Frank Capra won two Academy Awards, one for his direction and the other for producing this Best Picture winner. Its American minutiae was fresh and novel at the time--and some of it still holds up today--but when the wisecracks turn somber, and Riskin's script loops around to bide time, the film seems less a feel-good trifle than an over-praised, desperate movie-star \"product\". Remade in 1956 as \"You Can't Run Away From It\". **1/2 from ****",

Seen on television this very day it holds up well and is a fine mirror of a lost time. Colbert was always a class act and Gable showed a flair for something other than macho roles to say nothing of ever reliable Walter Connolly who alternated with Eugene Palette in portraying wealthy fathers with errant daughters.

Meet John Doe, It's a Wonderful life, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town are four of the greatest films ever made.  Capra was not without his misses and downright lemons though.  Arsenic and Old Lace and the abysmal Here Comes the Groom fall into these categories.  It Happened one Night falls somewhere in between.  Not an all out screwball comedy and not alot of social commentary, it is nevertheless a good light road picture, one of the first, and shouldn't fail to entertain.  Innovative in it's way it was the forerunner to many more comedies in the later 30's which have become standards in the genre of Screwball. Capra here was still honing his technique for better films to come and it shows. At times the timing is off and the writing could use snappier one liners which hit the mark. Gable's funnier moments seem to be accidental or improvised -- and Colbert, though capable, just is no Carole Lombard or Rosalind Russell in her delivery.  The thigh scene where she hails the passing car has been improved upon in several later comedies and even cartoons.  Even though I like this picture, I feel it is another film which has received a higher rating over the years than it is due.  Maybe it's just my love of more complex and polished comedic situations and dialogue in films like Bringing up Baby and His Girl Friday etc which I'm missing here. Cary Grant was, afterall, the definitive leading man in this type of picture.  It Happened one Night is a good, not great evening at the movies.  If you want to see Clark Gable really turning on the comedy charm check out Teacher's Pet with Doris Day which was made late in his career.  I've yet to see a better Gable comedy than that.  And if you're looking for another sweet road picture from yesteryear I recommend A Lady Takes a Chance with Jean Arthur and John Wayne, a light screwball comedy dappled with excellent performances.  It's a shame it is long forgotten and hard to obtain on video.",

            "content": "The idea for tonight's film started in a barber shop while Frank Capra was waiting for a haircut he read an old magazine article in Cosmopolitan called \"Night Bus\" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. It was a cute idea so Capra asked Columbia studios to buy the rights to it and then he forgot about it. Frank's previous feature was LADY FOR A DAY which got great reviews and was Columbia studio's first film ever Oscar nominated and Capra's. Irving Thalberg wanted Capra to make his next film at MGM in exchange for $50k and the loan of a star. But at the last minute Louis B. Mayer canceled the film but honored the deal. Back at Columbia Capra wanted to make Night Bus, but studio tyrant Harry Cohn and all his advisers fought against it. They said things like, \"It's nothing; froth, trivia, just another bus picture, no suspense, no heart, no oomph, winter's coming and it's all exteriors.\" All they could get Capra to do was change the title to IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT which they said was too long to fit on a marquee! Capra tried casting Myrna Loy \u2013 she turned it down; then Margaret Sullavan \u2013 said 'no thank you'; Miriam Hopkins was insulted and said, 'Not if I never play another part'; Constance Bennett told him to go fly a kite and then offered to buy the script and have it rewritten for her! Capra had co-written the script with his favorite writer Robert Riskin but they brought in Myles Connolly who added more sympathetic and interesting characters so people could identify with them. The pretty girl, a spoiled brat, was rich yes but bored with being an heiress now wanting something real. The man was made a guy we all know and like; a tough crusading reporter on the outs with his pigheaded editor. It's The Taming Of The Shrew, but the shrew must be worth taming and the guy must be one of us. Back to casting, this time they went after Robert Montgomery a great light comedian at MGM. Mayer called Cohn and said, \"Montgomery says there are too many bus pictures and (don't take this in the wrong way) but going from MGM to lowly Columbia was an insult. But you've caught me in a good mood. I got an actor here who's been a bad boy. Wants more money. And I'd like to spank him. You can have Clark Gable.\" Surprisingly the next knock on Capra's shabby office door came from a very drunk and cursing Gable, reporting to Siberia as he called it. Gable's objections almost made Capra throw in the towel but then Harry Cohn suggested getting Claudette Colbert for the girl in the story. (He had heard she liked money.) So Capra and Riskin made an appointment that very night to see her at her home. When they arrived Colbert regretted agreeing to the meeting as she was packing to leave on a month long skiing vacation. Capra saw this attractive, wealthy and spoiled woman and knew she was perfect for the part. So Capra, after being bit in the butt by her dog, asked what it would take to get her in the picture. (Capra had directed her first picture, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE a silent made in 1927 and a flop) To throw him off she said she normally made $25k a picture (a price Columbia had never paid to an actor before), he would have to double it AND she was only available from her studio Paramount during her Christmas vacation. They would have to shoot all her scenes and retakes in less than 4 weeks -- half the time they had budgeted! So Capra called Cohn to ask would he pay her the $50k, Cohn said \"I can pay it if you can shoot it in 4 weeks.\" Capra said, he didn't know, but he'd try. So they told her, \"Deal, Claudette! $50k for 4 weeks! Okay?\" To which she replied, \"Oh for God's sake!\" She was trapped. That next day she had to report for her costume fittings and the day after that they begin filming\u0085 in a hurry. While they shot film all day Capra edited and rewrote the story to tighten it up at night. To make the film and story move quicker he asked the actors to talk faster, his amazing cinematographer Joseph Walker to shoot faster. They had little time to build sets so most of the film had to be shot on location. If an actor didn't show up one day he was replaced by another and lines were rewritten. Most scenes were shot in one short take and then they sprinted on to the next location. Capra, getting exhausted claimed he felt like a boxer who left his fight in the gym. But, things started to pull together as they filmed. Capra in his autobiography talked about the happy accidents like when Colbert did not want to undress in front of the camera came up with the blanket being used as the \"walls of Jericho.\" Gable to save time undressing skipped wearing a t-shirt, causing t-shirt sales to later plummet. One of the best happy accidents happened when Capra decided to add a scene on the bus of a couple hillbilly musicians who start singing The Man On The Flying Trapeze to break up the monotony. He noticed the extras started smiling and singing along, almost becoming child like. Frank stopped and called for 4 more cameras and his stars. He told everyone they had no time to rehearse but to feel free to join in the singing and ham it up if they wanted too. He then told Gable and Colbert that they were a pair of icebergs when the scene stars and they were to slowly melt. Then they shot it all in one take. Just watch the actor's faces as they naturally shed their inhibitions and join in having fun!",

            "content": "Robert Riskin's screenplay is filled with plentiful wit and repartee. The dynamics between the chief characters are ripe for comedy, and the situational humor in the picture is fantastic. Clark Gable and especially Claudette Colbert give wonderfully spirited performances that are a real pleasure to watch, not least as they have outstanding on-screen chemistry; I could easily stand to watch ten more films starring these two. The scene writing and narrative at large sharp and smart, a true delight, and who but Frank Capra could be relied upon to make a movie with so much lighthearted warmth? Some moments that would come off as ham-handed in another title are executed with a joyous earnestness that's welcome and refreshing; in contrast, some scenes and dialogue are so silly that the term \"screwball comedy\" feels insufficient, elevating mundanity to an art form of ridiculousness. All this would be more than enough in and of itself, but the production design and art direction are rich and inviting, and the costume design and hair and makeup no less so. Joseph Walker's cinematography, meanwhile, is at once both soft and vivid, allowing 'It happened one night' to literally be easy on the eyes. It's no wonder why this is held in such high regard, for even ninety years on, it's superbly entertaining!This isn't to say that it hasn't aged at all in that same time. While unlikely pair Peter and Ellen do come around, with more depth to both becoming evident, it's worth noting that to some extent the film falls into the same trap as a great many of its contemporaries. The man is always right, dontcha know, and good and clever and wise, particularly compared to a woman is always a spoiled brat, dontcha know, and he must look out for her and teach her the error of her ways and all that's wrong about her. As fun and cheeky as the picture is, I'd be lying if I said it didn't take a while at first for me to warm up to it, for earlier scenes reek of sexist condescension that's altogether tiresome. This is almost rather flummoxing, considering the fabulous intelligence, ingenuity, and heart that characterizes the movie at large. Some specific scenes are so terrific that I want to say they're among the best (if not simply the superlative) in the entirety of Capra's oeuvre, and surely very high on the list in cinema overall. The tale truly didn't need to be so heavy-handed in its exposition to provide the necessary contrast to propel the eventual shift, and to set up the inevitable conclusion.The good news is that much more than not the feature is so strong and vibrant that its value far outweighs the early weakness. It's not forgotten, or forgiven, but it pales in comparison. Why, even as 'It happened one night' seems to run a bit long in the tooth, the last twenty minutes or so are also executed so finely that every last vestige of consternation is all but wiped from the slate. There is, in my mind, an asterisk appended to this movie, but it's small and slight next to the tremendous worth the title otherwise represents. I expected a good time before I sat to watch, yet when all is said and done this is far better and more essential a view than I could have anticipated. Gable and Colbert are marvelous, with supporting cast members like Walter Connolly having their own moments in the sun; the cast turned in sublime contributions; the writing and direction are almost as good as any could possibly get. Ultimately this is just a classic, period, and one that just about everyone needs to see at least once. There's a reason Capra has the reputation that he does, and 'It happened one night' is proof positive. However you need to go about watching it, this is well worth your time!",

Along the way she learns a thing or two about the rest of the people in America. (This is a film in the Depression.)'Happened' has a very \"love to hate you\" vibe about it between the two leads, whose blossoming relationship is the star of the film. Beginning with a bus ride, the duo ride, walk, hitchhike and sleep in various locations, jabbing at each other for most of it. The do seem an odd couple at first, but you grow to love them, as they do each other. It's cool, because you could argue the \"tipping point\", where each realizes their feelings for each other, is one of many scenes.While on the topic of scenes, there are some great ones. The bus, the songs, the \"gangster\", the hitchhiking, and my favourite, the angry couple (\"QUIT BAWLING!\") keep the film fresh and funny, until the last act where the 'rom' in this rom-com takes over.

The Hays Code was on its way in, the age of \"talkies\" had arrived, the Great Depression was in full swing and hack directors were busy turning cinema into a glorified version of stage theatre.And so \"It Happened One Night\" is primarily an interesting time capsule, flirting with sexuality and immorality, conning us into laughing at a rather misogynistic plot, celebrating the invention of sound cinema with much song and dance business and carefully selling another love-conquers-money dream to its impoverished Depression Era audience.Would modern audiences buy such a tale today? Of course they would. The template of many \"opposites attract\" romantic comedies starts right here, and ever since Rob Reiner \"updated\" Capra's film with \"The Sure Thing\" in 1985, movie studios have been retelling this tale, in one form or the other, virtually every year.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "\"It Happened One Night,\" the smash-hit movie of 1934, may not seem groundbreaking today, but it's still thoroughly entertaining. Its sturdy romantic-comedy plot has had elements recycled into many other movies, including classics like \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Roman Holiday.\" Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), an impulsive heiress, is trying to escape her controlling father and join the man she loves. On her bus from Miami to New York, she meets streetwise journalist Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who agrees to help her avoid the police if he can get the rights to her story. Gable has probably the showier role: Peter is fast-talking, cynical, and contemptuous of Ellie, always trying to teach her common sense. His lessons include, to entertaining effect, \"How a Man Undresses,\" \"How to Dunk a Doughnut,\" \"How to Hitchhike.\" However, Ellie is a quick learner, and by the time the hitchhiking lesson comes around, she can beat Peter at his own game! Another great scene has Gable and Colbert act like a bickering married couple to throw the police off their trail. The movie also attempts to show how Ellie becomes a better person by interacting with ordinary citizens (played by some of those great '30s character actors, talking in colorful vernacular), but I thought it could have gone a little further in that regard.Most of \"It Happened One Night,\" when the characters are on the road, is fast-paced and quick-witted. (At the beginning, Ellie jumps off her father's yacht wearing a dressing gown, and the next time we see her, she's at a bus station in a sweater and skirt. A typical movie would have showed exactly how she got her bus ticket and clothes, which would probably have bogged things down. \"It Happened One Night\" just has Ellie mention, in a later scene, that she pawned her watch to get money.) But at the end, when the romantic complications need to get sorted out, the pace slows. Also, Ellie's behavior annoyed me: for the whole movie, she's chafed under her father's control, but in the end she lacks the courage to follow her heart, and needs Daddy to make everything all right. Still, if Mr. Andrews hadn't orchestrated things, Ellie wouldn't get her happy ending...and that wouldn't be right in a movie like this, now would it?",

            "content": "From my fairly dissatisfied point of view, the absolute highlight of this decidedly disappointing \"Screwball\" comedy from 1934 took place within the first 15 minutes when wealthy bank Pres, Alex Andrews, so rightly slapped the face of his snitty, snotty, snooty, spoiled-brat daughter, Ellie. (And, boy, did she ever have it coming to her!) I can't begin to tell you how much I wished that this royal, high'n'mighty bitch had gotten her over-lacquered face slapped a few more times, but, of course, it never happened.Over the years I have heard (time & again) people literally falling all over themselves, raving away to me about \"It Happened One Night\" (IHON) being the ultimate \"be-all-and-end-all\" of Hollywood, screwball comedies.Well, I must say, that after giving IHON a fair enough view, I couldn't believe how petty, small and downright trivial its sappy story was.Not only was there absolutely no on-screen chemistry, whatsoever, taking place between IHON's 2 co-stars (Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert), but, I thought that Colbert's character (Ellie Andrews) was positively despicable and I couldn't have given a wet fart about her \"poor-little-rich-girl\" problems.And, not only that, but, Colbert (who was 31 at the time) was clearly way too old to be playing this part which would have been more suited for a younger woman of about 20.I am absolutely shocked out of my socks that this trite, little, nothing-of-a-movie actually swept the 1935 Oscar presentations by scoring for itself 5 of its prized awards in all of the top categories of \"Picture\", \"Actor\", \"Actress\", \"Director\" & \"Screenplay\".Back in \"Depression Era\" America IHON might have thrilled and delighted its audiences to literal pieces, but, today, 80 years later, its apparent charm & appeal (which doesn't hold up very well) got completely lost on this here viewer.All that IHON came across as being was just a completely contrived, clich\u00e9d and predictable story whose attempt at cuteness and coyness left me utterly unmoved.From my point of view, this rather flat and tired \"Boy-Meets-Girl\" Comedy/Romance was, at best, only mediocre entertainment.",

            "review_title": "Enjoyable comedy with social commentary",
            "content": "If you are having a tough day, this movie brightens in a nice way.To build off the other reviews, I first agree with comix-man's 2002 review that \"Frank Capra's idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films\" and that this film was one \"where anything can happen, where being a nice person is all you need to succeed.\" I would also say that the true state of the county was undoubtedly indicated, as that review states, because of hard times for many, especially the clash of classes. I also agree that the \"viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind, even if its only that a person's ideals could be used to make such a film.\" But there's more than that. This film was a great comedy which I actually wasn't expecting because the other Capra films I've watched, like It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), and You Can't Take It With You (1938) are not comedies in the slightest.At the beginning of the film, Ellie Andrews (played by Claudette Colbert) escapes a boat that her father is keeping on, swimming away, leading to a hunt to find her and bring her back. While on the journey she meets alcoholic newspaper journalist, Peter Warne (played by Clark Gable), who, once he finds out who she is, is willing to help her as he sees a story for himself since he is down on his luck (he was just fired from his newspaper job). Ellie is a bit uptight and prude at first, while Peter is more open and willing to deal with life as it is, but this quickly changes as Ellie is more than willing to oblige and let him serve as a \"protector\" of her of sorts. While you could say this is a bit sexist, the fact is that Ellie in this situation has no other choice since she has very little money (she admits at one point that she only has $4.00) after her bag was stolen. Additionally, she is not treated as an object as despite the time they stay together, Peter never advances on her, and it is her that later advanced on him, saying she loves him and cannot live without him. She plays a smart and witty character. In one of the film's funnier scenes, Peter holds out his thumb, asking to hitchhike, but everyone ignores him, while Ellie gets a ride by showing her leg off to an approaching driver, whom instantly pulls the break and stops for them. In the way this plays, it actually shows her smartness, as she knows what men will want even though she is just using it as a means to an end. She even ignores the clear advances of Shapeley (played by Roscoe Karns) with almost an eye roll. Having the blanket, the \"wall of jericho\" as Peter calls it, divide both Peter and Ellie as they sleep in the same room, is one of the film's funnier moments.There are a number of interesting themes in this movie. For one, perhaps Capra is showing those struggling represented by Peter's character, whom has a dark side. Not only does he beat up a man and steal his car (after the man was out to steal his suitcase), but he intimidates Shapeley by acting like he a mobster of some kind even though he is completely bluffing, and steals carrots from a farmer, to name the most notable criminal acts. While these actions, you could say, were necessary for them to continue their journey, they also are not portrayed in a positive light. The review by comix-man, which I mentioned earlier, says that the hostile reaction of the wife of Zeke (played by Blanche Friderici), the hotel owner, to letting Peter and Ellie stay with only the promise of being paid, means they \"cannot afford freeloaders.\" That may be true, but I would add that it also shows the breakdown of common human decency, as if they had been fair they still would have let her stay the night and leave the next morning, in a time of extensive suffering. Additionally, the fact that Peter is a struggling working-class man and Ellie is a heiress to extensive wealth is a clash of classes. And while they get along, Ellie's bourgeois habits lead to her snottiness at the beginning, although she seems more concerned about her well-being and happiness. The latter is indicated when she tells Peter at one time that \"I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day\" which is a bold thing for someone in her class position to say, as she would be forgoing all her class privilege!Both Ellie and Peter both play off each other very well. In terms of the story, the ending is no surprise, which I need'nt spoil, it isn't much surprise that her marriage with the air pioneer Westley (played by Jameson Thomas) is in doubt. This is especially the case when Peter is humble enough to only ask for the money he paid on the trip, not the whole reward. With that, I'm seeing some similarities to Mel Brook's Spaceballs (1987), especially when Lone Starr only wants to be paid enough to \"lunch, gas, and tolls,\" rather than the 1 million Space Bucks. Even the marriage scene in this movie seems to be echoed in Spaceballs, although perhaps marriage scenes in Hollyweird movies are similar.All in all, I would definitely watch this movie again and I look forward to watching Capra's other films, like American Madness (1934) and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936). I would recommend this film to anyone",

            "content": "Frank Capra is widely regarded as a revolutionary director and this movie constitutes substantially to this tag. 'It happened one Night' was the first movie of it's kind way back in the 30's where romantic comedies were yet to be born. This is considered as the first major romantic comedy in Hollywood history. Add to it, it was the first ever 'Screwball comedy' movie. Yup, this was actually a new genre invented by Capra. After reading some trivia about the movie, I came to know that the leads Gable and Colbert hated the script so much that they wanted to get over with the movie as soon as possible. Actually, the story of this movie is so simple that it can be explained in a paragraph. But the story-teller that Capra is, this simple story is converted into a very lovable and feel good rom-com which never ceases to amaze you. The movie is full of clich\u00e9s such as a rich spoilt girl falling in love with a not so wealthy guy and the girl running away from her marriage once she realizes her true love etc etc. But one must also consider the time when this movie was made. Perhaps, this was the first bride runway from marriage scene of cinema history. This movie also influenced a lot of other artists and filmmakers. The cartoon Bugs Bunny is influenced by one of the characters from this movie. Bollywood influence being 'Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahi'.This was the first movie to win an Oscar Grandslam, i.e all the top 5 major Oscars - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay - A Feat achieved 40 years later by 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Clark Gable rules the screen with his comic timing and exceptional screen presence. Claudette Colbert will make you fall in love with her, a very natural performance considering the era in which the movie was made.Overall, Be a part of history and watch this movie keeping your critics hat aside.Rating : 8/10",

Ellie is a runaway bride (actually daughter). She's married against her father's wishes, jumped off his yacht off the Florida coast and plans to travel by herself up to New York and reunite with hubby (King Westley played by Jamerson Thomas). Since air travel was fledgling in 1934; train travel would've been the mode of choice.But Ellie's low on cash and dad's (Alexander played by Walter Connolly) detectives are watching all the stations...Ellie gets on a night bus headed to NYC. (hence the title...source material was a story called Night Bus).A series of vignettes ensue, among them the classic 'walls of jericho' motel scene, and the hitchhiking scene. throughout Gable barks and complains nonstop and forbids the spoiled brat heiress from even thinking of whining. he's after an exclusive story (or so he thinks) and she wants to rush back to hubby's arms and out of dad's influence.of course, along the way...they unexpectedly fall in love. it's never manifested on screen...they don't even kiss and here's where the movie, the principles, Riskin and Capra shine. the motel scenes are a nose thumb to the Hays Office in their silliness also, since overt sexuality couldn't be shown at the time...the sexual tension between Peter and Ellie simmers below the surface during the film's second half. the haystack scene...where Peter stops himself from kissing her and Ellie realizes how much she wants him to...is the beginning of it.the final motel scene on the last night of their journey, where Ellie professes her love to Peter (the Oscar winning scene for Colbert) manifests this sexuality.i also found the sexism on the part of Ellie's father, Andrew interesting. he's a loving, doting father...but he's contend to find a good husband for Ellie...to insure her happiness. he never looks to see if she can or wants to help him...or what she wants for her happiness...until the end; after she tells him who she really loves.a reward is made public for Ellie's safe return; Peter leaves her to get an advance from the newspaper because he wants to bring his own money to Ellie to start their life together; though he rejected her advance. Then she contacts dad and Westley after she thinks she's been abandoned.there's a great scene...the last time we see Ellie and Peter on screen together...at her estate. A party's being thrown, she's to wed Westley again in a gala wedding...Peter comes to her house to pick up the money her father owes him. He sees her for the first time in her element; gowned and bejeweled...and he snarls at her.Perhaps Gable's Oscar winning scene is with her father...where he states he doesn't want the huge reward...only expense money for the trip...that Ellie's only a spoiled brat because of the father... and that, though she's daffy he's hopelessly in love with her!Andrew plays cupid...telling Ellie of Peter's rejection of the reward and his profession of love for her, as he's walking her down the aisle. Ellie runs off to a waiting car...leaving Westley in the lurch again... and over the phone...day's later from Andrew's office we learn that Westley's accepted cash to annul the marriage...and Peter and Ellie can marry.the film ends at a roadside motel...with a befuddled older couple complaining about the wacky young couple asking for a toy trumpet and a rope...they're re enacting the 'walls of jericho' scene. As a time capsule, as all films shot during current times become... it's rich with many Capra staples. The Depression, the melding of 2 different classes, which is an American institution...sense of looking out for the other person, they're all here.there's a scene in mid film...on the second bus ride, where Peter gives all his cash to a young boy traveling with his starving mom to meet his father...that is Capra at his best. he tweaks the heartstrings...but doesn't hit this one too hard. it also serves to mirror what Peter is involved in...he too is trying to get a woman he loves back to her husband.in short...the movie after all these years, holds up well...which is something all classic movies all still do. and it still works well on all levels.",

            "content": "This is one of Capra's earliest and it's amusing too. Capra, from an immigrant Sicilian family, shows his concern for class differences and promotes a benificent view of the poor. There's nothing explosively funny about the script, no memorable tag lines, but rather comic or ironic situations follow quickly upon the heels of one another. There are some laughable exchanges though, as the one between Ward Bond as a bus driver and drunken passenger Clark Gable. Bond: \"Say, I ought to sock you in the nose.\"Gable: \"I always keep my nose out there where people can take a sock at it.\"Bond: \"Oh, yeah?\"Gable: \"That's an intelligent reply. Why didn't I think of it?\"Bond: \"Oh, yeah?\" Gable: \"If you keep that up we're never going to get anywhere.\" Bond: \"Oh, yeah?\" Gable {exhausted}: \"Ya GOT me -- YEAH!\"Colbert is a spoiled brat, as we are told several times, although Capra never deprives her of our sympathy. (She's not spoiled, she argues, because spoiled people are used to getting their own way and she's been told what to do all her life.) Gable is a blustering newspaperman who begins their relationship with the intention of exploiting her but falls for her instead. (Cf., \"Roman Holiday\".) He teaches her things. (1) How to dunk a donut. (2) How to hitch hike. (3) How a man undresses. These lessons must have been amusing to an audience in 1935, many of whom might have been happy to have a donut to dunk. The undressing scene -- incomplete before Colbert retreats behind \"the walls of Jericho\" -- started a fad involving the non-wearing of undershirts by men. It's still kind of interesting, partly because we rather like the performers, but it's badly dated. Nobody dunks donuts anymore. Nobody hitch hikes either. Why not? Because instead of driving Model A Fords at 30 miles an hour down country roads everyone now speeds along in Ford Mustangs on Interstate Highways at 80. And hitching is now largely illegal.Besides, all hitch hikers are serial murderers now. (Except north of the border, where hitchers flourish along the TransCanada Highway. Canada has no serial murders, only postmen and moose hunters.)But this is a movie with some of Capra's populism on display. I direct your attention to the scene aboard the second bus. The scene is crowded with ordinary humanity of diverse but modest backgrounds. (Rich people in this movie fly.) An improvised band is playing in the back of the bus and a passenger requests, \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze.\" The tiny band goes through the first verse, including the bridge. A sailor pipes up and says, \"I know the second one, let me handle it.\" And the third verse is sung by a short dark guy up front. Then everyone piles into the bus's central walkway and dances around -- sailors, fat guys with bushy beards, little scholarly looking people, all smiling and singing. It's a startlingly unexpected delight, a spontaneous community engaged in a rite of intensification, the equal of any of John Ford's dances. Even the bus driver, behind his curtain, is drawn into the song. And the moments when the sailor if fluttering his hands and swings clumsily from an overhead bar are unforgettable. A thoroughly happy scene, a capricious but Capraesque caprice.Gable is almost always likable and unpretentious. Colbert can be irritating but she's okay here. You won't laugh during this film but you'll probably smile a lot. Well worth going with.",

I liken It Happened One Night to Marty, another cute comedy that swept up nearly all the awards at the Oscars. They're both cute movies, but neither is exceptional of the genre, and neither deserved to sweep awards that belong to the best pictures of the year. Both are large reasons why the Members of the Board at Hot Toasty Rag decided to create their own awards.As a mere cute romantic comedy, this isn't bad. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are opposites attracting: she's a runaway spoiled heiress and he's a no-nonsense reporter without a dime to his name. They get left behind by the bus and end up walking and hitchhiking to their destination. Along the way, they bicker incessantly and meet a host of colorful characters. \"Young people in love are never hungry!\" Alan Hale sings as he gives them a brief lift. Claudette gets spanked, criticized, humiliated, and frightened as Clark gives one of the most famous stripteases of all time - and influences every man in American to ditch their undershirts until 1951 when Marlon Brando brought the fashion back. But Clark gets his hat handed to him as he boasts being an expert on everything, and Claudette catches a passing car by lifting her skirt.One of the other famous scenes that's frequently spoofed is the accounting scene. Walter Connolly, an accomplished actor who's best known as his role in this movie as Claudette's wealthy father, is paying Clark for his expenses he incurred while taking care of his daughter. He offers a large sum, but Clark refuses and only wants gas and food money. With a smirk and a knowing, fatherly look, he tricks Clark into admitting he's in love.If it weren't for the tremendous hype and accolades, it would be a fun movie to watch every once in a while. But there are so many other romantic comedies that are just as good (and some better) that didn't get any attention, so it's a little frustrating. And, since there are any number of actors and actresses who could have played Ellie and Peter, it doesn't seem fair that Claudette and Clark won Oscars for their parts. Constance Bennett, Myrna Loy, Margaret Sullavan, Miriam Hopkins, Carole Lombard, Fredric March, and Robert Montgomery all turned the script down with their various insults - but they all would have been fine. Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers, Paul Muni, Robert Young, and James Cagney also would have been fine. If you like this type of movie, you can rent the extremely similar There Goes the Bride or Red Salute. But don't rent the musical remake; it's just awful.",

A perfect balance of naturalistic direction, beautiful cinematography and wonderful words.  A film which truly deserved the multiple Oscars it garnered. The oft-mentioned scenes in the cabin and on the road we all know and love are terrific, but what about the bedding-down-in-the-hay scene?  Such wistful looks and gestures...just the way Colbert is framed suggests the emotional changes taking place. So much said with so few words.  Truly pure cinema. And when there are words, who better to provide them than Riskin, master of dialogue that sparkles with wit.  I recently saw a 95% restored print of this at the Academy and the picture was stunning.  On a big screen, in 35mm, I was absolutely transported back to 1934.  Joseph Walker's lensing simply glows.

Capra's direction is understated and polished. It all adds up to a classic romantic comedy. However, the film has a very dated and irksome view of gender politics. I lost count the number of times Peter threatens to hit Ellie (i.e. domestic violence) and he does spank her without her consent. It is part and parcel of the screwball comedy that a romantic relationship is a coded fight for dominance. So while say the hitchhiking scene is funny there's a nasty undertone of gendered struggle. This aspect renders the film dated in the worst way. I cringed a lot more this time I watched it.This is a good product of the 1930's. It has all the strengths of Capra.

            "review_title": "More entertaining than I remember . . .",
            "content": "Frank Capra understood the strange avenues of the human heart like no other filmmaker, perhaps of our time as well. His films always had a deep understanding of human nature. His characters moved with the flow of real life. That human quality endeared his films to audiences and that's why they are still viewed today.That endearing quality probably came from his directing style. He didn't believe in sticking to the script. It has been reported that he showed up with only the framework of a scene, and then let his actors fill in the rest. \"All I want is a master scene and I'll take care of the rest\", he said \"How to shoot it, how to keep the machinery out of the way, and how to focus attention on the actors at all times.\" I have always thought of Capra as a pioneer, not least because it was his genius that created It Happened One Night, a movie so popular and so far-reaching that it would inspire two entirely new film genres, the romantic comedy and the screwball comedy. It also helped to perfect the road picture from which some of the greatest films ever made have drawn inspiration; The Hope-Crosby Pictures, Sullivan's Travels, The Blues Brothers, Lost in America, Midnight Run, Rain Man, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Almost Famous. What these films have in common is some form of familial or romantic attachment from the characters and/or a feeling of self discovery.It Happened One Night is responsible for all of these things. The story involves Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled daughter of a millionaire on the cusp of marrying an aviator named King Westley against the wishes of her father (Walter Connolly). He has the marriage annulled, and she is so put out that she so jumps off the side of her father's boat, swims to the shore and boards a bus from Miami to New York in hopes of catching up with her new husband. On the way, she runs into a world-wearing newspaperman, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who hates her at first sight. He's a man of the world, who knows how to get around.Peter doesn't think much of her, he knows she's a babe in the woods and isn't shy about telling her so. She thinks he's brutish and cruel but she follows him because he can get her out of a jam, at one point he pretends to be her husband in order to fend off the advances of an overly-friendly traveler that she meets on the bus. He doesn't want to lose sight of Ellie because he believes that the story could be a major scoop.Peter and Ellie make amends long enough to get where they are going but their mutual connection is that don't have one. He knows how to keep her safe \u2013 when she runs into the friendly traveler again, Peter pulls him aside and informs that man that he's a gangster who is about to pull a big job. The frightened man wants no part of any criminal activity and makes tracks. Ellie proves herself. During a stop on the side of the road, Peter unsuccessfully tries to show her how hitchhike by shaking his thumb in just the right way. A dozen cars pass without slowing down. Ellie decides to show him \"a system all my own\". Lifting her skirt, the next passing motorist gets a view of her shapely leg and the guy nearly runs himself into the ditch trying to stop.There are a dozen moments like that. One night when Peter and Ellie are forced to share the same cottage, he devises a way that two unmarried people (they're posing as married) can sleep in the same room and have privacy. He builds \"The Walls of Jerico\", a clothesline with heavy blankets thrown over it between their beds. What do you think the odds are that before the movie is over, the walls will come down? The comedy works in broad strokes, but the ever-present Capra-esqe quality of humanity and social commentary isn't quite as bold as it is in his later films. Peter and Ellie aren't interested in the social ills of their country until it crops up \u2013 they both have a personal agenda to tend to. This movie was made five years into the depression but that event exists around the edges of the film. It only takes center stage once, during a scene in which Peter and Ellie give their last few dollars to a starving mother and child on the bus. There is a personal transition in Ellie's soul. What we come to realize about Ellie is that she's been given the spoils all her life and that this revolution \u2013 the road trip in which she finds her sense of personal freedom.If there is a weakness in the film it may come at the moment when we are supposed to accept that Gable and Colbert have fallen in love. He's so mean and critical that it is difficult to believe it when he in love with her. The movie does allow them to meet in the middle as the heavenly rich and the earthy poor come together, the transition of her soul that allows her to follow her own path.

No one liked the project. Clark Gable was banished to the film as a punishment, and I'm quite sure that in 1934 Frank Capra was not looked upon with the high regard his films enjoy today.Yet everything came together in this \"bus movie\", as it was derisively called pre-production, and a charming, funny, and moving story unfolded.Only a few years into \"talkies\", the film set the tone and stage for the antithetical courtship that would become virtually ubiquitous for romantic comedies. Don't believe me? How do you decide who is going to get together at the end of a romantic comedy? Its the two people that early on hate each others' guts, right? Right. Every one of those movies is in some way derivative of \"It Happened One Night\".Unless you just hate \"old movies\", watch and enjoy. Or if you've already seen it, renew your relationship with the film. It is absolutely worth it.",

Gable a failing newspaper reporter who needs a scoop to boost his flagging career.In an era before interstate air travel the pair travel from Miami, Florida to New York via a nightbus and several stops en route.\nIts interesting how simple life seemed in the depression era U.S. in this film. No freeways with thousands of cars hurtling past! Just quiet backroads with the occassional car.The film is an early road movie as well as rom com. Very little is set in one single location. Just the odd motel rooms, the nightbus and exterior shots.Gable seems to revel in his role as a bit of a scally that differs from his more stiff upper lip roles in films such as Gone With The Wind.\nThe film was a great success winning several Academy Awards including the big 5 (Director, Actor, Actress, Best Picture and Screenplay). Few films (only three to date) have achieved such an accolade.For the first ten minutes I was like this is really dated and will be boring, however on reflection you can see its appeal.

            "content": "It Happened One Night, the film which won pretty much every Oscar worth winning, still holds up remarkably well for a film produced over 75 years ago. It's a film with a very simple story but that story is engaging, charming and often quite humorous. The fact that so much of the humor survives intact all these years later is perhaps most impressive. Obviously sensibilities were quite different in 1934 than they are in 2010. But most everything still works. And it's not just a good film, it's also a time capsule of sorts, a look at an entirely different world. Obviously many modern films have been produced set in the same time period as this film's story. But those new films look back at the past through different eyes, presenting modern perceptions of what life was like back then. This movie is the real deal, a slice of 1930s American life, the way it really was. To the modern eye some of the things we see in this film seem almost unbelievable. This is how people really lived? But it was only 75 years ago, an eye's blink of history really. And that is part of what makes this film so fascinating.Of course the one thing above all else that this film has going for it is that it has Hollywood royalty in the two lead roles. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are just as terrific as you would expect them to be and both duly picked up Academy Awards. Of course pretty much everyone involved with the film except the caterer picked up an Academy Award but I digress. Gable and Colbert certainly earned their golden statues. Gable plays Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled runaway heiress. Running away from what? Well she recently got married and her father most certainly did not approve. So before the marriage could be consummated Daddy dearest essentially took his daughter hostage on his yacht down in Florida, far away from the new husband in New York. What's a girl to do? Well, jump off the yacht of course. From there it's going to be a long, strange trip to New York. Ellie gets on a bus, meets Peter and now the film really gets going.Once our story has been set up there's really not much left in the way of plot. It's a simple story about the obstacles Ellie will face on her long journey. There sure are plenty of obstacles though. And this woman, used to all of life's luxuries, really has very little idea how to interact among the common folk. She needs someone to look after her and Peter falls into this role. It's a fun trip, with many memorable moments along the way. One scene in particular stands out with Peter and Ellie having to pose as a quarreling married couple. They could have stopped the film and handed Gable and Colbert their Oscars right there. There's also the famous hitchhiking scene, there's the Walls of Jericho, there's even a possible inspiration for Bugs Bunny. Now for all the moments which do work there are admittedly a few which don't. Some things are a little hokey but not absolutely everything is going to translate over 75 years. And while it's an engaging story it's not an altogether dramatic one as there's a sense of inevitability hanging over the whole thing. But the movie has to be deemed a success. It's witty, charming, amusing and ultimately quite memorable. Director Frank Capra, helped in no small part by the performances of his two great stars, produced a film which not only was a classic in its time but which still stands up today all these decades later.",

            "review_title": "Introspections on It Happened One Night",
            "content": "I recently read a statement that cited something like the test of a good mind is the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. Upon analysis, one can apply this notion to practically anything related to human experience; from concepts as far-ranging as politics and religion to those as close to us as human relationships. Since I had recently seen Capra's marvelous It Happened one Night I was reminded of the moment towards the end of the picture in which Claudette Colbert declares her love for Clark Gable.I was trying to understand the thought processes of Gable as he lies quietly, but obviously engrossed in his own mental meanderings. Here is the crux of a situation that has been preparing itself, falling towards a desired end since the inception of Gable's desire for Colbert, and yet, he questions the entire situation. As one with emotional cold feet: not wanting to remove his shoes in case the wet sand gives him a cold.The strength of his character shows us his childishness; whereas heretofore it was a staple element of Colbert's personality, now it is he who doubts the validity of the next move. And the move must come, as in all denouements where there is a clear sentimental frisson.But what if his thoughts per se? Is he thinking as groom, a father figure, a reporter, or just simply a man? Should the self-imposed 'Walls of Jericho' that have hitherto stood firm fall? Should they collapse in a rapture of passion? To be honest, I do not really believe that the 'act' is as important as the preamble. For me, the whole of It Happened One Night is like a road-hogging foreplay in which desire builds into love but out of a deeper understanding between teacher and student figures. One could argue over the continuity in the nature of Gable?s character toward Colbert; the fact that their relationship shows clear evolution has more than amply been recorded elsewhere; but my question now returns to the original premise about 'the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously?'.Gable understands what he is getting himself into. He also understands what he has had to, and will have to go through to both let go of his previous existence as a sassy and streetwise newshound, and to accept a future with this girl who represents so much that he has up to this point detested in his life. Just as Capra had to deal with extremes of class, so too does Gable now find himself having to come to terms with himself in relation to his own class-consciousness.The morality lies in the basic 'goodness' of mankind; not the submission to the premise that all 'upper-class?' people are the same or have the same moral standards; no. Worse: that he may have been wrong all along, that he may actually be able to do something about it, and worse yet: the dawning on him as he lays on his bed behind the 'wall?' that he has already succeeded.Whereas the analysis of film usually extends to its length in feet; the analysis of the human experience can usually humble the mise-en-sc\u00e9ne, especially when the characters are shown to be detailed, complex and deep. Although by today's standards some may analyze Gable and Colbert as being somewhat simplistic, one cannot (and should not) hold current moral values in a social framework up to the lights of 1934's scrutiny, the two as a pair are as rich and meaningful today as they were all those years ago. Furthermore, the processes that burrow through Gable?s mind at hearing simply 'I love you?' when they come not melodramatically, but as the most important words he has wanted to hear.Ironically, the words interrupt his reverie and he clams up almost childishly, hoping but not wanting to hope that he will hear those words. His retorts, sending her back to her bed, reminding her that she is married, his dream-like vociferation of the perfect girl who seems so near and so far are leading him closer to the identification of self. That he might actually be ready to go further with her. That the consummation, not through wordplay but through physical action, is about to happen, lead him, as previously stated, into two minds which by extension, to his two worlds; as reporter and as future husband. All of these dualities (a cold feet of the mind) lead him to the eventual awareness that he is, in fact, juggling with opposing concepts, feelings, worlds, options and although they at first seem contradictory, are nonetheless worthy of him as a person. He is the richer for it, despite what it can cause him in the future.The concept is timeless, the inner-conflict likewise. And this is but one small reason why It Happened one night must rate as one of the greatest films ever made.",

            "content": "Moviegoers in 1934 started their evening with a Fox Movietone newsreel, pictures of ex-stockbrokers selling apples on New York street corners, of that new president named Roosevelt and his plans for economic recovery, and maybe footage of a rising German leader named Hitler at the Nuremberg rally. Then, with bad news behind them, they'd tuck into a masterpiece of comic fluff titled `It Happened One Night.'\tDirector Frank Capra's movie practically invented screwball comedy, movies that helped America take its mind off the ongoing worldwide economic depression. Nobody goes to movies to get depressed, except maybe fans of Ingmar Bergman films. And few moviegoers expect movies they pay to see to mirror problems they go to the movies to escape from. During the Depression, Hollywood responded to this box office need in comedies about the rich, the eccentric, about nearly anybody who wasn't broke or unemployed or fleeing from the dust that covered Oklahoma. Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald said, `The rich are very different from you and me.' He was talking about the Jazz Age Gatsbys he wrote about. If he were talking about Hollywood, he would have added, `and they're funnier.' \tWealth creates freedom, a precious commodity in Depression America. The screwball comedy focuses on characters, often women, with enough cash reserves (usually from a rich father or relative) to behave as if the world was still theirs to command. Command, comedy, comeuppance \u0096 three words that define the movement of films like `It Happened One Night.' The rich aren't punished for being rich. Rather, the rich heroine learns true values and wins love through her unexpected connection with a man who exposes her to another side of life. \tEllen Andrews (Claudette Colbert), daughter of a Wall Street tycoon, never descends as far as Ma Joad's rattletrap Ford. When she flees her father's yacht to join a weasly playboy she married, Capra, his writers, and comic fate put her on a bus with Peter Warne (Clark Gable)``, a down and out reporter. Sniffing a story (when he isn't smelling booze), Warne shepherds her towards New York. Stops along the way provide opportunities for Andrews to share the joys of people who can still sing joyfully without a dime in their pockets and, by the way, fall in love with Warne. Capra trowels on sentiment and sexual innuendo in famous scenes such as an overnight interlude in a motel cabin in which Warne ropes up a blanket between his bed and hers to create privacy. The `Walls of Jericho,' as he calls it, thinly preserve proprieties moviegoers (and the censors) expected in 1934. Naturally, this is too good a gag to let go after one scene, and when the walls fall down, the movie ends. \t`It Happened One Night' swept the Oscars and in 1993 was selected for the National Film Registry. The movie is a masterpiece of comic casting. Colbert, with her delicate looks, had a voice that could step down an octave into comic dialogue. Gable, then emerging as a Hollywood hunk, growled his lines but showed box office boffo in the Jericho scene when he explains how a man undresses for bed, peels off his shirt, and reveals a bare chest underneath. Sales of undershirts reportedly dropped for the next few years. \tScrewball comedy took many forms. The conflict between wealth and poverty almost always shadowed the comic plot, but within limits. Nobody seeking a nickel's worth of escape from American grimness was paying to watch real poverty. What moviegoers wanted, and what Hollywood provided, were comic fantasies that affirmed the essential rightness of what they were and what they believed even though darn little in their real lives affirmed these values. Thus, in comedy, sex is the ultimate comeuppance. Instinct and attraction pay no attention to class lines. The important point, in most of these screwball comedies, is that in a society where money makes a difference, sex (or love \u0096 your choice) erases those differences. That may be a comic fantasy, but it held sway in theaters for years.  The rich, though different, still have the itch, and that's what Capra and other filmmakers took to the bank.",

The story is yet another variation of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew', with spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert, on the lam from her overprotective tycoon father, learning about love and humility from brash, mercenary journalist Clark Gable, who insists on calling her (it later becomes a term of endearment) a \"brat\".

This movie is a perfect example of what many romantic comedies were like during it's time, mostly due to the many rules and regulations of the Motion Picture Production Code, which came into effect in 1930. For example Peter (played by Clark Gable) and Ellie (a married woman and played by Claudette Colbert), go through much together throughout the movie and during these series of events they fall in love. On two separate occasions they end up having to stay the night in one hotel room together. Both times the rooms have two separate single beds on opposite sides of the room and between them a blanket gets hung in order to make this situation seem more appropriate, and to ensure that nothing would happen between this man and woman. Even though Paul and Ellie develop strong feelings for each other, to the point where Ellie (in desperation not to go back to her husband) practically throws herself at Paul, but is told that she had better get back to her side of the blanket. It is not until the very end, after the marriage gets properly annulled and Paul and Ellie get married, that the movie can make the suggestion that something more than flirting may happen between the two. Although I would never wish for the any type of censorship on Hollywood (or anyone else) to come back into effect today, there was something about the modesty and innocence of the film (a quality that is almost extinct in modern comedies) that I really appreciated. That combined with its witty comments and intellectual dialog that made watching it a truly refreshing and enjoyable experience.",

But the relationship between Colbert and Gable develops maturely and naturally, and is really what drives this excellent romance film. This is in my view one of the greatest rom-com films from the Hollywood Golden Era. As a note, this film is one of only three films in the history of the Academy Awards to win \"The Big Five\" (the other two being \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Silence of the Lambs\").",

            "content": "Well, it's evident why the many attempts to re-capture the spirit of this film have failed. The story really isn't all that good. What works is watching how Clark Gable (as Peter Warne) and Claudette Colbert (as Ellie Andrews) make the most of the script, with help from director Frank Capra. They play the reluctant lovers quite magically - coming across like a couple of performers having fun with the project. Possibly, the sparring of their characters parallels the two stars discovering their professional \"chemistry\". There is a sense of fun (the script calls it \"screwy\") about the film, thanks to Mr. Capra and his famous stars.Most memorable are the leading couple's \"risqu\u00e9\" scenes - Mr. Gable baring his chest when explaining how men undress, and Ms. Colbert lifting her skirt to hitch a ride - they are sexy and tasteful. And, Roscoe Karns' \"Oscar\" is worthy. The ability to create \"fun\" from \"dumb\" was improved on, in better films - but re-making this rather dated and unappealing story would obviously be futile. You can't re-make Capra, Gable, and Colbert - and that's what happened one night.******* It Happened One Night (2/22/34) Frank Capra ~ Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Roscoe Karns, Walter Connolly",

            "content": "Screen writer Robert Riskin, and Film Director Frank Capra enjoyed a long a fruitful association together throughout the Golden age of Hollywood. Together they worked on eleven pictures starting with The Miracle Woman in 1931 and culminating in 1961 with Pocket Full of Miracles, although this was a posthumous credit for Riskin, having passed away six years previously.Arguably their most successful collaboration was It Happened One Night released by Columbia Pictures in 1934. It was their fifth picture together and it was so simplistic it was ingenious.Shot on an incredibly low budget, in less than four weeks with two reluctant leads, it seemed this film was destined for failure. However it became the box office smash of the year and the first film ever to scoop the four main Acadamy Awards (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture and Best Director plus Best Screenplay for Robert Riskin)Having recently eloped to a flash aviator lover, spoilt heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) escapes from a disapproving father desperate to annul her marriage and attempts to travel incognito by bus from Miami to New York to rejoin her 'husband'. On her tail are the Police and several detective agencies hired by her father to try and stop her.In transit she meets wise cracking newspaper man Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and after a none to promising start to a friendship, Warne offers to help Andrews avoid her father henchmen and make sure she gets safely to New York. In return for his somewhat out of character generosity he expects her full and exclusive story. A story to help revive his flagging career.Reluctant at first and acrimonious to the last, Andrew's resists Warne's offers, but after several misfortunes on the road and near capture by the detectives, Andrews resigns to the fact that she has no choice but to accompany the disagreeable Warne all the way to New York.Your not going to get any prizes for guessing the emotional outcome of their journey, but just accompanying them on this trip is where the true entertainment lies.Riskin's witty dialogue make the frequent and inconsequential arguments between the two a must see as the silly disputes over 'dunking, piggybacking, hunger and hitchhiking set the screen alight. However, Gable and Colbert's comic timing and acting expertise wins the audience over in the more intense scenes, like when they pretend to be a squabbling man and wife to the prying detectives.Brilliant.Walter Connolly (Andrew's Father) Roscoe Karns (a fellow bus passenger)and Alan Hale (an operatic motorist) all steal every scene they are in, but without a doubt this is Gable and Colbert's film.If anyone doubts Gables title as the king of 1930's Hollywood, then watch this film and you will see why. In this film he single handedly destroyed the global market for vests/undershirts purely because he did not wear one. Name one actor today or even since who has that much clout and I'll eat my own foot off!Forgive the old clich\u00e9 but this IS a must see film.",

            "content": "It's been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still, it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch. While being the influence of countless films since, It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast, director, and script. At the start of the film, we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews (Claudette Colbert) in Florida aboard her wealthy father's luxury boat. Ellen is planning to marry King Westley, but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking. This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return. She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne (Clark Gable). He's a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble. Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is, he proposes a plan to her. He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story, which has become a national headline. While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close. The plot flies at a free-flowing pace that allows for wickedly good one-liners. The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama. There is a bit of suspense as the will-they won't-they couple explore their feelings for each other. While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together, but it's never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt. We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes, such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke. They are great in the small amount of time they get and don't distract from the main narrative. One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing. The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are. This makes it hard to track the importance of each setting.This is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy. Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads (often an unmarried man and woman) that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles. If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona, you should thank this film for popularizing the genre. Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it. He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame. He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work. The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film. Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances. Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever. He's handsome, quick on his feet, and witty. He also delivers the perfect one-liners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him. Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later. She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world. She bounces off Gable's laid back working man character with ease and her one-liners are just as good or even better than his. Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellie's wealthy father, Alexander Andrews. He plays the overprotective but also understanding father. At first, he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status, but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways. He's one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be. It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre. Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert, and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema. Even in 2017 the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy.",

            "review_title": "Great film",
            "content": "This is a great early road film. It is one of Gable's best after \"Gone with the wind\". Claudette Colbert, who is really beautiful, plays a controlled rich man's daughter who, after a bitter dispute, dives (very smooth and skillfully) off their rich yatcht, hops on a bus, and goes from Miami to New York to be with her fianc\u00e9 that her super controlling dad is trying to stop her from marrying. Claudette is a grown woman, her fianc\u00e9 is not a criminal or anything, he's just someone her dad just personally dislikes. So I am on Claudette's side and I feel that her dad was controlling to an unecceptable level, he was sending out detectives after her, that's just not OK considering the circumstances. Getting away from her dad's home was not illegal since she was a grown woman.Claudette meets Clark on the bus through interesting and humorous circumstances. I loved all the wit and repitour between the two. Clark's hilarious responses to the uptight bus driver saying \"oh yeah?\". Clark finding out the truth about Claudette and him blackmailing her to both help get her to her fianc\u00e9 and to get his newspaper editor job back, cause he'll have a good story on her, and many other great and funny situations and dialogue between the two of them. The moment in the cabin when Claudette's dad's detectives were looking for her, and she and Clark put on a last minute act to fool them,them yelling at each other and then Clark telling the detectives \"too bad you're not looking for a plumber's daughter!\"(Claudette earlier said \" I'd trade places with a plumber's daughter any day\"). The character of Shipley, I completely understood Claudette's reaction, Shipley was annoying. And then Clark lying to Shiply about being a gangster to scare him away, since he threatened to butt in front of Clark to grab half the $10,000 reward of returning her to her dad. The way Shiply ran off was the first funny thing he did. Then Clark and Claudette ditch the bus while saying \"when Shiply stops running, he will start thinking\". I liked the night time scene next where they set up camp outside, and Claudette lying back in the hay with the moonlight shining on her face, a nice old fashioned feel it gave. I also enjoyed the hitch hiking talk between them. Clark showing her all the different thumb signals, then him not being able to get any stoppers. Then Claudette pulling her dress to her knee and the first car seeing her stops. Claudette then tells Clark \"goes to show, the leg's mightier than the thumb. Clark: \" why didn't you take off all your clothes? We coulda stopped 40 cars\". Claudette: \"I'll remember that the next time we need 40 cars\". Hilarious. I'm not sure if this film was pre or post code but there were a couple sort of pre code references. Clark, while pretending to sleep, laying his hand facing up on the seat next to him when he sees Claudette coming back to sit there, Clark demonstrating to Claudette in what order he undresses as he's doing so in front of her, and his talk about \"the walls of Jerihco\". None of those things were anything as risky as what you have today, but there are a lot of pre code films that were considered risky by 1930s standards and not so risky today. Anyway, except for Claudette's dad's actions being too far, this film was great. And I loved the bus scene where everybody is singing to \" Man on flying trapeze\", that scene really reminded me of this film being an older, more simple time.",

As a quick-thinking, quippy, amoral shyster, he drives the plot in unpredictable and shocking swerves. His dynamic with the female protagonist is what fuels the comedy of this film. Unlike Gone with the Wind's Scarlett O'Hara, his companion in this film is a ditz who never rises from her cluelessness and dependence. This interaction is what makes the film unique but also a bit strange, as the supposed charm of Peter Warnes comes across as exploitative and domineering and it is hard to sympathise with him or the happy ending. The film is full of lifelike acting, zany and memorable moments, and an overall classic plot, but is let down by questionable characterisation.",

Oh sure, the Gable and Colbert team are great, chemistry going right and left, and maybe they earned their Oscars. But best picture? To be honest with you, the only reason it became so massively popular, is because this was what the USA needed during the years of the Great Depression, a riotous comedy that people could escape to forget their troubles.

I noticed that there was not a good laugh, hardly a chuckle, for the first hour! (Though the \"Yeah? Oh, Yeah!\" scene was nice, as was his comments about writing books on undressing, dunking, etc.) In fact the only good laughs in the movie are on four occasions, all near the end: **** minor spoilers**** (1) when they pretend to be bickering marrieds to throw off the detectives, at the motel; (2) the great hitchhiking scene (Gable has most of the lines, but Colbert's few reactions and smiles help the scene enormously); (3) when he is driving back to the motel with the money, and her entourage races past him coming from the opposite direction; and (4) when he meets/gets paid by her father.The movie gets better and better as a wry, tender, erotic, romantic drama once we get past the first hour.Two small points of logic that break the spell some: (1) nice scene, but it was silly to give the boy practically all their money (a $10 bill, quite a large amount in 1934) because they wouldn't take the trouble to get change for the bill; and (2) it was reckless/stupid of Gable to leave her despondent, asleep and unaware of his plans as he leaves for an extended period to raise some cash and then return. ****end of minor spoilers****Another small point: I wouldn't call it a screwball comedy.

It Happened One Night certainly has star power going for it, with Clark Gable proving himself Gregory Peck's equal in all ways that matter. But if you were to tell me Claudette Colbert was just as good in this as Audrey Hepburn was in Roman Holiday, I'd punch you. Not that Colbert is bad, mind you, but her character is written pretty passive. I blame mostly the era, but the problem still exists.Nevertheless, I do like this film. Frank Capra's light, idealistic world view is evident throughout and it's just such a joy to experience. In his world people still believe is basic goodness and there are no true villains. Or if there are, there are also plenty of people to laugh at them or to thwart their evil schemes. What can I say, they don't make movies like these anymore. An attempt to make a movie such as this nowadays just wouldn't fly. It would be seen as too naive. Its dialogue as too corny, its characters as lacking humane flaws. But in denying ourselves films such as these, we're losing something. Whether its simple honesty or something else. But we're losing it.And that's a shame.",

This movie confirmed my love for spunky Clark Gable and introduced me to the lovely, elegant and talented Claudette Colbert. It Happened One Night is a very simple story and that's what I loved about it. Colbert plays a rich, snooty heiress that runs away from her Father after he disagreed with her new marriage to a playboy. Although she is just doing it to spite him, she is determined to go to New York and marry him. He sends out private investigators all around the country in hopes in finding her. Since she is rich, she uses unlikely transport: a night bus! And there she finds Clark Gable. Hilarity and romance ensues.There are many memorable scenes in this and every time I watch it, it still cracks me up. There is nothing better than to watch Gable teach Colbert how to hitch-hike - boy does she show him! Great performances, great direction - just runs smoothly so you can enjoy this fantastic movie.It Happened One Night will make your needs melt for Clark Gable, make you laugh out loud and make you realize how much this sort of comedy is lacking in today's cinema.",

This film is the one that really started the screwball comedy genre, and its influence is still very strong today. Definitely one of the seminal pictures in motion picture history, a deserved 5-Oscar winner. The excellent writing and acting are pulled together under the brilliant direction of Frank Capra, undeniably the greatest film director in terms of conveying a powerful story. Hitchcock and Welles may have been the masters of detail and technique, but when it comes to absolutely selling a story to an audience, Capra is tops. What a legacy he left for future generations to enjoy! His film IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is still the most often-watched film at the holiday season, but IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is one of the *very* very few truly perfect films ever made.",

From the moment Gable appears on film, (calling his boss from a pay phone while he's drunk), every scene from then on is a classic to this viewer. Not a single missed step does Capra take. Claudette's confrontation with Oscar Shapely from Orange, NJ is classic as is Gable's confrontation with him later. The scene where everyone on the bus sings 'The Man on The Flying Trapeze' is a gem. The scene where Gable & Colbert are forced to get a room for the night and Clark introduces the 'Walls of Jerico' as well as the donut dunking lesson the next morning and the plumber's daughter, and on and on.Gable & Colbert are magnificent together. Capra, Gable and Colbert deserve every single award they received for this movie. It's an absolute masterpiece.",

            "content": "In movie-making, the best things happen through collaboration. It Happened One Night, easily the finest Best Picture Academy Award winner up until that point is what it is thanks to a perfect teaming of talents in its writer, actors and director. This exceptional group created a picture that is the essence of 1930s Hollywood \u2013 one of the most neglected and misunderstood periods in cinema history \u2013 and yet is universal enough in its appeal to be widely enjoyed today.Let's begin with the writer, one of the unsung geniuses of 1930s cinema, Robert Riskin. While everyone knows about the directors who couldn't handle sound or the silent stars who found themselves out of work, it's rarely remembered that screenwriters had a hard time adapting too. No-one seemed to know how to balance dialogue and action, and one of the weakest elements of many early talkies is the screenplay. It Happened One Night is one of the first really beautifully constructed screenplays of the era. Riskin's pacing of the budding romance is spot on, ensuring there is never a dull moment by smoothly easing us from romantic intimacy to comic absurdity. One of the most effective juxtapositions is when the coach passengers all join together to sing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" just before the coach crashes. The song draws into the warm feeling of community spirit, making the crash more of a jolt. Riskin's dialogue is abstract in that it is witty and almost poetic at times, but every sentiment is believable, and makes the characters larger than life.The early 1930s had also seen a scramble to define a great screen performance. The Academy Award-winners for acting thus far had been a very mixed bag, with a tendency towards rewarding the most grandiose theatrical performances. While the previous year's Best Actor \u2013 Charles Laughton as Henry VIII \u2013 is admittedly the most watchable and absorbing slice of hamming I have ever seen, and totally deserving of the prize, it was not of a style that could become the norm if the talkies were to progress. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were not spectacularly good actors, and there are many better performers who were never even Oscar nominated. But they deserved the awards here because It Happened One Night captures the fullness of their admittedly limited ranges \u2013 form Gable, suaveness and street-smartness, from Colbert haughtiness and sophistication, and from both a flair for comedy and down-to-earth realism. Most importantly they make their characters likable, something that the deepest or most versatile players still sometimes fail to achieve.And now we come to producer-director Frank Capra. Capra had a massive ego when it came to marketing his own brand, but on the screen he took a decidedly relaxed approach, using long takes and few camera movements. One of the best things a director can do to aid the actors is simply give them space to act in, not cluttering up the scene with a lot of bizarre angles or tracking shots. Capra often does something known as \"cutting down the line\", which means during a scene he switches to a closer or more distant shot without changing the angle. This technique is sometimes frowned upon, but it is effective because it steps up the intensity of a moment without changing the positioning of the performers in relation to the camera. Capra keeps his attention-grabbing whip-pans and close-ups to a functional minimum, using the former to draw us into a scene (like those horizontal wipes), and playing the latter like a trump card at moments of emotional intensity.Writer, cast and director \u2013 each was ideally suited to the material. This was the only way in which a picture this special and this enduring can have been made. The auteur theorists may not be able to accept this, but the Academy did. It Happened One Night landed the Oscar \"grand slam\" of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Credit where it's due.",

Along the way, the mismatched couple pretend to be married, wade through streams and sleep in haystacks, hitch-hike and, of course, fall in love.\nThe script is delightful, the direction marvellous, the acting superb. Clark Gable is on top form here, and I dare any female viewer to watch this movie and not be completely charmed by him. ;) He's debonair while being a bit gruff around the edges, tough but sweet, kickass but caring. Anyone doubting Clark Gable's legendary charm and appeal (I did, before I saw this) should only have to watch this movie to discover it for themselves.My favourite bit would have to be, of course, the running theme of the Walls of Jericho.

Although I've seen it well over 10 times since it never fails to charm, captivate, amuse, entertain and defragment me, they being the opposite effects most modern movies have on me. Frank Capra made some great films, but imho he didn't better this simple little screwball comedy with its Love (Ultimately) Triumphant message.Grouchy newspaper man Gable bumps into coquettish runaway heiress Colbert on a bus trying to get to New York to marry an ugly gold digger to spite her father. To get the story he helps her but they gradually fall in love of course - this is the logical how and why of it, with the central witty and natural performances from Gable and Colbert as sparkling as the lustrous photography. As a by-product True Love between the classes was also shown to be possible, although of course in this case neither class had Breeding. There are some delightful characters to savour along the way \u0096 the tongue-tied Ward Bond, the garrulous Roscoe Karns, the operatic Alan Hale, and the blustery Walter Connelly. Favourite bits: dunking doughnuts; piggybacking; hitch-hiking; the Walls of Jericho making it alright; frightening Shapely; the repartee on the bus(es); the clinch by the haystacks in the gleaming arc-moonlight \u0096 and so much more!To me it's ascended into timelessness \u0096 it seems less dated than most films made from the '50's to the '80's - the only films that will temporarily look less dated than this are perhaps those made in any current last couple of years.

This is a good example of the 'odd couple' comedy.

Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of a rich Wal-Street man who secretly got married to King Wesltey (Jameson Thomas), but her father won't even hear about it. Sick of being told what she has to do, she escapes from her father and tries to get from Miami to NY to see her beau.

Let's just say that this movie set the fashion for men to not wear undershirt t-shirts, it taught people how to dunk a donut and how to hitchhike.Clark Gable did a wonderful job, who would have thought that \"The King\" who is known for playing roles of ladies men and serious roles, now plays a comic role. He did wonderfully, he surely deserved the Oscar and you can tell that he had a great time doing this movie. Claudette Colbert was excellent too, great performance as the spoiled girl who always gets her way.Also the movie is great b/c even though it had a limited budget and only 4 weeks to be done, this movie wasn't entirely filmed in a studio, you get to see nice landscapes and great photography, and i love the dialogue between the characters, lots of memorable quotes on this movie that people still use nowadays.This is probably the best comedy of the 30's, and the pioneer in the so called comedy genre \"screwball\".

Basically Ellen \"Ellie\" Andrews (Oscar winning Claudette Colbert) is a spoiled heiress who, despite the objections of her wealthy father Alexander (Walter Connolly), is eloped to pilot and fortune-hunter \"King\" Westley (Jameson Thomas), the father wants the marriage annulled as he knows Westley only wants her money. In Florida, Ellie jumps ship and runs away, boarding a bus to New York City, she wants to reunite with King, on the journey she meets freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter Peter Warne (Oscar winning Clark Gable), they initially start with some seemingly coincidental bumping into each other. Peter recognises Ellie and gives her a choice: give him an exclusive story and he will help her, or he will tell her father where she is, she agrees to the first option. Peter and Ellie go through several adventures together, her initial disdain for him fades away, she finds herself falling in love with him, there is a point when she uses her sex appeal to get a hitchhike, but the person who picks them up attempts to steal their luggage, but Peter stop him, and steals his car. Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love for Peter, the next morning Peter has disappeared, believing he has deserted her Ellie calls her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley, Peter meanwhile has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie. Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, but she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, a second formal wedding to Westley goes ahead, on her wedding day Ellie finally reveals everything, Peter comes to her family home where her father offers him the reward money, but only insists on being paid his expenses. Peter explains his odd behaviour to Ellie's father is due to the fact that he admits his love for her, Westley arrives for his wedding via an autogyro, but at the ceremony Mr. Andrews reveals Peter's refusal to take the reward money to Ellie, he sends her to Peter, and pays Westley off, Peter and Ellie offscreen finally embrace. Also starring Roscoe Karns as Oscar Shapeley, Alan Hale as Danker, Arthur Hoyt as Zeke, Blanche Friderici as Zeke's wife and Charles C. Wilson as Joe Gordon. Gable is very likable as the good looking hard-nosed reporter who lightens up, Colbert is pretty and amusing as the runaway heiress who realises true happiness, together they are a great duo and partnership. I previously admitted that I didn't understand this film very well, however watching it again it is fairly straight forward, it is well written with good funny lines and mishaps, and classy and charming performances and interactions, it certainly deserves its status as a classic romantic comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Adaptation. Clarke Gable number 63 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 38 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

            "content": "Romantic comedy is one of the most fun of all movie genres; a great one is mixed with a nice balance of romance and humor that is very enjoyable for the actors and the audience. Today, these \"rom-coms\" are much more cynical and bitter; almost to a point of not being funny or romantic at all. They also so rigidly follow a formula that it becomes incredibly difficult to find any part of the story that is surprising, refreshing or even remotely entertaining.Here is a film that very well may be the first example of what is considered a romantic comedy. Often called the first screwball comedy, this is anything but for there are very few fast-talking dialog scenes and the on-screen couple don't get into too crazy of situations. Directed with down-to-earth sincerity by that great American director, Frank Capra, the story of a spoiled young woman taken from her high society settings and stuck with a wise-cracking, handsome man who takes her under his wing and sets her straight is as old as the hills. And yet, it works here effortlessly due mostly to the wonderful and realistic chemistry between the two lead actors.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time, reportedly both disliked the script and only did it for money and steady work. Neither would have thought that an Oscar for each and huge acclaim was waiting for them on the other side. Each actor's personality complemented the other perfectly; Gable's smart-ass remarks and smug grins against Colbert's soft, delicate yet independent facial expressions. Another element here handled much better than today is the parental issue. For most parents in these movies, they are either blithering idiots with no mind for parenting or bull-whipping tyrants with no evident love for their children's welfare. Here, the father is a little hard but is certainly filled with love and only wants what is best for his daughter.Still, perhaps this film will live one forever because of the incredibly smart and funny script. Based on a short story, screenwriter Robert Riskin fleshed out the characters and threw in some really great one-liners revealing not only the conflict between the main characters, but also the features and mannerisms that would put them in future situations. Nearly every scene is wonderful to watch unfold. The great timing between Gable and Colbert adds to the snappy dialog and makes the watching all the more enjoyable.It is amazing what has happened to practically every part of the great medium that is film a mere 80 years later. What was once great comedy and great romance together in the same story today turns into wild and illicit sex or stupid, dumbed down physical comedy and cheap laughs. Sometimes they have both; but here it comes down to well-written and acted characters along with two very likable actors letting their personas shine and the story do the talking. It really is true when they say they just don't make them like they used to.",

After an uncertain start with a shipboard scene between Colbert and Connolly that seems a little strained, the pace picks up (and never stops) as soon as Gable enters. Both Gable and Colbert deserved their acting awards \u2014 especially Gable who was never in better physical or charismatic form and certainly never equaled his spirited yet delightfully amusing performance in this movie. (There's even an astonishing Preston Sturges-like sequence in which Gable is hailed as \"the King\"). The support cast is equally adept. Technical credits, including Joseph Walker's superb photography, are impeccable.Dick Powell's 1956 re-make has none of the charm or the bizarre comedy of the original. It Happened One Night is very much a film of its time \u2014 impossible to up-date without losing its special yet entirely credible zaniness.AVAILABLE on a excellent Sony DVD.",

Tales of street life disappeared, movies dropped the sly lines of innuendo, and even the monster movies weren't so monstery anymore. It was a great time for romantic comedies where everything worked out in the end. While most of them were forgettable, \"It Happened One Night\" is memorable for many reasons.As much as being a story about a man and woman falling in love despite themselves and despite the efforts of family and business to intervene on both sides, the movie is a record of the time - a time of traveling by bus through the night, a time of hitchhiking with pleasure and with confidence, and a time when newspaper deadlines still mattered, at least to the newspapers.Hundreds of reviews mention that this movie swept the top five Oscar categories, but that's never the most reliable gauge of a movie's worth. Only seeing it can really show you what's to like about a movie - the characters, the performances, the lasting mood of its moments of fun and moments of melancholy.\"It Happened One Night\" doesn't waste space. Each scene contributes something to the film's character. The irreverent sarcasm between the leads constantly builds the tongue in cheek tone. The moderately-paced plot keeps interest without skipping too fast across the light parts of the story. The unlikable nature of the leads dissolves as we see enough their characters to appreciate the hidden chemistry between them.",

After completion of the film Lady for a Day, director Frank Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin began work on the film adaptation; as several bus-related films had recently failed at the box office, they changed the title to It Happened One Night.Columbia, a small studio with few stars under contract, made it a company policy to borrow expensive name-brand talent \"as needed.\"  So when Capra wanted MGM's Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy for It Happened One Night, Columbia's prsident, Harry Cohn, sent the script to their boss, Louis B. Mayer.  Although both stars were unavailable, Mayer surprised Cohn when he insisted Columbia take MGM's top leading man, Clark Gable, instead.With Gable confirmed, Capra turned to the casting of his female lead role. After Miriam Hopkins, Margaret Sullivan and Constance Bennett turned him down, Capra approached Paramount's Claudette Colbert, who didn't want to play the heiress role either.  Instead of saying no, however, the actress made Capra an offer she was sure would be rejected: $50,000 for four weeks work.  To Colbert's amazement, Cohn agreed to her terms.Production of the $225,000 project began on November 13, 1933.  Although Gable was intially reluctant to work on It Happened One Night, he soon warmed up to Capra and gave a charming performance, one that would forever cement his screen image as a breezy, good-natured man of the world. Colbert, however, was another story.  Although she gave an Oscar-winning performance, the actress did not want to make the film and continued to give Capra a difficult time throughout production.  After her scenes were completed, Colbert went on vacation to Sun Valley, where she told friends, \"I've just finished the worst picture in the world.\"It Happened One Night was released on February 23, 1934, to moderate to indifferent reviews.  But audiences across the country adored the film and made it the sleeper hit of the year.  The first screwball comedy (before Bringing Up Baby), It Happened One Night went on to sweep the Academy Awards, winning all five major Oscars that it had been nominated for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay.  But it was Claudette Colbert who knew exactly who was resposible for the success of It Happened One Night when, after accepting her award, she graciously told the Academy. \"I owe Frank Capra for this.\"  So do we.My rating: 3 and a half stars",

            "content": "Three time Oscar winning director Frank Capra emerged as one of the most successful filmmakers before, during, and after World War II with classics such as \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" (1936), \"Lost Horizon\" (1937), \"You Can't Take It With You\" (1938), \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), \"Meet John Doe\" (1941), \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (1944), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946) and \"State of the Union\" (1948). Before he made movie history with these films, he helmed the first Hollywood epic to receive all five top Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Screenwriter. Starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, \"It Happened One Night\" qualifies as a road trip comedy about a millionaire banker's daughter on the lam from her dominating father and a newspaperman abetting heiress' every move until they break up inevitable and then reunite at fade-out. Louis B. Mayor loaned out Clark Gable to Columbia Pictures as punishment for refusing to make a movie. Mayer's strategy, however, backfired. You see, the Academy awarded Gable the Oscar for Best Actor. Claudette Colbert received the Oscar for Best Actress, too! Culturally, this contagiously funny comedy of errors is memorable for two scenes. First, Gable shed his shirt and displayed his bare chest. Undershirt sales as a result plummeted. Actually, according to IMDb.COM, Gable ditched his undershirt because it interfered with the flow of the scene when he was shedding his apparel. Second, Colbert flaunted her leg when Gable cannot thumb them a ride. Indeed, history takes some interesting turns. Reportedly, Colbert lambasted the movie before it became a big hit. Furthermore, she dictated that Capra had to lense the action in four weeks. According to Frank Capra, Jr., Columbus paid Colbert twice her salary. \"It Happened One Night\" brought Columbia Pictures its first Best Picture Oscar.Millionaire banker Andrews takes his own daughter Ellie (Claudette Colbert) hostage on his own yacht after she marries the thrill seeking aviator King Westley. Actually, Andrews detests Westley and later pays him off with $100-thousand dollars. Ellie refuses to let her father coop her up against her will so she dives off the yacht and swims ashore. Andrews offers a ten-thousand dollar reward for her whereabouts. Ellie decides to maintain a low profile by traveling by bus. During the bus trip, she encounters an out-of-work newspaperman, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and they begin their relationship as adversaries until things change. The wealthy heiress loses her suitcase when a thief snatches it right from under her nose while she is leaning against the bus smoking a cigarette. Warne decides to play Sir Galahad and helps her out when he discovers that Ellie is the object of a national manhunt. Ellie misses the bus after a scheduled stop because she mistakenly believes that the bus company will wait on her. Warne sticks around the bus depot, hands Ellie her ticket, and helps her board another bus. Back aboard the bus, Ellie encounters a character named Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), and Peter saves her from an evening of his company. A washed-out bridge halts the Atlantic Greyhound Bus. Conserving their dwindling funds, Peter checks them into a cabin as a married couple. In this hilarious scene, Peter strings a blanket that he designates 'the Walls of Jericho' across the room between them as they sleep in separate beds. Our hero conspires to help Ellie hook up with King Westley on the grounds that she gives him the scoop on her saga. During a convivial moment when everybody is singing the song about the man on the flying trapeze, the bus driver steers the vehicle into a hole, and Shapeley makes his big move. Shapeley has learned about the reward so he tries to get Peter to share it with him. Cleverly, Peter lies to Shapeley tells him that he is a gangster who has abducted Ellie. In no time, Shapeley makes himself scarce. Afraid that Shapeley (Roscoe Karns)will still try to get word to Andrews about Ellie, Peter convinces her that they need to refrain from using the bus as transportation. Peter has no luck at hitchhiking until Ellie displays her legs and a motorist (Allen Hale) pulls over and gives them a ride. Naturally, Peter is upset that Ellie has saved the day for them. They get into an argument and things go from bad to worse. Meantime, Ellie's father experiences a change of heart and seek to win Ellie back even if it means accepting Wesley. \"It Happened One Night\" wraps up with a happy ending.This is a Hollywood classic worth seeing a dozen times or more. Colbert is the original runaway bride.",

Silent films were dead, 'talkies' were here to stay -- it allowed us the chance to laugh and sing along with the actors in the film. What could have been better in such dismal times?Looking at it that way, one can see why \"It Happened...\" was showered with adoration. But it just doesn't resonate today...there have been additional phase changes in the interim.In terms of content, this is watchable only for Gable's performance, who towers over everyone else here. Simultaneously, he smirks for the audience in recognition of his own power. The plot pinballs off of the newspaper headlines, which keeps the mood light.However, in form, this offers nothing as a *cinematic* experience. There's no change of perspective from our day to day world...it could all be played out on a stage. Heck, you could turn your back to the viewing screen and follow what's going on from the audio content -- like a period radio show.It's for this astounding lack of cinematic qualities that I must rank it so low. If you want a far superior and more effective example of visual storytelling, go with Hitchcock's \"The 39 Steps\".",

This movie probably had low aspirations when it was first released in 1934, but everything clicked so well that it's now considered to be the supreme example of screwball comedy, one of the best movies of the 30s, and one of the best movies of all time.Clark Gable and the adorable Claudette Colbert could not have more chemistry together. Their sassy back and forth is a joy to watch. And though this movie came out in the first year of the enforced Production Code, their relationship is refreshingly sexy. Dig Clark Gable in his undershirt (gasp!). And check out Claudette Colbert's shapely gams when she uses them to hitch a ride in one of the movie's classic scenes.Though the film is light and frothy, the spectre of the Depression isn't totally absent. For example, in one brief scene, Gable pauses at a railroad crossing to watch a freight train go past, loaded with hobos presumably off to find work somewhere, anywhere they can. One wonders if this was even staged or if Capra happened to catch an authentic moment from a dark time in America's history.The screwball comedy is not a genre that's managed to survive throughout the years, so all the more reason to enjoy this funny, breezy, sophisticated piece of cinema magic.Grade: A+",

            "content": "It Happened One Night (1934): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert, Walter Connolly, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale: Charming romantic road comedy about chance encounters. It stars Claudette Colbert as heiress Ellen Andrews who is eloping with a man whom her wealthy father objects too. He demands an annulment but she runs away boarding a bus to New York. On the bus she encounters a drunken struggling newspaper journalist Peter Warne, played by Clark Gable. He promises to help her get to New York if she grant him her publicized annulment details while on the road. Reluctantly, she agree and as predicted they go from bickering couple to actually falling in love. What works is a climax that bares charm and integrity. This becomes one of Frank Capra's biggest directional efforts and it works largely thanks to the chemistry between the leads. Gable brings much humour due to quirky dialogue and a knack for winning the argument, but he plays Warne with heart. Colbert plays the spoiled heiress set in her rebellious ways until a man like Warne says, \"no.\" Walter Connolly plays her strict father who comes around for the right suitor. Roscoe Karns steals moments harassing Colbert on the bus. Alan Hale has a comical appearance as someone who picks them up hitchhiking and then attempts to steal their belongings but is stopped by Gable. Theme switches actions, attitudes, and mental destinations. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "This is one of the best comedy-romance films ever made. It isn't the funniest movie, by a long shot. It doesn't' have the running dialog of witty repartee. There's no slapstick and there are no pratfalls. No scenes lead to rollicking laughter. There are no hilarious escapades or frantic goings on as in screwball comedies. There are no zany scenes of frantic farce as in the best Marx Brothers films. And, the film doesn't spoof or poke fun at various groups. Perhaps the absence of so much in these areas is what befuddled some of Hollywood and the critics - but not all. Because even the members of the film academy saw something special in \"It Happened One Night.\"They may have been swayed by public opinion, when this low-budget, second-tier studio movie packed the theaters and topped the all-time box office for Columbia studios to that time. It finished the year in fourth place, after such lavish MGM productions as \"Viva Villa\" and \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street,\" and the Paramount extravaganza, \"Cleopatra.\" There's more than a little irony in the fact that Claudette Colbert won the best actress Oscar for this film, and wasn't nominated for her role in \"Cleopatra.\" Especially, when most film histories note that Colbert told associates that she had just finished making the worst film ever, when shooting finished on \"One Night.\"Not only did the public like this film, but the academy honored it with the big five Academy Awards. Columbia was then a second tier studio, but won for best picture. Clark Gable and Colbert won the top acting awards. Frank Capra won for directing, and Robert Riskin won for the screenplay. \"It Happened One Night\" was the first film to win the big five Oscars, and the only one to do so for more than four decades. Only two others have done that since - \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in 1975, and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1991.My DVD of the film has a special feature short, \"Frank Capra, Jr. remembers 'It Happened One Night.'\" It was made for Columbia Tri-Star in 1999 and has interviews with Frank Capra, Jr. He had an erudite observation of how performers can misread the quality of a movie. It explains how Colbert thought so lowly of this film until after her Oscar. \"Many times,\" Capra Jr. says, \"actors don't realize what is being made. They see today's dailies, they see tomorrow's, they see yesterday's. It's disjointed. They don't know which takes are being picked. They don't know how it's being edited. They don't know what's in the director's mind of how this picture is going to actually be. So, sometimes they don't realize what their part is like.\"So, what is it about this film that makes it so great? It's a very good plot - and one of the first that began a decade-long run of rich heiress films. The comedy was subdued in places, and the film had a perfect mix of romance and humor within a range of different encounters and events. It was a perfect setting for a road-trip romance. And this film came out early in 1934, just when Hollywood was beginning to enforce its production code (aka the Hays Office, Breen Code, etc.). The only \"daring\" scenes that came anywhere near raising censorship eyebrows were Clark Gable taking off his shirt to show his bare chest, and Colbert's lifting of her dress to above her knee as a hitchhiking ploy to stop the next car. This one in particular is worth a hearty laugh because of the expression on Gable's face when she does that. It's a perfect representation of the culture of the time. The film is a prime example of the better humor that often came out of Hollywood films that toned down the \"risqu\u00e9 chart\" in favor of clean, genuine comedy.\"It Happened One Night\" will likely remain a favorite for generations to come. It's a movie that leaves one satisfied and smiling. One has a feeling of having spent a couple of entertainment hours very well.Here are a couple of favorite lines.Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), \"Aren't you going to give me a little credit?\" Peter Warne (Clark Gable), \"What for?\" Andrews, \"Well, I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.\"Peter Warne, \"Why didn't you take off all your clothes? You could've stopped 40 cars.\" Andrews, \"Oh, I'll remember that - when we need 40 cars.\"",

Now I'm not someone who is opposed to old movies or even old comedies (though I think that pretty much all of them are products of their times, as are movies today).  But I don't find this movie funny at all.  It doesn't have witty lines and verbal humor nor does it have much slapstick or goofy stuff.  It doesn't really have any funny material, unless you find some annoying sailors on a bus singing the \"daring young man on the trapeze\" to be hilarious.  BTW the one sailors solo and dance proves that gays have been in the military for at least 70 years.  Even the Romantic portion of this movie is weak, mainly considering that Claudette's character is very unappealing.  She is really winey and not funny at all.  If you are looking for a classic comedy check out The Marx Brothers, The Thin Man series (which I think are still hilarious today, Asta alone is better then this entire movie), W.C. Fields, or even Buster Keaton (if you want to go that far back...he is better then Chaplin).  I guess I'd recommend this movie to Gable fans or people who want to see what won best picture in 1934 (im sure there was something better).  This is just one of those movies that has since attained untouchable classic status and is on the critics funniest movie lists.

His deliveries were so sharp, his sense of humour was so good, I had no doubt since then why he was such a popular man among the ladies. His intro scene is absolutely hilarious and reveals much of what to expect from him. You couldn't blame Claudette Colbert for falling in love with him; even for 30s, he wasn't a boring \"gentleman\", but a cool guy.

Every modern romantic comedy, from \"The Graduate\" to \"When Harry Met Sally\" to \"Sleepless in Seattle\", owes a serious debt to the film that all but spawned the genre, \"It Happened One Night\".It can be argued that film was lucky to even get off the ground. This film was produced at several different locations on a shoestring budget (with Claudette Colbert receiving a large chunk of that budget as pay), yet the chemistry between Colbert and Clark Gable was among the best ever caught on film. Also, Capra's efficient directing style, which became a necessity for this project, paid off in spades.\"It Happened One Night\" caused a sensation from the word \"go\". T-shirt sales dropped because Clark Gable didn't wear one in the film. The phrase \"Walls of Jericho\" became a part of the American lexicon. It showed that women could indeed get just about anything they wanted, just by showing a little leg. And it has been acknowledged in several circles that \"It Happened One Night\" was the inspiration behind the creation of one of most-loved cartoon characters ever, Bugs Bunny.It would be hard to pick just one reason to watch this film, but if I had to choose, it would be the scene in which Peter (Gable) and Ellie (Colbert) pretend to be a married blue-collar couple when private detectives hired by Ellie's father encounter them at a motor lodge. This scene alone demonstrates Gable's and Colbert's chemistry with each other (I know I've mentioned it before. Trust me -- It's that good!).The first film to win Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay, \"It Happened One Night\" is a heartwarming, charming, hilarious movie that I would recommend for any couple (young or old) to see. This is the first truly great romantic comedy, which still holds up pretty well (Okay, so taking the bus isn't very romantic anymore).By the way, I showed selected scenes of this film to my son when he was 16, and he liked what he saw. If that isn't a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is!",

After enduring to the bitter end, the most flattering thing I can say is that the camera appeared to be in focus for the full duration of the film. I'm willing to make concessions given the cultural differences of the time periods, but I can't imagine that peoples innate senses of humor and romance have changed THAT much. I mean really, did folks back in the day think dissertations on dunking donuts and piggy-back rides were funny? I realize the players in older films can be exaggerated and caricatures, but the obnoxious male bus passenger was just too much. It was one of many cringe-worthy scenes that left me wondering if the art of writing screen plays was in it's infancy. Incidentally, who didn't think Peter's terrorist threats against the bus guy's family were a howler! I'm still laughing at that one?!?!As for chemistry between the two stars, distilled water appears more reactive. Peter was a self-righteous grouch who wanted some dream \"dame\" who likes to frolic on the beach and look at the stars. Who wouldn't want a guy like that? She..., come to think of it, I don't remember anything about her desires or ambitions. Her facial expressions and lack of anything resembling passion were confusing. There was nothing to like on either side. He wasn't an appealing character and she was boring.I will say the movie was funny as an audience participation event. When Peter ran and caught a car to retrieve his belongings from a film-flam man, I couldn't help busting a gut. Either the cars were very slow in those days, or the cigarettes they were smoking really did make them more fit. Either way, there were several \"incredible\" circumstances in the movie that had me chuckling.I suppose the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but I'm still wondering what happened and on which night?",

            "content": "Ellie Andrews, an heiress, has married a dashing pilot named King Westley against the wishes of millionaire father, Alexander. He tries to keep Ellie a prisoner on his yacht until she agrees to have the marriage annulled, but she runs away and boards a bus bound for New York, where she hopes to be reunited with her husband. Now at this stage the audience doubtless think they know how the movie will end. Westley will be the hero, the villainous Alexander will get his come-uppance and true love will ultimately triumph. Only it doesn't quite work out like that. True love does indeed win the day, but not between Ellie and Westley, who proves to be an unscrupulous fortune-hunter. Ellie's true love turns out to be Peter Warne, an unemployed journalist whom she meets on the bus. At first Peter's only interest in Ellie is also financial; her elopement has aroused great media interest and he believes that if he can get an exclusive on her story, he will be able to get his old job back. After a number of adventures, however, they start to fall in love.\"It Happened One Night\" was one of the last American films made before the production code came into force in 1934, and might have had difficulties getting past the Hays Office had it been made a few months later. That does not mean, however, that there is anything particularly permissive about it by modern standards. There is no violence, and no sex scenes, unless the sequence in which Claudette Colbert stops a car by showing a shapely leg counts as a scene of a sexual nature. Its rather cavalier attitude to marriage, however, might have struck some as excessively daring by the standards of the thirties. Certainly, there were plenty of screwball romantic comedies (\"The Women\", \"My Favourite Wife\", \"His Girl Friday\", \"The Philadelphia Story\") involving divorce during the late thirties and early forties, but most of these ended up with divorced or separated couples getting back together, which made them more acceptable to the censors. \"It Happened One Night\" is a romantic comedy which actually involves a couple who start off married and end up with their marriage annulled.This was the first film to win all \"Big Five\" Academy Awards, namely Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Colbert) and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). This feat would not be equalled for over forty years; it was eventually to be matched by \"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\" in 1975 and later by \"The Silence of the Lambs\" in 1991. In the case of \"It Happened One Night\" it must be said that all five awards were well-deserved. As was often the case with screwball comedies the basic plot is pretty implausible, but Riskin's script is so sharp, witty and fast-moving that we hardly notice.Gable and Colbert combine so well that it is strange to think that neither was the first choice of the producers. Robert Montgomery rejected the part of Peter and Colbert was only cast as Ellie after several other actresses had turned it down and Warner Brothers had refused to lend Bette Davis, who wanted the role, to Columbia. Colbert herself, in fact, was initially reluctant to take the part, allegedly because she had clashed with Capra while making another film with him some years earlier, but was persuaded to accept by an increase in her salary.Capra today has the reputation of being a director of sentimental comedies which helped Americans to feel better during the tough years of the Great Depression and World War II. There is an element of this in \"It Happened One Night\" with its Cinderella-in-reverse \"rich girl marries poor boy\" plot, but there is more to the film than that. It is a film where our expectations are constantly reversed. Ellie, the spoilt, pampered socialite, turns out to be much more resourceful than we might have imagined. Westley, who we expect will turn out to be the hero, turns out to be the nearest thing the film has to a villain, although as he benefits financially from his short-lived marriage there is a happy ending even for him. Peter, the cynical, down-on-his-luck reporter, proves to have hidden reserves of decency. Even Alexander is not such a bully as he at first appears. (And he was dead right about Westley's unsuitability as a husband for his daughter). Capra and Riskin are essentially playing games with and subverting standard movie clich\u00e9s, producing a modern fairy-tale for the twentieth century. They succeeded so well that the film remains fresh fifteen years into the twenty-first, more than eighty years after it was made. The makers of modern rom-coms, with a few honourable exceptions a pretty fossilised genre today, could learn a lot from them. 8/10",

            "content": "'It Happened One Night (1934)' is the blueprint for almost every romantic comedy that came after it, actually being somewhat surprising in terms of how closely it conforms to the tropes that still adorn its genre to this very day. Of course, the reality is that the piece is creating a genre, not conforming to one. This inherently reduces the picture's potential 'seen it before' factor; we may have, but audiences at the time certainly hadn't. It sort of highlights just how formulaic even the very best rom-coms tend to be, primarily because they all feature at least one element that this flick first established. Seriously, it's all here: the will they/ won't they dynamic, the contrasting personalities, the bickering, the banter, the humour, the heart, the misunderstandings, the domineering parent, the other man, the 'all is lost' mix-up, the wedding-based finale... the list goes on. That's not to say it feels especially derivative, though - I mean, how could it? It holds up remarkably well considering its age, primarily because its lead actors - despite both apparently having no love for the movie - share a palpable chemistry and do the quick-witted dialogue justice. It's constantly moving towards its compellingly frustrating finale, barely wasting a second. In many ways, it's remarkably ahead of its time. In some others, of course, it isn't. For instance, Gable's leading man starts out as a bit of a creep and then becomes a straight-up jerk for the majority of the movie (he even threatens to break Colbert's character's neck at one point). Still, it's obviously a product of its time. In the end, it's an enjoyable and hugely influential romantic comedy. 7/10",

            "content": "I've lately been watching a number of films made in the early 30's and it just strikes me watching \"It Happened One Night\" how unlike all the others it was, good as they sometimes were. I know it was the first screwball comedy, something in itself, but it's Capra's moving camera, the snappy dialogue and the credible acting even in unlikely situations that make you feel less like you're watching something staged. In all those senses, it plays like the first modern movie. Crazy as they sometimes are, Gable and Colbert's characters feel like real people, talking and acting naturally as they go. It's also a film made for adults to enjoy, the for-the-times risqu\u00e9 humour concerning the erection (no pun intended) of the symbolic Walls of Jericho between the thrown together couple, Gable's undressing to his bare torso, Colbert's hitching a ride for them by provocatively hitching her skirt and the closing consummation scene where the walls come tumbling down are all knowingly and winningly rendered.Gable is great in the role that elevated him to his unchallenged status as the King Of Hollywood, the personification of contemporary masculinity, handsome, confident and honourable and yet not without sensitivity or good manners. Colbert is equally good as the spoiled brat who is brought down to earth on the road with Gable. She's sexy, sassy and chic and every bit the match of Gable, a prototype for the smart-talking female characters to be played in succeeding Hollywood comedies starring the likes of Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur, Barbra Stanwyck, Carole Lombard and others. The starring couple's interaction and comic timing is perfect, a model for all those initially-warring-couple features for years to come.With a witty script by Robert Ruskin, an able supporting cast and a succession of humorous situations, the film flows beautifully from the off, never letting up, directed energetically and at times almost instinctively by Capra in the movie that really made his name. There are no lingering close-ups, static scene-setting or slow dissolves here, it's all pace and movement as befits the plight of the runaway couple.Capra's social commentary is still evident and doesn't gloss over its Depression Era setting, manifest in the scene when Gable salutes the everyday folk riding the top of the train which crosses his path. Capra didn't really return to screwball comedy after making this, instead going on in later years to further exercise his conscience by employing Messrs Deeds, Smith and Doe, but he didn't need to, he nailed it forever with this marvellous one-off collective collaboration, almost unbelievably shot in only four weeks.",

When one says \"Best Picture Winner\", you think the said film must meet a certain criteria, such as war drama or epic production value-centric story, that certifies it that prestigious title. It Happened One Night has neither of those, though it does achieve a wonderful romance brought to life by Clarke Gable and Claudette Colbert and contains a screenplay as fresh as the carrots Clarke Gable eats himself during the picture.Movies of the 1930s (and earlier) have reoccurring problems when they are put up to the task of competing with newer pictures using today's standards of film perfection: they lack the tight, technical exertion. The sound is often terrible, some dialogue may even be lost, the editing is probably loose, and the photography is assumably rugged from the restoration attempts by the studios. It Happened One Night falls prey to these shortcomings, but it's the film's only real flaw, and not a big one at that. It's still a fairly entertaining movie and the restoration is actually successful most of the times.I couldn't take my eyes of It Happened One Night! It's a delightful film that should not be missed by any generation. Before Pretty Woman and Annie Hall were \"the\" romantic comedies of their times, there was It Happened One Night. Most of the romantic comedy plot devices we've seen used repeatedly, originated here and were so accepted by audiences and writers that they have grown into clich\u00e9. Aside from that, It Happened One Night combines classic stories (poor little rich girl, desperate reporter, train rides, extramarital affairs) into one sublime, Hollywood picture. The thing to any successful romantic comedy, besides the script having more on its cutting board than what the average joe-blow can bring to the table, is its stars. Think about how successful those two rom-coms I mentioned earlier would have been without Julia Roberts and Richard Gere or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton? Not very. The leading couple not only has marvelous chemistry together, but they both have the bolts to screw in a great performances. Clarke Gable in particular shines. His movie-star presence and ability to flow with a picture and character are on full display here. Claudette Colbert produces first rate acting, as well.It Happened One Night is a greatly pleasing film. You'll watch it with a smile on your face. It's funny and contains one of the best movie romances out there, a relationship that starts out in hostility, evolves to friendship, and is overcome with the realization of love. It Happened One Night is cute and having inspired a whole genre of films ahead of its time.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",

I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, \"it was a different time!\" but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.Despite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, \"she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret\" but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word \"demented\" popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.The characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks. I hope no bizarre situation occurs in which I am ever forced to watch this again.4/10 Bye love you",

Coming to the performances, both Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert chip in with commendable work while their on-screen chemistry is even more impressive.On an overall scale, It Happened One Night is an expertly directed, deftly written & superbly performed cinema that brims with heart, humour & entertainment, and remains as effective today as it was back in its time of release.

Several of his films feature this successful combination. Enjoy this one for the first, or even the second time. Great films are made to be seen more than once.",

We've seen \"Ball of Fire\", we've seen \"Bringing Up Baby\", we've seen \"Bluebeard's Eigth Wife\" and many others of the kind; and they were all about equally funny and equally well made and acted - in fact, some of them are even more entertaining, because with a running time of 105 minutes, \"It Happened One Night\" is a bit overlong and DOES have its lengthy periods. And there also are MANY other comedies from the same time, which are MUCH less known, and yet almost more unusual and inventive - like \"Three Cornered Moon\", made just a year earlier and also starring Claudette Colbert.Now was it the studio's PR machinery (and it was VITAL for Columbia to land a success that year, because otherwise they would have gone bankrupt), was it the impact of Clark Gable, who was rising like a shooting star at the time, were it the last glimpses of pre-Code frivolity (like when Claudette Colbert teaches Gable about hitch-hiking, and lifts her skirt instead of her thumb; or the constant talk about the 'Walls of Jericho', the blanket that separated their beds...) - it's all OK with me, of course, it may not be the VERY best of the classic screwball comedies IMHO, but it's surely good, clean fun to watch even today!",

As a comedy, Frank Capra's almost 90 year old light-weight romance has not aged all that well but as a pleasant snapshot of America in the '30s, it's great. Famously, the film cleaned up at the Oscars and the direction, cast, and script are all very good. Gable, one of Hollywood's iconic leading men, is willing to play the fool at times, (gnawing on carrots, ineffectually spitting, etc) something I always like in a 'star' and Colbert is great as the somewhat na\u00efve, almost waifish 'spoiled rich girl'. The plot follows the usual 'meet cute - bonding adventures - love acknowledged - final-obstacle surmounted' trajectory but is enjoyable (and likely seemed a lot more original in the early 30s than now, after decades of similar storylines). The film was made before strict enforcement of the Hays Code, so the humour is slightly sly and risqu\u00e9 (although no more than many of the subsequent 'screwball comedies', which snuck a lot past Mrs. Grundy's censorious eyes). All in all, a fun slice of Americana and Hollywood history - cute, quaint, clever, and well worth a watch at a number levels (and one reason why I don't wear an undershirt).",

            "content": "You would think that after over a century of having the Motion Picture around as a Business as well as an \"Art\", that we'd have some formula or two that could be applied and, Wah-La! Success, we have an Oscar winner. We do have formilae, but they're all too evident. The success of a picture is often just good old fashioned, \"Pot Luck!\" As in so many other cases, Director Frank Capra's IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (Columbia, 1934) started life as a short story in the hallowed pages of The Saturday Evening Post. It was Samuel Hopkins Adams' story titled \"Night Bus\", and it was adapted to the screen no less than four times. In addition to this 1st time with IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, there was Columbia's 1956 remake, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM IT, with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon; as well as both Fillipino and Turkish productions. Like so many other Capra films, Robert Riskin was responsible for the screenplay.Simply stated, the plot goes something like the following. A cocky and rebellious newspaper man, Clark Gable, decides to tell off boss, and go freelance, all on his own. He does so with a bottle and a telephone. Meanwhile, spoiled daughter (Claudette Colbert) of ultra rich(though sympathetic)father(Walter Connolly)decides to run off from her scheduled marriage, leading father and his army of Private Detectives on a merry cross country chase, from Florida to NYC via a Greyhound-type Bus.Ex-reporter and rich Heiress cross paths, and the fun all begins. Was it going to be business for Peter Warne(Gable) as a \"scoop\", that would allow him to name his ticket anywhere in newspaper business? Or was this to become a case of personal involvement for the two? A see-saw, back and forth series of events then transpires and we have one of the best pictures ever. And to think, it was all do to other studios lending a couple of their Stars to lowly Columbia.MGM lent Gable to Harry Cohn's \"Poverty Row\" Columbia Studio as a punishment for misbehavior in public. Paramount likewise lent out their lovely,sexy and sophisticated Leading Lady, Miss Claudette Colbert, reportedly against her will. The two reportedly did not hit it off so well, but their professionalism prevailed.We must mention again a great assembly of supporting players that gave such life and seeming spontaneity to the story. We had Alan Hale, Ward Bond,Jameson Thomas, Arthur Hoyt,Blanche Frederci,Charles C. Wilson, Irving Bacon and even Bess Flowers. Special mention has to go to Roscoe Carnes whose possibly career's best role/performance did so much to add sparkle to all of his his scenes. He also provided a comic relief as fast talking, lecherous Traveling Salesman, Oscar Shapley.(\"Shapley's the name and that's how I like 'em!\") In spite of all these problems and a short shooting schedule, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT swept the Oscars with Best Picture, Best Actress(Miss Colbert), Best Actor(Gable), Best Screenplay(Riskin), Best Director(Mr. Capra).It was interesting to observe our \"young 'uns\" and getting their reactions to a film that is now over 70 years old. Well, it appears that the age has little, if anything to do with their enjoyment and appreciation. As our 30 year old Michelle Ryan, now of Arlington, Virginia, stated, \"There is a big difference between 'movies' and a 'Film'.\" And IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT should be on everyone's list of \"Top Films\"!",

While not entirely believable in any era, the story is a joy and Gable and Colbert work excellent together to make the story a bigger gem than it otherwise would have been.The film flows well until the last 5 minutes. Capra seems to have decided or been told 'wrap this up fast, it's gone on long enough' which didn't feel the case. But bringing Gable back into the picture at the end, and Colbert's reactions, are hurried. The flow of the last chapter of the plot does not match the rest of it.

            "content": "Love, an obnoxiously overwhelming emotion that can often dictate our actions towards one another. Initially one may dislike the other due to unprecedented circumstances. Difference in class, wealth, personality or all of the above. However, expend enough time with that particular individual in a closed environment, and naturally those extinguished feelings may burn bright once more. For overindulged heiress Ellen Andrews, whom originally eloped with a fortune hunter only to realise he solely desires her wealth, cooperating and cohabiting with the middle class seemed like an otherworldly adventure. Haphazardly fleeing her father, whom desires her marriage annulled, she encounters a newspaper reporter. Their initial disdain for one another soon transforms into an illuminating love, which sees them travel cross-country to initiate a wedding that neither of them crave.Capra's award-winning pre-Code romantic comedy is the grandfather of all modern romcoms. Simple as that. Every clich\u00e9d trope and narrative beat stemmed from this joyous road trip feature, in which continues to rampantly inspire today. From the inevitable romance between the opposing central characters to the situational comedy meticulously embedded throughout. It's a romance not regarded highly for its basic plot, but for its sublime compositional components. Riskin's screenplay is absurdly witty, nestled with sharp quips for both characters that would ensue joyous hilarity and gleaming smiles. A notable example is the hitchhiking dispute. Peter would egotistically demonstrate his ornate abilities to hitch a ride with a passing vehicle, utilising three distinct techniques with his thumb. Asserting his masculinity and all. Ultimately, he fails. Ellen then stands up to plate and secures a ride by flaunting her leg. Whilst this action may not have aged well in terms of portraying the female counterpart by seemingly objectifying her (a product of its time, no doubt), it seamlessly combines the visual cues of Gable and Colbert's wonderful performances with the rigidity of Riskin's script.The feature entirely depends on their chemistry, including the way they naturally bounce off each other and the emotional connection attracting them. Fortunately, it's categorically splendid to observe. Gable's roguish qualities automatically promoted Peter to acquire a convincingly charming personality. His initial blackmailing ultimatum, subconsciously viewing him as an antagonist, soon dissipates into contagious likeability. The pencil moustache too was a win! Colbert had the most ground to break with her character Ellen. Developing a sheltered heiress whom had limited knowledge of the real world into a relatable individual. Excellent performance, with enough subtleties to substantiate an emotional fragility to her character. Capra's straightforward direction, alongside Havlick's succinct editing, manages to present a convincing love story through situational and literary comedy. Hugely sophisticated for its time.Having said that, there is a precise moment within the road trip when Ellen switches into doe-eyed love mode. With just the click of a finger, her character changes from this semi-independent strong-willed persona to this emotionally malleable loved up weakling. Yes, its purpose is to accentuate her overwhelming love for Peter through an arduous one-sided confession, adjacent to the symbolising \"walls of Jericho\" that corroborate their privacy, yet it also diminishes her characterised qualities. The 'Romeo and Juliet' narrative strand unfortunately occurs all too abruptly, consequently altering the third act's momentum.Despite these reservations, It Happened One Night is a product of its time that still holds up extremely vibrantly today. A romantic comedy that relishes in the classic romanticism of pre-Code Hollywood, which clearly has inspired every subsequent romcom since. It's the patriarch of the sub-genre, bolstered by sterling chemistry between the two leads. \"The walls of Jericho are toppling!\", and to that I say \"Let 'em topple\".",

For Peter, this scoop could save his career and for Ellie, well, she needs all the help she can get to make it to New York alive. The two develop an unlikely relationship exchanging humorous jabs as they bus, hitchhike and hijack their way and of course while neither will be the first to admit it, there's no hiding their feelings for each other from the audience.Classic films tend to rely on the prowess of their marquee actors and Gable and Colbert are terrific together. Both are humorous and play a wide range of emotions. Gable is one of those stars that has that intangible \"it\" factor that just makes him seem so incredibly important in every scene. There is a strong tension between them the entire film that is funny at times and romantically intriguing at others.The writing, however, is what makes this a standout classic. The way Peter wiggles his and Ellie's way out of tight situation, namely those that would result in Ellie being found out, is genius. Robert Riskin does some of the best witty dialog and scenes. The best parts of the film are when Peter and Ellie are alone, either in their motel room or out in the forest. The tension between them is highest and it makes the dialog that much better. This is a film that you remember the scenes. Like a play they all carry their own weight and interest. What happens next is not as important as what is happening.\"It Happened One Night\" only suffers from a clich\u00e9 ending. The humor shifts from wit to just laughing at the film in general because you know the inevitable will happen and anything that tries to stand in the way at that point is just --pointless. Anyone who loves classic situational and near-farcical comedy will love \"It Happened One Night\" and with good reason. It's enjoyable for all generations but it's very true to the era, definitely an escapist Depression-era film because it concerns itself with the wealthy and pokes fun at them. There's even a song, though it's incorporated in a more drama-focused way, no theatricality.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

However, it explains why Colbert's character, not a ditsy dope, would choose to run away from her privileged existence and face certain retribution -- financial and emotional -- making her all the more sympathetic as she gamely takes on Clark Gable in a battle of wits and manners. Likewise Gable, in the opening scenes, suffers in somewhat tragic circumstances, and his character struggles to hide his dejection and sense of failure under a dapper appearance and good grooming. Without this foundation, the situation is silly and contrived, because these two attractive, intelligent, witty persons would have no reason to react as they do, suffering rebukes and slights from one another, mostly \"deserved\", or at least rationally handed out, according to their limited knowledge of each other.

It was given little promotional attention upon release. Yet, somehow, audiences loved it, as they generally still do. It's certainly one of my favorite romantic comedies, having seen it a number of times over the years. Claudette was so cute and Gable so handsome. They both had great screen comedic talent, and great screen chemistry. Claudette and Gable would reunite 6 years later in \"Boom Town\". However, this was not a romantic comedy, and was not as well received.Another film from the '30s that somewhat resembles this film is \"Desire\". If you enjoyed the present film, you will likely also enjoy that film. It stars Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich. Like the present film, it's largely a 'road' romantic comedy, with them being mostly antagonistic until they settle down and get to know each other better. However, Marlene wasn't as cute as Claudette, nor as good a comedian. Nonetheless, if you find Marlene fascinating, it's worth seeing.See both these films at YouTube.",

            "content": "The first of three films that Frank Capra directed that won him the Best Director Oscar (Mr. Deeds Went to Town lost Best Picture to The Great Ziegfield in 1936), It Happened One Night is credited as at least one of the first, if not the first, screwball comedies. A genre born of the Hays Code Office's requirements around the portrayal of sex in movies, it partially substituted violence for sex in watching the interplay of man and woman develop over ninety minutes or so. This is a much milder version of what came to dominate the comedy scene for another decade compared to something like Howard Hawks' Bringing Up Baby, and it never loses its Capra touch of gentle humanism. That Capraesque approach to humanity is one of the keys to this film lasting as long as it has.Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is the daughter of a rich magnate, Alexander (Walter Connolly), who was caught at the marriage license window as she tried to marry the gold-digging playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) by Alexander's agents who stole her away from New York to Miami where he's keeping her on his yacht until he can talk some sense into her. In a fit of anger, she jumps ship and manages to get to shore where she evades her father's men and gets onto a bus alongside Peter Warne (Clark Gable), a New York newspaperman who gets unceremoniously fired by his editor, Joe (Charles C. Wilson), over the phone. Not know who Ellie is, Peter, thinking she's pretty, pays her some attention, chasing after the guy who steals her bag and leaving her with four dollars to get her to New York.The joys of the film are all about the interplay between Ellie and Peter, anchored by the winning performances of both Colbert and Gable. However, my only real problem with the film comes with its comedy. There's an early scene where Ellie and Peter share a two-bedroom cabin, separated by the \"Walls of Jericho\", a string with a quilt hanging over it, and the interplay between the two is so slowly cut. If Columbia operated at all like how Irving Thalberg ran MGM at the time, then Capra and Harry Cohn screened the film for audiences as they fine-tuned it, and the pauses in the dialogue feel like room for laughter from the audience. There's a funny line, then the film goes quiet for 3 seconds or so before picking up the conversation. This works well if the audience is actively busting a gut every few seconds, but while I was happily bemused by the snappy dialogue between the two, the scene surprisingly dragged a fair amount. The comedy is nice, but the presentation of it was designed for it to be hilarious.Ellie and Peter steadily grow their relationship as they become reliant on each other. Ellie is out of money, and Peter has the story of the year tracking the movements of this rich heiress that her father is desperately looking for with agents up and down the eastern coast of America. It's also a sort of marriage that develops, especially in the film's later sections where Peter becomes increasingly tied to the idea of providing for her himself, getting mad at her when she talks about convincing their ride to give them a meal (he'd picked up some carrots from a farm, anyway). There's also the moment where Peter fails to get a ride while hitchhiking by using his system with the thumb while Ellie gets a ride with the first car by just showing her leg. He's mad at her because she did it instead of him, but he also couches it in terms of her getting naked for other men. He feels possessive of her like a husband does a wife, and all of this is done rather subtly, letting it develop over the course of the film without anyone ever talking about it directly.The emotional weight of the film is just that: the subtle development of a husband/wife relationship between the two characters as they grow to rely on each other for several different reasons. They have obstacles to overcome (the most amusing being the overbearing fellow passenger on the bus, Mr. Shapeley played by Roscoe Karns who picks up on Ellie's real identity that Peter has to scare off), and getting over those obstacles is what draws them closer. There's a bit of screwball type violence, mostly Peter smacking Ellie on the butt as he's carrying her across a river because she doesn't know what a piggyback ride is, but most of the film really relies on character first and foremost.Of course, the film ends with what has become something of a clich\u00e9 with a misunderstanding bred of an innocent disappearance, convincing both that the emotions they both felt were born of lies, creating the final obstacle that they need to overcome (the resolution is something that Mel Brooks aped decades late in Spaceballs), and because the characters are so clearly created, their relationship so clearly drawn, and their emotions so clearly felt, that resolution, while built on some contrivance, ends up ringing just the right way.There's so much to enjoy in It Happened One Night, especially as it moves into its second half. There is such a warmth of humanity on display, especially in scenes like the whole population of the bus singing \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\", that it's hard not to get caught up in it. Warm, amusing (though not hilarious), and touching with an ending to make the heart glow, Frank Capra's first major film is Classic Hollywood distilled.",

            "content": "\"Yes! But don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy myself!\"This is a soothing film to start your morning.'It Happened One Night' is, on paper, pure establishment: a Frank Capra-directed Hollywood hit (albeit a slow-building one) that famously won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay, then becoming the template for hundreds of romantic comedies that followed. It's apropos then that its title suggests a flicker of chance, an unperceivable dash of magic. Indeed, even now, 'It Happened One Night' carries the unmistakable tenor of a breakout hit, fueled by confidently zippy repartee and manic comic invention that almost none of the innumerable pretenders to the throne of romantic comedy can match.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert star as a rakish newspaper reporter and a pampered and recently married heiress who fall for each other on a cross-country trip despite their clashing temperaments. The pair are as mismatched as can be: she's trying to get out from under her overbearing father's thumb (who's trying to annul her marriage) and runs away, and he selfishly smells the scoop of the century when he realizes who she is. No prizes for guessing whether they go from mutual irritation to attraction over the course of the trip, as what ensues are almost corrosive verbal fireworks between the two. He thinks she's a spoiled brat, and she believes he's a gruff, self-serving jackass. While they're both on the mark, this witty, hilarious picture, written by Capra-regular Robert Riskin, makes the most of this unlikely pair with its jagged and droll battle-of-the-sexes humor and unsentimental approach to romance.Yes, it's a narrative that's been recycled countless times since, sometimes merely by using the genre conventions it helped to establish, like any movie where a pair of attracted non-lovers are forced to share a sleeping space. That's what Gable and Colbert do in the walls of Jericho scene, remembered for both its Biblical innuendo and its less allusive shot of a bare-chested Gable. There's also the much-spoofed scene where Colbert's Ellie schools Gable's Peter in hitchhiking technique, also predicated on a type of nudity that no longer qualifies as such. It's remarkable, then, that the '34 telling of this now-familiar story still feels fresh: always funny, still romantic, and quite beautiful to look at beyond even its two photogenic stars, matching the film's weaponized patter. There's a lot of deep and understated affection in the comedy, but the way the picture uses diverting sharp barbs to mask those sentiments is incredibly sophisticated for its time. Then again, maybe this film just indicates that I was born four decades too late.Much of the film's progeny strive for that innate likability while missing one virtue of its not-quite-screwball pacing: simplicity. 'It Happened One Night' lets Peter and Ellie spend a lot of time together, focusing on their competing desires rather than the zany logistics of their travel arrangement. Their most famous scenes involve just the two of them, and many of the other sorta-important characters are either comic bit players or mostly offscreen. In the end, their romance, even with all of its twists turned into genre hallmarks, feels as quick and graceful as a magic trick, just as any classic romance should.",

It's a road movie and it deals with themes that will resonate with a contemporary audience. Many of the scenes are hilarious, especially those involving Mr. Shapely, played by Roscoe Karns. The movie has snappy dialog, a fast-paced story, excellent development of the principal characters, and a good upbeat ending. Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable give outstanding performances which reveal their skills as comic actors. The hitchhiking scene cannot fail to provoke laughter. The movie presents a story format that sets the standard for a genre of road movies. The movie also highlights the emergence of an America dominated by the automobile and tied together by roads and highways. Figuring in the story are gas station attendants, motel owners, bus drivers and bus stations, all part of the newly emerging automobile age. A movie of this kind could not have set in a pre-auto culture. This accounts for the movie's contemporary feel. Clark Gable so dominates this movie that it is virtually impossible to imagine anyone else playing Peter Warne. Yet, what makes the movie succeed is its straightforward storytelling about people who want to be break free from the social conventions that are denying them happiness. This is a wonderful and beautiful movie.",

It might just be the fact that I'm not that crazy about romantic-comedies, but I seem to have stopped enjoying the idea of the story after a while.  However, I really did enjoy some of the scenes in this classic. For example, the scene where Colbert manages to get a ride with Gable by lifting up her skirt to hitchhike.  I also thought that the scenes where Gable undresses and tells Colbert that there aren't two men in the world who do it the same way and the scene where Gable explains to Colbert that dipping your doughnut is an art were brilliant.  Overall, I think it might simply have been the idea of a reporter falling in love with a rich woman whose father does not appreciate her fianc\u00e9 that kind of made this movie, to my eyes, not quite as good as I expected. However, I must give credit to Gable and Colbert for their two very good and very strong performances as well as for Frank Capra's expert directing.  I do believe that he is one of those directors who can make those incredibly charming movies better than any other director.  I do recommend it for movie-buffs and for fans of Gable, Colbert, and Capra.  After all, it was the first movie to win best picture, best actor, best actress, and best director.",

For the time and age this movie is very refreshing and it's almost amazing how being one of the first to fall in the category of \"chick flicks\" it still isn't one, because:1. It's not clich\u00e9d in any way. 2. Most of it is comedy, focusing little on the romance and delving more into comical situations and mix-ups. 3. The bit that is romance is sweet and nice without overdoing it, playing off a real situation, not a fairy tale one.I guess this seems paradoxical but this movie's romance department is quite realistic. I appreciated the ending a lot, no kiss (though it wouldn't have hurt :)) no mushy declaration, no ostentatious proposal, just a nice pun well-played out and charmingly unforgettable. I give this movie 9 out of 10 because I didn't like the wedding sequence. I guess that was the only gag that didn't make it the perfect afternoon movie.

            "content": "It's rare the Academy Awards hands out the 'Big Five' Oscars to one motion picture: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. In fact, only two other films hold that honor after February 1934's \"It Happened One Night\" achieved the seemingly impossible. Strangely, the Columbia Pictures' movie was initially a production no one wanted to be involved. Several top-flight stars rejected having anything to do with the production after reading the script, including Miriam Hopkins, Myrna Loy, Margaret Sullavan, Frederic March and Robert Montgomery, who later called it the worst screenplay he had ever read. Columbia boss Harry Cohn recommended actress Claudette Colbert to director Frank Capra to play the role of 'Ellie' Andres, who escapes from her wealthy father by diving off his Florida yacht to return to New York to re-unite with her recently married husband. Her father loathes the man and demands the marriage be annulled. Colbert had bad memories dealing with Capra in the first movie she ever appeared in, 1927's silent 'For the Love of Mike,\" and vowed never to work for him again. To discourage the hiring, she demanded double her salary of $50,000. Surprisingly, Columbia met her request.Capra, after hearing so many actors reject the screenplay, asked his writer friend Myles Connolly what he thought of the script. His advice: make Ellie more sympathetic. Screenwriter Robert Riskin reworked the script based on Samuel Hopkins Adams' 1933 short story 'Night Bus' to do just that. Still, the rewrite didn't improve Colbert's disposition on the set. She bickered with Capra throughout the four weeks of filming. She told her friends \"I just finished the worst picture in the world.\"Clark Gable was equally unenthusiastic about the project. MGM loaned out the actor since his next studio film wasn't ready for some weeks, and his $2,000 a-week salary would be paid by Columbia. His first words to Capra on the initial day of shooting was \"Let's get this over with.\"Once \"It Happened One Night\" was released to major city theaters, critics were lukewarm towards the film. The New Yorker review scathingly wrote \"pretty much nonsense and quite dreary.\" The initial short run at the large city movie houses was drawing only a mediocre audience. The film then played at smaller venues and towns. Suddenly, through word of mouth, lines formed out the door anxious to see Gable, as Peter Warne, a jaded know-it-all newspaper reporter just fired from his job who meets up with Ellie on the bus journeying north from Florida. The movie struck a special cord to rural Americans who were experiencing a lack of jobs, food, and shelter during the Depression. Roger Ebert noted in his review of \"It Happened One Night, \"The communal singing of \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" interrupts the action and morphs into a wonderfully democratic vision of the night bus as a society in eternal transit.\"That bus ride scene was particularly instructive in how Capra, through his years of living in poverty, instinctively reframed it in the middle of filming. The director at first hired a small band to play \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\" to a bus full of lower class travelers, including the two leads. Amazingly, all the extras knew the entire words to the song and sang it on the set. \"Another idea.\" recalls Capra. \"Why not let the whole bus join in? And that's what finally evolved.\" He praised small Columbia for allowing such independence that larger studios would have a committee of executives deciding on the director's preference.\"It Happened One Night\" is filled with such classic scenes. When a bridge washed out the road during a rainstorm delaying the bus, Ellie and Peter are forced to share a motel room. The script called for Gable to strip down to his undies, describing each phase of his undressing. Gable's slick-tongue narrative got hung up when he had to remove his undershirt. Capra decided to bag the T-shirt. Gable's dialogue flowed smoothly after that. The sequence was so popular the males in the audience stopped buying undershirts, causing a massive drop in T-shirt sales.Another scene is the famous hitch-hiking sequence where the two are forced to stake a ride. After Peter is unsuccessful using his thumb, Ellie tries the approach by raising her skirt and showing some leg. A body double was used for the close-up. Colbert was appalled. \"That's not my leg!\" she exclaimed, and insisted her leg be used instead.\"It Happened One Night\" is credited as cinema's first screwball comedy. Even though loose versions of the farcical genre had been around since Shakespeare, including 'As You Like It,' the format didn't really pick up steam until Columbia's film. Movie critic Andrew Sarris defined screwballs as \"sex comedy without the sex.\" The commonality all the screwball comedies have is the quick-paced dialogue, with romantic relationships set in hilarious situations, and containing occasional class distinctions of the middle-class seen as 'heroes' while the upper-class members looking like saps.Even though \"It Happened One Night\" cleaned up at the box office in the secondary market, Colbert agreed with the sophisticated critics who gave a thumbs down to the movie. She was so sure she had no chance of winning the Academy Awards Best Actress, Colbert, despite her nomination, was seen boarding a train from Los Angeles to vacation in Phoenix during the evening of the ceremony. An Academy representative rushed to the station to inform her she had just won. Colbert went back to the Biltmore Hotel's gathering to accept the award. Film footage showing the evening's winners captures Colbert attired in traveling clothes.\"It Happened One Night\" was the first to capture the 'Big Five\" awards. The other two were 1975's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and 1991's \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" Members of the American Film Institute rank the Capra film the 35th Best American Movie, the 8th Funniest, the 38th Most Passionate, the third Best Romantic Comedy, and nominated Ellie's quote, \"Well, I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb\" as the one of the Best Quotes in Film. The motion picture is also included in the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die' reference book.",

No, \"It Happened One Night\" is an unabashed romantic comedy and one of the best (if not the very best) of all time.The story concerns a spoiled heiress (Claudette Colbert), on the run from her controlling father, who meets up with an unemployed newspaper reporter (Clark Gable) on a night bus to New York. They decide to work together to their mutual advantage but what starts out as a business arrangement gradually develops into something more.The film's embarrassment of riches begins with its stars. Not only do they deliver excellent performances individually but together they have wonderful chemistry. Gable's performance is probably the best of the two but both were deserving Oscar winners. Besides these two, the cast is uniformly solid, including supporting standouts Walter Connolly & Roscoe Karns.The film is distinguished as the first to win all five major Academy Awards. Besides the aforementioned Oscars for Best Actor & Best Actress, the film also took home Oscars for its adapted screenplay (by Robert Riskin) and direction (by Frank Capra) along with the prestigious Best Picture Oscar.

Frank Capra's sparkling romantic comedy is just about as uplifting as any movie can possibly be. Whatever it is that makes a star a star, Clark Gable had it in spades more than any other leading man before or since, & how could Claudette Colbert, (or any other woman?), not fall in love with him. Against her father's (Walter Connolly) wishes Ellie Andrews (Colbert) has married newspaper magnate King Westley (Jameson Thomas) & after an argument she jumps her rich fathers yacht into the sea & swims to shore. She is wearing a long white silk gown & not carrying a handbag. Next we see her at Miami bus station purchasing a ticket to New York to be with her husband, complete with a new outfit & handbag! Even allowing for a few plot absurdities this is a movie with a big heart & is very entertaining. On board the bus she meets Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who is a newspaper reporter. When the bus makes a meal stop at Jacksonville Ellie has her handbag stolen leaving her with just 4 dollars. Peter now gets wind of who she is, the runaway daughter heiress of a millionaire father & he senses a good story. After they get back on board the bus Ellie sits next to a rather comical man named Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns), who is an incessant chatterbox who has a habit of saying \"believe you me\". After getting tired of him she tells him, \"Believe you me, you bore me to distraction\". On this night there is a heavy rainstorm outside & the bus is forced to make an overnight stop. Peter hires out a chalet at a campsite & he tells the owner that he & Ellie are a married couple. When she protests he points out to Ellie that after the theft of most of her money they cannot afford \"separate establishments\". He attaches a length of rope across the centre of their chalet & drapes a blanket over it as a room divider which he calls \"the walls of Jericho\". \"That I suppose makes everything quite alright\" she tells him. Peter Warne now admits to her that he is a reporter & has latched on to Ellie Andrews because he senses a good story. He knows her real husband King Westley very well & tells her, \"That guy is a phoney. If I were you I would take the next bus back to Miami\". What follows is a movie that is chock full of memorably entertaining scenes & I guarantee that if anyone is feeling a bit low this film will improve their mood. Highly recommended.",

It would be a film, despite starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, that would vanish as time progressed, right? Guess again! The movie happened to be the table-setter for a new kind of film, and it is a movie that resonates well with people, even to today's modern audience. Personally, I found much to enjoy. Despite my misgivings on the screwball genre, Capra gets it right. The situations are zany, fast, and witty. The performances are excellent, and Capra is on the top of his game following his usually formula in the world of comedy.The making of the film could have been its own film. This picture was produced by Columbia, which was seen as a minor picture at the time. Frank Capra lacked two major stars to appear. He previously worked with Claudette Colbert, but their experience together was negative, and she vowed never to work with him again. I guess a salary that is doubled would change minds. Because of how the studio system worked in the 1930's, actors were \"owned\" by individual studios. In Clark Gable's case, he worked for MGM. Rumor has it that he was punished by the studio and allowed Columbia to borrow him. Gable was apprehensive about the project and even showed up on the first day of set very drunk.The opening sequence sets the picture off with a bang. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is a wealthy socialite who secretly married this aviator, Wesley. Her father, believing what is best for her, annulled her marriage. In anger, she jumps off the boat and goes ashore. Her father, Alexander (Walter Connolly) sends a private detective agency to find her. Ellie manages to stay one step ahead when she purchases a bus ticket. She sits next to a cynical journalist, Peter Warne (Gable). Warne manages to annoy her and ends up blackmailing her in order to force her to travel with him. Despite her original feelings, they begin to fall in love. But Ellie has reason to believe that Peter may be more into her father's $10,000 reward than her?It is well-known what an accidental pairing the teaming of Colbert and Gable was...but it worked in such a grand fashion. They both were fantastic as a whole and individually. Being such great actors, should we truly be surprised? The most famous scene in the movie is where Colbert shows off her leg to attract drivers. She was very hesitant at first, but she decided to do it anyway after she learned what Capra was going to do for Plan B. Gable really owned the role as the cynical reporter and he really elevated everything to another level in the film's end. Just watch and you shall see.It Happened One Night is the first picture to win the grand slam at the Academy Awards. It took home Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Actress. Colbert actually thought she wasn't going to win, so she did not attend the ceremony. The studio's head, Harry Cohn had to send someone to \"drag her off the train\" for her vacation. The film revolutionized the screwball genre, and it is the best film from the genre in my own humble opinion. Capra allowed his film to succeed on a quick, zany screenplay and wonderful, breezy performances. People back in the day were enamored with Gable's shirtless figure. Soon after the film was released, the Hays Code would come in effect which would not allow this. Anyhow, a funny, enjoyable picture with Frank Capra at the top of his game.My Grade: A-",

            "content": "It is a very rare thing when a light-hearted comedy, something that is quintessentially the stuff of a 'good movie,' breaches into that territory where the term 'good film' can also be applied, but Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night may be an exception. Today, most people know Capra solely for his rediscovered classic It's A Wonderful Life, made a dozen years later, but this film was his first stab at what most critics would label greatness. This is all the more interesting because the 1930s, with their still newly developed sound technology, were still a transition period, of sorts, with the over the top hammy expressionistic acting of the silent films still dominating more than the more subtle naturalism of later film eras.As a comedy, this is all the more striking, since there was not the manifest symbolism of some of the great silent film comedians, nor was there the social satire of the 1960s madcap comedies, nor those of Woody Allen's intellectualized Golden Era. Yet, Capra's film, aside from its fame as having lifted Columbia Pictures from the bottom of the film studio heap, and being the first film to win the Big Five Oscars in a single year- Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Lead Actor, and Best Lead Actress, is credited with being the first 'screwball comedy,' a subgenre of the romantic comedy, that flourished during the Great Depression and World War Two years. The films that this film kicked off all were romantic comedies, but the main focus of the films was on the frustrations the protagonists went through before inevitably ending up together in the end, rather than the stuff of pulp novels. Another aspect of this film, which makes it relevant today, is the brisk pace at which it was filmed, acted, and even edited. It is not as noticeable today, in Hollywood's caffeinated era, but compare it to any of a few dozen other films from that era and the difference is startling\u0085. there are a few cringe-inducing moments when the era is shown at its worst- with a portrayal of a Stepin Fetchit like black railroad character, but that's a minor cavil in an otherwise great comedy, and possibly great film. After all, greatness includes- it does not preclude, humanity, and Capra was as infected by the worst of his times as anyone. But what makes a man great, especially an artist, is the degree to which those times claw at him, and the percentage of times a man of his time becomes a man for all times. The same is true for his art, and this artist and his film pass both of those bars. It Happened One Night is still as funny as it ever was, and the fact that you will get a bit more is the type of bonus feature DVDs alone cannot provide.",

            "content": "Spoilers. Observations. Opinions.Clark and Claudette are excellent. I had put off seeing this film, because I thought that besides the leg-flashing hitchhiking part there must not be much interesting stuff in this movie.I finally watched it. It held my interest all the way through. It was funny and hilarious in places.Westley looked old enough to be Claudette's father. At the beginning, I thought Claudette was marrying her father's friend, another \"old\" man.Good to see Ward Bond, and an earlier version of tough looking Greyhound bus.Shapely was annoying, as he was supposed to be. The actor essayed the part well. Shapely believed it when Clark inferred that Shapely's children could end up being hurt. Hilarious! Tough guy Clark.Yes, I am interspersing the names of actors and characters.The father, in the end, paying off Westley, was a good move. This is part of the denouement of tying up the loose ends of the story. Clark, waiting in the car while the marriage ceremony was supposed to start, surely peeled off quite fast after that wonderful scene of Claudette running to meet him in her beautiful white wedding gown and veil.A singing Alan Hale was also hilarious. He was annoying to his passengers. He was the one whose car Claudette stopped when she raised up her skirt to her upper leg. Clark had failed in his ride-thumbing lessons; he couldn't flag down a car to save his neck.Clark pretended to be hard boiled, and Claudette pretended to be disinterested. Later, they had a meeting of the minds, er, hearts.This is a pre-code film. Pre-code films existed from near the beginning of sound films to around mid 1934. Pre-code allowed more sexuality, sexual innuendoes, adultery, violence, etc., than were allowed after this period. Church groups, moralists and Hollywood censors took care of that. Some pre-code things I noticed: motel managers wondered if sleepers Clark and Claudette were married. Claudette removed her clothes down to her slip. Clark showed his bare chest to Claudette. The beds were separate, and separated by a blanket draped over a rope, but they were in the same bedroom. Even Claudette raising her skirt up high on her thigh got a lot of the audience's attention when this film was new.",

Even if we consider the age of the film, it's just annoying and distracting all the time with its characters' outdated crappy behaviour. It's still a fun film that can be remembered for being the first in a lot of things but not one of the greatest films in a long shot.

            "content": "It Happened One Night (1934), was a film of firsts. It is an example of early romantic comedy in film. It was the type of rom-com, that influenced many films that came after it. It took that genre and galvanized it, so it would become a staple genre for the next century. Also, this film capitalizes on a few other sub-genres. This film is an off-shoot of the sub-genre known as the \"buddy\" film, only in this case it is between a man and a woman, from two completely different backgrounds, coming together to help each other. They also capitalize on the classic sub-genre known as the \"chase\" film, where our two characters take us on a journey across the country, as they flee from the other characters, to reach their final goals.The plot of the film revolves around a rich socialite, the daughter of rich businessman named Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), Ellen, who rebels against her father and marries a spoiled-rich, fortune-hunter, named King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Ellen (Claudette Colbert), escapes from her father's home and ends up in Jacksonville, where she meets a man, an unemployed reporter, named Peter Warne (Clark Gable). He tells her that he will help her get to New York City to be with Westley, in order to grab a scoop of a story. If she doesn't cooperate he'll turn her over to her father. So, off on their adventure to New York City, they go.This film came out at a very interesting time in Hollywood's history. It was a post-depression era film, part of the early-talkie era and a pre-code Hollywood film (although the censorship-code started to take hold by 1935, so this is at the tail-end of that moment in film history). The use of sound in film was becoming more streamlined and much more crisper. This one uses all the techniques and talents that made early sound film so groundbreaking.This film completes its greatness by winning the Best Picture Award at the Oscars in 1934. This film won all of the big five awards that year. It has those classic moments that made this film wonderful to watch. From the hitchhiking lesson, to the \"Flying Trapeze\", sung on the bus, to sleeping in a hay field and dividing the room up with a rope and a blanket. It has the right amount of comedy, drama, mood, sexual tension, sights, songs and sounds, that make it a near-perfect film.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert earned their Oscar wins, by convincingly giving us performances that still hold up today. His portrayal is right on the numbers. He doesn't come off as an over-emphasized 1930s clich\u00e9. His character does work throughout the ages. He's nice, but tough. He's sly, but also ignorant. He can be slick, but also look like a clown. His resourcefulness is lost on her though, because she is so prone to being waited on by others, that she doesn't see the extraordinary lengths he goes through to please her.I also want to emphasize the conditions these actors had to work under when they made these films so long ago. Today actors have huge campers they can wait in until filming starts. They have more protections for their safety today. They have a team of people around them catering to their every need. Technologies, communication and transportation is much more accessible today. When you watch these older films, visualize yourself and your friends today going out for a film shoot, in the rain, mud, cold, with limited resources and a couple of vehicles, that barely go over 35 miles an hour. That is what it was like, filming these huge Hollywood productions, back in its early days. It's these great moments, involving the whole process of the thing, that makes a film like this even greater.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way.

The end is visible from the beginning, and the road from start to finish doesn't travel a route that is particularly entertaining. Nonetheless, this is a landmark film of the 1930's and it deploys three of the great talents of that era: Frank Capra as director and Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert as the two hostile personalities who eventually fall in love. I never thought much of Gable when I was young but my mother often said he was the handsomest man alive. Colbert also pales alongside contemporary sexpots yet she was considered one of the most beautiful of the stars (back in the days when Stars were Stars). And Capra was considered a master movie-maker in his day. Although tame by contemporary standards, \"It Happened One Night\" is worth viewing as a milestone of an earlier era. Bearing in mind the limited technical resources available at the time and the no-sex code imposed by the Hays Office, I think it's worth 8 out of 10.",

Gable\nwas (is) an example of that, but his ability to be so natural on screen is compelling. I would compare him\nand Cary Grant, but Grant not only had a single gear, he was so arrogant and demeaning. Yes, Gable\ndoesn't treat women much better, but his natural style is far more genuine than Grant's pretense.Colbert did a great job, and showed why women normally out-perform men in acting. The flexibility and\nrange are much wider, and Colbert exercises these traits well here. Comparing her to Jean Arthur in\nanother Capra film \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), Arthur has a much softer and wider range.But both deliver perfectly on their respective roles.ENTERTAINMENT:\nModerate to high value (for those who love classics)TEMPO:\nGood paceCINEMATOGRAPHY:\nFor the era, I was impressed (even with the sets)MUSIC / SOUND:\nLimited, which was just about rightDIRECTING / WRITING:\nDirector: There's a hand full of brilliant directors: Capra, Hitchcock, Wyler, Wilder ... and a few contemporary\nones. But Capra will always be among the \"giants\" of film directing.Writers: Riskin has written some good story, e.g. \"Lady for a Day \" (1933) and this.

            "review_title": "Classic Comedy About Sheltered Female and Strong Male=TNT",
            "content": "This script by Robert Riskin I find to be filled with excellent dialogue; This is an unpretentious but very idea-level social satire, involving the unlikely pairing of no-nonsense Clark Gable with classically-trained charismatic Claudette Colbert. The second unlikeliness about the film is the princess-like Colbert, being barred by her magnate father from consummating a secret marriage, jumping off the yacht where she is being confined and ending up being spotted by newsman Gable. He is in fact portrayed as the usual late-twenties hard-drinking no-nonsense reporter sort with three exceptions--he is adventurous, able to get along and function effectively at all levels of society even during the Depresssion, and he is working in a profession where there is no job-level between managing editor and field reporter; this all leaves him frustrated by dull or routine assignments but wanting to investigate and do something important in the world. Only the wealth of Colbert's father qualifies her as important. Once he befriends her, and agrees to get her where she wants to go, the added complication comes from their attraction for one another, a slowly growing and smoldering subtext to what they actually do. He disapproves of her; she disapproves of him. He represents, it appears to me, reality--what she has been denied every bit as much as any European princess (\"The Princess Comes Across\", \"Roman Holiday\") has been denied it; and he is a natural leader shut out from the upper levels of society and thus denied also; and he is the natural leader/mental aristocrat by ability denied her worlds of unobstructed goal-setting, doing one's one desires and not having to be disbarred from anything. As no one I know has noticed, then, this is a European story-line grafted onto a supposedly classless U.S., every bit as much so as is \"Destry Rides Again\" or \"Roman Scandals\". That I suggest is the secret to \"It Happened One Night\" and its strong story-line; it is a film about Gable's personal purpose of doing a good story for his career's sake and having it turned upside down by his falling in love with what Colbert ought-to-be, could be, and is becoming. The \"Walls of Jericho\" business involving the erecting of a curtain so Colbert will feel safe spending the night with Gable is a charming device for comedic purposes, as is Gable's removing his shirt as a symbol of reality-sexuality being offered to Colbert, the last thing she immediately wants to deal with. In another sense, the Walls are protecting him, the realist, from immediately having to deal with her higher-value-sexual meaning rather than her story-value to him as a reporter. The cleverness of the dialogue, picaresque adventures, human encounters and interactions depicted in the movie all magnify its importance again. And the fact that these are all beautifully presented by director Frank Capra and his technicians further increases their ability to affect an audience. The couple's different ways of handling people, the dunking of a donut, and the classic triumph of the bared female leg (hers) over hitchhiking expertise (his) at promoting them a ride become symbols of the natural triumphing over the artificial. over \"barriers\". And when the time comes for Ellie Andrews (Colbert) to decide whether she wants to stay married to one King Westley or divorce or marry Peter Warne (Gable), we the viewers have been well-informed as to what decision she will be making. This is a screwball-type comedy due to the unpredictable reactions of many persons to the Depression's unnatural restraints and emergencies. The basic situation--the princess-cheerleader female and the rough-hewn-commoner male has been carried out many times, but never with more success since the film's release; but this is essentially a European plot line grafted onto a U.S. stature-through-ability individualism; this is why so many attempts at this formula have failed, I suggest; because the formula was not understood, and because the united States has been increasingly unAmerican since 1902, particularly since 1937. The other interesting and important aspect I find as a writer is that Gable does not know who this waif is at the beginning; so we find that Gable's character is a commoner who deserves to be an important man, a first-rate newspaperman frustrated by his inability to chart his own course, a man who likes people who lives in a rough, noir-like environment, and a man who likes women and wants an equal but has to play mentor to a desirable woman only slowly realizing her potential. This is the \"ice-goddess\" aspect of the rich explored in \"The Phildaelphia Story\" by Philip Barry; Gable's problem is that of the great man stuck in a tsar-ridden society, familiar from \"Holiday\", \"The Big Sleep\" and \"The Fountainhead\" among others. The film I find is a delight; its dated aspects are those of its technologically backward period only. Its strengths appear to me to be derived from its honest plot and many interesting characters. Both leads are self-regulating; he lives by a moral code, and during the film she discovers the need for one. They seem to be an excellent match, when all is said and done. The evils of the Depression, which socialist Capra might have stressed even more than he does, are used very cleverly here as a background to the personal self-discovery mutual story-line. This is a well-photographed and artistic effort, I suggest, but nothing as stylish as Capra's later efforts. Cinematography by Joseph Walker, art direction by Stephen Goosson, and Robert Kalloch's costumes, with brief music only being provided all add to the realistic sense of the two character's descent from riches or daily reality and their immersion in the wider meaning of a nation in social upheaval and economic distress. In the cast the viewer should note Walter Connolly as Colbert's exasperated banker father, Roscoe Karns, Ward Bond, Alan Hale, Arthur Hoyt, Jameson Roberts, Harry Hume, Milton Kibbee and many more persons effective in brief parts. This is a well-designed movie, very deserving of its popularity.",

            "content": "Director Frank Capra's \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) was deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress in 1993, and for that it was preserved in the National Film Registry. It is an honor few films have received, considering only 550 out of the hundreds of thousands of films America has produced since film's birth long ago. This is rightfully so, as the film is a masterpiece on many levels and despite being nearly eighty years old watching it today it still doesn't feel dated at all. Its humor is golden, there being so many classic lines I've heard them quoted so many times in other productions and in everyday life even. Not only that but it was a blue print for future films of a similar genre, the romantic comedy everyone's come to know and love, and its influence is unmistakable as well as undeniable. The film encompasses many aspects of the classic screwball comedy that was prominent in the 30s and 40s. Though elements of the subgenre have survived on for years in modern comedy, the screwball comedy of the early twentieth century represented a specific point in American history. Take for instance Claudette Colbert's character, Ellie. Besides being beautiful, she is intelligent, especially compared to the minor male characters. We see this in the opening scenes and one of our initial reactions may be to think of her as nothing more than a spoiled brat. However, the clever writing uses her somewhat awkward and clumsy nature amongst the everyday people and bus travelers not only as comedy, but as a way to draw sympathy for the character. We soon see that she is alone in her plight, and so arrives the charming Peter Warren, played by Clark Gable. Peter Warren appears and quickly distinguishes himself from the other male characters in that he is not only intelligent, but he's a man of honor and dignity. Not only that, he's street smart and humble compared to Ellie's would be husband. Consider the well-played foil of how Peter is on a simple bus, in sharp contrast to the groom who arrives at his wedding in a plane of all things. It is on the bus where the majority of the character interaction takes place. The two seemingly opposite personalities are brought together by fate, another one of the trademarks of screwball comedy that became a principle of romantic comedy as a whole. Throughout the film, one hears dialogue in rather a series of quips almost, the comedic insults and quirks of the characters. You see this with many of them, but it is strongest with the two star crossed lovers.That is one of the beauties of screwball comedy. This \"sex comedy without sex\" achieves its sexual tension without being lewd at all. Despite the lack of today's raunchy style, the dialogue is so rich, and the actors so talented with lines, you can feel the attraction building. Before it even reaches the d\u00e9nouement, you can hardly notice how much closer the characters have become due to its sublime subtlety. Romantically speaking, the hay scene is the high note, as we finally see the boiling romance between the characters that they previously denied or really had no intention of. But also, and perhaps for memorabilia and sentimental laughs really, would be the hitch-hiking scene. It's not just incredibly hilarious, but Ellie finally proves her worth to Peter who previously had cared for her almost as if she were a helpless damsel. It's brilliant characterization at work. The mise-en-scene of this film is another one of its main attractions. On one level, it represents the social status differences and qualities of the character. In many shots of Ellie's father (Walter Colbert), we see the fine wine and other assorted alcohols. In sharp contrast, the first time we see Peter he's drinking out of a bottle in a telephone booth. The remarkable beauty of the film's artistic mise-en-scene though comes out in its night scenes, especially in the rain. The camera and lighting really illuminates the characters in those scenes. It makes them stand out amongst the others as if they weren't even there. As time goes on, night after night, the two literally and emotionally draw closer to one another.\" It Happened One Night\" is a masterpiece on many aspects. It is a classic that represents the birth of a genre and a picture of human emotion. Alas all that, it is a frozen moment in history, giving illusion to a time that has been forgotten by some. Taking all that into account, along with the majestic authenticity of the glorious black-and-white days, it truly stands the test of time.",

It's easily one of the best movies that had been made.I have firstly watched it without any references just seeing it in IMDb top 250 and that Frank Capra has directed. I completed watching it once, twice and now thrice. It's a simple ride that will be at times too fast as the bus moving in the film and at times lousy as they eat their breakfast. It's not hurried and it's neither slow. This has the perfect pace and Frank Capra, the genius who has given wonderful gems knows how to keep the audience glued.The time it was made that is 1934 could have been so exciting to have seen this and I discovered this movie only last year that is 2010 and yet I was very excited all through for the first time and even now. There are moments that have stood the test of time and this I believe will be appreciated simply for it's authenticity for a real life portrayal by characters.Now coming the movie, it's a tale of a runaway girl who wants to meet the one she loves and along this journey meets a man she falls for. The depiction of such simplicity is strengthened with such conversations that are straight into heart as we can relate to all of those. Like the conversation where our hero helps the heroine save from the detectives while she combs her hair, ah so apt it was. Refulgent this movie shall be for all the romantic comedies.I hugely thank frank Capra for presenting such a delightful film right in 1934.It's 5/5 for the earliest romantic comedy that I am aware of and the one of the best I have seen thus far.",

The funny thing about the movie is the name which says, \"It happened one night\" when actually in the movie's story it actually went on for more than a night.The movie plot is about Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) who has been whisked away by her father in his yacht to keep her away from her new husband King Westley. Ellie then jumps ship, swim to shore and heads off to New York to meet with King Westley. On her way she meets a reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) and both started as an unsuitable pair that grew to be lovers.Both Colbert and Gable felt the movie was not going to be good enough and gave Capra a lot of bull. Even the movie's iconic scene where Colbert lifted up her skirt to stop a car during the hitchhiking scene, was not so easy to film for Capra as Colbert refused to do the scene claiming it was not lady like, but upon seeing a body double do it, she later changed her mind and did it herself.Although picking up slow, the movie later became one the biggest hits for the studio and the thing is that at the end the movie cleared the Academy Awards and both Gable and Colbert were better off. Colbert is known to have told a friend, \"I just finished the worst picture in the world.\" She boycotted the Academy Awards when she got a nomination believing she will not win, but she was called back to come pick up her award.Here is a movie that actually makes you smile all the way through, although like the actors themselves upon initial siting of the film you can be turned off thinking this is heading nowhere, but be patient the movie has all the familiar scenes that we see in the movies today (all taken from this old classic). This old classic is tagged the 46th greatest film in the last 100 years in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).It Happened One Night is a nice DVD for one to place on the shelf.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Utterly charming and immensely influential !!!",
            "content": "The genre of 'Romantic comedy' is generally scoffed at and looked down upon by critics and many viewers nowadays. This is mainly because of the mechanical way in which a huge number of them have been produced over the years and unfortunately, there is a distinct lack of creativity and artistic input apparent in most of them. Although the prejudice that some people have against the films categorised in this genre is justified due to recent releases, but one has to acknowledge the fact that a number of great and incredibly influential films also are romantic comedies. The film that is widely regarded as the one that pretty much single-handedly started it all, is Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night'. It was the first Screwball Comedy and it is very easy to see the way it influenced subsequent films.'It Happened One Night' is a film set in the Depression Era. It hints at the struggles that ordinary American people faced at the time. However, the film never really tackles it head on and in a way must have offered the viewers of the time a nice escape from reality and an escape from the horrors of their financial problems. The film explores the class distinctions of society. We get to see two individuals belonging to different classes and financial backgrounds get together and go on a journey. We see the character of Peter showcase his disdain and prejudice against the haves of the society. We also see how Ellie being a rich sheltered socialite finds it difficult to completely fit in with Peter and his ways initially. The gender politics in the film is an interesting element. On one hand, there certainly are aspects of it like Ellie needing Peter's help for everything, or some of Peter's aggressive remarks towards Ellie that can make the film look a bit dated, but from another angle it is a bit progressive too. We see at the beginning that Ellie is being almost suffocated and imprisoned by her father. Capra gives us a good understanding of how oppressed she clearly feels and the whole affair with King Westley is nothing but an attempt to break away from the shackles.The film is very charming and funny. Clarke Gable puts on an utterly charismatic performance. He exudes charm and charisma and Claudette Colbert holds her own brilliantly. The chemistry and the wit involved in the scenes between them to a great extent makes the film. Robert Riskin's script is rich with witty, snappy and sharp dialogue. There are singular examples of brilliant scenes that stick out over the others which are extremely funny even today like the piggyback scene, the hitchhiking scene, etc. to name a few. The film pretty much set the template for the trope of the two leads hating each other at the beginning and then slowly developing feelings for each other. We see this transition take place slowly and gradually. There are three major scenes involving just the two of them having a conversation before going off to sleep which can be used to notice the changes and developments that take place in the way they perceive each other over the course of their journey.This was made when the silent films were starting to go out of fashion, and one can see how much the camera work is reminiscent of the silent films of the era. The camera is not very mobile and the movement of the camera is kept to a minimum. However there is one specific moment of bravura camera movement in the scene where the camera tracks sideways from left to right to follow Ellie as she heads to the cottage shower while being noticed by the working class people in the locality. Another very important aspect of Capra's direction is his lack of the use of music. Films of the later 30s and early 40s were famous for being a bit drowned in music. But Capra uses the music in a very discreet way. Some of the most important scenes in terms of character development is accompanied by nothing but the sound of crickets chirping in the background. But I couldn't say the film blew me away and I'm sure that's because of the fact that I was already expecting a lot of the twists and story elements that were going to transpire as they have been repeated to death over the years in other films. The last 20 minutes of the film I felt were a bit flat. Another example of a film which left me a bit underwhelmed because of the tropes being used and reused in later films was 'Double Indemnity'. I know maybe this criticism is a bit unfair, but I generally tend to judge a film solely based on whether it worked for me or not irrespective of when it was released and I'm afraid 'It Happened One Night' doesn't completely hold up.Having said that it is still a charming, funny film with charismatic performances. There are a number of scenes of genuine comedy littered throughout the film. But the last 20 minutes left me a bit underwhelmed.",

It stars Claudette Colbert and my favourite actor from that era, the handsome Clark Gable, who fall in love in the midst of an entertaining set of screwball adventures, all the while exchanging assorted witty banter.The story revolves around a spoiled heiress, Ellie Andrews, who marries a fortune hunter named King Westley against the wishes of her father, who has the marriage annulled before it can be consummated. Ellie runs off and boards a bus where she meets reporter Peter Warne, who recognizes her. He gives her a choice, either give him an exclusive story and he will reunite her with King or he will reveal her whereabouts to her father and collect the reward. Ellie agrees to give the story and various adventures ensue, during the course of which the pair develop a mutual attraction.This movie has two main claims to fame, other than its incredible male star! The first is the hitchhiking scene in which Peter tries unsuccessfully to thumb a ride, turned down by car after car. Then Ellie lifts her skirt to reveal a shapely leg and...you guessed it, the next driver slams on his brakes!The other is the famous Walls of Jericho scene, which is my lingering memory of this tale. Peter and Ellie are obliged to share a motel room for the night, surely quite risqu\u00e9 for that era! However, in order to maintain the proper decorum for an unmarried couple, a blanket is hung up sort of clothesline style to separate the two sleepers.

I'll never forget the feeling of exuberance at watching Clark Gable run to his boss at the newspaper to pitch a story about how he's fallen in love with a princess, such energy, such emotion; I had never felt such a way from watching a movie before. It Happened One Night is the famous and most widely seen film of its genre and I believe it deserves such an accolade; something unforgettable is happening in every scene, whether funny or tender, jam-packed little details to spot on every viewing. It Happened One Night along with Twentieth Century gave birth to the screwball comedy, but it isn't the only sub-genre it set a standard for. The runaway princess movie, the road movie and the newspaper comedy all owe their debts to it.In his opening scene, Clark Gable is introduced as the king; couldn't be more adapt. Watching the movie closely I can say that everything this man says is pure gold from his art of donut dunking, art of clothes removal, the different methods hitchhike signaling and his wall of Jericho. Then it dawned on me just how Seinfeldian this movie is. Much of Clark Gable's dialogue in this movie could be a Jerry Seinfeld stand up routine. It's easy to see how many screwball comedies have influenced modern day sitcoms; all that's missing is the laugh track.Claudette Colbert is one of the most famous incumbents of The Gable Treatment; what I like to call the macho manner in which Gable treats his leading ladies. Of course for any other actor to have this characteristic they would be an unlikable brute, but because it's Gable it works. I also have to ask did the scene in which Gable eats a raw carrot while attempting to hitch-hike with his usual confidence and cockiness inspire Bugs Bunny?

It is not a stage play on celluloid, the dialogue is wonderfully emotive and not descriptive. The tone is light but not too light. There is enough space between the word and the role to create a character.What is more remarkable is the absence of sentiment. A lot of movies from that era \"create\" the moment for the audience: the music decides when the viewer needs to be scared, to be touched, to cry. Here there is no such forced reaction. And yet the order of the events keeps us interested, keeps us with both lead characters and their emotions.The funny thing is that it is a comedy, often referred to as the first screwball comedy, but it has no jokes. There are witty lines, of course, but no \"laugh or I'll shoot\"-remarks. The funniest bits are when Claudette Colbert proves how to get a free ride by showing her leg and the driver who comments on everything by making a song of it. Those moments could be clich\u00e9s now, but at the time they were original and fresh, and even to a 21st century audience, used to so many comic situations, those scenes are still funny and touching .The sympathy and understanding that this movie show for humans in general gives the viewer the same sympathy and understanding. How not to be touched by the scene in the bus where people are singing a song they all know, and where strangers take turns singing the different verses. To see such community feeling in an era that was struck by poverty and despair is heartwarming.Both leads achieve to be likable and believable just by portraying a round character. A film that celebrates humanity, extraordinarily simple but touchingly effective, and that in 1934!",

Yes, the movie was made around 40 years before I was born... but the feel is all so clear.  There is a sense of being alone, where no one truly knows you.  A sense of adventure, and discovery, wit, and romance... that always brings me back.Now it's plain to see, Cary Grant and Claudet Colbert are wonderful together. I am reminded of growing up with my sister, and feeling  seperated from family and society, like the two actors in this film, on a sort of journey thru blindness, to find your way home again.",

            "content": "I have watched many modern colorful and whimsical movies, looking back at the 1934 black and white movies, I thought I could not enter into the movie without patience, I did not expect to be immersed in the first act, feeling the characters of that era, walking in At the corner of that era, riding the traffic of that era, listening to the stories of that era. Although it was only a black-and-white picture, it seemed that I had returned to that calm era, and I could feel the green grass, the breeze blowing, and the beautiful wind at that time. After a careful taste, it is endless.At the beginning of the story, a stern and powerful father prevented her daughter Ellie from looking for true love. In this way, it seems that the father is the villain of the play. While avoiding her father 's eyes, Ellie went to New York to find his true love Wesley. At this time, in the car, I met the petty gentleman Pete who was in conflict with his boss. Pete's nature was naturally disgusted by the silly white sweet Allie. After learning from the newspaper that Ellie was the daughter of a wealthy businessman, she planned to exchange her exclusive interview with \"The Rich Woman's Courtship\", promising to send her to New York safely.In the car, Ally met greasy Shapley, who harassed Allie with a humorous conversation, and Pete's siege won him a lot of favors. Immediately after the bridge was broken, the two had to stay in a car hotel, and the embarrassed two stayed in the same house. The orphans and widows were in the same room. At this time, the gentleman 's Pete built the wall of Jericho (Jeligo, the ancient city of Jordan, a fortress with a hard wall. This city guarded the portal of Canaan. According to the Bible, the Israelite siege Walked for seven days, then blew the horn, and God destroyed the city wall with miracles, so that the Israeli army could easily enter Canaan.), Pete said that he had no horn, indicating that he would not step into Ellie 's territory, Ellie hesitated Fall asleep. At the same time, the rich businessman sat on the plane to New York and waited for Allie. With a sigh, he could hear that the rich businessman was worried about Allie's safety.As soon as the camera turned to the next day, the intimate Pete got up early to prepare bathrobe towels and breakfast for Allie who was still sleeping. Ali also completely put her guard down to Pete and began to talk to Pete like a tuberculosis. At this time, the rich business detectives came to find Ali, and the two acted in a tacit understanding to stage a double reed to deceive the detective, although Now it seems that this is a very fake period, but in the era when the aesthetics of the film is not high, it is a very exciting period.After getting on the bus and continuing the journey, Shapley saw the newspaper that the rich businessman rewarded Ellie for 10,000 US dollars. Here was another very exciting paragraph. Pete called Shapley to the woods, and the black and white light and shadow perfectly interpreted the male host ( I use \"male\" here because I want to praise Pete in the movie, and I want to praise Clark Gable outside the movie.) Excellent acting skills, a sharp turn of his eyes, a gaze, a frown, just like a fierce mafia in a suit. The two revealed their whereabouts and did not continue to ride in the car. They came to a manor to prepare for sleep. The experience of the day made them feel sorrow with each other. The gentleman 's Pete still did not do anything to the married woman, \"What are you thinking about?\" \"It's strange that I'm thinking of you.\" This ambiguous conversation made Allie smile sweetly. That's right, this is how it feels to fall in love with you.The next day, the two got on a ride to New York, and dog food continued along the way, but the owner was a thief. Pete grabbed the car and got his own car. At the same time, the anxious wealthy businessman finally compromised, preferring to let his daughter marry Wesley, and not wanting her daughter to have no news. During the conversation, Wesley was also like a person who refused to cancel the marriage contract for true love, but Wesley bowed his head and smiled but it was not. So what's going on.It 's only three hours to New York, but Ellie is going to stay at the hotel at this time, because the last night she was reluctant to Pete, people who have experienced all kinds of hardships, feelings naturally come faster, when Pete said his dream island , Allie couldn't help it, bypassing the wall of Jericho and crying out his feelings for Pete. This time Claude Cole White played very well, the feelings were brewing very real, from questioning to the chest ups and downs, Taking a deep breath and crying, it is very real step by step. Because of the husband's wife, hesitant Pete refused. Pete, who calmed down, regretted that he went out alone late at night and decided to get a thousand dollars before dawn to take Ellie away. Unexpectedly, Allie was awakened by the landlord in the middle of the night and rushed out of the hotel. Allie thought Pete ran away. She was frustrated and called her father to pick her up to marry Wesley. But with money, happy Pete, on the way to the hotel Seeing Ellie leaning on Wesley in the car to the distance was also discouraged, feeling that she was being played by Ellie, and there was a misunderstanding between the two from here.Before marriage, my father saw Ally 's heart and told Ally to go after true love. Afterwards, he asked Pete 's heart, and then supported her daughter to escape marriage. After seeing this, she realized that it was really a distressed one. Daughter's good father. Wesley spent 100,000 dollars on it. Finally, the sound of the horn sounded and the wall of the film Jericho fell and ended.The movie is called \"It Happened One Night\", but there is no true one-night romance. The hostess has a loved one while falling in love with another person, it can be said to be scum, it can also be said to pursue true love. The male lead Clark Gable is an actor I like very much. He is handsome and elegant, quite gentlemanly, but exudes evil spirits. I think Yapi is used to describe him. The completeness of the plot is very high. The reversal of his father's temper and the exposure of Wesley's nature all have their beginnings and ends. There is no intimate lens, which is also due to the promulgation of the Hayes Code, but it does not affect the plot.\"It Happened One Night\" can be said to be the originator of the out-of-school scholars with the rich family of thousands of types of love comedy movies. The status of the male and female protagonists often differ greatly. After a series of hardships, they eventually become dependents. Many films of later generations, including famous ones, have their shadows. The lines of the movie are also very classic and worthy of scrutiny,For example, \"Ellie: I don't like your name. Pete: It's okay, I can give it back tomorrow.\" The witty round field.For example, \"Ellie: What are you thinking? Pete: The strange thing is that I'm thinking of you.\" Beautiful romance.For example: \"Pete: I have seen a small island in the Pacific Ocean, and I still can't forget it. I want to take her there. He must be a woman who loves surfing like me. You know, sometimes you feel like moonlight and sea water. In one body, you feel that you have suddenly become so great. It would be better if you lived there. You felt that you could take off the stars. \"This passage not only cried Ellie, but also the people at that time.This movie was filmed during the Great Depression after the end of the economic crisis in 1933. At that time, the society was turbulent and poor. Such a beautiful and peaceful utopia can temporarily make them forget the suffering of reality. The film will naturally be liked by people at that time. To what extent I like it, there is a bridge section where the male owner undresses. At that time, people used to wear a shirt under the shirt. The male owner did not wear it for the convenience of shooting. The result directly affected the sales of American undershirts. The male owner was the trend at the time. In the center of the storm, the popular style on the street is the same style as the male owner. Later, the inspiration for the cartoon rabbit starling to eat radishes also came from the male owner leaning on the railing while cutting and eating while talking.At the beginning of that movie, \"It Happened One Night\" was the first person to eat a crab. The timeless classic can be imitated, surpassed, and cannot be replaced.",

            "content": "As part of my acquaintance with the Academy Award winners, I managed to watch an interesting, but rather predictable film \"It Happened one Night\" in 1934. The film collected five awards at once, including the Best film and the Best male and female roles. An illustrative aspect, however, after watching it, I was not delighted either with the performance of the main actors or with the picture itself. I wouldn't call the movie bad, but I didn't really like it.The picture will demonstrate a fairly formulaic plot for our time, where a rich girl runs away from piled-up problems and gets acquainted with a little lucky journalist who is in search of really worthwhile material, which will certainly help to improve the position of a man. The main characters are played by Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. Both are good in their roles, convincing, but it still seems to me that the couple got their Oscars only because there were no alternatives. I would not call their game outstanding.History is another matter. Even if it sometimes looks ridiculous and even affected, it cannot be taken away from the fact that it was this picture that gave rise to a whole direction of films, which is now commonly called roadmuvi. \"It happened one night\" in a peculiar way plays out various interesting moments that happen to the characters during their journey. The audience will then be able to see the same elements in many similar paintings, and an attentive moviegoer will surely understand that they were inspired by this Oscar-winning picture.Despite my reserved attitude to this work, I in no way detract from its merits to world cinema, on the contrary, I see in the film a lot of things that changed the aesthetics of cinema and inspired new paintings by other authors who successfully borrowed the concept of this film or its elements. The film came out average, not claiming to be a masterpiece, but it should not be forgotten that I, as a viewer of the 21st century, had already seen a lot of paintings before I got to this work. And that's why the film seemed like a kind of gray horse, a picture that you would hardly want to review again.5 out of 10.",

Colbert was an outstanding pre-Code Hollywood actress, and this movie, though it was made after the code was in place, shows some of the same vivacity she had in those earlier films which would later fade.  This is a classic that any movie buff shouldn't do without.  People praise Frank Capra for It's a Wonderful Life, and that praise is even more validated with this shorter, spunkier comedy.",

Many of the scenarios (the singing driver, the song on the bus, the fake-hitman scene) actually had me laughing 90 years after its release.

There's absolutely nothing about this which a modern film maker would do differently. The style of acting, the direction, the editing, the score are all perfect.Although the Frank Capra/Robert Riskin partnership is often remembered for their slightly later 'social commentary, little man against the world comedy dramas, this in my opinion is their crowing glory (I'm obviously excluding IT'S A WONERFUL LIFE of course since that is the best film ever!) Having unjustly not won the Oscar for their boss Harry Cohn the previous year with LADY FOR A DAY, the pair made sure they would this time by poaching the era's biggest stars, putting them in a wonderfully feel-good story and having them act like nobody has ever acted before.Although Claudette Colbert didn't want to make this, she is wonderful in this.

Not too many flicks can withstand the test of time, but I suppose the \"battle of the sexes\" genre that permeates \"It Happened One Night\" and the honest dialog that fills the script can still resonate with us (it does me)so many years later. It was made before Hollywood explored the dark side of life and so \"It Happened One Night\" does not tell you much about the grimmer aspects of the 1930's. It only briefly alludes to the joblessness and hunger that many people experienced (a woman faints on the bus, and there's a train full of hobos), and does not touch race relations during those years whatsoever. Instead, in no maudlin way, it seems to try to show that there is decency in everyone, from a hustling reporter looking for a scoop, to a rich heiress trying to find happiness in her own right. That they should find love in each other, despite their differences, is what makes the movie so hopeful. If that's too naive for some to stomach, the sophisticated humor in such scenes as the Walls Of Jericho and the donut dunking lesson, help ground the movie in some reality. \"It Happened One Night\" got the Oscar for Best Picture in 1934, and as far as I'm concerned, would deserve it again today.

Another unexpected accident came years later when legendary Warner Bros. animator Tex Avery told the story of how he came up with the idea for Bugs Bunny by watching Clark Gable eat carrots in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT! A sound man on the film later told Capra the story of how he over-heard Colbert complaining to Gable about making the film (she thought it her worst) and Gable defended Capra saying he Gable was having a blast and that Capra was on to something. Well they finished the film on time and it opened at Radio City Music Hall where it only played for one week. The reviews were good but mixed and the box office not as strong as Capra's previous movie LADY FOR A DAY. Then \u2013 it happened. Happened all over the country \u2013 not in one night, but within a month. People took longer to find the film, in the Midwest, in small towns, the word of mouth spread and surprise it was funnier, much funnier than usual. But, the biggest surprise of all, they could remember in detail a good deal of what went on in the film and they found everybody else did and that it was great fun talking about this and that scene. And let's go see it again and take the neighbors. The quietness burst into the proverbial prairie fire. Theaters sold out for weeks and weeks. Critics went back for a second look, a third, a fourth.Astonishingly enough, the news about It Happened One Night was not that it made Classic status but that it got made at all. Oh and buy the way it, was the first film to sweep all five of the major Academy Awards and the only one for 48 years! Colbert did not want to even attend the Oscars so she went in travelling clothes, seems she was leaving that night to go on that vacation she missed. So when her name was called she ran up grabbed the award, said thanks and dashed out the door only to STOP. Turn around. Go back up on to the stage to the microphone and added, \"I owe Frank Capra for this.\" Gable said the same. Meanwhile, my favorite director Mr. Frank R. Capra went on to have a wonderful life. I used to call him at his home on his birthday (he was in the phone book) to thank him for making this film, and then MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, LOST HORIZON, YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, MEET JOHN DOE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. I used to call him on my birthday too. I told him watching his films again, was my present to me.

There was not a minute where I was bored at all, and this, my lads, is a very good form of entertainment! Better than modern comedies, which follow many cliches. Not many were found in this film.

            "content": "107: It Happened One Night (1934) - released 2/22/1934, viewed 8/2/08.Alcatraz becomes a prison. The first Flash Gordon comic strip is published. BIRTHS: Hank Aaron. KEVIN: What can be said about this seminal rom-com classic that hasn't already been said? This is one of only a couple of 1934 releases that we've seen previously. When we first rented it, we watched it twice before sending it back, which was extremely rare at the time. Even then, I wasn't exactly sure why it merited a second viewing. One of the many things I like about this movie is how it's one of those classic films that was never designed to be a classic. There was nothing particularly out of the ordinary about its production, and yet the planets aligned just right so that the end result swept the major awards at the Oscars for the first time ever. Even when you watch the movie, you're not likely to find anything unusual or innovative about the story and the characters, except that they are all top-notch. Both Gable and Colbert take their potentially bland roles and breathe beautiful life into them. Gable's struggling journalist Peter is kind of a jerk on paper, and not just because he's exploiting Ellie for a story. He seems to want to bring Ellie down a notch and give her a humbling lesson about common folk that she'll never forget. He insults Ellie and her upbringing in nearly every scene. He tells Ellie's father (played by the excellent Walter Connolly) that what Ellie needs is \"a guy that'd take a sock at her once a day, whether it's coming to her or not.\" But Gable's likability and charisma make Peter's undeniable love for Ellie (in the context of all that outward disgust) feel honest and not a contradiction. How is that even possible? Peter creates something of a monster in Ellie, who exceeds his bitter expectations when she metamorphoses from a spoiled, shut-in heiress to a spunky and resourceful heroine (re: the limb is mightier than the thumb). Colbert hits just the right note to make Ellie likable and even at times relatable, yet never losing the sense that this is an upper-crust kind of girl. Then there's the chemistry, which crackles every moment they share the screen. These two probably bad-mouth each other more than they are ostensibly nice to one another, but the script drops in all those subtle hints that these two are really growing attached throughout their journey. The episodic storyline is perfectly paced. I don't think there is one scene that runs too long or too short in the entire film, and every character and subplot is paid off by the end. Frank Capra made a lot of perfect movies, and this one was the first of those.DOUG: 1934 begins with Frank Capra becoming an A-list director while giving birth to the screwball comedy with It Happened One Night. Not bad, Frank. What's with that title, though? It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm not going to bother summarizing the plot, so I'll just get straight to the review: When I first watched it some years ago, I thought Peter was a little too mean. I don't think that anymore (any girl with $2 her pocket who indulges in bus vendor snacks is in need of an escort), though he probably couldn't get away with some of the things he says or does today. The hitchhiking scene is my favorite, and not for the reason you think; It's Claudette Colbert's shining moment. After taking so much abuse from Peter, she finally gets to upstage him and make him look stupid. I can't believe this hasn't been remade a hundred times over. There's The Sure Thing, which follows the model, of course, but I'm surprised we haven't seen Hollywood do a literal remake, especially in this age of celebutante heiresses splashed all over the media. (Not that I'd want them to, mind you. It's just\u0085odd.) Although it became a huge hit and a motion picture classic, it's easy to see that IHON was designed as a small film.Last film viewed: One Hour With You (1932).

The development of their love is more linear than in any other film I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure that was intended. Regardless, it was perfectly executed in every respect; the writing, acting and direction.3). I'm not a big Gable fan typically, although I've always believed him to be an excellent actor. He's just young enough here to have a bit of boyish charm barely show thru the rugged exterior of his flawed, yet principled character. He really does a great job, no doubt, particularly when he's trying to hide the fact that he's been hurt.4). Claudette is gorgeous, vivacious, funny, and lovable. Her performance in this movie (one she was very reluctant to accept initially); ended up earning her the best actress Oscar, and deservingly so.5). It's a road trip movie. And those always keep the audience's attention better than anything else offered. I don't care if it's Sleazy Rider, Thelma and Louise, or Dumb & Dumber; road trip movies are more fun, that's a fact.Some other highlights include the controlling father, who changes his tune upon his daughter's eventual return. Unlike the love mentioned in item 2, above; his change wasn't linear. He became quite engaging upon seeing the change in his daughter, recognizing clearly she had fallen for someone other than her obnoxious fianc\u00e9. Also, reading between the lines, analyzing his lovelorn daughter toward the end, he took an immediate liking to (whomever the hell it was), she fell in love with.There are a few clever subtleties like that in this movie.Add in Alan Hale Sr., in a quasi-cameo role, driving his two hitchhikers nuts with his obnoxious singing.Finally, the ONLY reason this movie does not get a 10, is the ending. Not that it wasn't a happy one, but the writers (I'm guessing their responsible), not only needlessly gypped the audience out of the final scene where they get back together, BUT MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY as well. Heck, they actually failed to put in the climax of the movie. What the hell were they thinking? No faces, no dialogue, just an explicit (and goofy) suggestion that all was OK.I cannot elaborate on what could've (should've) been done here without making it a spoiler, but the possibilities were endless.Yes, I highly recommend. Furthermore, this movie is purchase worthy for your collection.ThxBob R.",

Gable was great in this movie-it reminded me a bit of Carey Grant in His Girl Friday-the cynical newspaperman who really just wants to get the story (and the girl).

            "content": "It Happened One Night is a great Classical film about society and the American Dream. While being a classical film, reusing old plot points and themes, it had a sense of realism as well, whether that be because of the realistic characters created, or the touchier subject matter. It differs greatly from the first film we watched Modern Times in it's message and it's approach.The message of this film seems to be \"If you put your head down and work hard, then you can get through anything.\" This message is very optimistic, and almost the opposite of Modern Times which was very pessimistic. This film is also a perfect example of Cinema offering an escape, it's not as subtle as Modern Times, but is still hidden under a comedy, so in essence people could see the film, and enjoy it without knowing the message. The message is very optimistic, through the message and characters it offered audiences a chance to hope when times were very tough.I would go so far as to say the whole film was an allegory for society and the American Dream, saying \"yes times are tough, but it will get better.\" The characters are relatable because they were imperfect, they weren't stereotypes, and they resembled the masses, which made the allegory all the more powerful. Audiences could see themselves in characters that would persevere and eventually succeed, further reinforcing that the film offered hope to the masses. Whether or not Capra knew we were closer to the end than the beginning than the end of the great depression is irrelevant, because films like this helped America get out of the great depression and redefined the American Dream. The impact arguably was this film, and others like it helped people be more comfortable being themselves as they were finally being represented in media, they weren't being told to be a stereotype anymore. The impact was both good and bad, as people began to be more comfortable being themselves, society became more open, and less judgemental, but things like divorce rates, and single parent families also rose. Whether or not the impact of this film is good or bad is totally subjective, but I would lean towards positive, because optimism is usually a good thing to give people. Looking at the advanced camera-work, lighting, the countless films it's inspired, along with the timelessness of the message, It Happened One Night may be the most influential films of all time. I know it sounds bold, but when one considers that it was a film unafraid to tell the masses \"be who you want to be,\" that's a message that people still haven't fully accepted today. It also helped redefine, and reinstate hope in the American dream, while offering audiences an escape. It's a very well-rounded film, and it is still present in society today.",

Several viewings on, I'm hooked \u2013 it seems almost incredible that it was made in 1934, not 1984 or 2004. There isn't a romantic comedy in existence, and never will be, that doesn't owe a debt to this film. It's funny, modern, charming, and meaningful about people \u2013 what more do you want? Colour? Ah, nuts.Clark Gable plays Peter, a cynical journalist who ends up on a road trip across a Depression-hit USA with runaway heiress Ellen (Claudette Colbert). Ellen's sheltered life has done nothing to prepare her for the trials that lie ahead. She's so certain that she knows what she wants, and what's best: she's naive, but sparky and intelligent. She has to be knocked down in order to have her eyes peeled open.* Some spoilers from here* I thought I knew all about Clark Gable, and wasn't that bothered, but here he radiates masterful alpha-male charm and can switch on a dime from comedy to a love scene, boyish vulnerability to hardboiled cynic and back again. I don't know which version of him I liked more, although I think my favourite mini-moment comes when he's hardboiling it for the telegram girl, pipe in mouth - Philip Marlowe if ever there was one.The script is full of wonderful details \u2013 I don't know how much was in the original short story but I get the impression a great deal must have been added in to make it funnier.

But best of all are the lessons Ellen has to learn. For all her wealth and snobbery, and for all we enjoy her gradual comeuppance, she shows she's capable of learning (finally being hungry enough to eat a raw carrot!), and is worthy of Peter's love. When, near the end, she's weepily describing to her father how poor Peter's opinion is of them both (\"you should hear what he says about you!\"), capping it off with \"\u0085he's marvellous\u0085(sob)\u0085\", you're right there with her.\"It happened one night\" is in danger of eclipsing William Powell's wonderful \"My Man Gordon\" as my favourite thirties film. It's revised my lazy opinion about Clark Gable too \u2013 but it won't make me like \"Gone with the Wind\" any better, I don't care what anyone says.",

After paying the author $5,000 for the rights, Capra spoke with his boss at Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately, the man in charge didn't think moviegoers were interested in a film about buses, so Capra changed the title. With that, \"It Happened One Night\" was born.In the movie, a wealthy businessman locks up his spoiled daughter to prevent an inappropriate marriage. However, she (Claudette Colbert) manages to escape, and tries to get from Florida to New York City by bus. On the trip, she meets a roguish reporter (Clark Gable) to whom she takes an instant dislike. Until romance starts to flower...In the '30s, Columbia was one of the smaller studios in Hollywood. They couldn't afford to keep their own roster of contract players, but instead borrowed stars from their bigger \"sisters\". MGM, in turn, used the loan-out system to Columbia as a way to punish their disobedient talents. That's how a tiny \"poverty-row\" studio could suddenly have the illustrious Clark Gable at their disposal.Frank Capra wanted Claudette Colbert in the female lead, but the actress declined because she'd already booked a skiing vacation. Only when Capra guaranteed that the shoot would be completed in time before her departure did she agree to the film. Colbert later wrote a letter to her agent describing \"It Happened One Night\" as one of the worst movies she'd ever appeared in.Fortunately, that was a judgment not shared by the Academy of Moving Pictures. When the Oscars were awarded that year, \"It Happened One Night\" became the first film to win in all five major categories. Best movie, best director, best actor, best actress and best writing.

MY favorite scene however, is when Claudette Colbert brings the cocky Gable down a peg or two and puts him in his place when she hails a cab with those nice gams of hers. He spends the rest of the trip down the highway sulking over how a woman beat him at his own game of hitchhiking. Well, it serves him right. Also, I want to punch (no, KICK) him right in the face whenever he dictates to how and what she spends her money on. The jerk obviously thought he owned her or something.

            "content": "At first, there was very little optimism for this film, as everyone was predicting that it was going to be a failure. In fact, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert tried several times over to quit the film. However, let's say that everyone turned out to be wrong in every sense, because the film did become a hit, and would ultimately become the first film to win the Top Five at the Academy Awards, and go on to become one of the finest comedies in all of cinematic history.It Happened One Night is wonderful and magical, it's a comedic delight that is still as funny and enjoyable now as it was back in 1934, it's perfect in every aspect. The performances are superb, the dialogue is sharp, and the humor is clever and witty. This film also proved to be a gamechanger in the cinema landscape, as it turned Columbia Pictures into a major studio, and it kicked off the screwball comedy genre, and contributed to the ascent of the careers of two of the most iconic actors of all time.In this screwball gem, director Frank Capra gives us a comedy that manages to be hilarious, while at the same time, showing a look at the classes during the Great Depression. Claudette Colbert stars as Ellie Andrews, a rather spoiled socialite who is on the yacht of her helicopter father, a banker named Alexander Andrews, who in turn, has annulled her marriage to an aviator named King Westley, to whom she was secretly married to. After escaping from the yacht, she eventually has a fateful encounter on a bus with a reporter by the name of Peter Warne, played by Clark Gable. After Ellie has her purse stolen at a bus stop, Peter coercers her into traveling with him. Along the way, Ellie finds herself falling in love with him. However, further complications arise from the fact that her father is concerned for her whereabouts, and has offered a $10,000 dollar reward for information about her.While he was known for being able to direct both comedic and dramatic films, Capra had a gift for comedy. He directs this film with the ability of a master, in which he brings out the best of the film in every way imaginable. As a result of his directing, the romance and comedy elements seem natural and don't feel forced or cliched, and the acting is stupendous. What makes the humor work is because of its style, it's a classic battle of the sexes that the audience can find themselves relating to. Without giving too much away, there are some scenes that will definitely have you laughing. One of the best moments involve a scene where Gable gives Colbert a lesson in dunking donuts, as well as a scene where he gives her a piggyback. However, one of my favorite moments is a scene involving hitchhiking. Colbert bests Gable by using a rather inventive method, instead of using her thumb, she shows some of her leg, which does cause a vehicle to stop, much to Gable's utter shock. Reiterating, the film is still funny because it doesn't try too hard to be, and the type of humor is something that, in some ways, the audience can find relatable.In regards to the acting, everyone did excellent work, but there is absolutely doubt that what made the film work was the combination of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. One would be hard pressed to find a better comedic couple than these two, because they were perfect in every single sense. Their back-and-forth quips are a pleasure to see, as they both match wits with one another, which is buoyed by the incredible chemistry that the two of them shared. It's no surprise that Gable's career was off and running after this film, because to say that he was sublime would be putting it lightly. As for Colbert, she's fortunate that what she said would be \"the worst film ever\" would end up making a bigger name for her as well, because she was also sublime. In fact, everyone was fortunate that this film ended up succeeding, because it ended up changing comedy, and Hollywood in the long run in more ways than one.It Happened One Night is one of those films that is bound to happen in more than just one night, meaning that it's one that people are probably going to be coming back to again and again. Since it's original release, the film retains all of its charm and brilliance. Ultimately, this film is a timeless classic that will remain one of the greatest comedies of all time, and probably one of the best films of all time, because this is a prime example of cinema at its absolute finest.",

When we first meet him he's drunk and he just gets fired, but he jumps on a bus and that moment will forever change his life.From that point begins this diamond of a movie. A screwball comedy but that doesn't dominate the show. Its light on all that and relies heavily on the charm of its script and the strength of its two leads. Absolutely terrific! It also happens to have one of the most entertaining bus rides ever! How joyous and merry that was!In the end its a movie about love, hoping to find the right person in your life to share a dream, having fun and being patient. When they say that chivalry doesn't exist anymore that's because it got left behind in the past when all these golden age classics were in their infancy. Here you see plenty of it in spades. Hollywood churned out alot of movies during the 30s 40s and 50s that involve alot of women or men not in love with their spouses and while its certainly bold and alarming at the same time it sure produced some of the best and well remembered movies ever made and this one is no exception. Frank Capra probably could have retired off this movie alone but he decided to go on and create more movie magic in the years to follow, what a career!If what you only know about this film are the memorable scenes (Walls of Jericho and the hitch hiking) and the oscar sweep I strongly encourage you to watch it. Its funny and loveable and plays out beautifully all at the same time. I didn't mention Claudette Colbert yet so I will now. She's a gem!SPOILER ** One of the only romantic movies I know of where the two leads never share one kiss on screen! That was the only shock and I had to point it out.",

His idealistic turn in Gone With The Wind does not compare to the likeability and strength of this great performance, for once the Academy Awards are consistent with that.\nI hate it when nostalgia promotes a pretty mediocre achievment from an unbiased 2 to a warm and fuzzy 1, there is none of that here anyway though, this is the old days when the guy didn't have to get down to it with the girl for them to realise they cared about each other and when the humour is about the people and good writing, it was the first of 3 flicks to snag all 5 of the major awards, Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay.This was also the very first road trip romantic comedy and one of the first romantic comedies. A great moment is Colbert falling to bits in the fake husband and wife scene as Gable yells \"quit balling\", or Gables little commentary about stopping cars. A good clean flick that you can watch more than once. Fans of Romance and Films should see this, be sure your among them.10/10",

The ridiculous, childish dialogs (except, of course, when it is about sex,), the multitude of goofs, mistakes, failures and, as a whole, a non-sense story plagued with out of time -humour? and mystical love, makes this one of the most disgusting movies in the history of cinema, to my taste.Now Clark Gable can be completely wasted, then perfectly sober one minute later, that's never been a problem in Capra's movies. Being drunk is funny, of course. Also the bus driver can be transformed into a different actor after a song has been sung, Is it a miracle? Is it a goof? This movie is SO bad, who cares any more?",

Well, luck is the residue of perspiration, or something like that. . .IHON is NOT the first \"screwball\" comedy. It is not a light, fluffy piece of \"Capra-corn.\" Nor is it a fairy tale.This unique and remarkable film stands alone like a Colossus astride converging worlds of film-making, unable to be categorized, refusing to fit into a formula.It is filled with reality: the scourge of the depression is never far away, the charm of ordinary people, in ordinary situations, making them far from ordinary. The ugliness of people, so easily drawn to crime of one kind or another, and the human spirit, resilient, flawed, stubborn, immature at times, and confused, lifting itself about all.**Spoiler** An excellent example of this (there are a multitude) is the singing of \"The Man on The Flying Trapeze\". A spontaneous celebration of humans sharing a common experience and musical language (long lost, tragically, today) which elevates them (if just for a moment) above the difficulties of their lives. How beautiful. Then, we are shocked back to a different reality with the passing out of the child's mother. This is quite disturbing and not the usual fodder of the so-called \"screwball\" comedy. No, it approaches the works of Chayefsky or Wilder, or rather, they approach this films juxtaposition of the tragic and the comic.As far as the performances, look--Gable is perfect. It is impossible to take one's eyes off him for a moment and I say this as a confirm heterosexual. Gable is MAN, child, Sage, and fool, wrapped up in Peter Warne, a complete and fully realized human character. Bringing him to life, Gable is brilliant. It may be the greatest (forgive me, Jack Lemmon) single comedic acting performance ever made. Gable. No wonder they called him, \"The King.\" Colbert is as well, as perfect, not a missed moment or note. She glides through the role as an ice skater warming up before an event, free and unencumbered, angry, vulnerable, phony, pure and wise. All can be seen in her visage and tone. What a performance.Roscoe Karns. Need I say more? I hope not. Perfect.Please note the absence of a soundtrack. None is necessary as the film provides its own, in its counterpoint of people of a multitude of melodic styles, faces, colors, attitudes (OH, yeah?!?!?), in its flight from fear to laughter, in its harmony of all these playing simultaneously. Who needs a soundtrack.Beautiful.Perfect.",

            "content": "It Happened One Night is a decidedly 'Capraesque' film that employs uplifting but stereotypical themes, which correlate with much of the prevalent conservative ideology in the United States during the 1930s. The film, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is undeniably charming but displays glaringly conventional views about class and gender relations in particular. Implementation of diegetic sound helps to advance rather than hinder the film by allowing for the portrayal of class status through accent and manner of speech. Colbert's Ellie represents the epitome of high breeding with her disaffected and skeptical drawl and careful enunciation. Peter's unrefined, blue collar accent and colorful slang help to mark him as having a lower socioeconomic status in contrast to Ellie, someone for the average American moviegoer to identify with. Another voice worthy of note was that of the only black man in the movie, a vendor selling food to the travelers at a bus stop, hollering in a stereotypically southern black accent, a holdover from plantation days. This character was clearly on the bottom rung of the social ladder in the scene, in a racially stereotypical presentation. While Wllie defied traditional norms by running away from her father to join her new husband, she was quickly 'rescued' and swept up by Peter. In this world, men appear to own or at least to make the decisions for Ellie, and she can't seem to help  but falling head over heels for the first two she meets outside of her sheltered life. In several scenes, newspaper headlines are superimposed with Ellie's picture, one even reading \"Ellen Andrews Escapes Father.\" This presents a rather disturbing image of Ellie being held captive by her father, and the legitimacy with which this is viewed by the public is akin to that of an escaped convict. Indeed, one of the only ways the sylph-like Ellie fought back against male oppression was through the use of 'hunger strikes' and, arguably, smoking cigarettes. I do not need to restate the implications of women wielding their power through food restriction, smoking, and sex (e.g. the hitchhiking scene), all of which convened during the 1920s, setting the scene for generations of women to come. One of the major recurring themes of the film was the 'walls of Jericho' that existed literally (through a rope and blanket) and metaphorically (through the lack of sexual contact) between Ellie an Peter. This 'wall' enforced the metaphor of a woman's body as a fort to be stormed, the first conqueror reaping the spoils. Indeed, even though Ellie was technically married, it was made quite clear that she was still a virgin, and thus the opportunity to marry Peter was still a viable one.",

I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I still laugh at that \"argument\".My other favorite moment of the movie is the \"Man On The Flying Trapeze\" sing along on the bus. I can't even really explain why I love that scene so much. Perhaps because it's so simple and joyful.I really enjoyed the character development in this film. I love watching Peter and Ellie start out as strangers who are pretty much disgusted with each other grow into two people who love each other. It takes place very subtly and is very sweet to watch. One reason why I love classic movies is because I enjoy seeing the sights and sounds of that era. This movie is no exception. I loved seeing all of the classic cars and even Colbert's wardrobe and hair were a treat. While it wasn't the most flattering look, I'm sure it's very true to what was considered high fashion in the mid 1930's.

Any classic movie lover would be hard-pressed to deny the charm of this film. As enjoyable as any of Capra's best, I Happened One Night is one of those rare films that is a joy to watch, simply for its entertainment value. Clark Gable stars as Peter Worne, a hard-nosed reporter, who just got the pink slip from his job when he runs into Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews. Having run away from her father, Ellie is trying to get to New York to be with her husband, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Smelling a story, Worne decides it may be best for both of them to stick together for a while. What the newsman doesn't count on is that he may see more to Ellie than what he had counted on. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play off of each other wonderfully throughout the movie, displaying a the chemistry between stars that makes a movie a classic. The achievements of the Capra and company did not go unnoticed during Oscar season, either. It Happened One Night made Oscar history as being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards, a feat that would not occur again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it in 1975. Aside from winning Best Picture, the film also took in Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin).

It's a competently made film with good production design and solid actors working on it. But the rotten core of this film is with its two main characters and how they unnecessarily complicate the story. The movie has actually had a pretty good setup as a woman, Ellen played by Claudette Colbert, betrothed to a king runs from her father to be with her fianc\u00e9. Upon going bus to bus to get there, she meets Clark Gable's character named Peter who's an egotistical, newspaper man. At first their chemistry is fun. But where this movie really started rubbing me the wrong way is how controlling Peter is towards Claudette. I get it, it's old-fashioned but with the demeanor Gable gives the character, it feels unhealthy. She doesn't seem to enjoy it either, nor does she hint or explicitly say so. For a character that made an active decision in escaping from her father, she doesn't play an active role through nearly the rest of the movie. Like I said, Peter takes her and pretty much dictates all her actions their on till a certain point til' the end. Their chemistry mainly involves them being snappy with each other. I felt no amount of dialogue or character actions made me learn anything new or significant about these characters. Therefore, I struggled to make a connection with them. Plus, there are many problems in the story that felt very contrived and forced (especially towards the end). So many of these problems feel like they can be solved with simple character dialogue. And I understand many of these tropes are very garnered to old styles of film. But considering the vast amounts of movies that do a far better job capturing romance, this movie only shows how much we've gotten better at it. If you can deal with these tropes, all power to you. I just could not stand it and it really was killing my patience.Overall, this movie has a great actors, good production design, but it severely lacks in the character/character department and it severely suffers from that. Especially with these obnoxious tropes instilled into it. I'm giving this one a 3 out of 10...",

While she's asleep Peter leaves and goes to NYC to to write up a story about their affair for $1,000 with the plan of driving back to Ellie so he can propose to her. Ellie gets woken up early and thinks that Peter ditched her, so she calls her dad and King Westley to come get her. Peter returns to the cabin to see that Ellie is gone and believes he also got rejected. Ellie tells her dad about Peter and her dad calls Peter her to have a meeting about the $10,000 reward, Peter doesn't accept it tells him that he loves his daughter. On the day of the wedding the father and Ellie are walking down the isle and the father tells her everything Peter has said to him during the meeting and that if she wants to bail out of this wedding and go to Peter, there will be a car ready for her to drive away in. Ellie waits then dashed away and into the car to drive to Peter. Overall this was a great love story and the story line/writing was tremendous and it does a good job leading up to the climax, especially the part when Peter leaves and she thinks he ditched her. This is a well thought out film",

What I enjoy a lot is seeing these older movies and there story lines compared to todays rom coms, and how they inspired todays movies. It Happened One Night follows a spoiled heiress and a reporter who found her as she was running away from her father. They make a deal, she will give him the story of her if he gets her to New York. The story is fun and playful and you are constantly routing for this unlikely couple. They are continuously getting themselves into, and some how out of, these hilarious situations on their travels. Whether it be them escaping from detectives or the two of them hitchhiking, but what makes these scenes so fun to watch is their crazy and flirtatious ways out. The chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is undeniable which makes the movie so entertaining. The movie is still relatable and enjoyable to watch today, I would recommend this movie to any of friends, and if you haven't seen it either, well make it happen one night!",

            "content": "It Happened One Night (1934; director: Frank Capra), is a wonderful romantic comedy, meant to delight the audience with romance, grandeur, and Clark Gable's charming wit. It Happened One Night is the story of two people from opposing backgrounds having an unlikely meeting on a bus, and how it snowballs into something much more. Claudette Colbert's character Ellie Andrews is fleeing to her husband in New York whom her powerfully wealthy father doesn't approve of, and although she is trying to evade her father's scouts, she is a bit drunk on the idea of finally being on her own. The runaway heiress runs into Peter Warne, Clark Gable's character, who only a few minutes prior to bumping into her had been fired from his job as a reporter (although he pretends that it was he who quit) and needs a story (such as one involving a spoiled heiress throwing a tantrum). They immediately take a disliking to each other, but grow close as they must depend upon each other to reach their separate goals. It's truly very amusing, and the plot's simplicity doesn't affect that, but rather, makes it sweeter. Like with the form of the film, it's better to leave well enough alone and enjoy what it is: an \"aww\"-type rom-com. It's meant to make the audience feel warm and fuzzy, and maybe like they could be in a situation like it; one where they find true love over the course of a couple of nights of adventure. Trying to pick out a specific meaning for the big picture only leads to testing generic sort of phrases and realizing they all fit the plot; \"Sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you find it\", \"opposites attract\" or really anything other clich\u00e9d tagline can be applied to this plot, but to give it credit, It Happened One Night was perhaps the first popular romantic comedy with sound in U.S. cinematic history, so it can't really be clich\u00e9d when the clich\u00e9s are of it. The only real symbolism is the \"walls of Jericho\", which is a blanket folded over a string that Peter put up to separate he and Ellie, which at the very end after their elopement is shown to drop to the floor.The cinematography of It Happened One Night is unsatisfyingly dull. The plot is certainly cute and amusing enough to keep the film enjoyable overall, but the camera doesn't perform anything special to layer it. Being charmed by this classic screwball film is only achieved if you resolve not to look for any interesting type of camera directing. The audience just wants to feel a part of the story and live it out happy ending and all, so the form seems to have been something that was dropped in priority to what is now considered sitcom level. Even the music isn't remarkable. In fact, the only time I noticed it was in the wedding scene that plays Mendelssohn's traditional Wedding March. The acting, however, is wonderful, most notably Clark Gable's, whose charm makes the film what it is. I loved it, myself... but I am a sucker for a good rom-com.",

            "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" is a nearly timeless classic and probably the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Claudette Colbert plays Ellen Andrews, the wealthy daughter from a wealthy family. She's recently married and her father is trying to keep her from her \"love\". She escapes her father and is determined to get to her husband, King Wesley. Clark Gable plays Peter Warne, a down and out newspaper reporter who has the story of his life fall into his lap (literally). Peter Warne is determined to salvage his newspaper career by getting Andrews back to her husband. Neither he nor Ellen Andrews have any money, so they have to make it across the country on the cheap. As they travel it becomes clear that they are falling in love with each other--- both both Gable and Colbert play their roles perfectly. Falling in love and not wanting to fall in love---because Ellen Andrews is already married---and Peter Warne is only in it for the money that the story will bring him. In all romantic comedies the end is never really in doubt, however the twists that this story takes make it an adventure. The film is incredibly uplifting and fun---the hallmark of a Frank Capra film. This film has inspired many other romantic comedies (such as the \"The Sure Thing\" and \"Runaway Bride\" to name a couple). However, this is the real deal. It appeals to audiences of all ages and is timeless. If you haven't watched it before you are missing a masterpiece.",

Detracting from my hatred a bit, however, is some very nice cinematography as well as some interesting and neat ways of incorporating the Great Depression setting without detracting from the main story. Some of the jokes landed quite nicely although most of them were either too dated or portrayed with too much hammy acting to get a laugh or even a chuckle. I'd give it a 4.5/10 as well as a sticker of essential American Cinema since I now know the origin of about a dozen running gags in current film and television.",

She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down- on-his luck reporter Peter Warne, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and \"Westley,\" the weasel husband she married in haste who is only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the Oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! When they find themselves stranded off the road, Peter teaches \"Brat\" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking. It is a classic scene, as he fails miserably until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! \"It happened one Night\" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated so many famous scenes from \"It Happened One Night.\" With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds;\"the walls of Jericho.\" This is another classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellies' father, close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. \"It Happened One Night\" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture. It should be part of everyone's movie collection. 80 years after it's release, \"It Happened One Night\" is still fresh, funny and the ultimate screwball comedy!",

            "content": "Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. This film, more than any other film of the time before, made comedy classy and personable. It has genuine heart, skillful gags that have no need for pies or extravagant slapstick, and intelligently written characters who are along for a ride, literally and figuratively. It is one of my favorite comedies and my goal for this post is to renew interest in my readers who have already seen it and ignite a curiosity in those who haven't experienced the joy of viewing it for the first time.For those unfortunate ones who haven't yet seen Frank Capra's master work, or simply those who have forgotten its plot, here are the basics. 'Ellie' Andrews, the irresistible Claudette Colbert, is a young socialite from Miami who is bored with her smothering father. She impulsively marries a fortune hunting heel of a man which infuriates her father. She rebelliously runs away and determines to meet her husband in New York, traveling by Greyhound bus. On board, she makes the acquaintance of recently laid-off reporter Peter Warne, the ever charming Clark Gable, who within hours deduces her identity and makes her an offer. She'll allow him exclusive story rights to cover her journey to reunite with her love and he won't tell her daddy where she is. The rest of the movie is a wagon-load of shenanigans that the two of them get into on the bus, off the bus, on the road, in the wilderness, and in the process of multiple overnight rooms. This movie was the boasted favorite of Friz Freleng, one of the pioneers of the Looney Tunes and you can see why. The gags and dialogue are snappy and always effective, all the actors are in rare form, and the story moves at a brisk, yet leisurely pace to compliment the sometimes leisurely, sometimes chaotic journey these two share. Why don't I own this one yet?! Time and generational gaps have unfortunately given It Happened One Night the label of an \"old movie\", something an unfortunate number of youth today will go out of their way to avoid, which saddens me. I am as much a proponent of classic film as Scorsese or Roger Ebert, and that does not make me old. That makes me educated in a certain regard to history. It Happened One Night was the first of only three films thus-far in American film history to win the Big Five Oscars: Best Picture, Screenplay, Director, Actor, and Actress. This movie is a time capsule of how it was in the Depression on the road. I would rather watch this movie than another time capsule of the Depression-era, John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, since this movie is nothing but lighthearted fun from start to finish. Grapes of Wrath is so heavy-handed and sappy, that it tends to make Paul Haggis' Crash look subtle and that movie could hardly have been less subtle.This film is a bundle of joy wrapped in caustic lunacy with love from one of America's prime comedic directors, Frank Capra, whom most would remember as the maker of 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the public domain classic It's a Wonderful Life. If you're interested in seeing more from super-zany Capra rather than soapbox, melodramatic Capra, look for 1938 Best Picture Winner You Can't Take it with You. This movie is begging to be watched, so do It Happened One Night a favor, and give it a look. I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed.Final Rating: 5/5 Practically Perfect in Every Way",

She meets smart-mouthed reporter Peter Warne (Gable) en route and the antics continue as they mutually reply on each other to get to New York despite their differences.After Ellie Andrews escapes the clutches of her father (Connolly) and tries to make her own way to New York, we get to enjoy seeing her experience such foreign concepts as budgeting, being alone with a man and sleeping rough...mostly done with her upper-class charm, bar the odd tantrum.Rogue reporter Peter Warne, not wanting to miss a chance to get his job back, blackmails her into letting him tag along. Their relationship develops and varies between friends and enemies as they remain stuck with each other. Peter fails to hitch a ride with his thumb so Ellie hilariously hitches one using her leg, a scene mimicked in the Laurel and Hardy classic Way Out West when Stan does the same thing.It was a non-stop film and plenty of fun to watch, though the acting was over the top in places among some of the supporting cast. The atmosphere on the bus was well done with a very entertaining rendition of The Man on the Flying Trapeze.Said to have inspired several Looney Tunes characters, the film thrives on the combination of the naivety of Ellie and the life experience of the more happy-go-lucky Warne as an unlikely love triangle begins to form and plenty of hilarity ensues. It is a little predictable like many rom-coms, though perhaps in the day they kept the audience guessing!

This is one of my favorite movies and one of few I ever give a flat out A plus to, wishing there was a higher rating. It's terribly witty and perhaps--its only flaw--overwhelmingly wonderful.  Frank Capra is at his best as are Colbert and Gable (who was borrowed from another producer and almost not in it at all).  The chemistry between Colbert and Gable is outstanding, they have wit down to a long forgotten art most romances lack today.  Very famous scenes will stay with you--shouldn't say which--and especially for the moviegoer, should and must. If you haven't seen this movie, this should be one of the next on your list.  I always will suggest this movie and biasly will get p*ssed off if someone has never seen it, its just that amazing.

After all, we 21st-century audience have long been used to the rich-girl-falls-in-love-with-poor -guy clich\u00e9, and I doubt whether they could really live happily thereafter.It Happened One Night is about an odyssey of Ellen. She embarks on a quite unusual journey: from the big old house of her dad's to the equivalent of her lover. En route, she has to combat poverty, starvation and prying eyes. Stripped of wealth that she lived upon, the rich heiress has a taste of the common people lives. She has has to share a cabin with a man, to wait in line to use an outdoor bathroom and to go across a river only to enjoy a sweet night on the grass. She is as if misplaced into a realist cartoon by discontented artists delineating desperate women and children. She disguises as a siren to stop a passer-by. In the end, Ellen learns not only to eat row carrots out of hunger but also what a good man looks like. She presumes she wants to spend her life with her fellow traveler, instead of her father or her ex-lover who now join forces to welcome her home. Like Odysseus, there is a fight awaits Ellen after she arrives home.In Ford's fairy tale, capitalists are actually benevolent human beings, and a cynical journalist and a spoiled heiress can bridge the gap between social status. In this sense, It Happened One Night is love letter to liberal democracy. Mystically, the common audience enjoy it as well. With Peter's telegram not revealed to the general public, we the audience become the few people that have the privilege to peek at their adventure and love story. What is an odyssey for Ellen is a getaway for Peter and for us, in which we make funny jokes about social inequality and bourgeoisie value. It is, after all, a very healing journey.",

            "content": "For those of you who have been keeping track of my Best Picture retrospective, Hollywood movies had been heading towards a downward spiral since adapting the then-gimmick of talking pictures, and most of the previous BP winners were really lackluster (particularly Cavalcade). This film helped save talkie pictures and audible performances, and helped put Director Frank Capra, as well as stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert on the map. With that aside, I never really thought it was that funny.Don't get me wrong; it has its place in cinematic history, and it is an important step in the branching path in the evolution of cinema as an art form. But I never particularly found that much to be funny about this movie, and while it is subjective, the film is a Comedy, and humor is a key element of any given Comedy. There are a few scenes that worked though, particularly the hitchhiking scene. Essentially, Clark Gable was trying to hitch a ride for him and Claudette Colbert to this large group of cars driving by, and Gable tries everything in the book to signal them, and they all ignore them. And then when Colbert gives it a try to another passerby, she shows off her bare leg to him, and he stops and picks them up. There's more that follows later in that scene, but I don't want to spoil the rest because it is a pretty ridiculous series of events.Speaking of spoiling the movie, what is it about? Well, Claudette Colbert is a spoiled, rotten little rich girl named Ellie Andrews that runs away from a wedding to a rich aristocrat and goes out on a ram. Meanwhile, Clark Gable is second-rate reporter Peter Warne that found himself out of work due to the lack of news stories. The two cross paths as passengers on a bus, and he recognizes her because her escapade made headlines (a Frank Capra trademark; absurd news headlines). Unfortunately for her, Ellie loses all of her money and possessions, and is forced to stick with Peter. Seizing the opportunity, he makes a deal with her: he gets to escort her cross country so that she makes a new life for herself, and he gets to chronicle her escapade in detail. To avoid life broke and on the streets, she agrees, and high jinks ensue.Now, let me be frank; while I do not consider this film to be that funny, I still enjoy this movie a great deal. There is a reason why this film works so well: A blend of witty writing, direction that takes full advantage of the medium, and the excellent chemistry between Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, audible or otherwise. In fact, back then, not only did this film set the record for most Oscars ever won, sweep or otherwise, but it was the first of only 3 films to have won The Oscar Grand Slam: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Adapted or Original), Best Actor, and Best Actress; and it shows.Now if there is one thing to gripe about this game, it is essentially what spawns all the common Romantic Comedy clich\u00e9s, particularly the bad ones; they start off not getting along, they eventually start developing feelings for one another, a misunderstanding occurs, they go their separate ways hating each other, and then a friend convinces them to return to one another, and it usually ends at an airport (not this movie) where they fall in love again, get married, and live happily ever after.This film though did it much better than almost all of these other movies, because it was new at the time, and it was actually believable; some contrivances here and there, but mainly for comedic effect. They didn't hate each other when they first met; they simply teased each other. They develop a relationship with one another, but we can actually believe it. There's a misunderstanding involved, but they didn't hate each other for a while. Peter ran off to go publish his story in the city and to buy an engagement ring, while at the same time, the hotel owner recognized Ellie from the earlier headlines, and called the police while he was gone. For a while, neither of them were happy, but that was because they were missing each other's presence and not fully aware of it. They both had friends that convinced them to run off again, reunite together and, a recurring gag that bears symbolic relevance, take down the curtains.Overall, even though it introduced a dangerous number of bad RomCom clich\u00e9s, I will not count it against this film as what followed is irrelevant to the qualities of this film. Besides, I think the positive legacies of this film easily outweigh the negative. Still, I wish this game was a little bit funnier, but I'll let it slide a bit. With that said, unless you really hate Frank Capra, I highly recommend this film to anybody. I'll give this film 8.5 out of 10, rounding it up to 9 out of 10.",

The strength of this movie other than its sharp plot lies in the sizzling chemistry between the two lead stars . Gable and Colbert simply glow every time they appear on screen together. The simple plot of a spoiled runaway girl who befriends and eventually falls for a smart mouth reporter while ironically riding on a bus trip to meet the man whom she thinks she loves is pure genius. The old clich\u00e9 is very apt over here and it can truly be said that they don't make em like they used to. All in all a classic movie and deserves its place at no 35 on the AFI list of the greatest movies of all time.",

It Happened One Night became the first of these iconic movies as it swept the Academy Awards of 1935.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert as Peter Warne and Ellen Andrews take us on a breathtaking journey across the United States with so many cheeky escapades and good-natured wisecracks that the 2 hour runtime simply flies by. Screwball comedy is the name of the game, personified by the lively, charming Peter with a few punchlines from his flirtatious partner in crime as they outrun (or rather outsmart) a nationwide manhunt. Romance, lurking subtly in the background for most of the movie, takes centre-stage as the story draws to its delightful conclusion.The acting awards were well deserved, with both leads bringing their characters to life with refreshing authenticity and although the prim dialogue seems a little off to the modern viewer, it lends a true old-timer feel to the story. The plot is pretty straightforward, which is appropriate for a comedy and the cinematography offers everything you could expect from a movie produced almost 90 years ago.Rumoured to be the inspiration behind the now legendary Bugs Bunny, IHON is the adored great grandpa of rom-coms, the sublime origin of most cliches we see in the genre today.",

Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert have great on-screen chemistry and do a fine job of making their characters and their relationship believable and engaging.Gable and Colbert are helped by the film's screenplay. The story is simple but it provides a great opportunity for these characters to be fleshed out and their relationship to be explored. The film established several tropes common in romcoms today but the characters and dialogue are well written enough to prevent the film from feeling clich\u00e9d or dated. It did take me a little while to get into the rhythm of the film and feel invested but by the end I was rooting and cheering for the lead duo.The film is also well shot. This shot - http://pre-code.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/ItHappenedOneNight2.png - from the beginning of the film took me by surprise. It was a pleasant surprise. It feels rather modern for a film from the '30s. Most shots from the 30's tend to be wide shots that capture a good chunk of a scene. This applies to 'It Happened One Night' as well and it is not a complaint. They give scenes or conversations a kind of flow that makes it seem more natural. It is a nice change of pace from what we're used to today.Overall, this is a pleasant and engaging film with two well-developed characters played by two well cast and charismatic actors. I wasn't amazed but I would happily revisit it in the future.",

Decades later, the film still feels fresh, has lost none of its charm and is a pleasure to watch.After the opening credits (accompanied by some appealing theme music), we are introduced to Claudette Colbert's character of Ellie Andrews. She has locked herself in her room on a boat which belongs to her over-bearing father. He is threatening to annul her very recent marriage to 'King' Westley because he disapproves of him. After an argument develops, she jumps ship and swims for the shore, with the intent of going straight to New York to meet up with her new husband. While taking a bus trip to reach her destination, she encounters Peter Warne (played by Clark Gable), a newspaper reporter who eventually recognises her after seeing a front page story of her as a runaway. After he threatens to turn her in unless she stays with him in order to give him headline news, she reluctantly makes the cross country trip with him. Things don't always go to plan, which allow some humorous scenes, and there is an attraction that develops between the two. The question then, is who will she end up with by the time the film ends?This is a film which deserves its status. Not only is it a wonderful, feel-good movie, it is great in all aspects of cinema, and has hardly dated a bit. The films energy and performances from all the cast keep the film from feeling stale, even after more than 70 years. The script is cleverly written with some truly laugh-out-loud moments. What makes this film even more remarkable, is the fact that few people involved in it, with the exception of Frank Capra, had much faith in it. Even the stars of the film, particularly Claudette Colbert, were unenthusiastic to say the least. Thankfully though, the film turned out incredibly well.'It Happened One Night' also has a place in cinematic history for being the first film to win all 5 Oscars in the main categories, an achievement that was not equalled until 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest'. Some viewers today remark at how unlikely it would be for a romantic comedy these days to receive such an honour. That being said, it's not a film that is going to be forgotten any time soon, and it certainly should be seen.",

It stars Clark Gable (Gone With the Wind, The Misfits, Mutiny on the Bounty) and Claudette Colbert (Since You Went Away, The Palm Beach Story, Drums Along the Mohawk).It Happened One Night is about a rich spoiled girl who runs away from all of the wealth and meets an out of work newspaper writer and they hitchhike to New York City together and on the way there, they just might find love. This film was one of the pioneers of the screwball comedy genre. So when the Robert Riskin was writing this script, I'm sure he had no idea of the impact this would have on the world. Ever since this film, the formula has been copied over and over again. Even now, this has the classic rom-com formula.The acting in this movie is great. The chemistry between Gable and Colbert is impeccable. Sure Gable's character Peter might be a little of his time (with all the talk of beating Colbert's character Ellie). They still work very well together. Colbert also gives a good performance as the rich girl who just wants to get away from it all. They both won Oscars for their performances.While a good movie, we have all seen this before: two people with conflicting personalities don't like each other in the start, but of course fall in love in the end. But then I remind myself that this is the first movie to do that. In conclusion this is a very funny movie that has a lot of heart.",

The woman was in need of getting to her husband and the man was in need of getting his job back. The two found each other and decided that they could use one another to seek their goals, but instead, they fell in love with each other. Throughout this film, there were many different camera angles taken which made the film more realistic.  A majority of the film was shot through the view of a moving vehicle.  The angles differed from time to time depending on what type of vehicle the main characters were in.  When the characters were in a regular car, the camera was straight in front of them and would not move from side to side as if the camera was on the hood as they were moving down the road.  Although, what was really happening was that the car wasn't moving.  There was a screen behind the vehicle with film already on it making it look like the car was moving and then another camera was filming the whole thing. When the characters were on a bus, the only other vehicle they were in, had many different angles portraying the couple.  There would be angles shot from the front of the bus which would shot in close and out far on the characters, where in the car scenes the shot would stay at a certain distance.  The camera would also shot angles from the side of the bus as if looking through the window.  There were a couple of instances when you could tell that the bus wasn't really moving when they were filming from the side of it because there would be some distance from the character, who was against the window, and the actual window or the side of the bus. The camera shot different angles on the characters even when they were not in a moving situation.  Most of the camera angles stayed back far enough so that you could see both characters in it.  It would single out the characters once and a while when they had something meaning say and the film wanted you to hear it.  The camera would also single out characters when they were expressing emotion.  The camera angle would get in nice and close to the characters face in those situations, especially when the woman was crying, this way you could actually see her tears and get the full effect.",

            "content": "\"It Happened One Night\" might seem to be a simple romantic comedy at first glance. A romantic comedy it is, but I can see how it could have won the Academy Award in the 1930's.One Night contains the affluent fantasy of many 1930's films. To the many audience members to whom even the price of a movie ticket had to be a carefully thought out luxurious expense, the typical 1930's film world of mansions, diamonds, gowns, tuxedos, song, dance, and anything you want a mere checkbook scribble away, had a fantastic appeal.One Night gives us that world in the form of movie bookend. Ellen (Claudette Colbert) leaves that world in a rebellious attempt to marry a man who is in reality only after her money. Finding herself in a strange world without her wealth to protect her, Ellen is vulnerable to thieves, con artists, and her own inability to stretch her meager resources. Along comes Clark Gable, whose ability to stand up to her and show her *husbandry* (get it?) allows her to make it to New York without Daddy's detectives or other baddies intervening. To a 1930's audience that no doubt knew how to stretch a dollar (and probably had to every day) the Gable's character's husbandry must have been a source of pride: the rich aren't so great\u2014they are helpless to cope with the problems we common folk face every day.Peter Warne (Clark Gable) although befriending Ellen in order to collect a reward and get a great news story, ends up with neither, only insisting that Ellen's father pay the $39.60 in expenses he incurred in bringing Ellen home. \"Love Triumphant\" is the headline as Ellen arrives home, and it is so in this movie, for by the end Warne does not value money, only Ellen's love. Again a triumph of the common folk.Surprisingly, even Ellen's father values love over money, hoping Ellen will choose Peter over King, even though the latter's own considerable wealth would be enhanced in terms of what Ellen would inherit. Even he would rather a poor newspaperman for a son-in-law that loves his daughter than a millionaire that doesn't love her.",

The other two are When Harry Met Sally...(1989) and Monsoon Wedding (2001). After finishing this one, it's easy to see why this was first on the list.It Happened One Night tells the story of Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of wealthy Wall Street man Alexander Andrews (Walter Connolly), who is marrying aviator King Westley (Jameson Thomas) out of rebellion, and can no longer bear for her life to be planned out for her and constantly be told what to do. So she literally jumps ship from her father's boat in Miami and heads for New York in pursuit of Her soon-to-be husband Westley. On the bus there she gets stuck next to wisecracking New York newspaper man Peter Warne (Clarke Gable). Meanwhile Mr. Andrews is using everything at his disposal to find his daughter, including but not limited to a reward in the newspapers offering $10,000 to anyone with information on her whereabouts. Once Peter sees Ellie's wit and finds out who she is, he sees a great opportunity for himself. He offers to help the charming yet na\u00efve Ellie get to New York without getting stopped in exchange for exclusive rights for her story. The film then takes us on the journey of them discovering that they love each other, despite the slightly testy nature of their initial relationship.With a powerhouse director like Frank Capra, it's no wonder why this film turned out as well as it did. In fact, it is the first film to ever win the \"big 5\" at the Academy Awards, which consists of the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Actor, and Best Actress awards. The only other films to accomplish this feat were One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991).This film, as far as I know, established the blueprint for the modern Romantic Comedy, which it also deserves tremendous credit for. As for my personal opinion, I think this very enjoyable watch that maintained my attention throughout most of the runtime, and while it isn't perfect, or even my favorite film from the 30's, it's still an undeniable old Hollywood classic.",

Half of me (the more liberal intellectual half, of course) had to cringe at half the lines in this movie, but the other half (the testosterone driven knee-jerk 'rather mannish' half, of course) couldn't help but get a kick out of the dialogue.  I have to admit, when Peter spanked Ellie, I laughed myself half way out of my seat.  It's the kind of scene that makes you scratch yourself and belch, thinking, \"God it's good to be a man.\" The film is definitely worth seeing, if you can manage to put down all your opinions on the patriarchical phalocentric reification of normative gender rolls and pre-feminist social structure and values.  Well.. it's good for a couple laughs, at least.  I agree, though, with some of the other postings here that this isn't Capra's best work.  I prefer the slightly more world-wise Capra-courtship that we find in films like 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and others.  Still, it's worth watching, and it lends itself well to at least some analysis.",

            "content": "A Hollywood classic comedy starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. This film has never lost its charm and appeal even after 65 years. Rich Heiress Ellen Andrews (Colbert) runs away from father to be with husband and meets Peter Warren (Gable) on a bus trip from Florida to NY. Gable's rough tough demeanor makes it hard to believe that the two can fall in love but that is just what happens. The classic Walls of Jericho motor court scenes and Gables explanation of how he undresses are superb. The best scene is Gable trying to hitchhike a ride after explaining to Colbert that it's an art and he knows so much about it that he should write a book on it. Of course, he fails to get anyone to stop. Colbert gives it a try and what you see is her pulling up her skirt and revealing a beautiful leg shot which immediately stops a car which is driven by the great character actor Alan Hale. The scene near the end of the movie which has Gable asking Mr Andrews for payment on his expenses and whether or not Gable is in love with Colbert is hilarious. Characterizations are solid (Oscar Shapely, King Wesley) dialogue is crisp, plot line is hilarious. A truly great comedy classic.",

            "content": "A screwball masterpiece. The story tells of rich heiress, Ellen Andrews (Colbert), running away from her father to reunite with King Westley (Jameson Thomas), who had eloped with her. On the way to New York, she runs into snappy reporter, Peter Warne (Gable), who had recently lost his job. After recognizing her, he agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story. Hilarity soon ensues as the two undergoes a series of (mis)adventures on the way to New York.A pioneering masterpiece and all-time classic. This movie still holds up greatly and is still a fun one to watch every now and then, even after many-many years and many-many rom-coms and road movies later. If many scenes and scenarios seem familiar, it's because this movie is seen as the pioneer and blueprint to many concepts, tropes, and scenes often found in rom-coms or road movies of the romantic persuasion. Putting aside the blueprint aspect, there is still a lot to be discovered with this movie. The chemistry between the two leads is absolutely brilliant. The story itself is tight and very entertaining featuring lots of great scenes as the duo make their way to New York featuring many misadventures and hilarious occurrences, all the while we see them get closer and closer to each other with every passing mile, also present is fast-paced, clever dialogue (mostly courtesy of Mr. Gable). There is also no shortage of great supporting characters, from fellow bus passengers to motel owners bring their own charm to the movie. Not to mention an abundance of classic scenes. All of this is then wrapped up in a quite satisfying end that'll leave viewers smiling after tagging along in this adventure. All in all, this classic movie is an absolute must watch, even if you're not a fan of romantic comedies or road movies.",

            "content": "Director Frank Capra (It's A Wonderful Life) delivers another top notch film that has a really simple storyline. It is basically a 1930s rom com! Setting the template for the genre for decades. Its stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert form an unlikely couple. Colbert a spoilt brat heiress about to marry someone in New York. Gable a failing newspaper reporter who needs a scoop to boost his flagging career. In an era before interstate air travel the pair travel from Miami, Florida to New York via a nightbus and several stops en route. Its interesting how simple life seemed in the depression era U.S. in this film. No freeways with thousands of cars hurtling past! Just quiet backroads with the occassional car. The film is an early road movie as well as rom com. Very little is set in one single location. Just the odd motel rooms, the nightbus and exterior shots. Gable seems to revel in his role as a bit of a scally that differs from his more stiff upper lip roles in films such as Gone With The Wind. The film was a great success winning several Academy Awards including the big 5 (Director, Actor, Actress, Best Picture and Screenplay). Few films (only three to date) have achieved such an accolade. For the first ten minutes I was like this is really dated and will be boring, however on reflection you can see its appeal. Bravo again Mr. Capra.\nHindi remakes were made like Dil Hai ki Manta Nahi and Jab we met. But my favorite remains this one.",

Frank Capra is my favorite film director; It happened one night is my favorite Frank Capra film. Frank Capra was an excellent director who spoke well to the working man.  Spoiled wealthy heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) is on a boat with her father. Ellie's father doesn't want her to marry her boyfriend King Wesley, because he doesn't approve of him. Ellie gets made and jumps of the boat and swims to shore. She goes to the nearest bus station and gets a bus ticket to go to New York to be with King Wesley. Meanwhile at the bus station reporter Peter Warne has just lost his job. On the bus Ellie meets Peter. Peter knows who Ellie is, because her father is well-known. Peter tells Ellie that he will help her find King Wesley. Peter is a gruff man who isn't going to tolerate Ellie's spoiled ways. Peter teaches Ellie how to be more humble and less spoiled.  Overnight Peter and Ellie room together at a small hotel. In one of the funniest seens in film history Peter puts up a sheet so they can undress in private. He calls it \"The walls of Jericho\". My two favorite scenes in It happened one night are: 1. when Ellie and Peter have to hitch a ride. Peter can't get a ride by using his thumb; Ellie lifts up her skirt and they both get a ride. 2. A woman and her child are on the bus, they are obviously very poor and have been looking for work all day; like a lot of people during the great depression. The woman faints and the boy starts crying. Someone helps the woman up; Ellie and Peter both comfort the boy. Ellie gives the boy most of the little bit of money she has left. Ellie is now learned how to be less spoiled. By the end of the film Peter and Ellie fall in love. Ellie decides that king Wesley is a shallow rich snob, and that she would rather be with Peter. IT Happened one night is obviously set during the great depression. The film was released right in the height of the depression. It Happened one night has the feel of a depression era movie. The idea of the happy poor and the depressed rich show are feelings of the great depression. IT Happened one night is a pre-code film; released 5 months before the hays production code was passed. It Happened one night was the sleeper of it's year; a sleeper is a film that everyone thought would be a box-office failure but turned out to be very popular at the box-office. IT Happened one night is based on a short story called \"Night Bus\". It Happened one night has been copied many times: the idea of a spoiled rich young woman running away. When It Happened one night was released Columbia pictures was a small studio. IT Happened one night is a masterpiece with excellent cinematography, a flawless script, top-notch acting, colorful characters, and perfect sets. Claudette Colbert is very sexy in the lead role. IT Happened One night is a film that everyone will enjoy! My rating is 1,000 out of 10!",

            "content": "It Happened One NightAt face value this film seemed to take viewers through the same routine plot that most Hollywood romances produce.  However, taken into consideration the film first hit a theater in 1934 makes it revolutionary. The plot is witty and plausible, in the sense that it invites viewers to seek out their own romantic fantasies.  The applied comedic character roles boost the plot above normal romance film standards.  People might label this movie a chick flick, but with gendered expectations put aside it is a film for all audiences to enjoy. The film's plot is carried on the shoulders of actors Clarke Gable and Claudette Colbert, whose performances lead to an Oscar for both best actor and actress.  The dynamic duo play characters with rather diverse social and economic differences which allows conflict to unwind.  Their dissimilar lifestyles are creatively display by Capra's famous 'Walls of Jericho' scenes.  At face value the character's goal are to reach to New York incognito, but romance takes its toll and the new plot twist aims to tear down the walls of Jericho. Using several fade techniques the filming itself rhythmically jumps from setting to setting as the travels of Peter and Ellie persist.  As our characters further themselves along the path we catch glimpses of dependency for one another, for instance the scene in which they cozy up in a hay stack for the night.  The scene's setting is natural yet suddle allowing for each character's true feeling to unravel. Perhaps the best aspect of this film is the comedy applied mostly through Clarke Gable's character Peter.   His charming and direct tones bring laugh out loud comedy.  Peter's character becomes an ideology for all males. Staying with in the lines of realism, the films overall quality provides one of Hollywood's best romantic comedies up to date.",

            "content": "In the scene (first \"walls of Jericho,\") from the movie 'It Happened One Night' directed by Frank Capra, we see Ellie standing outside during the night in a pouring rain. The narrative/story or the plot unfolds like this. The passengers are forced by a storm to spend the night in an auto court and Ellie has had her suitcase stolen not too long ago and she has very little money to afford a room. Peter knows this because he tried to retrieve her suitcase from the thief but was unable to do so. Thus in order to help Ellie, he rents a room at the auto court under both their names and claims her as his wife. Ellie is somewhat surprised by this, but the shock is softened both for the audience at the time (1934,) and for Ellie, because in the earlier scene Peter helped Ellie to deflect an annoying guy on the buss named Shapeley, by claiming her as his wife. When Ellie enters the room she is somewhat dismay by having to have to spend the night with a strange man. \"According to Colbert, this was the only time in the rapid shooting schedule that he redid something, because he had decided she didn't look 'scared enough.'\" pg.44, last paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Keep in mind that for 1930's this was a big deal. The film is going against dominant ideologies at this time and they have to thread carefully. They are going against the norms. If one pays close attention, you notice the beds are separated from each other, even though the room is registered for couples. This is due to the influence of the evangelicals at the time. And the fact that they would have boycotted the movie if the beds were seen together. (class notes, professor Goldberg, Summer 2015) The beds are the first thing that captures Ellies attention once she enters the room. We get a POV shot of her looking at Peter making the bed for her in a low key lighting. What is to follow is witty comments going back and forth between Ellie and Peter as we get establishing and re-establishing shots of the room. Ellie is trying to find out about Peters intentions and Peter is trying to get Ellie to stay. Not only because he likes her, but because he also needs her story to get his job back. It is at this moment that Ellie finds out about his occupation. In order to gain her trust he assures here that he is not interested in her sexually and that she is \"just a headline\" to him. Then Peter puts up the rope in the middle of the room and uses a blanket to make the 'wall of Jericho,' according to Peter. He does this to gain her trust. But the situation is till tense. This is when the director Capra, \"broke the pathos with some comic relief\" and had Peter taking off his clothes to force Ellie to her side of the room. pg.45, first paragraph, Runaway Bride, Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930's, Elizabeth Kendall, Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1990 Then we get a pan shot of Ellie running to her side of the room and looking baffled that she has to put up with him. To further seal the deal as if she has no option but to spend the night in this room with this man, we get a silhouette shot of her lifting up the curtain and looking out at the window at the pouring rain. The movie does a great job of getting the audience of the 1930's engaged in the class warfare between the rich and poor by making it as if the rich girls (Ellie) needs the poor guy to survive on the streets, but yet at the same time the poor guy (Peter) needing Ellie to survive. The way the movie does this is by going against the traditional gender role and the dominant ideologies of male masculinities, through a role reversal. Peter, the poor guy is putting Ellie on a budget and rationing her breakfast. But the glue that holds the movie together and acceptable for the audience at the time, is the sexual tension between the two characters. Nonmatter the class difference or gender difference, the one thing that all of them and the audience have in common is sex.",

The main characters are smart and three-dimensional -- a very hard thing to do in a comedy.One of my favorite comedic moments of all time has to be when they are crossing the stream \"piggy back\" and he tells her to hold his suitcase. I also love the scene where the people on the bus start singing, truly hilarious.The DVD has some interesting trivia about the production and how Colbert did not want to make this picture. Ironically, this is the movie that won her an Oscar.All in all, a very rewarding movie experience.",

            "content": "Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews first meet on a crowded bus headed to New York.  `Driver do these seats accommodate two?'  Peter asks.  `We'll maybe they don't and maybe they do' responds the driver.  It Happened One Night takes us on a hilarious journey in the lives of two very different characters.  Peter Warne is an alcoholic, jobless news reporter who is down on life and Ellie Andrews a na\u00efve, sheltered Daddy's girl who is tired of doing what is expected of her.  The strongest and most effective aspects of It Happened One Night are the amazing chemistry between Peter and Ellie and the great one-liners that occur throughout.  In my opinion, the dialog, along with the witty story line of It Happened One Night, is what makes it such a powerful movie. Ellie is in denial, she is miles and miles away from her destination, the police and America are looking for her and she only has $1.60.  She will do anything not to depend on Peter.  Peter on the other hand is just as stubborn, he needs a job and he sees a story in Ellie.  Although he constantly refers to her as `brat' and `as helpless as a baby', there is an obvious sort of twisted attraction to her on his part.  As true to life in real romance, Ellie and Peter will try at all costs to resist one another.`I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband' Ellie says.  There are five points in this movie where Ellie and Peter are assumed to be husband and wife; the first time is on the second bus.  Ellie has missed her first bus assuming that it would wait for her and Peter has stayed behind as well.  An annoying man named Shapely has explained to Ellie that it is his experience that `the colder they are, the hotter they get', Peter steps in and announces that Ellie is his wife. Ellie seems shocked but pleased.  Ellie and Peter are husband and wife again at the first lodge they stay over night in together.  Here they build `The Walls of Jerico' a sheet clumsily separating the beds they sleep in. Ironically enough, it is not until this point as Ellie lies in bed, dressed in Peters pajamas, that she learns his name.  As pretend husband and wife for the third time Ellie and Peter fool a search team of detectives hired by Ellie's father into believing they are in fact married and not who they are looking for.  This is a major turning point in our story.  The development of trust is occurring.  Ellie and Peter begin to work together in order to accomplish one another's goals.  The fourth time they stand as mock husband and wife occurs after Ellie accomplishes at what Peter fails- successfully hitchhiking.  Peter and Ellie grow even closer as they sit in the back of the car that picks them up; Ellie gloats as she bites into a carrot.  The fifth and final time they are supposed to be married marks the huge turning point in our love story.  They are flat broke and Ellie insists that they stay at a lodge only three hours away from their destination.  It is there that she professes her undeniable love for Peter.  His head filled with confusion he responds to her that she had better go back to her bed.  They are perfect for each other and they know it, but could it ever work?  Peter can't deny it, he's mad about her.  He needs money so he returns to New York.  The whole thing becomes a huge misunderstanding, mainly because both Ellie and Peter are extremely quick to jump to conclusions regarding one another's intentions.  For the first time in our story, the lovers are separated and miserable. `He blames you for everything that is wrong with me' Ellie weeps to her father.  Actually to this point we have all had Mr. Andrews pinned very wrong.  If not for this father's love and greater concern for his daughter's happiness, then this love story would never have been.  In a meeting between Mr. Andrews and Peter over reimbursement in the amount of $39.60 to Peter for his troubles, he asks; `Do you love my daughter?' and Peter answers, `Yes but don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy!'  So Mr. Andrews being a good father realizes that it is up to him to unite Peter and Ellie. In an anticipated and suspenseful finale, the two are joined and it is then that `The Walls of Jerico' finally topple.",

But you would be disappointed if you were to be an Indian viewer who had first seen its Indian remake Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahin (1991), which is a sensational mix of the up-and-down romantic drama, hilarious comedy, great acting (Aamir Khan - who outperforms Clarke Gable by a distance, and Anupam Kher), and a score that would have done Giorgio Moroder proud.Unfortunately, the remake can never make it to this list because it is not in English - it is in Hindi, India's native language. Still, one must ask if Italian/Spanish titles could be included in the list, then the list should truly be free of language restrictions.Actually, as an afterthought, I should add that at least half of Slumdog Millionnaire is actually in Hindi. So maybe the real problem with the list, just like with the Oscars, might be that it expects somebody from the Western world to direct & produce the movie. Whether or not you disagree, I strongly recommend you watch Pushpak (another Indian movie, and importantly NO language problems with this one). This is in not a imdb-250 movie. After you have watched it, you would likely just ask whether imdb-100 or something even shorter.",

            "content": "On top of what? Romantic comedies, which this has often been dubbed to be the first, of all screwball comedies. While its not, it's definitely the best. From writing, casting, superb acting, and directing. From Gables inebriated nonchalant disrespect of anything he see as a barrier to a good thing, to his charming and overtly sexual grin, his threatening to (sexually) spank Colbert, to him clobbering a highway thief--this comedy has more romance and adventure, than most romance and adventure films claim to have.There's even some singing, per the era, and it fits nicely into this picture. Colbert was perfectly cast, and does her part well as the spoiled little rich girl, who needed a good \"thrashing\" and a real man to take charge and plow through anything to \"tear down the walls of Jericho\". If chem-labs at school were as copacetic as Gable and Colbert, I'd be feeding carrots to lab animals. Their chemistry is undeniable the best sexual, comedic, and dramatic chemistry of any film. This is 1934, and for mainstream films, female legs (and men's), spankings, sexual undertones, women hitchhiking, and the likes, we're frowned upon (not in the dirty B cinemas) and Capra and team did right to keep if PG, or else it'd be a simply lost film, looped in with other, muddy, grainy pictures from the era. This one has a warm, soft tone in the lens. I remember seeing it on TV and VHS years ago, and it's as good as the restored versions. This is a romcom that won't emasculate men, and a bit of cat and mouse, \"come and get buddy\" action, for the ladies.He gets the girl (or did she get him?), guys and girls are happy, there's a stellar supporting cast, and then the walls of Jericho come down...always a biblical undertone and joke with Capra, but far from religious or pretentious. This movie catered to the depression-era populous, who needed to be entertained, and that's what it did, that's what it does, and that's what it I'll continue to do.Definitely a top 5 film of all time.",

            "content": "First ever winner of five Oscars in all major categories, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay, the 1934 movie It Happened One Night is a whimsical romantic tale of fortuitous love between a spoiled socialite Ellen Andrews played by Claudette Colbert and a cantankerous newspaper reporter Peter Warne played by Clark Gable. The slapstick comedy collaboration from director Frank Capra and writer Robert Riskin, still remains quintessential viewing because of its clever and amusing portrayal of the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment.Ellen, recently married to infamous pilot King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her millionaire father (Walter Connolly)'s orders is now cooped up on a yacht against her will with her father so that he can decidedly change her mind and have her marriage to the apparent gold digging cad annulled. Defiant Ellen who believes she is in love wants no part of her father's plan for her jumps ship to shore and eventually finds herself on a bus bound for New York. Here she hopes to reunite with her husband and live happily ever after. On board the Greyhound bus she meets Peter, none the worse for wear and recently fired from his newspaper for being drunk on the job. So begins an unlikely series of dealings between the two that stem from them agreeing to help each other out for a price of sorts. Peter recognizing Ellen from newspaper headlines as the much talked about runaway heiress, agrees to help her get to New York while she in turn offers him exclusive rights to her story, his hope is to revamp his career. The journey is series of memorable, classic, comical, events that draw the two closer together. Peter never one to hold back on his opinion and ever nonchalant, often chastises \"Brat\" his nickname for Ellen, because of her bourgeois tendencies and take on life, whereas he is a down to earth working class man; depicted in sharp close up clarity, every handsome rugged feature proving to be aesthetically camera friendly always defining his cool no nonsense sensibility. The two collide, bicker and banter about everything. There's is not an apparent match made in heaven but their liaison becomes more meaningful the longer they spend together. Peter is assiduous in keeping his promise to Ellen; Ellen is just doe eyed and realizes she is in love with the brash outspoken journalist. A timeless feature that that suggests Ellen's beauty and fragility is achieved with the application of a filtered lens on all of her close ups; this very effective application implies a softness and purity to her character.A notable fact about this seminal movie is the precedent it set for zany romantic comedies that would follow, such as Bringing up Baby (1938) and the Philadelphia Story (1940) both starring Katherine Hepburn and the impact it still has on screwball comedies today.",

            "content": "Hilarious jokes with a cute romantic dynamic.\n\nDirector Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life & Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) directed one of the greatest romantic comedies ever with It Happened One Night (1934)! It flies by for a quickly paced 105 of cute back and forth jokes that lead to a sweet little romance. Capra's direction is playful for lighthearted romance and stylish shots for the moody driving of the Night Bus. Joseph Walker's cinematography excels with the Night Bus headlights peering into the midnight darkness and pouring rain. Stephen Goosson's art direction shows off mossy trees and natural spaces for a lovely aesthetic for It Happened One Night.\n\nCapra's sterling direction held my attention. He kept the pace fast and jokes constant. He's got a moody atmosphere for every night scene and foggy forest, while keepings things bright for the daylight romancing. Gene Havlick's editing cuts scenes into concise romantic comedy moments for non-stop laughs. His fast cutting during the hitchhiking sequence is a riot. Sydney Moore's Night Bus dingy set decoration and straw covered outside is fun.\n\nWriter Robert Riskin crafts hilarious jokes, endearing romance, with really likable characters. Riskin adapts Samuel Hopkins Adams' cute short story \"Night Bus\" with charming playfulness to his romantic comradery and witty humor. Capra's humanist viewpoint helps Adams' narrative of an average reporter humbling a spoiled socialite as they get acquainted on a Night Bus. It Happened One Night is a fun concept for a meet-cute scenario.\n\nClark Gable is very tough and charismatic as the dashing reporter Peter Warne. He's gruff enough to feel realistically stern and disapproving, but kind enough to feel like a romantic hero. He's got great romantic chemistry with Claudette Colbert. Gable and Colbert have a similar scoundrel and spoiled brat dynamic as Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan in French Kiss to me. \n\nClaudette Colbert is lovely and hilarious as a spoiled heiress named Ellie Andrews. She's delightful to watch with excellent comedic timing, a cute face, and pleasant manner as she bums around for money. She's moving as she pleads for Gable to take her with him. I found Claudette Colbert charming as Ellie with a sweet sincerity, doe eyed innocence, and elegant grace.\n\nWalter Connolly is loud and crazy as Ellie's boisterous millionaire father Alexander Andrews. Roscoe Karns is creepy as the obnoxious sleaze that hits on Colbert. His bus passenger Oscar Shapeley is selfish and annoying in a fun appearance. Alan Hale's singing car driver Danker is hysterical. Jameson Thomas is just the type of dullard as King Westley to make Clark Gable look even cooler. George Breakston is heartbreaking as the bus passenger boy whose mother collapses. Ward Bond is a riot as the indignant first bus driver.\n\nComposer Howard Jackson's score is very playful and pretty. He fits It Happened One Night's sweet romantic comedy vibe. All the singing characters are a blast. Edward Bernds' sound design captures the voices clearly and provides neat ambient noises for the environment with croaking frogs and chirping cicadas. Costume designer Robert Kalloch made a cute striped suit and skirt with all sorts of robes and suits for Clark Gable.\n\nIn all, It Happened One Night feels highly influential to romantic comedies as the archetype of the rough guy ending up with the pampered girl.",

The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said \"now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver\" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Not completely as Colbert gets a few laughs herself.  But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character, Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy, the screwball and It Happened One Night set the mold.\n\nCapra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie. Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio, along the lines of Republic or Monogram. As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it.\n\nCapra also had a stroke of good luck. Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B. Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable. The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM. In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day, drunk as a skunk, is priceless. Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative.\n\nAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something. He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day. So the publicity drums were beat.\n\nThe rest as they say is history. It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios. And it set the standard for screwball comedy.\n\nThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert. They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them, you have people walking out in droves.

Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM. It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent, a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in.\n\nGable and Colbert did only one other film together, Boom Town for MGM. You can't get much more different than those two films. Boom Town had a huge MGM budget, Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well, and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein. It's also a great film, but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night.\n113 out of 120 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Colbert already is on the loose and is being pursued. Along the way, she runs into and must depend on Gable, who is quite glib and very funny. As the two of them make their way across the country, they find themselves in near compromising conditions. We have the famous \"Wall of Jericho\" where they sleep in the same bed with a bed sheet acting as a barrier. Colbert is defiant; Gable is flirtatious. Remember the famous scene where Colbert gets a driver to stop and pick them up by sticking out her exposed leg. Frank Capra gave us all these films about Americana and this is one that has captured our being for decades. The byplay between the principle characters is worth the effort.",

And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.\n\nGreat character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies.",

My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!",

Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies.

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). \ud83d\ude09\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.\ud83d\ude09\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how\u2026.this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.\ud83d\ude09\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it\u2026.and I've seen it a lot!\ud83d\ude09\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and na\u00efve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f",

But, six years later, I gave a second try at it and\u2026 boy, my first impressions on one of the funniest classic romantic comedies ever made were completely wrong. In Miami, Ellie (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled daughter of a millionaire, runs away because her father wants to annul her marriage. At a bus to New York, she comes across a newspaper journalist, Peter (Clark Gable) and they of course hate each other, only to bond together during their runaway. The best parts about the movie are when she has no choice but to follow Peter's shoes, whether it's sleeping next to him on the bus, roleplaying in front of the detectives, hitchhiking, sleeping in the hay, or eating a carrot. As funny as those scenes are, the circumstance that she's on the run from the police, her fiance and her father and she could be left behind and get caught in any time creates tension as well as a connection between the two. Another great scene is at the wedding in the end just after her father reveals Peter's love for her. Not only is the payoff funny, but her decision to reject her fiance and ditch the altar during the matrimony is satisfyingly heartwarming. Even if you know what's going to happen, It Happened One Night is still a brilliantly-played, wonderfully funny love story and a quintessential example of the ultimate screwball comedy. If you love classic films, pop this movie in and give it a watch. \n\n(4 \u00bd Shirtless Clark Gables out of 5)",

This movie is one of only three films ever to sweep Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Lead Actor and Best Lead Actress.  Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is a charming comedy that teams two of the era's top stars, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.\n\nColbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled heiress who recently eloped against her father's wishes.  He fears her new husband is interested only in the fortune that Ellie will eventually inherit.  He attempts to hold Ellie against her will while he arranges for an annulment.  Ellie escapes her confinement, boards a bus to New York and during the journey meets boozy newspaper reporter Peter Warne.  As with most good romcoms, the two are initially quite abrasive, but through circumstance they slowly warm to each other.  Peter eventually realizes who she is and agrees to help her reach New York if she will give him her exclusive story.  Colbert and Gable have a wonderful chemistry and an intimacy that transcends the rather light script.  \n\nMy one complaint with the movie was the use of two actors in their mid-to-late thirties playing characters that are quite obviously intended to be much younger.  In fact, twice when Colbert first meets Gable's character she is given the task of referring to as \"young man\".  It's a little much.  \n\nMuch of the dialogue is outdated but this film is still a solid one, and it evokes some great laughter as these two people find a new and mutual path together.",

She soon falls in with drunken newspaper reporter Peter Warne, and they take an instant dislike to one another: it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to work out how their relationship will unfold. And indeed Capra doesn't even bother trying to keep the audience guessing about where the film is heading, but provides a slightly mad-cap romp \u2013 written at the last minute on the insistence of his stars \u2013 in order to make the journey more interesting.\nWhat is striking about the film is that it thus revolves around a love affair between a single man and a married woman, something that the Code would almost certainly have not allowed. Or at least not in a screwball comedy in which Peter flippantly strips to his trousers in front of Ellie and later slaps her on the backside as he carries her across a river. By modern standards, the film is positively tame, but at the time it must have raised a few eyebrows. Especially as it concludes with Ellie abandoning her husband at the altar (their first wedding having been annulled) whilst her father looks on gleefully.\nNonetheless, this doesn't mean that It Happened One Night should be watched merely as a historical cinematic curiosity: it remains hugely entertaining. The on-screen chemistry between its two stars is palpable and Claudette Colbert is perfectly cast as the petulant Ellie, capable of being alternately irritating and endearing, whilst Clark Gable demonstrates great comic timing as Peter. The film is often very funny, from Claudette diving into the sea from her father's boat, through such scenes as Peter and her posing as an arguing couple to hide her real identity from a pair of detectives, to Peter's hilarious moment when Roscoe Karns' Oscar Shapeley tries to blackmail him into turning Ellie in for the reward her father has posted and Peter terrifies him by pretending that he's kidnapped her and wants his help in a possible shoot out with the cops.\nThe film is full of amusing moments. There's the hitch-hiking scene, the scene when Peter fails to thumb a lift after several attempts an Ellie succeeds by flashing her leg at a passing car, and Peter's brilliantly grumpy conversation with Ellie's father when he demands reimbursement for all of the belongings that he had to sacrifice whilst escorting her across country. In addition to the two stars, the story is filled with vaguely outlandish characters, resulting in great comedic performances from all concerned, including Karns but also Alan Hale as Danker, the singing car driver, Charles C. Wilson as Joe Gordon, Warne's newspaper editor boss, and Walter Connolly as Alexander Andrews, Ellie's possessive father (brilliantly, when he orders a telegram sent to the detectives he wants to track Ellie down, it begins with the line \"daughter escaped again\").\nIn amongst all of the jokes and comic set-pieces, the film is often quite touching too, such as when Ellie realises that she loves Peter and when \u2013 having returned home \u2013 her supposedly controlling father is sensitive enough to realise that she has found somebody other than her husband and promises to move heaven and earth to make her happy. It is often the little things that make the film great \u2013 the sing-along scene for example, which shows Ellie slowly shaking off her spoilt outlook on life. Much of this is down to Capra. A director who eschewed flashy techniques, he brings a perfect lightness of touch to the film and Joseph Walker's cinematography suits his style, with shots that allow the cast room to move. Despite its age, the film still looks pretty good, although some of the exteriors are obviously filmed on studio sets rather than locations. That said, the sets are impressively detailed and convincing enough. \nThe only way in which It Happened One Night hasn't aged well is in Alexander slapping his daughter's face and Peter suggesting that she needs a husband who will occasionally \"sock\" her to keep her in line: it's an alarmingly casual attitude to violence towards women that isn't comfortable. But when watching old films, it is inevitable that disturbing anachronisms will occasionally be found: they are the only sour note in a film that otherwise remains both funny and charming.",

I did laugh many times during the films, and found both leads enthralling and loved the interplay as insults were thrown back and forth. Clark Gable has star quality and lights up every scene he is in. Claudette Colbert is nearly his equal and is more convincing before she actually falls in love with him. I really enjoyed the ending as she runs from her wedding and how Clark Gable discusses to his father in law how mad it would be to be love with her. The singing trapeze song on the bus was another highlight as was the initial scene with Clark Gable as he is drunk on the phone to his boss. They are both very different in their lives with Claudette Colbert's character having barely lived or been allowed to and never ever meeting a man like Clark Gable's character. A film about class and money and in the end the father understands what his daughter wants with more freedom and to love the right man. A thoroughly brilliant film which is funny, warm, charming and has class from the director, writers and the cast.",

One of the reasons is the personal connection to me.  \n\nIt reminded me of a T.V. show me and my mom and dad used to watch called, \"Castle\" It's a show about a writer who shadows a Homicide Detective for research for his crime novels and throughout the series the two bicker and have this sort of playful banter between each other and in the end it turns into more than just shadowing her for research and they end up falling in love with each other. I also love this film because it reminds me of the relationship between me and my ex-girlfriend starting out. We started out not liking each other and then teased each other playfully and ended up together. Just like in this film between the two main characters. Another great quality that makes this film so good is the acting. \n\nThe acting between the two main characters Peter Warren and Ellie (Ellen) Andrews is fantastic. I love the chemistry and character arc between the two. I love how they go from disliking each other and having to be with each other and in the end wanting to be together. Throughout the film they even acted like a married couple, the way the bickered and spoke to one another and the way they teased each other all the time. It kept me intrigued the whole movie and made me laugh and wanted me to know if they ended up together or if they went their separate ways in the end.",

I went into this film knowing about his existence in some of themes noteworthy films of all time, such as Gone With the Wind, but I had never really seen any o this work. But this movie really showed the acting talent he had on display. This is not to take away form Claudette Colbert at all as she's also quite captivating. The story of these two humans hitting their personal rock bottoms traveling across the country in search of answers but instead find love was a simple one that really spoke to me. I think this should be the blueprint for any romantic comedies made, as the jokes make you laugh, the emotional moments hit and make you squirm, and the end is heartwarming and sweet. Wow. It Happened One Night (1934) really showed me that some older cinema has its lures and reasons for viewing. The writing came off as extremely fresh and original, I thought for the time it was quite good at creating even characters for both the male and female lead, giving Colbert's character plenty of her own motivation and perseverance herself. In the end, what really carries this film are the fantastic performances, and the heartwarming story that's presented, I felt warm inside at the end of this one.",

            "content": "If you like romantic comedies, It Happened One Night by Frank Capra, is the film for you to see. It features a spoiled heiress, Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who escapes the control of her father and heads for New York to reunite with her husband. On the bus ride there she meets a recently-fired newspaper reporter by the name of Peter Warne (Clark Gable). They strike a deal that helps them both get what they want; but along the way they gain more than they bargained for\u2026 they fall stubbornly in love with one another. With phenomenal cinematography, thoughtful storyline, clever dialogue, top-notch acting, and endearing humor, this film will have you pressing play a million times over. Let's dissect all the wonderful elements that went into making this film so memorable. \n\tWhat is a good film without quality acting? A bad one\u2026 Luckily for It Happened One Night, the acting was up to par with the rest of the movie. With sharp, witty, bounce-back dialogue Gable and Colbert had a flawless on-screen connection. Even side actors such as Roscoe Karns who played Oscar Shapley did a wonderful job and played their parts well. Facial expressions were genuine and reaction time was generous! It was easy to remember the scenes where good acting stuck out, because it was the entire movie. One of my favorite scenes to appreciate the acting in the film was the one where detectives find Ellie in the camp home and she and Peter have to put on a show to disguise her. It's difficult to act as an actor or actress without the result feeling corny. But this scene wasn't corny at all\u2026 it was enjoyably ridiculous! Now let's get serious; acting is way harder than it looks. This is why I was so impressed with the natural and realistic portrayals of emotions in this movie. Claudette Colbert did a magnificent job in the role of Ellie Andrews. One scene specifically stuck out to me. It was near the end of the film, when she was getting ready for her wedding with King Westley. At first, she seems disconnected. She's smoking a cigarette, drinking, and feeling everything but happy on her wedding day. Her father notices she's not quite herself, he even says that she's changed, and coaxes a confession out of her. The way that she clings to her fathers coat in tears and the way she fumbles over her own words as she explains everything makes the outburst seem so real. Then, after her father shows her the letter Peter sent regarding payment, she immediately changes her tune. She goes from crying and heartbroken to carefree and cold shouldered. She holds back her tears and cheers to a \"never ending merry-go-round\" life with King. This attempt to shrug off her emotions and dive into a meaningless relationship is what some might call a rebound. Which sadly is a realistic coping method, and she does it so well! This film has also done such a wonderful job at character development. One example of this is shown through the character of Ellie Andrews. In the begging of the movie, Peter helps Ellie with nearly everything. Chasing after her stolen bag, sitting with her on the bus, rationing her spending, saying she's his wife to help hide her true identity, etcetera. She appears as helpless, careless, and naive. But further into the movie, during the hitchhiking scene, we see her true capability clearly for the very first time. After Peters failed attempts to halt a car, she succeeds on her first try. Perhaps this confidence and self capability could be a trait she picked up from Peter along the way. In addition to the audience gaining a deeper sense of who this character is, it also aids to the compatibility of her and Peter, since Peter is well grounded in the ways self reliance. We also see characters go through developmental stages such as denial. Particularly Gables character, Peter Warne. When Ellie asked him what he was thinking after they almost kissed he denied his feelings and hid what he was really thinking. He covered it up with a lie in the form of an insult towards her. We see Peter in denial again during the scene where Ellie confesses her love to him in the motel and he tells her to \"go back to bed\". Another character development tribute was defeat. This is shown in the climax of the film. Through the big misunderstanding between Ellie and Peter, we see defeat in both of them. Ellie intends to go through with her plans to marry King and gives up trying to be with Peter because she thinks he ran from her. Meanwhile Peter gives up trying to be with Ellie and buys back his love story because he thinks she turned herself in and took him for a ride. \n\tThe cinematography, done by Robert Riskin, was completely remarkable. It was truly notable in many of the intimate scenes shared between Colbert and Gables characters, which I noticed usually happened in the night and focused on the conversations they had just before bed. The first instance of this was when their bus got stuck and they had to lodge together in a camp home. Something about that scene, after the lights were turned off, was so beautiful. It wasn't simply one aspect of the scene, it was every aspect, put together all at once, that made it visually and mentally poetic. The lighting that resulted in rich black and whites, the silence between them and the quiet presence of what's being left unsaid, the beat of the rain on the roof and the imagery of it running down the windows, and last but not least, the framework created by the \"Walls of Jericho\" (as stated in the movie). The scene is still, yet has a truly cinematic flow to it. Riskin pulled off this scene and two more relatively similar to it, which is hard to do. Reiteration in cinema often comes across as repetitive and unnecessary. However, Riskin's execution was so subtly different each time that it felt like a whole new idea while still allowing audiences to feel the same things as before. It's completely genius. These three scenes have what one could call an \"evolution\", which is part of what Riskin altered slightly each time to prevent them from feeling too familiar. This so-called evolution is the rate at which the characters feelings for each other heighten. Within three beautifully filmed scenes, we see them go from butterflies and silence to deep love and outcries. Along with those three distinct scenes, I noticed an interesting part of the film where a sound transition played a role. It took watching this movie twice to notice it, but I believe that that simply proves how naturally it fit in. It's important to appreciate when a filmmaker pulls off an out of the ordinary task without it taking the audience out of the movie. When Ellies father is searching for her in a plane, the sound of the engine transudes into the next scene where Ellie is waking up in the camp home she's hiding away at. The audio of the plane carries a few seconds into the scene implying that her father is passing over the campsite. This gives a really cool effect because it tells the audience that she hears the plane and is completely unaware that it's her fathers search party. Later into the scene, detectives show up at her door and she and Peter put on an act to disguise her. This proves the theory of it being her fathers plane passing over the campsite. This movie really succeeded at involving the audience and bringing them into the movie. I think this is best shown through the climax of the movie when Peter is racing back to the motel to get there before Ellie wakes up. As a member of the audience, I felt the hectic motions of this scene. Elements such as short camera shots, fast transitions, train passings, loud audio of sirens, and car chases aided the chaotic flow of this part of the movie. The speed of the scene and the reaction time left for the audience to understand what's happening was well balanced and received the desired affect upon the viewers\u2014 anxiety. If you're trying to give the audience a feeling of frustration and stress, this tactic of allowing them to know something the characters don't is a clever way to do so. Audiences were overwhelmed and frustrated to see this big misunderstanding between the characters unfold. As for myself, I wanted to scream at the screen loud enough so the characters on it would hear me, understand, and change their ways. Sadly, this did not work.\n\tThis movie did a fantastic job foreshadowing. For example, during the bus boarding scene where Peter is talking with his ex boss in the telephone booth, the men surrounding him call him by the name of \"King\". They say things like \"Make way for the King!\" and \"Long live the King!\". Let's keep in mind that Ellie Andrews is married to a man by the actual name of King Westley. This casually hints that Ellie will end up with Peter and, if the audience pieces it together, gives the entire films ending away. Another time that foreshadowing is used is when Peter and Ellie are riding the bus and the band on board starts to play. The lyrics talk about a man who's jealous of another because he gets all the girls he wants, including his true love. The same could be applied to Peter and King. This foreshadowing is disguised by the joy of a sing-along song. It's interesting how foreshadowing can be so subtle yet so obvious. \n\tIt Happened One Night was a pre-production code film, which allowed it to get away with many things that it would not have if it was released after the Production Code Agency was in motion. Filmmakers had to submit their works to the PCA to receive a stamp of approval. If the film had elements that violated the production code, it would be denied approval and sent back with notes of necessary edits and adjustments to make it \"theater-ready\". Capra's film featured many of the production codes's no-no's including underdressing, two people (who were not married to each other) sleeping in the same room, smoking and drinking, crude humor (for its time) including a scene where Peter spanks Ellie, the idea of a married woman almost kissing another man, and finally, insinuative scenes such as the last one where the so-called \"Walls of Jericho\" topple. Despite the fact that it did not fit the production code, It Happened One Night was a huge success. It won five academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Writing Adaption. This was known as the \"Big Five\" and was the first film to achieve this accomplishment. Fun fact; Gable's Oscar was auctioned off for $607,500.00 and now belongs to the Motion Picture Academy. Colbert's Oscar was also auctioned but no bids were made\u2026 awkward. But the important thing to note isn't that Gable's Oscar is more valuable than Colbert's\u2026 it's that thing film was resoundingly magnificent and worthy of all the awards.",

            "content": "It Happened One Night (1934)\nDirector Frank Capra\n\tIt Happened One Night is a good film for the time. It wonderfully portrays screwball comedy and is a blueprint for romantic comedies of the modern time. But certain factors of the film make it harder to see today. The chemistry between Peter, played by Clark Gable, and Ellie, played by Claudette Colbert, is fantastic and there quick wit flirtuos jabs at each other is replicated multiple times in todays Rom Com. But at the same time while it tries to be empowering to women doesn't quite hit that spot. \t\n\tThe acting done by Gable and Colbert is charming and also realistic with it being built in historical context. Gable, who plays a working class journalist, has to deal with Colbert's character, a born rich girl. Their interactions throughout the film shows how people in the 30's felt about each class, how the working class felt that the upper class is crude and spoiled, while the upper class just is trying to deal with their own problems and insecurities. Gable and Colberts build in the film to a romantic relationship gives off the hope of how good people in the world can still achieve their goals and deserve to be treated equally. This can also be seen in the amazing bus singing scene where people of all stages of life unite to sing songs with one another. Another theme this film plays off of is the city living vs the country living. Back in the 30's people started moving towards big cities and people would start to envy and detest people who lived in the city. In this film Gable and Colbert have to travel from the city into the country to find themselves and achieve their goals. This theme while being relatable isn't as popular in today's age. While this is one reason it doesn't hold up a bigger reason is the way Gable and Colbert interact with each other. In some ways it's charming and fun but other times it's demeaning to Colbert. We see Gable threaten to hurt Colbert and treat her as if she knows absolutely nothing of the world. In some ways this film was empowering for women in the 30's but in today's age this film does more harm than good.\n\tWhile this film is fun and the pacing keeps something happening every minute the film doesn't hold as well because of some political reasons. This doesn't stop it from being a charming movie that is entertaining and showcases how the relationships of classes with one another in a brilliant way.",

            "content": "If you've ever commuted by bus, you probably already know that the rides are usually long and boring with the passengers all turning to their phones for entertainment. With that in mind, it's interesting to see the road trip dynamic done well in It Happened One Night. The reason it's done so well is that it's a light-hearted screwball comedy and because it was wise to conform to the production code standards of the time. \n    It Happened One Night is essentially a screwball comedy that takes place as a road trip. It stars Clark Gable as Peter, the bitter journalist who's recently been fired, and Claudette Colbert as Ellie, the somewhat spoiled woman who's desperate to get away from her father.  Together they travel on a bus towards New York, along the way encountering all sorts of problems and mischief. There is a pleasant dynamic between Ellie and Peter that I think works because they are characters that are fundamentally different. This film being a romantic-comedy it's only appropriate to mention that it's one of those cases of Opposites Attract. The film's plot moves along nicey and it doesn't feel too long. The comedy sprinkled throughout, keeping the film light and wholesome. I would also point out that some of the comedy stems from the difference in times. I find the dynamic between Peter and Ellie dated, but that is what makes it comical to me.\n    The other thing that's noteworthy about this film is how it adheres to the Motion Picture Production Code. At a time that skeptics of the code were sure that any film that is under those restrictions was sure to do bad, this film managed to break those expectations. Much of this film's success stems from what I think is a classy approach to its themes. The romance between Peter in Ellie is a constant back and forth that never turns into anything too gratuitous for the audience. In particular, the scene where Peter and Ellie share a room, Peter takes the time to set up a sheet as a partition which he calls the \"walls of Jericho\". It's reflective of a time that was more modest in nature concerning the roles and privacy between men and women. Throughout the film, those tropes are seen. The traditional manly role the Gable plays in constant collision with the ladylike personality of Colbert. The language of the film is also pretty mild. At one point in the movie Peter lashes out at Ellie and exclaims, \"If you do, I'll break your neck!\"  I would say this line hasn't aged well; however, it makes me chuckle to think of its irreverence. Other than the film is mostly upbeat in nature. There is a scene that I would say pushes the boundaries of what the Motion Picture Production Code set, but if I were to guess, It was just enough to not warrant any huge backlash. That scene is, of course, the piggyback scene. \n    In conclusion, I think the film was well done. The romantic screw-ball comedy mixes all sorts of witty lines with silly situations that display a classic \"fish out of water\" trope.  I don't think there was anything about it that was over-the-top, It was quite moderate in nature. That being said, I think it's the fact that this film comes across as the definition of \"playing it safe\". That is it lacks any ambition, and overall has nothing more than simply an enjoyable quality to it. Not great, but not bad.",

            "content": "I thought this movie was very entertaining, even though it was trying to hide anything \"illegal\" or \"explicit\", since the production was trying to follow a certain code made by the Church and other sources.   There were many examples where material was hidden to the audience, but still implied, which I thought worked and it seemed like the director was trying to \"stick it to the man\", while also trying to make a Hollywood style film.  Three main examples I saw were towards the beginning, when everyone was on the bus singing and dancing, a flask is handed to a man, but he begins to open it out of the frame, and you never actually see alcohol consumption.  Or when Peter went off to fight the man that gave them a ride, they both drive off and are out of the shot/scene, then Peter reenters, bruised and the man is gone, but he has the car and there was no real sign of a fight.  The final example, is when Peter and Ellie get back together and head back to the cabin, they had previously setup blankets to divide the room, but since they were married, it was \"ok\" for them to be together in the same room, and thus, the \"Walls of Jericho\" were able to fall.  Overall, this was a classic and pretty predictable movie, but with what was going on at the time and how strict of code producers had to follow, I think they did a good job.",

How important you are, historically, and to have been the first \"grand slam\" at the Oscars in 1934 must have really felt good. Heck, you were even directed by Frank Capra! I'm talking It's a Wonderful Life Frank Capra! Yes, you're pretty treasured It Happened One Night, but not by me. In fact, I really didn't care for you.\nNow hang on It Happened One Night, before you get a twist in your toga, hear me out.  I don't necessarily think you're a bad movie. You've even made me laugh, like the time Clark Gable was trying to hitchhike and every car passed him by, and when Claudette Colbert gets the next one to stop by flashing her leg, but he turns out to be a robber that steals all their stuff? That was hilarious It Happened One Night. \nBut, if I'm being honest, you're getting old It Happened One Night. Dated. Clark Gable gives a stellar performance of a misogynistic, abusive man who falls in love with the woman he verbally abused the entire film. You're whole plot reeks of Stockholm syndrome. You may be treasured as a classic piece of cinema, but to me, you're nothing more than a representation of the times. And, like most romantic comedies, you will fade into the distant reaches of my memory. It may just be my 2019 brain, but you lack substance It Happened One Night. I didn't care if the character's loved each other, I was just flinching, waiting to see if Peter was going to become violent with his harsh words. \nYou're a fine piece of history, but in the end, that's all you are to me: history. History to learn from, to reflect upon, not with praise, but with cynicism. Seeing how women were treated in these types of movies prove that they do not stand the test of time. You're no exception It Happened One Night. That's why, upon my last viewing, I just couldn't help but cringe. \nI'm glad people love you, It Happened One Night, just know that I just can't be one of them.\nAlso, It's a Wonderful Life was mediocre at best. \nSincerely,\nIan\n",

            "content": "It Happened One Night is considered to be one of the greatest romantic comedies. The film comprises a mismatched couple who intend to rebel live against societal rules because of love. The film paved the way for numerous movies that adapted romantic comedy themes, setting a new pattern to romantic films. The director applies the idea of irony in several instances in the film. For example, the director uses situational irony technique when Peter claims that he is good at hitchhiking. He tells Ellie that he is can quickly stop a car and ask for a ride. However, when no car stops despite him sticking his hands out. But, Ellie does it instantly by lifting her skirt. The director shows that Ellie utilizes her feminine characteristics, which turns to be faster than they anticipated. The directors of the film, called It Happened One Night uses literary elements such as imagery to develop the themes of the film. One of the forms of imagery the director uses is the walls of Jericho. The wall of Jericho refers to the curtain that Peter hangs between their beds. The audience can see the two getting dressed either side of The Wall of Jericho. They know that they are in the same room, and they appear to be imagining the intimate and sexy image of the other without clothes. This image of two lovers on either side of the curtain seems to be a romantic one. The director also utilizes the idea of symbolism in developing some of the themes in the film. For instance, the relationship between Peter and nature symbolizes feeling alive and freedom.",

Does it age well with some of the lines and subject matter, of course not, but what movies from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s really do with the current political and global mindset. However, this film is a product of its time and its stars. Both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert put on superb performances as the unlikeliest of lovers. Ellen Andrews is a spoiled brat daughter of a wealthy businessman who is fleeing her overbearing father to be with her husband King Westley. Pete Warne is an alcoholic reporter who accidentally falls into arguably the largest story of his life. Although their love story is not traditional, they do show they care about one another throughout their journey from Miami to New York. The symbolic Wall of Jericho, especially the falling of it at the end of the film, shows the barrier that Pete puts between the two of them that eventually cannot hold back how they truly feel for one another. Everything they put each other through eventually leads to them getting together and arguably the line of the movie.\nFather Andrews: \"Do you love my daughter?\"\nPete: \"YES!! But don't hold that against me.\"\nThis movie is a must watch, especially for those that want to see the origins of the rom-com and also see the first film to win the big 5 categories at the Oscars (Best Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Cinematography).

            "content": "How wonderful to think that the Academy was once willing to reward light mainstream fare that is extremely well written and acted with the Best Picture award. Frank Capra is one of the great directors of the 1930s and 1940s and this is possibly my favorite of his films. The presence of Clark Gable was enough to tell me I was going to have a fun time, his rakish charm is undeniable, and Claudette Colbert is a great comedic actress. I expected to love this film going in and I really did, it's a very enjoyable watch and one of the more entertaining Best Picture winners.\n\nSpoilt heiress ,Claudette Colbert, has fallen in love with the repugnant King Westley, in an effort to escape her domineering but well-meaning father,,. Her father is vehemently against this and in his rage he slaps her causing her to run away from him, news that reaches all of the biggest newspapers in town. Working at one of these newspapers is Peter Warne, Clark Gable, a sardonic reporter who has his doubts about love. He is sent out to investigate an unrelated story but meets  by chance on the bus and sets out to get the inside scoop without her knowledge. What follows is a very entertaining series of misadventures during which the two fall deeply in love and the requisite last minute admissions of love are given with  running away from the marriage she no longer desires into the arms of Warne.\n\nThere are many iconic sequences in this film with Claudette Colbert revealing her ankles whilst hitchhiking, the singing on the bus, the \"Walls of Jericho,\" Clark Gable shirtless and the two lying in the hay being just a few of the hugely influential scenes. These scenes have served as an influence on countless future films, from Mystic Pizza (1988) to Bandits (2001), because they are endlessly charming, sexy and oh-so-romantic. Revealing Gable's chest was rather risqu\u00c3 (C) at the time and was no doubt a big excitement for the ladies in the audience but even today it's a sensual moment as Gable's swarthy beauty is revealed for all to see. The hitchhiking scene is also fun as we see them really work together for the first time and the punch line works just as well today as it did at the time of release. I could go on and on about why individual scenes have a special magic to them but I will try instead to talk about the men behind the magic Capra and  .\n\nThe screenplay is incredible as it is all things at once, managing to balance Gable's acerbic lines with Colbert's more starry-eyed romantic dialogue in the second act. It is this balancing act which it pulls of so well that makes it a near-perfect romantic comedy being equal parts romantic and funny. The big moments in the film, Colbert's tearful declaration of love and Gable's harsh rejection and Gable receiving the news that she will be marrying King Westley and not him, have the right amount of panache but they never veer into hysterics and always remain light enough to keep the audience happy and invested in the central couple. This screenplay and that of Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally\u00e2\u00a6 (1989) are sacred texts within the world of romantic comedies and their authentic charm and sweetly romantic dialogue are lacking in lesser offerings like Bridget Jones's Diary (2001).\n\nCapra's direction is also key to the magic of the film as the movie rollicks along at a pleasant pace and we never spend too long on one scene. The film also looks beautiful with Colbert and Gable's faces luminous against the darkness of the night sky and the faces of the bus-goers captured with a sense of love. You don't expect great cinematography or \u00e2~visionary' direction in a romantic comedy usually the dialogue and the acting is far more important but here one of the greats displays his ability to keep an audience invested in an admittedly thin plot.\n\nThe actors are fabulous, they earned both Best Actor and Best Actress for their work, and their chemistry is powerful. The guy and gal who love each other but won't admit is a common trope, it's even present in Shakespeare for god's sake, despite this it doesn't feel stale here. Gable is handsome, charming and confident but he is convincing when his face falls at the news that he won't be marrying her and Colbert's expressive little face is delightful when she lets go of her hang-ups and joins the sing-along in the bus. Their witty back and forth is impossibly pleasurable to watch and I would have gladly spent a few more hours with this wonderful pair.\n\nThis was definitely, in my opinion, the best film of 1934 and the Academy should be proud for rewarding a production that has brought so many joy and that's popularity has rightfully endured.",

The fact that they both won Oscars for their performances must have been a shock. Gable and Colbert have great chemistry, whether the film requires them to bicker or cooperate, and the time they spend together builds up an organic bond which is best demonstrated when they're apart, and long to be reunited. I enjoyed the performances and the script, and it's refreshing to see a film made at this time that has so much respect for women and their choices. The heroine gets to make her own decisions and figure things out for herself, she isn't just a pawn being moved round a board, and she gets a lot of great lines too. The visual quality might have diminished somewhat, but the gags and humility remain as fresh as ever.",

It isn't shot nicely and the camera work could have been a lot better but it surely is edited perfectly. The execution by Frank Capra is apt for the script and bodes well with the tone throughout the course of it as he keeps it light and breezy. Clark Gable is as always convincing on his portrayal and so has been Claudette Colbert on her parallel role with him as a bratty celebrity.

The film is a fizzy comedy of errors played to perfection, and Gable and Colbert's ever-imitated exchanges will never be forgotten.\nIt Happened One Night remains a genuine joy to watch for anyone with a heart and a sense of humour, and Hollywood will always be indebted to Capra for kickstarting a trend that would last for decades - if not a decade or two too long.",

Gable is a newspaper reporter who's been fired.  They find each other on a crowded train, and are forced to sit together.  They hate one another at first, but after spending time on a couple of busses, a car, in the haystack together, and in a hotel room divided by a clothesline with a blanket hanging over it ... well, you get the idea.   At one point he carries her across a stream caveman style, over his shoulder, and gives her a swat on the behind as they debate what constitutes a piggyback ride.   They confuse each other's motivations and split at the end, Colbert off to wed another (and in a very pretty dress), but we all know where it's heading, and this one is complete with a 'runaway bride' scene.  \n\nI don't know if the movie was worthy of sweeping the Academy Awards (and Colbert herself didn't think much of it), but it's still sharp with its dialog, and quite entertaining.  Aside from the main story line, it has a nice 'Capra' touch in having everyone on a bus (including the driver) singing verses of 'The Man on the Flying Trapeze' to pass the time.   I also smiled over this interchange after Gable's character had tossed some newspapers off the bus to make space for his seat:\n\nBus driver: \"Oh, fresh guy, huh?  What you need is a good sock in the nose.\"\nClark Gable: \"Listen pardner, you might like my nose, but I do.  I always wear it out in the open, where if anyone wants to take a sock at it, they can do it.\"\n\"Oh, yeah?\"\n\"Now that's a brilliant answer.  Why didn't I think of it?   Our conversation could have been over long ago.\"\n\"Oh, yeah?\"\n\"You keep that up, we're not going to get anywhere.\"\n\"Oh, yeah?\"\n\"Ya got me.  Yeah!\"   (to chuckling from the other passengers)",

The film, though tame by today's standards, even lets them use their sexuality fun & risky ways (Gable reportedly killed the undershirt business for years in his famous undressing scene while Colbert legs showed a new way to hitchhike).  Behind the camera, Capra keeps the film fast-moving, focusing just on the main plot (the only subplot is Andrews father, nicely played by Walter Connolly, and his desparate search to find her) while Riskin script gives some of the best dialogue you'll ever hear.

I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, \"it was a different time!\" but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.\nDespite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, \"she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret\" but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word \"demented\" popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.\n\n\nThe characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks. I hope no bizarre situation occurs in which I am ever forced to watch this again.\n\n4/10\n\nBye love you",

The performances by Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are superb, and possibly the first truly deserving Oscar wins, even by today's standards. The story, directed effectively by the legendary Frank Capra, is an entertaining one - she's a wealthy socialite who runs away from her father to marry a slimy rich dude, and he's a charismatic reporter who keeps her under his protection so she won't get caught by the media circus searching for her. There are tons of funny and obviously influential moments, from the train scene where Colbert sits next to an obnoxious guy and Gable pretends to be her husband so the guy will go away, to the hitchhiking scene where she flashes her leg so a car will pick them up. The story, while admittedly a bit bloated at times, is full of witty dialogue and powerful symbolism, with the \"Walls of Jericho\" metaphor being the most obvious and potent one. It was the first film (and the only for about 40 years) to win all 5 top Oscars (picture, director, actress, actor, adapted screenplay), and for its time there was hardly a more deserving film.",

What we have here is the story of a young heiress (played by Claudette Colbert) who is frustrated with her overbearing father, and his threats to have her new marriage annulled. So she hops on a bus to go be with her husband. On the bus she meets a reporter (played by Clark Gable) who agrees to help her with her journey in exchange for an exclusive story. I always find it charming when I watch an old film like this and see how they handle the modesty of the times. The whole \"walls of Jericho\" thing was a lot of fun, and it paid off in a great way in the final scene. The pair of lead actors are just wonderful. I was surprised how Colbert was able to make her character so likable despite being spoiled rotten. Ordinarily that is a character type that I hate, but she was so sweet it didn't grate on my nerves. Gable is playing that lovable loser who just can't seem to catch a break but I always find myself wishing he would. He plays the heartbreak scenes so expertly and it pulls at your heartstrings because you can tell exactly what he is thinking behind those strong eyes.\n\nOne of the challenges in any romantic comedy is creating good chemistry between the leads, and I think they did that well here. Between the scene where they are pretending to be married, and the scene where they are trying to hitch a ride, I was laughing quite a lot, but also convinced they had a real connection. I think what didn't work for me is that this story is so familiar. Obviously It Happened One Night probably did it long before any of the others where I've seen a similar theme, so it shouldn't lose points for that, but I just think there have been improvements made in the genre. There were moments where I thought this movie dragged a little bit as well, and that's probably because I knew how things would end and I was just waiting for it to get there. That being said, there are a lot of iconic moments in this film, some that I had seen many times before without realizing they came from here. The acting was top notch, and there were a lot of funny moments too. I don't know if I'll ever revisit It Happened One Night on my own, but if someone asked I would gladly watch it again.",

It surely doesn't take a genius to notice that it's a mighty tall order to make a movie that would still be able to rise to the occasion after eighty years, but Frank Capra and Robert Riskin don't seem to have too hard of a time doing just that.

As the first film to win the Oscars grand slam, it also serves as the blueprint for every romantic comedy and screwball comedy that followed. It is hilarious, charming, and most importantly, very well made. At the time it was being made, no studio wanted it. Eventually, Capra received the go-ahead, Gable was cast as a punishment for being an annoying actor, and Colbert was assigned after the studio offered her twice her normal paycheck. Pretty soon, Capra was a household name, and this best picture winner was cemented in history. \n\nThe first half of the film is the best. Filled with one hilarious antic after another, the first half serves as a comedic travelogue that obviously inspired \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.\" The second half sinks into romance that started the predictable plot of every romantic comedy EVER!!! It should be the most interesting, but it ends up being the least, mostly because it was the first in a LONG line of romantic comedies. However, the acting is top notch considering the bribery, and the character development is lacking, but that doesn't have any effect on the film really. The plot is mundane, but the screenplay is excellent, taking the overall idea and twisting and turning it into many different directions and places, all with great success.\n\nUltimately, this is one of the great films of Hollywood, and certainly one of the best comedies. With its long line of memorable jokes and setups, this film shows that everyone involved has real talent, and that a little sophistication makes any humor all the more appealing, something modern comedies should consider. It was a blueprint for romances and comedies alike. It is a film where I kept looking at my watch and saw that the film was only just beginning, and then leaped with joy in anticipation of what great thing would happen next.",

And my proclivity doesn't change here.  Alas, this award-winner just simply has too many implausibilities for my taste.  The variety of scenarios these two main characters go through in a course of several days is just too unrealistic.  I know, I know....  I'm supposed to simply not look at this realistically, but simply go with the flow of snappy dialog and old-fashioned charm.  And, to be honest, I did sit through the entire film, compelled to see if there would be any detour to what I viewed as its predictable trajectory.  No such detour(s).  That said, there was a certain charm to the hamminess of the actors' performances, and slap-dash vignettes.  Reading the \"inside scoop\" of how this film inevitably came about (on Wikipedia) did give me more interest than I may not have had initially.  In short, I'm glad I've finally watched It Happened One Night.  It made for a breezy hour and a-half for what was a couch-potato evening....  :)",

She finds herself hiding on a bus sitting next to down-on-his luck reporter Peter Warren, deftly played by wise cracking Clark Gable. The story takes off in funny and memorable predicaments for this unlikely couple. Both Ellie and Peter are fiercely independent with their personal goals on the line and yet they are forced to completely depend on each other. Peter is not about to let his lead story escape and she needs him to help her get to New York and \"Westley,\" the weasel husband she married in haste only interested in her money. In the meantime, an array of colorful characters including Ellie's father bent on annulling her phony marriage, help make this film a wonderful screwball comedy. This Frank Capra film is the original road trip story packed with a fast paced dialogue by Robert Riskin who won the oscar for best screenplay. Gable and Colbert also deliver great performances that garnered both of them Academy awards! The scene in which they are stranded off the road and Peter teaches \"Brat\" (Ellie) the art of hitchhiking is funny as he fails miserably, until cool and collected Ellie succeeds in stopping a car by lifting her skirt and exposing her leg. Clark Gable munching a carrot with his mouth full in a fast talking performance according to Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones of Warner Brothers cartoons admitted was the inspiration for another iconic character, Bugs Bunny! \"It happened one Night\" is sheer joy to watch and director Frank Capra is at his best. This 1934 gem is why so many other films that came later, copied and recreated famous scenes from \"It Happened One Night.\" With very little money, Peter and Ellie register as a married couple to get a room only to hoist a blanket between the two beds; \"the walls of Jericho.\" This is a classic scene and a turning point in the story for the two sparring characters who are falling in love. Even funnier is when detectives hired by Ellie's father close in on the couple at the motel and they improvise a domestic argument to fool them, only to burst out laughing when the coast is clear. \"It Happened One Night\" is the first film to win 5 Academy awards including Best Picture. It should be part of everyone's movie collection. It was released on January 1st, 1934 and after 80 years, \"It Happened One Night\" is still fresh, funny and a classic screwball comedy!",

Frank Capra made movies that you walk away from feeling great; it may tug on your heartstrings at times, but by the time 'The End' comes up on the screen, you're sure to have a big smile on your face.  This is actually the first Clark Gable movie I have seen, and I have to say I was impressed by his acting abilities; he overflows with natural charisma, and at times, he has the swagger and confidence of an assertive drunk.  He shares a perfect chemistry with Colbert, and when they're playing characters pretending to be someone else, it's magic; there's a bit where they pretend to be in an abusive relationship, and it is quite hilarious.  There is also the famous hitchhiking scene which has been parodied and spoofed a countless number of times, and that is worth the price of admission alone.  This is a wonderful, feel good movie.",

But in the case of It Happened One Night, I find it to be probably the most overrated comedy of all-time.\r\n\r\nWhat's the story? Well, a spoiled rich daughter (Claudette Colbert) marries wealthy King Westley (Jameson Thomas), a marriage that her father (Walter Connoly) objects to. She ends up escaping her father, by jumping off a boat, and travels to New York to have a life with Westley. But on the way, she runs into the drunken, and usually fired reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who recognizes her and sees this as a chance to make a huge story out of it. But the more they're together, the more they fall in love.\r\n\r\nIt Happened One Night was directed by Frank Capra, who would later direct the wonderful drama It's a Wonderful Life and the powerful Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Capra is one of the most acclaimed directors, and I was expecting a whole lot out of this film. But sadly, I didn't.\r\n\r\nOriginally, no one took this film seriously. Clark Gable was punished by another studio to do this film, and Claudette Colbert viewed the experience as \"the worst movie ever made.\" Despite a slow start, the film became an overnight smash and would even win Best Picture and it's other big four, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. The films It Happened One Night beat out for Best Picture was The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Cleopatra (no, not Elizabeth Taylor), Flirtation Walk, The Gay Divorcee, Here Comes the Navy, The House of Rothschild, Imitation of Life, One Night of Love, The Thin Man, Viva Villa, and The White Parade. The films that lost were probably much better than It Happened One Night. The fact that both lead actors didn't want to be a part of this film shows how disappointing this film is.\r\n\r\nWhy is it disappointing? First, it's not really that funny. I did get a chuckle out of me in a couple of scenes, such as the famous hitchhiking scene, scenes where Gable and Colbert pretend to be a married couple, and \"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\". But many of the jokes, such as the \"Walls of Jericho\", seemed dated and the film turned into a horrific melodrama in the second half. I didn't want a \"I love you. I don't want to lose you.\" kind of thing in a comedy. I hate it when a film like this changes it's tone by surprise. It usually never works, though it did in Sullivan's Travels, but that's different.\r\n\r\nClark Gable is an excellent actor, if you watch him in Gone with the Wind. While he's likeable here (especially if you're a woman and you like muscular bodies), but the \"cuteness\" didn't always work. Claudette Colbert, like  Gable, was likeable as well, but became really annoying in the second half. Everyone else did very little to make the film better.\r\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy some moments, I was let down by It Happened One Night. The comedy is bland, the acting is bland, and the fact that Hitler and Stalin loved this movie is a disgrace to Hollywood cinema, plus the fact that Gable's carrot-eating inspired Bugs Bunny (Bugs is much funnier, by the way.) Supposedly, this film inspired such comedies such as Bringing Up Baby, but Bringing Up Baby easily kicked It Happened One Night's butt. I suggest  you watch Bringing Up Baby instead.",

While some parts are quite idealistic, it is essentially a screwball romantic comedy and a great one at that. The direction from Frank Capra is classy and dignified and cleverly gives us an insight into gender and class status, and the screenplay is sophisticated and funny. The humour still works, I found myself laughing when Clark Gable said \"now don't tell you're in love with the bus driver\" for example. The cinematography is beautiful and dynamic and the music is richly and sensitively scored. The acting is very, very good. Clark Gable looks handsome here, and he gives a close to hysterical performance as Peter, with his impeccable comic timing and witty humour. Claudette Colbert is lovely as Ellie, the spoiled yet somewhat independent heiress who Peter falls for. The two actors show great, charming chemistry together on screen, and they are terrifically supported by especially Walter Connolly as Andrews. The story is relatively simple, but I liked its simplicity, it was effective. Overall, a wonderful, funny and charming film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The writing is strong and witty especially which is clearly visible when it offers a similar gravitas to the supporting cast to factor in on drama and comedy too. It isn't shot nicely and the camera work could have been a lot better but it surely is edited perfectly. The execution by Frank Capra is apt for the script and bodes well with the tone throughout the course of it as he keeps it light and breezy. Clark Gable is as always convincing on his portrayal and so has been Claudette Colbert on her parallel role with him as a bratty celebrity. The only missing puzzle is the stakes that are projected in here are taken lightly by the characters and the makers which clearly isn't feasible at all. It Happened One Night is a soothing and independent night if not appropriately taken hold of.",
