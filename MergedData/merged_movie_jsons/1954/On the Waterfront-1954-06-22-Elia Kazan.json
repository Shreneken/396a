            "content": "\"On the Waterfront\" is basically the story of one man, Terry Malloy, a young dock worker with a little, and unsuccessful, experience as a boxer but not much intelligence or purpose\u0085 He wastes his time around the docks, vaguely discontented about his life and revealing a tender trace in his otherwise tough manner as he tends his pigeons caged on the roof of his modest building\u0085 His brother Charley (Rod Steiger), a suave opportunistic lawyer, works for the local dockers' union, headed by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the arrogant mob boss\u0085 Friendly takes affectionate interest in Terry and tries to make things easy for him\u0085 He also takes advantage of Terry by involving him in the killing of an uncooperative docker\u0085 Unaware of their murderous intentions, Terry sets the trap for the man who is thrown from a roof top because he allowed himself to be interviewed by a crime investigating commission\u0085Terry's alienation from the crooked union leaders starts when he meets the dead man's sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), and realizes the grief he has brought into her life\u0085 She asks his help in bringing the racketeers to justice, as does Father Barry (Karl Malden), a priest of complete goodness and rightness\u0085 Brando's moral dilemma was superbly drawn in the film\u0085 He's an ordinary man finding the courage to stand up and be counted\u0085 As portrayed by Brando he is touchingly believable\u0085 The rest of the cast is excellent:Cobb is extremely good as the brute fury boss who intimidates the workers into silence, stopping at nothing to maintain his position of power on the docks... Rod Steiger gives his finest performance as the clever and suave opportunistic lawyer who works for the local docker's union...Eva Marie Saint manages to make the blood go through Brando's valves reviving and creating a heart that never existed before... Karl Malden is hard and clear as the activist Catholic priest who continue encouraging other longshoremen to testify, inciting Brando to fight for his rights\u0097regardless of the cost\u0097rather than be a pawn in a ruthless system of bribes and killings... \"On the Waterfront\" is one of the great American films, not only because it bravely spreads a strong light on the violation of justice, but because it is a powerful piece of cinema, which push forward a classic study of man's responsibility to his fellow man... The film won eight Academy Awards...",

            "review_title": "Powerful portrait of N.Y. docks , being stunningly performed and excellently directed by Elia Kazan",
            "content": "This compelling and dynamic drama is set on New York's dock where mobsters control the Union and stevedores . An ex-prize fighter named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando who deservedly won an Academy Award) turned longshoreman struggles to stand up to his corrupt union bosses (Lee J Cobb) and is embroiled in violence . Malloy faces the terrible dilemma of whether or not to turn informer . While his brother (it was originally offered to Lawrence Tierney , but he asked for too much money so the role went to Rod Steiger who was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance) is a crooked lawyer and he meets a beautiful ex-nun (Eva Maria Saint , Grace Kelly turned down the role of Edie Doyle, deciding to make Rear Window instead) and falls in love for her .This is an interesting and thought-provoking film with attractive plot by screenwriter Budd Schulberg , containing intense drama with pungent lines , emotion , wonderful performances , memorable climax , magnificent direction and classic musical score by maestro Leonard Berstein . For this brooding film and highy charged throughout story writer Budd Schulberg took the idea from newspapers , as he started with an expose series written for The New York Sun by reporter Malcolm Johnson , the articles won him a Pulitzer Prize and were reinforced by the 1948 murder of a New York dock hiring boss which woke America to the killings , graft and extortion that were endemic on the New York waterfront . Marvelous acting by entire casting . Marlon Brando is perfect as stevedore who faces the thorny dilemma of whether or not to become himself into an unfortunate informer . The taxicab scene , one of the most known scenes in the cinema, in which Brando began to improvise some dialogue , while surprising Rod Steiger listened and Kazan simply stood back and let the two actors direct themselves . Along with first-rate main cast : Brando , Steiger , Eva Maria Saint , appearing here and there great secondaries giving nice interpretations , such as : Lee J. Cobb , Leif Erickson , Michel V. Gazzo, Pat Henning , James Westerfield , Martin Balsam , Pat Hingle , Nehemiah Persoff, among others . Being film debuts of Michael V. Gazzo, Pat Hingle, Martin Balsam, and Eva Marie Saint . The leading characters were based on real people: Terry Malloy was based on longshoreman and whistle-blower Anthony De Vincenzo ; Father Barry was based on waterfront priest John M. Corridan ; Johnny Friendly was based on mobster Albert Anastasia. On the Waterfront is widely known to be an act of expiation on the part of Elia Kazan for naming names to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) during the Joseph McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s.This trend-setting film has a gritty portrait of N. Y. waterfront and stand up well nowadays and resulted to be a huge financial hit , it is a winner all the way , as from a budget of just under $1 million, the film went on to gross ten times its production costs in its initial release. And winning eight Academy Awards , including : Best Picture , Direction (Elia Kazan) , Actor (Marlon Brando), special mention for Eva Maria Saint who gave a debut performance that won her the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, Cinematography (cameraman Boris Kaufman) , Art Director (Richard Day) . The motion picturre was compellingly directed by Elia Kazan , and it seems to be a direct response to Miller's play The Crucible. In fact , Kazan intended it as a direct attack at his former close friend Arthur Miller who had been openly critical of Elia's actions . Rating : Very good , above average , and a real must see . Well worth watching .",

            "review_title": "A Few Side Remarks on a Consensus Classic",
            "content": "No need to echo consensus points, except to say the movie is indeed a powerhouse. Instead, I'll offer a few side comments. The production took place during the McCarthy era. Thus, I expect the catalytic role of Father Barry is no accident, appealing, as it does, to the aggressive anti- communist sentiments of the period. Apparently, initial preferences were to make the union gangsters communists instead of real gangsters. For various reasons, the communist idea was shot down and we get Johnnie Friendly, instead. Still, the religious message is spread on pretty thick by a forcefully effective Karl Malden as the working class Father.In this same political vein, Director Kazan was never forgiven by large segments of the Hollywood left for naming names before the HUAC sub-committee on communist influence in the US. Apparently, he looked upon this movie as a defense of his role before the committee. After all, it's Terry's (Brando) willingness to testify about underworld control of the union that breaks their hold. But, of course, the movie couldn't end on a bland courtroom proceeding, so we get the powerful showdown on the docks, where Terry undergoes a purifying beating for his earlier collaboration with Friendly.It's hard to say enough about the effectiveness of the decision to film on actual dockside in New Jersey. The uncompromising nature of that filming lends necessary grit to an explosive drama. Note too the ongoing sounds of the waterfront that keep reminding us.Maybe I missed something, but I can't understand why the mob killed Charley (Steiger) instead of Terry once they knew Terry would inform. After all, what's going to motivate a guy to retaliate more than killing his brother. Charlie's dangling corpse does make for a powerful scene, as does Terry and Edie's expressionist flight down the shadowy alleyway. But the choice to kill Charlie still seems murky to me.Anyway, these are a few side remarks on a much reviewed film that remains an undiminished classic, even after 60-years.",

            "review_title": "A classic for all the right reasons",
            "content": "Watching On The Waterfront nowadays, two scenes stand out head and shoulders above the rest. First is the impassioned speech by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to the gathered dock workers in the hull of a ship where he tries to rally them against the mobsters running their lives. Second is the confrontation between Terry and Charlie Malloy (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger) in the back of a taxi which ends in one brother pointing a gun at the other and Brando's now legendary \"contender speech.\" Both of them are sequences where the characters do nothing but talk but each is a fine example of what makes On The Waterfront the undeniable classic it is; acting, scripting, cinematography, music, everything fits into one cohesive whole and the end result is a welcome addition to any film collection.The story here concerns Terry Malloy, a New York shipyard worker who finds his conscience bothering him when one of his friends is murdered. Terry at first is a tough guy with a grim outlook (\"you know my philosophy on life, give it to 'em before they give to you\") who despite his inner turmoil refuses to confess anything to the Police as it would make him a \"rat.\" However, the arrival of Malden's headstrong Preacher and the victim's innocent sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint in her debut appearance) throws his deaf and dumb world into chaos. Soon, Terry finds himself falling for Edie and the Preacher's words hit home, leaving the angry young dockworker to question what's really right. The mob meanwhile aren't too happy about Terry's UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP and begin to pile on the pressure, especially his older brother Charlie who's torn between loyalty to his boss and looking out for his younger sibling. Before anyone can put a lid on things, the dockyard becomes a very tense place to be.Brando of course puts his heart and soul into his performance. Terry by his very nature isn't one to carry his heart on his sleeve and so the great Method Actor is left to convey his turmoil through body language alone. It is a testament to how good he is that you can tell exactly what Terry is feeling even though he hardly ever expresses it verbally. Instead his shoulders hunch with resigned indignation and his eyes spark with anger, Brando playing the part so well he more or less disappears into the character completely. While he may have taken a lot of the credit however, he is far from the only strong presence in the film as Karl Malden's rock hard Preacher is just as compelling, his depiction of the dignified man of Christ who isn't afraid to drink beer and smoke cigarettes with the Wharf rats being a refreshingly positive portrayal of a Catholic leader. Eva Marie Saint meanwhile puts in a convincing portrayal of Edie, but she is hamstrung a little by some old fashioned writing. Her pursuit of her brother's murderers give her some powerful moments but there are a couple of instances where it becomes all too clear that the part was written by a man. However, she still gives us one of the most touching moments in the film, a confrontation with Terry where most of their chat is disrupted by a tug horn that is achingly sad despite the absence of dialogue.Acting is only one half of the equation of course and needless to say, the story remains constantly gripping. The murder that opens the film leaves an instant grip on the viewer's attention and as Terry spirals further into an intricate web of half truths, things get incredibly dark. The New York tenement blocks that tower over the proceedings provide an imposing sense of claustrophobia while the rooftops are a smoke laden jungle of chimney stacks and TV aerials. However, if you look closely it becomes apparent that the crew still had some fun with the material and there is some subtle humour to be had - a wedding party degenerating into a brawl and a bar full of panicked customers emptying into the streets followed by a shot of one isolated individual desperately jumping into the bathroom.All in all therefore, On The Waterfront is a film that is thoroughly deserving of its reputation. Brando excels in his role and heads up a highly talented cast giving it their all. Most of all though, it's an engaging and captivating story of urban paranoia, filled with tough guys spitting out slang in barking New York accents. Think you're a big shot, do ya? Huh? Well do us all a favour and check this one out. Ah enough a youse guys, ged outta here.",

            "content": "\"All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.\" (Edmund Burke) The evil in 1954's \"On the Waterfront\" is the union bosses, brilliantly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger and their thugs. They are allowed to do business because of the fright, intimidation, and passiveness of an entire group of longshoremen, who either work or don't while the big shots take kickbacks and steal from them. Then Joey Doyle, who had agreed to testify against the union bosses, is set up by a clueless Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and thrown off of a roof. His sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint) is determined to find out what happened. But no one will talk. She shames Father Barry (Karl Malden) into taking more of an interest in what is happening on the docks, and he does. Still, no one's talking. Terry falls in love with Edie but still can't do the right thing. Another man is killed. When the killing finally affects Terry, he realizes something has to change.\"On the Waterfront\" is one of the most amazing films ever made, directed by the great Elia Kazan. There were three Oscar nominations (Malden, Cobb and Steiger) in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the film took home the top acting awards, Kazan as director, and best film, best screenplay, best editing, best cinematography, best art direction. There was a nomination for Leonard Bernstein's fantastic score, and it's difficult to understand how he could have lost the award. This is the only film for which he wrote incidental music. It is fantastic, particularly in the tender moments between Terry and Edie.\"On the Waterfront\" has the classic performance of Marlon Brando, a man who is loyal to his brother Charlie (Steiger) even though Charlie ruined Terry's fight career and now is part of the union corruption. Brando is sensational as a tortured young man (based on whistle-blower Anthony DiVincenzo) who knows what he should do, but the price is too high. It's his love of Edie that gives him a conscience. She's from another world and hasn't been jaded by life yet. It's impossible to believe that this role was offered to Grace Kelly, but it was. Why Kazan thought her cold beauty and finishing school accent would have fit into this scenario is beyond me. Saint is perfect - warm, strong, gentle and most importantly, comes off as the kind of girl who lives in a blue collar neighborhood.Lee J. Cobb as Johnny Friendly (based on real-life mobster Albert Anastasia) gives a bombastic, violent, and scary performance; Karl Malden is letter-perfect as the priest who fights for Terry's soul; and Steiger is excellent as Charlie, a weak man who has taken advantage of his brother to feather his own nest. Karl Malden's character of Father Barry was based on the real-life \"waterfront priest,\" Father John M. Corridan, who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the west side of Manhattan. Father Corridan was interviewed by screenwriter Budd Schulberg.The saddest thing in the film is the attitude of the young boy who helps Terry take care of Joey's pigeons. He's already been inculcated with the \"D&D\" (deaf and dumb) policy of the longshoremen.The cloudy, rich atmosphere of the story is captured by the Hoboken, New Jersey locations - although this is a fictionalized version of events on the New York waterfront.The end of \"Raging Bull\" is a homage to \"On the Waterfront.\" The end of \"On the Waterfront\" will give you goosebumps.Evil only triumphs when good men do nothing. When those same men stand up for what they believe in, they show evil for what it really is - cheap, lousy, and dirty.",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 105I finished On the Waterfront about 2 hours ago, and something strange happened. Something I haven't done in a long while, I can't for certain remember the film that caused it. When the film ended, I sat in silence for about 10 minutes.On the Waterfront is an inspiring film. There's a feeling you get watching it- movie magic. Something great is playing out in front of your eyes and you are taking in the collective effort of geniuses. Right from the start, with the dramatic score (that stays fine throughout) introducing the film, something special is happening.The plot synopsis gives the appearance of a plain film, and plain it is not. The mob, murder and romance are the stars of this show and right off the start this is apparent- like the lighting of a fuse. Then as the wick burns down, the drama unfolds. We learn about Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), his past and present, and his conflicted thoughts. We are introduced to characters that push him down the path he has to choose. A viewer grows to care about Terry, and until he decides for himself, we have no idea what he'll do.This film is an acting gold magnet- it received 5 nominations in acting alone. I'll start with Brando's legendary performance. It doesn't matter what you think of him offscreen because for 2 hours he is at his very best, one of the best in acting ever. Terry is a fantastic character and Brando gives an unrivalled, honest performance.Wanting him to stand against his negative influences are Father Barry (Karl Malden) and Edie (Eva Marie Saint). The father is a frustrated man, furious in his quest for righteousness. Only in The Exorcist have I liked a priest as much. He gives a raging performance, at its peak with a scolding of the longshoremen. Riveting. With him, but quite the opposite in character is Edie, who falls into the plot. Saint aces her characters role, which is to mold Terry. Their scenes are tender, believable, and in a recurring theme with the film, honest. During their bar scene I thought they could've just made a romance together, leaving out all the drama.On the other side, the mob union leaders, we have Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the head honcho, who is ferocious, intimidating, and impeccably evil to honest workers. There's also Charley (Rod Steiger), Terry's older brother who is comfortably in with the mob. I didn't notice him at all, except for 'the scene' which must've made him in the Academy's eyes.Speaking of 'the scene', the pivotal Taxi cab dialogue between Terry and Charley, you can tell as it happens this is the moment, the peak of On the Waterfront and Marlon Brando. It is the turning point of the film, where Terry makes some huge realizations that we can infer from only his face and tone. I won't even discuss his words, as it's been done by absolutely everyone. There are several other great scenes, like the 'It's a crucifixion' speech and the various rooftop scenes.Right until the last scene we aren't sure what will happen. I won't spoil it, but it's elevating. Heroic. Even enlightening.On the Waterfront is about the small speaking out against the large and corrupt. It's about going against the flow, breaking the silence. Sometime in your life you were or will be in Terry's position to some degree, and you'll either do or don't. Leave it at that, please don't read the director's reasoning behind the film. Take it for what it is: a fantastic film that will make you want to be a better person who can speak out against wrongdoers. Powerful indeed.I thought On the Waterfront would be good, but not this good. With stupendous performances, a top notch story and a strong message, On the Waterfront is film at it's best. 9.4/10",

            "content": "I watched \"On the Waterfront\" last night, and I have seen it many times. This movie is a perfect capsule for any viewer. The actors are superb in their roles, the dialogue is raw and powerful, the staging is tight and reflects the claustrophobic nature of the characters' lives in this part of Hoboken. You have the feeling that they never leave this area of maybe a few blocks, because they feel trapped by their circumstances, poverty, grueling work, and the corruption that's endemic in this place and system.Marlon Brando is Terry, a failed prize fighter with deep regrets and loneliness, who is a low-level thug in this corrupt system dominated by the bombastic, cruel union boss, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb in an electrifying performance). He rules the waterfront with brutality and terror. To make Terry feel even more trapped is the fact that his only living relative, his brother, Charlie (Rod Steiger), is Friendly's right-hand man. Terry has no great ambitions in life, and seems resigned to this bleak path until fate, and two shining lights, appear in his life: Edie (Eva Marie Saint), a decent, loving, determined and angelic blonde woman, and Father Barry (Karl Malden), the local priest who can throw a punch, drink a beer and stand up to the mob with the strength of his faith behind him. Terry and Edie embark on a seemingly doomed romance that both actors play so beautifully. You can feel their yearning, their awkwardness, their passion for each other and their deep connection -- all without the explicit nudity and fake grunting used in contemporary movies. When they embrace, you feel their desperation and desire for each other in a profound way.\"On the Waterfront\" is certainly director Elia Kazan's great masterpiece. The performances are all outstanding, and Brando is just a marvel of tortured pain and passion and agony and courage. One particular thing I love about \"On the Waterfront\" is the scenery. Every set or outdoor shot conveys the grim, cold nature of the characters' lives. There is no movie glamour and little comfort here. Only a hot cup of coffee made on a plug-in heating plate in a \"cold-water flat,\" or a beer and a shot hastily consumed in a waterfront saloon are pleasures to these characters. Their clothes are patched. Edie's hair isn't \"styled,\" and she wears no makeup. Terry's face is a bit scarred. Malden's nose is...as we all know. The gritty setting feels real. If you've never seen this movie for any reason, do not delay!",

Even though it isn't classified as \"film noir,\" it might as well be, as it has the earmarks of one: gritty, downbeat with a feeling of dread, magnificent black-and-white cinematography, etc.It's certainly not a \"fun\" movie but if you appreciate great film-making, you have to rate this near the top of the list Not only is the direction (by one of the all-time greats, Elia Kazan) superb and the photography striking, the acting also is top-rate.Marlon Brando was just riveting to watch in here and deserved all the accolades he received for his performance. Talk about a guy with mixed emotions and a tormented soul! Eva Marie Saint, as Brando's \"conscience\" and love interest, proved to be worthy in her role.The rest of the characters were angry people, always shouting it seemed, always upset at someone. Even the priest, played by Karl Malden, was that way although one of his passionate speeches was remarkable to hear. How many films does one hear about Jesus Christ being everywhere men are? None I can recall, offhand. He, like Saint's character, also influenced Brando to do the right thing.Lee J. Cobb filled his bill as the angriest of them all, the labor boss who would have anyone killed who dare speak out against his illegal practices, and Rod Steiger was his normal intense self as Brando's older brother. Hey, almost everyone was intense in this film. It gets you involves and wears you out by the end.Steiger and Brando's conversation in an automobile fairly late in the film (\"I couda been a contenda\") is one of the most famous scenes in movie history, but I found many memorable scenes in this movie....too many to recount here.Suffice to say if you are looking for a hard-nosed drama with great acting and photography, a film that still looks and sounds up-to-date in many respects, don't be afraid to give this \"oldie\" a look. You'll see why it's considered one of the best movies of all time.",

It concerns a longshoreman's inner and outer struggles in exposing the corruption of union bosses.Unquestionably, the strength of the film is the acting. Brando's performance in particular is one for the ages. He won his first Oscar for this role and Eva Marie Saint also garnered an Oscar in her introductory film role. On top of that Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb & Rod Steiger all earned Best Supporting Actor nominations. These accolades give an idea of the level of talent on display here.Kazan's direction is well done as he strives for a gritty, realistic look. Shooting on location was an important part of that. Leonard Bernstein's score, on the other hand, is often overbearing. There's nothing wrong with the music itself, only the prominence of it.The main area in which I feel the film doesn't quite deliver is the story. The film does a fine job of exploring the characters but I find that the underlying storyline doesn't really work for me. The main premise is a good one but after the initial confrontation I began to lose interest.

            "content": "I queued for twenty minutes in a crowded cinema to get into this film, and was lucky to have even a sidelong seat... yet I was left in the end feeling disappointed. The only people on the IMDb who fail to worship \"On the Waterfront\" appear to be those who hate its director - on 'ethical' grounds. Well, I care little enough about Elia Kazan's history or politics, yet all the same somehow I wasn't sufficiently impressed. The film features all the technical skill of Hollywood's Golden Age, supporting actors and establishing shots and, yes, innovative use of music; in many ways I'd rate it 8 out of 10. But the best film ever - the greatest star performance? That I honestly can't see, and I admit that the high expectations hurt my reaction to the result. But thinking back, I find the chief causes of my vague dissatisfaction to be twofold: Marlon Brando, and the too-convenient outcomes of the plot.Brando I suppose I just don't 'get' - I saw him in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"One-Eyed Jacks\", and missed whatever-it-was I was supposed to spot then. Where I'm concerned he holds if anything a sort of physical anti-charisma - the slouch, the mumble - and the acting that supposedly makes his contemporaries look like posturing hams, I simply don't see. And so in my ignorance, not knowing that this was held to be one of the greatest performances of the century, I was left with the impression that Marlon Brando was actually the weak link in this film.The revelation that the character is thirty years of age comes as a real shock: he's treated and acts throughout as little more than a sulky teenager. The lack of expression may simply be skillful acting to depict the character's stunted emotional growth, but I'm afraid I found it hard to care much what happened to Brando's Terry Malloy, whereas Rod Steiger, with far briefer screen-time, brought brother Charley and his wrenching choice vividly to life. But there's nothing inherently wrong with the role of Terry, and I can't help feeling that it would have been fascinating to see what some other actor might also have made of it.My other serious problem, unfortunately, was the way that the plot treats our heroes with kid gloves... thus undermining the whole sense of menace on which any \"one man against the Mob\" plot ultimately relies. Yes, the script is happy enough to bump off a minor character or two in order to emphasise the threat of Friendly's organisation, and yes, Terry does finally get beaten up. But compared to the summary justice administered to Joey Doyle or Dugan for far lighter offences, a punch-up seems pretty easy going - Terry's lucky not to fall victim to another 'accident'.But the fact remains that up until then, our heroes have got away with open defiance. As far as the Production Code goes, Edie is evidently sacrosanct by virtue of her sex and the priest by virtue of his cloth (despite Dugan's portentous warnings, the worst the Father gets seems to be a rotten tomato). Brando is, one can only assume, preserved by being The Hero.A highly dramatic assassination attempt amounts to no more than driving a lorry at him in the street, with no attempt to finish the job as he takes the bait and hangs around Charley's body to emote. He walks into his enemies' headquarters with no more protection than a single unaccustomed gun, and no-one even attempts to lay a finger on him... even after his own ally, equally unscathed, knocks him down! The worst repercussion he seems to face, for all the trumpeted bravery of his betrayal, is a petulant \"you'll never work in this town again\" - and even this is undermined by a convenient unheralded change of heart on the part of the workers who have never previously cared for him: the 'bum' who gets all the cushy jobs and now the traitor who broke the code of the docks, yet losing a fight suddenly makes him some kind of holy hero. I'm left with that feeling of manipulation: things happening or failing to happen because they meet the desired message, not because they further the emotional value of the plot.Some aspects of the script are very well done, but I found myself with the jarring conviction that I'd just watched a film noir - and a good one, with all the skills and devices of the genre - with a tacked-on happy ending. In a great film, the plot should seem ordained, interlocking, inevitable. Here, I got the impression that the screenplay was more interested in showcasing big scenes for its star, and in an arbitrary moral, however obtained - maybe politics does come into it after all...In many ways, the film is good; it's worth having seen. But I cannot truthfully say that I would recommend it whole-heartedly to a friend, let alone recommend him to put himself to trouble or expense to see it, as I did. That makes for a rating of 6/10. Without Brando, for my part, it would probably have been a seven.(Edit: I was fascinated to discover by chance today that the uneasy strain between the basic story set-up and the final outcome is *not* in my imagination alone: it's the direct result of warring visions between writer and director. The character of Terry really has been 'sexed up' to provide Brando with a more significant and sympathetic role, and the apotheosis of the informer is all Kazan's idea - in Schulberg's published version, Terry winds up in an unmarked grave and Father Barry is the most important protagonist... It turns out that the dislocation that jarred me so can be traced with almost clinical exactness to this collision of two quite separate concepts of message and plot: frankly, it explains an awful lot!)",

The story is pretty simple and has been done before but the script is superb and all the actors are at the height of their powers.  Brando is unbelievable as Malloy--he portrays his innocence and hurt so easily--I actually started to get a lump in my throat when he comes to grips about the corruption.  Rod Steiger is great in a small role as his brother.  The taxicab sequence between him and Brando has become a legend--rightfully.  Lee J. Cobb is frightening as the leader of it all. Eva Marie Saint (in her first theatrical role) is gorgeous and just great as a woman who falls in love with Brando.  The scenes between them are incredible.  There's also superb direction by Elia Kazan--this is possibly his best work.  The only debit here is Karl Malden as the priest--he overplays it way too much and got on more nerves.  But that's about it.This movie is one of those rare instances where everything clicked together perfectly.  A HUGE hit in its day.  Don't miss this one!",

            "review_title": "My extended review of the film",
            "content": "My comments here are written in light of having watching the film for a second time. While I liked 'On the Waterfront' a lot the first time round, I appreciated it even more the second time. There are some slight negative points - the music is at times overbearing and the religious side it tries to bring forth does not quite work - but there is not anything significant that I would flaw the film on.The acting is definitely the film's strongest point. Marlon Brando gives and intense and realistic performance. It is not just because of the famous car scene, or the well-known scene in the bar with Saint, that makes his performance great. It is everything that he does throughout, in particular the facial expressions that he captures on his face. Towards the end there is a scene in which he stands alone and just stares at his fellow workers. His expression is unflinching without being unrealistic. Eva Marie Saint is quite good too, also giving off a performance in which her face is central. However, there is less to talk about with her than there is about the supporting actors.When I first viewed the film, it was Karl Malden's acting that stood out the most to me. His performance and character are powerful, however on a second viewing it seems a bit over-the-top, as does the whole religious side of the film in which he is involved. On the other hand, Lee J. Cobb is brilliant as Johnny Friendly, providing a fierce performance while not letting his character turn into a stereotype of evil. Then there is Rod Steiger, whose acting, after only one viewing of the film, I did not take much notice of. He is hardly there, and until the point when he instructed to talk with Brando, he does not have much to do. Indeed, Rod Steiger has very few good scenes in the film, however he is excellent in those scenes. It is incredibly realistic acting, the way he interacts with his brother, and the way he is torn between the mob and his family.The next thing to mention is that this film could never be as effective in colour. The bleakness of the black and white prints is used well by Kazan. There are many shots of the characters, which just show their heads against a white sky: a bleak white sky. We cannot even see if it is cloudy or sunny day. The sky is as plain and as barren as what the future holds for each of the characters. Leonard Bernstein's music deserves a mention too. It is an electrifying score and often fits the actions very well. It is at times a tad overbearing (note the scene where Brando goes to Saint's house) as it has a tendency to over-ride the dialogue and the action. However, this does not subtract much from the overall picture.The sound recording is very realistic. The dock noises can often be heard, which helps to set up the waterfront atmosphere, and there is one scene in which the noise of a ship plays a key element in a conversation between Saint and Brando. In that conversation it is metaphoric, and it could even be argued that it is only heard through perceptual subjectivity. The other noises are sharply recorded too, such as banging at the basement of the church. The photography is excellent, using shadows very well to set up the atmosphere, all of which is captured well with some glides and tilts.One can praise a film for many different reasons, but it is not worth much unless one can explain what the film is about. I would say that 'On the Waterfront' is a drama about struggling against the restrictions of society, and of what it takes to stand up for what one believes in. However, I also see it as an exciting thriller about fighting corruption and the harshness of stevedore life in a community that is effectively run by gangsters. Perhaps it is about love and how relationships develop, and the events that help them to grow strong. I think different viewers will take some different out of it. And it is perhaps that, more than the artistic and cinematic qualities of the film, which makes it a great piece of cinema.",

Instead, they put it on afternoon TV, sometimes around dinner time.  Well, that's when I'd come home from high school, and got to enjoy free black and white classics such as \"High Noon\" and \"On the Waterfront\".It made a moviefan of me for life.  I remember the effect of \"On the Waterfront\", as I remember thinking about Terry Malloy in that final scene, \"Wow, that guy's got guts!  I wish I could be like him.\"  Being just a typical Midwestern teen, I didn't know who Marlon Brando was, but I just was fascinated by this life of these good and bad people, on the tops of buildings and in the cold, wet streets and alleys of this far-away place near the waterfront.Now, every time I watch it, years later, I still love it.  Yes, there is definitely an attempt to make Terry into a Christ-figure at the end. That's no coincidence that he stumbles from having been beaten to a pulp, to walk and carry a hook on his shoulders, to lead others to a better life.  (In the book by Budd Schulberg, by the way, Terry disappears after testifying and what is thought to be his body is found floating in a barrel of lime.  But he has become a legend on the waterfront.)  I love the powerful Elmer Bernstein score (glaring for our present tastes, but back then, exactly what people expected to hear during a drama -- you've got to wonder what a future generation will say about the constant replays of fairly irrelevant pop and rap songs as themes during most movies today, dramatic or comedy). \nAnd being raised in a Catholic home, I found Father Barry to be a great dramatic figure, one of the only times I saw a priest portrayed as a gritty, brave, heroic person, not afraid to mix it up with the common folks in the parish.  He smoked, drank and slugged it out.  And he was not afraid to die for the right reason.  Folks, that's true Christianity at work.  And that's powerful.A classic.  A must-see.  10/10",

            "content": "Except for Karl Malden who overplays his role as a priest, the acting here is quite good. Rod Steiger, Lee J. Cobb, and Eva Marie Saint all give fine performances. And Brando is indeed terrific as Terry Malloy, the non-intellectual brick-head and former boxer who is torn between his own conscience and loyalty to a corrupt gang of bullies. His scene in the taxi with Steiger is his most famous in the film. But I actually prefer his performance in the bar, wherein he tries to console the sister of the dead man.Apart from the acting, however, I find little of interest. The B&W cinematography, though competent, is nothing special, except for the scene where Malloy and his girl run through an alleyway; that scene is quite effective and a good example of noir lighting. Otherwise, the visuals are drab, cheerless, and dull beyond words. The low contrast lighting of the blue-collar shipyard area conveys a mood of bleakness and misery.Most of the script's characters are humorless hoods and thugs devoid of sentiment or kindness. Everyone is angry, and they're angry through the whole story. There's not an ounce of humor anywhere. Conflict is both verbal and physical. This is a very talky script. Some of the longer scenes could pass for stage play material. I couldn't care less about the political intrigue that was the basis for the original film concept. And the film's background music is loud and overbearing.\"On The Waterfront\" is one of several old movies that film school instructors like to use to show examples of high quality acting. Similarly, for a viewer to say he or she likes this movie would be \"safe\"; hardly anyone will force him to defend his opinion.But times change. The movie is way outdated. Along with a number of other cinematic \"sacred cows\", \"On The Waterfront\" seems stale, bromidic, shopworn and tired. However \"instructive\" the film might be for new actors, I find it lacking in entertainment value.",

            "content": "Elia Kazan's film is still amazing after 50 years. It's curious how it parallels Kazan's own life in the way the main character, Terry Malloy, ends up naming names to the commission investigating the corruption on the waterfront, the same way the director did in front of the HUAC committee, presided by the evil Senator Joe McCarthy and his henchman, Roy Cohn.\nBud Schulberg's screen play is his best work for the movies. It also helped that Elia Kazan had a free reign over the film, which otherwise could have gone wrong under someone else's direction.Terry Malloy, as we see him first, is a man without a conscience. He is instrumental in ratting on a fellow longshoreman, who is killed because he knows about the criminal activities on the piers. At the same time, Terry is transformed and ultimately redeems himself because he falls in love with Edie Doyle, the sister of the man that is killed by the mob.\nTerry Malloy is a complex character. His own brother Charley, is the right hand man of Johnny Friendly, the union boss. Charley is trying to save Terry. It's clear that Charley is going to be sacrificed because of the way he is acting by the same people he works with. In a way, the death of young Doyle is paid back with Charley's own, an interesting twist of events, when it should have been Terry the one that had ratted in the first place.Marlon Brando had his best opportunity here. Everyone lavished praise for his performance. I don't know whether it was me, or what, but the way he played Terry, at times, is an enigma. Could it be the way he speaks? The taxi scene, when he speaks in his famous line, his voice sounds so out of character. Maybe it was Brando's take on the character, but in retrospect, he doesn't sound like a New York wise guy. Eva Marie Saint, whose made her debut in the cinema in this movie, is excellent as the sweet Edie. It's incredible she stays with Terry even though he's been instrumental in the death of her own brother. She is obviously in love with Terry and will do anything for him. Karl Malden's character is also symbolic. He represents the sanity and the salvation for an otherwise horrible person, because Terry up to this point has no conscience and he is resentful for the fact he never got to be somebody when he had a chance in the boxing ring.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great actors of the American movies gives a detailed performance as Johnny Friendly, the boss of the union local that controlled the waterfront. Rod Steiger, as the crooked brother Charley was amazing. There are a lot of minor roles such as Martin Balsam, who went to bigger and better things. Also, a non speaking Fred Gwynne who is part of Friendly's crew.This films owes a great deal to the black and white cinematography of Boris Kaufman and to the great musical score of Leonard Bernstein. Was it me, or was this film an inspiration for the music he later composed for West Side Story?One of the greatest films of all times.",

            "content": "ON THE WATERFRONT is considered to one of the great classics of American cinema . It's easy to see why . It's a story that involves a nobody standing up to a powerful and corrupt organisation and doing the right thing , of one man making a difference . However it's impossible to watch this once you know the background of the director Elia Kazan . A Turkish immigrant to America he started off in theater and along with Lee Strasberg introduced something called \" Method acting \" where the actor gets in to the psychological depths and motivation of their character and effectively becomes that character . Where as previously film stars like Clark Gable , Errol Flynn etc etc were always playing a different shade of themselves a new breed of actors in the 1950s such as James Dean and Marlon Brando brought the method acting style to cinema and the method hit new heights in the late 1960s and 70s with New Hollywood . Perhaps we should be thankful for Kazan ? Maybe but the downside was Kazan was not a nice person at all from a very important moral viewpoint This film features a corrupt union who are fleecing the workers and lining their own pockets . The Waterfront Crime Commission are very interested in bringing down this corrupt union but they have a problem in that no one wants to talk to them and the union are more than happy to arrange accidents for suspected informers such as throwing people off roofs and fearing that former boxer Terry Molloy might snitch on them because they murdered the brother of a girl Molloy is falling in love with decide to put heavy pressure on him . You might like to consider that a couple of years previously Kazan was more than happy to testify in front of The House Of Un-American Activities and named eight former colleagues he knew from the American communist party with these eight people then being blacklisted . In effect he grassed them up and stabbed his friends in the back .With friends like that who needs enemies ? Continually this film screams that informing on \" bad guys \" is all that's needed for good to defeat evil and unfortunately while being a red might not necessarily make you a bad person there does seem to be some sort of moral equivalence of being a murderous gangster and someone suspected of leftist leanings . I mean it doesn't matter what someone has done because if they've done something wrong then they've only got themselves to blame if someone snitches on them isn't that right ? . A snitch is a good thing There's also a large dose of irony . The only character with a moral compass is Father Barry played by Karl Malden . Yeah I mean a Catholic priest makes for a superlative role model . Yeah I'm sure if Father Barry found out about a paedophile ring for example he'd be round the police station right away naming names ? Or maybe not . After the death of a longshoreman who knows too much Father Barry pleads in the name of Jesus for the workers to rise up against their cruel union bosses who are taking the bread from hungry babies and using it to pay for expensive suits .Let's think about this for a tiny second . If the character of Barry wasn't a priest and just an ordinary worker , and who doesn't mention Jesus and pointed out the exploitation the workers were experiencing what sort of person would Barry be ? No doubt a good guy but one with leftist , almost certainly fundamental Marxist leanings , in which case he'd automatically be blacklisted as a filthy red . Oh it's an entirely different ball game now eh comrade ? Yet another example of Americans not getting irony . And remember - no one likes a snitch",

It's a remarkable film about a man who has to do what he has to do and face beatings and exclusion and a reputation these dock workers would not want.

The whole idea of the film is there's a mafia in town that's forcing an omerta city-wide and a few like a priest or others are standing in its way calling it out for its oppressive ways. So far, nothing revolutionary. Brando and Eva Marie Saint and the other actors all do a really good job at their roles. So far, we're at standard level.Brando is linked to some key members of the 'mafia' mob including the big boss and tries to help out Saint's character, who's lost her brother earlier in the film. So he's torn between trying to help her out from goodness of heart and purity, and keeping his mouth shut; this is a major crucial theme in the film: you're either a \"D n d (deaf and dumb) or a \"canary\" (a squealer).The film is basically a constant strain between silence and speaking out the truth, but at no moment, despite the dramatic climaxes and attempts to draw in the viewer, is that theme explored in an interesting or particular light; we're just given these most obvious, common narrative and theme which are fine but by no stretch of the imagination anything unique or above 'good' in quality.So as explained earlier in this text, sometimes you just need to put a couple of things together: good acting, an obvious but engaging theme, with a mafia-type environment.

Being able to reach inside yourself and pull something out that kicks everyone in the ass. He was truly one of a kind. They say sometimes beautiful people are born under a dark cloud.

Unfortunately, I ended being part of the group that it did not really appeal to. As ground-breaking and artful as this movie may have been, to me, most of the elements were too commonplace by today's standards to be enjoyable.The movie is about a dockworker (Brando) who witnesses a murder of a fellow worker who was going to testify against the mob. The mob, as it turns out, runs the docking business on the waterfront. Brando's character was comfortable playing \"deaf and dumb\" to the murder until he meets and falls for the murdered man's sister. Add in a priest that weighs heavily on his conscience, and you can see where the movie is headed.The ideas involving whistle-blowing, inner moral conflict and even corrupt bosses vs. innocent laborers have been pretty well played out do date ... so as powerful as they once may have been, they are not quite as effective to a modern viewer.Brando's performance was clearly good and will forever stand the test of time. The way he moves, speaks and even communicates through his body-language is impressive. We can perceive his conflict and struggle through his mannerisms and the delivery of his words. Good as his performance was, it was not quite enough to make up for the familiarity of the plot.Because this movie is so well respected and celebrated, the prudent thing to say is to check the movie and see what you think. My rating only reflects the fact that it's not an automatic win in everyone's book; my guess is that you'll know in the first 15 minutes if this movie is going to appeal to you.",

The dramatic progression is rather mediocre, the narration lacks grip, tension, it is too linear, too predictable and too slow to captivate the viewer's attention from end to end. The actors are bland, a vast majority of people by the way even consider Marlon Brando's performance as one of his best when his acting is just dreadfully inexpressive. As for the cinematography, which is also often highly regarded, it's more than OK but very academic, and often badly served by a deafening, too grandiloquent soundtrack. With 8 Oscars and a solid reputation, On The Waterfront appeared like a true masterpiece but ultimately the movie could very well be part of the overrated classics category.",

            "content": "It's difficult to review a film that in almost all respects comes together exactly as it was intended to. There's not much left to criticize.The plot: Brando is Terry Malloy, a dock worker on the waterfront who gets mixed up with an innocent young schoolgirl, Saint, is persuaded by her and the local priest (Malden) to rat on his corrupt union bosses, is shunned by everyone because he has squealed, is even ridiculed by police officers, is beaten to a pulp, and is redeemed.I watched Kazan shooting one of the scenes -- Nehemiah Persoff drives Rod Steiger into the basement garage -- while I was growing up in the area and thought nothing of it at the time. Gee, another movie.On its release, my friends and I were somewhat surprised at how well Boris Kaufmann's perceptive photography captured the wintry streets of Hoboken, New Jersey, and at how much the people and their faces were recognizable types.As an adult, I was -- and still am -- stunned at how closely this movie approaches perfection. It's one of a small handful to which I would give the highest possible rating.There isn't much point in listing the details that make this such an outstanding story. It would require a book or two. But I'll make special mention of the first scene gum-chewing Brando and Saint have together, walking a little aimlessly through a children's playground. The air is filled with smoke from burning leaves. Brando pushes away a drunk asking for money. They remind each other of the schooldays they shared. Saint drops her white -- her very white -- glove accidentally and while they chat Brando picks it up and fiddles with it, brushing off the dirt, trying it on. \"You was a mess,\" says Brando of Saint as a little girl. \"I remember you from the first time I saw you,\" Saint replies with a self-conscious smile. The ex boxer Brando pushes his nose with with a fingertip -- \"The nose, right?\" Unable to understand that a pretty and innocent blond girl from a convent could find him interesting for his own sake. That's all there is to the scene, but it's almost flawlessly executed. What begins with two near strangers strolling through a dismal and leafless little park ends with a young man and woman who now can imagine themselves as friends, or more than friends. It's impossible to imagine how the scene could have been improved.No movie is perfect in every respect and this one becomes a little mechanical towards the last third. The courtroom scene is the weakest, although it's hard to see how it might have been left out. It's one of the best American films ever made and to miss it is to miss an awful lot.",

            "content": "After three nominations for Best Actor in 1951 for A Streetcar Named Desire, 1952 for Viva Zapata, and 1953 for Julius Caesar, the Oscar was not to be denied Marlon Brando for the fourth time. Although his playing of Terry Malloy was indeed Oscar caliber stuff, the award was really for a most remarkable body of work on screen up to that time. It was also for setting a new trend in acting style and influencing the next three generations of players.On the Waterfront is also alleged to be Elia Kazan's answer to his critics of why he was a namer of names at the House Un-American Activities Committee. I don't think it was an accident that the subject of this film was labor racketeering. Forgotten by a lot of the people who defame Kazan today is that the Communist Party asked him to infiltrate and spy on not just actors, but various craft unions associated with film and theater. It was something he never forget.He's often called a friendly witness. To me a friendly witness is someone who was an unabashed admirer of the House Un-American Activities Committee and its work, someone like Adolphe Menjou or Hedda Hopper or even John Wayne, people who were convinced these people were doing a patriotic service. In On the Waterfront, labor racketeer Lee J. Cobb, a bullying loudmouth of a man, runs the longshoreman's local. He commits murder, extortion, and various other crimes at will without fear of reprisal because no one will talk because of their code against informing. Waterfront priest Karl Malden realizes it, but bangs his head against the code of deaf and dumb.Marlon Brando is a washed up ex-prizefighter who finds work on the docks through his older brother Rod Steiger who works for Cobb. Unknowingly he fingers Eva Marie Saint's brother for a hit and then he falls for her. The film is essentially Brando's struggle to find out what the right thing to do in this situation.When he's on the screen Brando dominates. He invests the character of Terry Malloy with a lot of layers and the audience really struggles with Terry in his soul searching. He starts to see Cobb and to a lesser extent his brother Steiger as more exploitive than helpful even in his own life. That famous taxi scene with Steiger who's got his own life on the line if he doesn't get his brother away from Eva Marie is one where it all comes out. Brando got his ticket to Palookaville and he doesn't like the neighborhood at all.Eva Marie Saint got a Best Supporting Actress in her film debut. She's pretty far from later characters she played like the cool blond of Cary Grant's dreams in North By Northwest. Those were more the roles she played in her career than the working class girl of On the Waterfront.Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, and Rod Steiger all were nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category and they wound up splitting the vote and allowing Edmond O'Brien to win for The Barefoot Contessa. The other nominee was Tom Tully in The Caine Mutiny. All three could have been winners.I remember when Elia Kazan died a few years ago and I think the unkindest cut of all for him was to be eulogized on television by Pat Buchanan. Though the left disowned him, he always considered himself a man of the left. One could fight injustice without submitting to a regimentation of the soul that Communism was when it triumphed. Something a lot don't realize today. The regimentation that Lee J. Cobb had on those longshoremen is what Kazan was expressing himself against in On the Waterfront. over fifty years later it's a landmark expression.",

Terry Malloy's on edge because he's working in an environment where a lot of underhand things go on, but say one thing about it to the wrong person and you're at risk of becoming simply another statistic. When you constantly feel under investigation, why upset the applecart? Isn't it better just to keep your mouth shut?This was Kazan's attempt at justification to absolve himself of any blame for reporting his colleagues to the House of Un-American Activities Commitee. As cowardly as that may be to take an enactment of totally different circumstances and then use it to try and show that you were in the right, this little parable of his still remains exceedingly thrilling.Brando plays the reluctant informant perfectly, visibly rarely comfortable in his own skin unless he's talking to Edie, (Marie-Saint) sure that interlopers will nip in and steal his thoughts away at any second. Malden is also terrific playing the priest who tries to persuade him to reveal all, and the climax right in the heart of territory where Terry feels most safe is nail-biting when you see it for the first time. Marlon had that majestic ability when he was on top form of easily being able to foster a sense of kinship for his protagonist, so if you like a thriller where you're able to feel every gut-wrenching development, then this is the right type of movie for you.To think all of this was achieved when the intention behind it was hardly whiter-than-white...",

Cobb (as Johnny Friendly). As you might expect, Mr. Cobb isn't going to go down without a fight. \"On the Waterfront\" put director Elia Kazan and his favorite \"method\" actors on overdrive; it earned a mother-lode of accolades, including a whopping eight \"Academy Award\" statuettes. Not to put the picture down in the dumps, but it isn't either Mr. Kazan's or Brando's absolute best - although it is, of course, excellent in most respects.The most obvious problem is that the bombastic Leonard Bernstein-dominated soundtrack jars uncomfortably with the general tone of the piece. As a result, the realism suffers; and, the stylish direction becomes rather blatant. Still, the \"Joeys Coop (sic)\" rooftop segments by Kazan with cinematographer Boris Kaufman are excellent, and the performances by Mr. Brando et al are undeniably classic. Brando brother Rod Steiger (as Charley), the other man in the famous cab scene, is especially flawless.

There's no doubt in my mind that ON THE WATERFRONT is one of the greatest movies ever made if not the greatest of all time. The movie is about as raw, gritty and downbeat as anything ever made and at the same time it has a certain power that is still as strong as the day it was released. Everyone says this was director Elia Kazan's way of making \"good\" for what he had done in his personal life but I really don't think it's that simple. What makes the film so powerful is the rawness that he brought it but you've also got Brando's performance, which is probably the second or third greatest in the history of cinema. I think the only think I'd put above it are Robert DeNiro's in RAGING BULL and Brando's own performance in LAST TANGO IN Paris. The way he plays the rather dimwitted Terry has been copied countless times over the years but each time I view this film I see something that I hadn't noticed before. I love the accent, the way he actually makes this guy feel like a real character and just watch how many changes he goes through. Brando is just so believable in the part that you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real person working on a real dock. There are countless legendary scenes but of course the one in the back of the taxi really stands out in terms of Brando's acting but so does an earlier scene where he finally admits the truth to the woman he loves. The only negative thing about the performance is the fact that it's so great that it has pretty much over shadowed the rest of the actors and all of them are perfect as well. Saint is believable in her part as is Rod Steiger as the brother. Everyone seems to overlook the fact that Steiger was in the cab scene as well and certainly helps with its power. Lee J. Cobb is marvelous as the hot tempered crook and Karl Malden add terrific support as the priest trying to help Terry. Even the supporting non-actors do a very good job in their small parts. Kazan's direction is spot on from start to finish and you can't help but be amazed at the power he's able to get out of the story and the performances. The music score is one of the greatest out there, the cinematography top notch and in the end there's really not a single negative thing to be said.",

            "content": "This Kazan-Brando collaboration (after A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, 1951 9/10) finally granted both an Oscar along with a sweeping 8 wins including BEST PICTURE out of 12 nominations. The prestige of this monochromic magnum opus is merely indisputable so as to my sheer expectation could not be more intrigued.It is a forthright story, a bum longshoreman's awakening to his conscience and takes on a venal union boss and his heavy minions. There are several incentives for his self-morphing into a better person, his love to a girl who in turn elicits his true grit, the demise of his brother (a pretty slow-witted move to put the final nail in the coffin to urge a man at his wits' end to go to the opposite of the line), and a religious influence from a virtuous priest, whose righteous homily is spirit-lifting but cannot deliver the huddled mass from numb apathy. Against the grain, it is also an indictment of the repressed workers who is suffer from crowd conformity psychology and cowardice, the most abhorrent thing is one of the sidekick child massacres all the pigeons just to demonstrate an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth when Brando finally musters his courage to be a key witness in a murder case against the boss, it feels blatantly inexplicable and rather far-fetched. The same can be referred to the ending, a battered-up Brando (with horrible bloodstain make-up) struggles to stand up and walk towards the gate so rest of the longshoremen can be convinced that they should follow suit and disregard whatever reasons hold them back. It is a too-well calculated victory.Bad-mouthing about some uneasiness while watching this picture aside, Brando emanates a tremendous air of competence as the young loafer stranded in the underbelly of the dock, his two-hander with Eva Marie Saint comes well-handled, alternately romantic and endangered, and Saint's film debut is also a fortuitous triumph for her, a borderline leading part nabbed BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS trophy. Wondrously, the film also holds the record of securing three slots as BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR nominees (but no win), Kazan's longtime workmate Malden emotes a paragon crime-defender as the priest, J. Cobb is the pure evil as the ringleader while his henchmen are completely imbecile and a young Steiger is the in-between as the ill-fated brother, an ambiguous image betrays great empathy in the illustrious conversing scenes inside the taxi with Brando. ON THE WATERFRONT also manifests Kazan's top-notch deployment of the camera, with DP Boris Kaufman, the close-ups and fixated angle shots run fluently without tampering the rhythm of its grim reality. Leonard Bernstein's accompanying score adheres firmly to the vascular impulse of the predictable diegesis. Thus, it is a fine piece of filmmaking and reminisces of the Golden Age with a touch of working-class bashing which may leave a small number of its modern audience nonplussed.",

            "content": "In terms of a piece of film history, it's best to look at On the Waterfront as one of those master's classes in Film acting. The scene in the cab (and the still photo seems to have been taken not during film in but during one of Steiger and Brando's \"moments\" in-between takes, silly gooses) is the most noted and famous take, and of course it's a great scene, so great that when it's done you still can't believe it's 55 years old. But there's other really great scenes and moments: Karl Malden with his unique spud-nose going off on the waterfront workers after the man is killed from the crates falling; Brando picking up the glove and putting it on his hand or offering the gum and then chewing it himself in front of Saint; Lee J. Cobb- nothing specific, just him period, as he pulls off an equally scummy character as well as Brando pulls off a conflicted squealer with his \"conscience\".Now, this doesn't mean the film isn't also a) well directed, b) compellingly scripted, c) shot with a wonderful eye for the Hoboken locations and a noir tone like Third Man lite, or d) topped with a compelling Leonard Bernstein score. But there is one thing against it, a thing that keeps it out of my favorite movies list here on facebook and elsewhere even as I acknowledge it as a given classic: Elia Kazan's real-life ratting to the HUAC taints so much of the picture it's like if Roman Polanski made a movie in the early 80s about a man who has to flee in exile for a crime which he doesn't think is, um, necessary enough to face punishment for, and it's not um sex with a minor/rape of course, but something like that.Kazan got the Oscar for the movie, and more power to him - for the movie. As a fellow, however, it sucks to think, or rather *know*, that the film is meant to be in part a testimony from Kazan about why he ratted, and what it's like to be one, and parallel alleged Communist sympathizers or Communists with gangsters strong-arming their way into the Union of a waterfront (the latter of which was an actual true story and had quite a lot of real research, but besides the point).Bottom line, it's the anti-Crucible, and the most difficult thing in revisiting On the Waterfront is knowing the context behind the picture. If one can separate oneself from it, then it's awesome and all. To Brando's ultimate credit as an icon, he makes us forget this for much of the time he's on screen. J. Hoberman compared Brando as the male Marilyn Monroe- I'd say he had a little more talent and depth, but I can definitely see the comparison. You don't want to take your eyes off this guy to see what he'll do, and as would happen later on in his career you could never tell what batty things he might do next as you look right at him. He was, at the least, \"somebody\".",

Michael Skelly, aka \"Johnny Friendly\" (Lee J. Cobb), is the hood that runs the union, taking a piece of the action from everyone in sight. Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger) is Terry's older brother and Johnny Friendly's right-hand man.The film opens with Terry, under instructions from Friendly, getting a friend, Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), to go to the roof of a walkup tenement where he keeps racing pigeons. Joey has testified about corruption within the union at the Waterfront Crime Commission. Terry thinks they're only going to \"lean on\" Joey, but they end up throwing him off the roof. Through this tragedy, he gets reacquainted with Joey's sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint). They were in school together before Edie went to a school upstate. The other major character is the local Jesuit priest, Father Pete Barry (Karl Malden) who tries to help get the regular union men to reject the corrupt leadership of the union.The movie follows developments within the union, including the deaths of two more longshoremen, the developing relationship between Terry and Edie, and the continuing efforts of Father Barry. Terry gets a subpoena to testify and initially rejects it, but after his brother is killed, he testifies about Joey Doyle's death to the Commission. In the end, after a violent confrontation between Terry Malloy and Johnny Friendly, the union rejects Friendly.This is a remarkable movie. I've seen parts of it on TV numerous times, but I never watched it closely before. It's a left-wing movie (rejected by most major studios because it was seen as a \"commie\" film). One of the most remarkable social justice speeches I've ever heard in a movie came when Father Barry speaks immediately after the arranged accidental death of longshoreman Kayo Dugan (Pat Henning).Elia Kazan was a controversial figure at the time of this film because he had named names in testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee before making this film. He had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s but left it because it was too controlling.Marlon Brandon is actually stunning in this film, playing an uneducated guy that sounds like he's been hit in the head a few times too often, but whose guilt about what he did to Joey keeps bubbling up.

Revolving around a ex-boxer turned dockworker, who is one of the hundreds of dockworkers under the corrupt and murderous rule of mobster Johnny Friendly and his army of assistants, he is gradually faced with the choice of continuing to waste his life under the tyranny of this system, or stand against the evil that this is. Along the way, he is helped by a girl whom he falls in love with and a priest from the neighbourhood parish.Undoubtedly one of the biggest contributions to the greatness of this film is Marlon Brando's performance as Terry Malloy, which I firmly believe is the greatest of his entire career. His performance alone would probably be a good enough reason to at least be interested in the film, as he perfectly encapsulates the anguish and inner tension that his character faces throughout the film. Lee J. Cobb, playing Johnny Friendly, the mobster in charge at the waterfront, also turns in a brilliant performance as a domineering kingpin who will do absolutely anything to cover up his evil deeds, even at the expense of other people's lives. These are just two of the many great acting performances in this film, which also included Eva Marie Saint (As Edie, a sister of one of Friendly's casualties and Terry's love interest), Karl Malden (a tough, justice-oriented priest who plays a role in motivating Terry to stand up against Friendly) and Rod Steiger (Terry's brother and Johnny Friendly's right hand man).On the Waterfront is also very well shot, not relying on spectacular cinematography or breathtaking special effects, but the sturdy, gritty black-and-white depiction of the harsh dockworkers' environment is phenomenal and helps to make the film more captivating. But above all else, it is an emotionally gripping story that leads you to empathise with the main character and the other dockworkers, as well as sensing a righteous indignation against the evil and injustice perpetrated by Friendly and his gang. You also journey with Brando's character as he is gradually led down a path of personal redemption. The iconic scene of Terry and his brother in the cab, as he pours out his heart in lamenting his wasted opportunities and regrets while resenting his brother's previous betrayal of him. This is undoubtedly one of the finest movies in American cinema that has ever been made, and totally worth watching for any film lover.",

It seems overtly theatrical compared to what Steiger and Brando are doing. Those two are doing something relatively new: establishing a parallel conversation over the 'ordinary' work of portrayal. It has the most obvious effect of making the characterization 'real.'Its often credited to some sort of inner connection via the 'method,' but that's not at all so. Meryl cannot; Dustin cannot. Only few have the gift: Marlon, Julianne, Kate, Sean. That's what makes this special, only Marlon's folded acting, supported by Rod's.What else doesn't work? The cinematography tries to be 'classic,' the writing is after a theatrical model that - although it has some meaty scenes - follows too simple a dramatic shape. But the biggest problem is the score. This is good music. And I understand it was key to adding jazz to the realistic cinematic vocabulary. But the personality of this music is one dimensional. Its message is purely in the direct sounds, the communication. Its as if all the conversation were in the words and none in the accompanying body language.Its okay, but Brando's work deserved something more dimensional. Only when the music is replaced by the waterfront sounds when Brando tells the girl does the composition of image and sound work. 'Streetcar' is where you need to go for a project integrated with the Brando fold.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

I really do think this movie along with TWELVE ANGRY MEN and MARTY should be mandatory viewing for modern film makers, as I have long lamented that modern films place too much emphasis on special effects and not enough on acting and characterizations. The bottom line is that if the characters in a film are under-written, it almost always dooms a film to mediocrity--even with bloated budgets.As far as acting goes, ON THE WATERFRONT is filled with many of the best actors of the 50s and 60s. Marlon Brando is at his best here in a simple but well-played role that isn't the least bit reminiscent of his Flether Christian or Jor-El--thank goodness. And, for support, the film includes Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and Rod Steiger--now that's a pretty powerful lineup! And, fortunately, these actors are all given excellent roles that give them a lot of chance to shine.The film itself is about mob control of a longshoreman's union. A small but ruthless group of thugs control the waterfront and the workers behave mostly like zebras--hoping the \"lions\" leave them alone. However, through the course of the film, standing idly by becomes more and more difficult--especially for Brando. This actually is a great film example of mob psychology. At one point, a large group of dock workers just stand by as Brando is pummeled by just six guys. No one is yet willing to stand up to the thugs and they just hope it won't happen to them next.About the only negative, and it's not enough to give this film a lower score, is the music. While the 50s jazzy tune is quite appropriate for the film, at times it is way too loud for the film--making normal moments seem way too intense and over-done. At one point, I even think it would have been best to have no music instead of the blaring violins during a seemingly normal conversation between Saint and Brando.",

            "content": "I don't think I've reviewed any movies with Marlon Brando in them (aside from the adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar), so I need to fix that by talking about this movie. On the Waterfront has a reputation of being one of the best movies ever made, and definitely in the top 20 or so in the crime genre. No matter how you look at it, you can't deny its magnificence. Brando brings a strong feeling of toughness to a movie that is already full of merciless and ruthless men who intimidate each other into doing their dirty work. At the same time, Brando does not really see himself as a tough guy in this movie. Maybe that's what makes it surprising for many people. The movie focuses on how mob bosses control the docks that ships pull into and scare their subordinates into going along with it. Brando plays Terry Malloy, who works at one of these docks. A mob boss named Johnny Friendly is suspected to be involved in some murders, but he uses his control over the docks to silence any opposition. Terry's brother Charley is Johnny's lieutenant and most trusted ally. When the brother of a girl named Edie is killed, she tries to enlist the help of a priest played by Karl Malden to do something about the mob's actions. The mobsters break up a meeting being held by the priest, and shortly after, Edie starts to like Terry. This gets ruined later on when he tells her he is partially responsible for her brother's death. As the movie goes on, Friendly has Charley murdered in an attempt to scare Terry, but Terry is adamant about killing him. The priest tells Terry not to fight Friendly face to face in a dirty alleyway like a wild animal, because that's what he wants. Instead, he suggests testifying against him in court, which works out because it makes his role in the murders more well known. The mob cuts relations with Friendly, and just to be spiteful, Friendly tells Terry he'll never have a job on the docks ever again. This backfires though, since after Terry goes to the docks looking for work, they hire everybody but him. The other workers rebel and refuse to work unless he gets the job too. A fight breaks out between Terry and Friendly's henchman and they beat him relentlessly, but with his new friends behind him, Terry gets the job and Friendly is powerless to stop him. This is a very inspiring movie. It shows the inner workings of how the mafia used to (and sometimes still does) control docks on the east coast of the US, and how you have to do exactly as they say or else you'll be sorry. Brando fulfills his role as Terry perfectly, mainly because he is just a lowly bystander for most of the movie. He watches the mob do all these horrible crimes and get away with it, even once Edie gets the priest to interfere. He loses a lot of confidence in himself later on, but it's won back at the end when everyone sides with him against Friendly. Lee Cobb as Johnny Friendly is intimidating and distinctive. He's not the top mob boss, but he's up there, and his presence in the movie announces to his enemies that they better behave unless they're ready to fight dirty. Karl Malden as the priest Barry serves as a kind of father figure to Brando, and what he says usually has something to do with advice or guidance. Finally, Eva Saint plays Edie, who deserts Terry in the movie after learning of his role in her brother's demise, but comes back to him later on. Filmed in New Jersey, the movie has an industrial and sort of run down look to it, which sets the mood for the various murders that take place. Overall, this is one of the most exceptional crime movies ever made, and whether you like the genre or not, you should give it a look if you haven't yet.",

            "content": "\"On the Waterfront\" was the big winner at the 1955 Academy Awards with no less than eight trophies. The film got Best Picture honors and director Elia Kazan won his second Oscar. Brando got his first nomination for another Kazan film three years earlier and this time he won. That film back then was \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and brought Karl Malden the win. Here he got another nomination. Lee J. Cobb shines as the main villain and manages his first Academy Award nomination just like Rod Steiger, who has only a very small part and was a complete newcomer to movies at that point. The latter could also be said about Eva Marie Saint with the difference that she did win the prestigious Supporting Actress award for her breakthrough movie. Saint is stunning and gives a truly mesmerizing performance. So does Brando. This is maybe my favorite turn from him. Both were in their late 20s in this film and Brando was actually older than Steiger, who played his older brother.Really everybody nails their part here and I am always surprised what a likable presence Karl Malden has. Guess I need to watch \"Streets of San Francisco\" at some point. This film is packed with excellent metaphors about all kinds of stuff, including pigeons for example. It deals with (false) loyalty, love, parental disapproval of boyfriends, missed chances and careers and finally having the balls to do the right thing. I am actually glad that the film has a (sort of) happy ending. Occasionally I felt it could end badly for Brando's character. It's really difficult to find something negative about this film, but maybe if you don't know a lot about unions and the mob in America back during that era, you may have a hard time tin understanding crucial moments of the movie, including the ending. That's just a minor criticism though. It's an excellent film and I highly recommend it.",

Kazan made \"On the Waterfront\" sort of as a window into how hard it was for him to do what he did.  Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning) has become involved with some low-life crime syndicates in New York City.  His older brother (Rod Steiger, Oscar-nominated) was first drawn in and Brando cannot overcome the grip that the low-lifes have on the waterfront.  Brando slowly begins to realize that his life has been a waste when he meets the sister (Eva Marie Saint, Oscar-winning) of one of the people who was killed by Lee J. Cobb (Oscar-nominated) and his evil henchmen.  Karl Malden (also Oscar-nominated) is the local Catholic priest who is trying, unsuccessfully, to return the area to peace and harmony.  Kazan's film is rough, unrelenting, and somewhat difficult to take at times.  Keep in mind this was made in 1954, when musicals and romantic comedies dominated the cinema.  The film is superb and would get Kazan his second Oscar in eight years.  It was also awarded the Best Picture Oscar in 1954.  It was well deserved.  5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "There's no question that Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando are at their very best in \"On the Waterfront\".  Kazan led a cast of solid talent in a morality play amidst the backdrop of the Depression-era New York waterfront.  Brando, much calmer than in his mercurial performance in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (also directed by Kazan), personifies the best in \"Method\" acting, perfectly engaging the viewer with his genuineness as Terry Malloy.In the most famous scene, Brando, a has-been prizefighter, confronts his brother (Steiger) who is about to set him up to be executed by the mob bosses of the union.  When Steiger reveals his intent to set Brando up, the scene explodes with reality and pathos.  Brando's words, \"Wow\", sum up the intensity and emotion of the scene.Great acting and directing, however, cannot cover up the transparent political/apologetical intent of the movie.  Two years earlier, Kazan had sold out his integrity to the House Unamerican Affairs Committee (HUAC), \"naming names\" of those who would become the blacklisted Hollywood 10. Kazan, a former communist himself, regretted his involvement with the Party, and evidently decided it was politically advantageous to name his former associates.  Likewise, Brando character Malloy finds himself in a mob-run labor union, and in his effort to 'get out', repeats much of what Kazan did in real life.  Worse, Kazan, through the allegorical message of the film, brands his former writers as criminals and murders, and himself as the naive innocent.  Being a communist was no crime in the 30s, and he was no innocent.\"On the Waterfront\" is thus steeped in a right-wing political worldview. Mobs run labor unions.  Unions are thus corrupt organizations who exploit workers and make it harder for businesses to thrive.  Turn in union leaders into the police.  Even the church becomes a tool of the state to further the cause of the police against the union.Brando was never satisfied with \"On the Waterfront\".  In fact, he later commented that it was indeed a tool for Kazan to justify his actions to the HUAC.  One thumb up for the acting, one thumb down for the cheap political message.",

            "review_title": "A political film from the Cold War discrediting unionism",
            "content": "Perhaps the most intriguing aspect about \"On the Waterfront\"is that it is a highly political film. The personal drama of the main character (Brando as the docker Terry) and the love story are poor conveyances for the discrediting of unionism and the glorification of the catholic church during the zenith of the Cold War. In view of the controversial nature of the film the superabundant award of Oscars (eigth!) seems somewhat overdone. In fact the director Elia Kazan himself has gained a bad reputation of slandering and ruining some of his colleagues during the black McCarthy years. He branded the following actors as Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller. Looking back on these years one can only wonder how the naive propaganda could develop such a deep influences on the public. Although in our present days similar films are still produced (see for instance \"Hoffa\" of director DeVito), the rise of independent film makers and the globalization of the film industry have luckily furthered a more balanced supply of cinematic narratives. Let us briefly summarize the fictional story: in the New York harbor, the local union of dock laborers is led by Johnny Friendly. Friendly makes shabby deals with the local businessmen, enriching himself and his close clique. Dockers, who try to criticize his methods, are expelled from the working force. Eventually the authorities form a political and judicial committee, that will investigate the ties between the union section and organized crime (just like in \"F.I.S.T.\"and \"Hoffa\"). The thugs and other associates of Friendly react with murder in order to silence the dockers, when they profess to testify before the committee. During the course of the film we gape at two of such liquidations. The father of the parish becomes the mouthpiece of the few remaining honest workers, in an attempt to restore decency and justice in the community (I guess in the present days Kazan would have selected another type of notable). He convinces the naive Terry, a dock laborer whose brother belongs to the Friendly clique, to inform the committee and take a stand against Friendly. Eventually Terry concedes, and supplies the incriminating evidence. At first the other dockers are dismayed at what they see as telltaling. In addition they realize that they have lost their union. Interestingly Kazan pays quite some attention to this common feeling of betrayal, which seems indeed incredible in view of the passed union atrocities. It may well be that here Kazan is working up his own conduct during the McCarthy years. Friendly senses his defeat, and orders his thugs to beat up Terry. In the end we see a severely injured Terry stumbling towards the harbor sheds, where he is welcomed by a dock baron (glad to be rid of the union riff-raff) and by his now sympathizing colleagues. Imho the acting and dramatization are not bad, although sometimes a bit out of proportion. Nevertheless the film lacks credibility. Of course it can not be denied that the barter culture of unions may lure individual officials into dubious transactions. However, in the setting of the New York harbor it is impossible to imagine the portrayed excesses. The observer gets the sensation of looking at a reverse Eisenstein picture. Perhaps what remains as value in \"On the Waterfront\" for our times is the exemplification of political Cold War propaganda during the fifties. If you are just interested in collective bargaining or even sympathize with unionism, there are definitely more informative and realistic accounts. Try Salt of the Earth (of the same period, but banned!), Norma Rae, Bread and Roses, Harlan County War, Matewan, Man of Iron. Or take a look at the other films about social action, that I have reviewed here on IMDb.",

The dialogue and character interactions are so good and executed to perfection by the marvelous cast. Brando and Cobb are magnificent. There is so many perfectly executed sequences, and none better than when the two brothers face off on why there is animosity between them.

            "content": "Like \"The Godfather\" or \"Citizen Kane\", \"On the Waterfront\" can be analyzed from many perspectives yet all leading up to the same assessment: Elia Kazan's masterpiece, Best Picture of 1954, changed the face of acting forever. There are times though where the film gets cinematic, stagy or preachy, but these grandiloquent flaws are curiously redeemed by the timeless quality of more ordinary moments, all featuring Marlon Brando\u0085 naturally.\"On the Waterfront\" confirmed what \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" established. Actors have been playing tormented and ambiguous characters but Brando injected his own approach to realism, something floating between expression and detachment, less playing real characters than real human beings, futilely but intensely. Take the walk scene with Edie (Eva Marie Saint in her debut, Oscar-winning, role), she accidentally drops her glove but instead of giving it back, he playfully puts it on his hand, symbolically touching her hand before feelings would do. The most benign objects become props of Brando's naturalness, adding nothing to the story except the essence of a cinematic gift that will inspire a new generation of actors, 'method acting'.Even in \"The Godfather\", Brando still cared for these little touches to enhance depth, and humanity in his characters, a Mafioso with a cat on his lap, sniffing the rose on his tuxedo after saying \"We're not murderers\" or playing with oranges with his grandson. Being to acting what \"Citizen Kane\" was for directing, in \"On the Waterfront\", Brando displays an infinite range of contradictory emotions as Terry Malloy, the former prizefighter, official longshoreman and officious muscle-man of Johnny Friendly, the mob-connected union boss played by Lee J. Cobb. The film opens with one of these contradictions through his involvement in the murder of Edie's brother, who was about to finger Friendly to the Crime Commission, immediately followed by guilt.Basically, Malloy didn't know they were going to kill Joey but is still unable to share his feelings, torn between his brother's status as Friendly's right-hand man \u2013Charley the Gent, played by Rod Steiger- and his growing romance with Edie, the first to see the sweet and delicate gentleness behind the tough-guy facade. But doesn't Brando's performance make it obvious? There is something in Rocky Balboa obviously borrowed from Malloy, working for a loan shark to make a living, but being constantly called a bum. Some souls believe in Malloy though: he's coerced by Edie, and Father Barry (Karl Malden) the 'Christian voice' to testify against Friendly, instead of playing \"D and D\" (Deaf and Dumb) but Malloy can't make up his mind. \"Being a rat or a bum\" is his cornelian dilemma, and the legendary taxi scene is a microcosm of his existential crisis.Charley unsuccessfully tries to bribe Terry to get him out of trouble, but when Terry sees Charley's gun pointing at him, he has the oddest reaction, gently lowering the gun, with a smile and a \"Oh Charley\" speaking pain, disbelief but brotherly love saying \"how could have we sunken so low?\" Terry finally vents his anger on Charley who stole his chance of stardom when he told him to dive for Friendly in Madison Square Garden, \"I could had class, I coulda been a contender, I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum\" (apparently, Rocky Balboa is what Terry coulda been) then, with a poignant mix of resentment and forgiveness, he says \"It was you Charley\".Both brothers know they're in a no-return point, mistakes have been made, and they'd never be together again, one way or another. Charley who hasn't taken care of Terry like a real brother let him go, signing his own death warrant through an act of foolish generosity. And with Charley dead, a part of his shameful past is about to haunt him forever if he doesn't act. Determined to kill Friendly, he's exhorted by Father Barry to testify. He does and becomes a rat; kids who admired him kill his beloved pigeons. But leaving the town as a pariah would keep him as low as he was before, the redemption process isn't finished yet, there's more than 'ratting', there's 'assuming'.Terry finally confronts Friendly, shouting that he's standing, over all these years \"he's been ratting on himself\", and the violent brawl between Malloy and Friendly's men leaves him one inch from death, but earns him the respect of his friends. And suddenly, a Christ-like aura enlighten Terry's damaged face, he stands up and marches toward the dock, followed by other longshoremen, ignoring Friendly threats. The operatic finale is too cinematically powerful to be believable and can be belittled by any of the scenes I just described but it doesn't matter because at that moment, it's not Terry but Kazan triumphing over his own demons, Kazan who named names before the House of Un-American Activities Committee, ruining eight careers and forever dividing opinions.From the ending, everyone understood the reason to be of \"On the Waterfront\", yet the film was a critical success. But how could anyone deny its influence on the field of acting, Brando but not just Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and Rod Steiger (the three of them splitting the votes for Best Supporting Actor Oscar)? How could anyone deny its realism in the depiction of gangster world, the docks, cold and foggy at daylight, hostile and shadowy at night? You could almost breathe the fresh and smelly stink of sea and touch Terry Malloy's soul like he caressed Edie's glove. Kazan's work was simply pure genius deserving every award it got.I guess people forgave Malloy because at least he ratted on criminal activities, unlike Kazan. Maybe it's poetic justice if Kazan took for himself the seal of an infamy without it tarnishing \"On the Waterfront\". Many great films are made of personal, even debatable purposes, but with results like that, it's definitely worth it. The rest lies in Kazan's conscience... you know conscience, that stuff that \"can drive you nuts\".",

            "content": "There is a reason this film won 8 academy awards. It is one of the best movies of the 1950's, easily. Watching Brando on screen is mesmerizing, as he is truly one of Hollywood's finest actors, in history. He may be on the actors mount Rushmore. And for a 50's movie, it's a real dark story. There aren't many smiles shared throughout this classic.One of the best parts about this movie is watching the young talent right before our eyes. You can really see the talent of not only Brando, but Eva Marie Saint. As she won her one and only Oscar for her role. Brando's character is a troubled ex-boxer who never really finds his own in the real world. He has to choose which side he's really on even with his longtime friends and brother on one side. From the opening scene of a murder the film glues you to the story. It didn't feel like a typical 50's movie at all. There wasn't any cheap romance and cheesy dialogue. Its written beautifully and is complimented with a great score. The script is brought to life by a great supporting cast led by the priest. He influences Brando to stick up for what is right even if it means ratting on his team. No wonder this movie has been number one on many all time great 50's lists. I think Rear Window and a Dial M for Murder still wins for me but this is not far behind. Very impressed with everything about this movie.My only complaint comes from the courthouse as I thought that scene feel flat. I wish we heard more dialogue and heartbreak from Terry after losing his brother. That perhaps would have made my score a 10. Nevertheless it's a great film filled with memorable performances.9.2/10",

            "content": "An ex boxer now working on the docks controlled by the mob is conflicted when a man is murdered.I have seen this countless times and it still has a great impact every time. Marlon Brando's performance as Terry, the punch drunk dockworker is the best male acting I have ever seen. He is totally believable as an ex fighter, not very bright but very sensitive. We see his toughness (or as the character Edie says \"he tries to act tough\") but he shows warmth and tenderness as well. His scenes with Eva Marie Saint (Edie) are some of my favorite moments. I especially love the scene where he is walking with her and she drops her glove, he picks it up and puts it on his hand. Later there is a scene where he takes her to a bar and they have a very revealing conversation, you can see the pain and conscience in his face.Another thing I loved was Leonard Bernstein's music score (his only one for a dramatic film). The mournful sounding horn at the beginning sets the mood. The more sad moments have very melancholy strings. The final scene has great impact due to rousing music.The direction by Elia Kazan really brings us into the gritty world of working class life in the big city. It was filmed on location in winter and we see the actors' breath and hear sounds of the city.The supporting cast could not be better, Karl Malden gives what may be his best performance ever as the priest who tries to get Terry to stand up to the corruption. Lee J. Cobb is brutal as the mob boss. Rod Steiger (playing Charley, Terry's brother) has the famous heart breaking scene with Brando in a cab, he wants to help his brother but knows deep down he cannot.The Blu Ray is definitely worth owning for this classic.",

            "content": "Many talented people made this intellectually dishonest movie. Why is the ILWU under attack? The longshoreman had one of America's most courageous and honest unions. Their leader, Harry Bridges, was born in Australia and had been both a socialist and a communist. The government tried and failed to deport him. No wonder his union was under attack by Hollywood, as opposed to company unions or Mafia influenced unions. J. Edgar Hoover maintained that there was no Mafia, while they owned him: Communists, who were idealistic about unions, were his target. Even more ludicrous was the notion that the Catholic Church in New York in the 1950s, headed by Cardinal Spellman, was a force for progressive change. This movie presents a decadent and dishonest argument, so, despite the skillful craftsmanship, it is repellent. Elia Kazan often did excellent work, but Hollywood leftists held him in special contempt. I used to do transcripts for interviews by historians. The night before Kazan testified, he spent the evening with leftists, whose company he declared that he enjoyed above any other. The following day, he went in and named names. \"On the Waterfront\" stinks of this vivid cowardice. This movie's poison continues to infect our politics. Many Americans, bankrupted by business controlled government and paid with lines of credit instead of wages, believe that the unions, which created a middle class, are an enemy from which they need to be rescued: a movie made by SAG, DGA, WGA, IATSE union members.",

            "content": "Winner of 8 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, ON THE WATERFRONT continues to be included on many top ten of all time lists. With the possible exception of THE GODFATHER, it, more than any other film, has inspired multitudes of people into becoming actors, screenwriters, and directors. Just the backseat taxicab scene between Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger alone served as a training ground in acting schools. And to illustrate how much reverence the script has earned, in RAGING BULL a washed up Jake LaMotta stands before his dressing room mirror reciting dialogue from ON THE WATERFRONT.As with any great motion picture, there is a dark side, and this one involves Elia Kazan. A brilliant director on both the stage and screen, Kazan's leftist politics eventually got him subpoenaed to testify in front of the House un-American Activities Committee that was rooting out communists real and imaginary. His naming of names made him a pariah in Hollywood's liberal community, and some actors -not enough as far as I'm concerned- flat out refused to work with him again. Screenwriter Budd Schulberg was also a friendly witness to the committee, and many in the industry felt that ON THE WATERFRONT was Kazan's way of justifying being an informer, an act he finally admitted to towards the end of his life. To his dying day, he remained a polarizing figure in Hollywood.Kazan damaged his credibility even further when it came to casting the male lead. Frank Sinatra originally agreed to play Terry Malloy, but when Marlon Brando found himself unexpectedly available, Kazan broke his verbal pact with Sinatra and gave Brando the part. The singer never forgave either one. To portray Edie Doyle, Grace Kelly was offered the role. But when Kelly declined so that she could work with Hitchcock, Kazan hired Eva Marie Saint, an actress with background in stage and television but about to make her silver screen debut.Brando won his first Best Actor Oscar as Terry Malloy, an ex-boxer now making a living as a longshoreman on the Jersey docks. Once a promising contender, Terry works for Johnny Friendly (Lee J Cobb), a ruthless mobster -patterned after Albert Anastasia- who controls the union local with an iron fist. Friendly's mouthpiece just happens to be Terry's older brother Charley (Rod Steiger), who not only provides legal representation but actively sits in on the crooked dealings, making him more of an accomplice than counsel.Terry isn't a bad guy; he's simply a not particularly bright palooka who fell in with the wrong crowd. His first awareness of this is when he unwittingly lures a dock worker to his death. It turns out the victim was due to appear at a subcommittee hearing on organized crime within the labor unions, and was bumped off by Friendly's goons to prevent this canary from singing.The dead man's sister is Edie Doyle (Saint), an inexperienced girl/woman who's determined to find out who killed her brother. Edie's only ally is Father Barry (Malden), a tough priest willing to risk his neck to clean up the unions by legally -and morally- getting rid of the racketeers in control. This is easier said than done because the longshoremen despite being shafted by Friendly -unless they give him a percentage of what they earn- and despite barely having enough pennies to rub together, adamantly refuse to become an informer.Happenstance thrusts Terry and Edie together, and she starts seeing him socially, unaware of his involvement with her brother's murder. As he begins to fall in love with her -and vice versa- Terry is overwhelmed with guilt because he wants so badly to confess to her that he's terrified of losing her. But all of a sudden, he's been subpoenaed to testify before the waterfront commission!Worried that the kid he's treated like a nephew is now going to betray him, the odious Friendly orders Charley to convince Terry to keep his mouth shut, or else he'll end up sleeping with the fishes. (Oops! Sorry, wrong Brando movie \ud83d\ude0f!) And if Charley isn't successful, then both Malloy brothers will find themselves in the morgue. It's in the famous can scene where we learn all about Terry's fall from grace in the boxing ring....and the role Charley played in it.Brando's forceful performance as Terry Malloy is one of the most influential ever put on film, even more so than his Stanley Kowalski in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. When he received his fourth consecutive Oscar nomination for Best Actor, no one in Hollywood had any doubts about him winning this time. It simply impossible to continue ignoring him and the impact he was having on screen acting. Future legends such as Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, and Martin Scorsese admitted they couldn't look away whenever Brando was on the screen.Eva Marie Saint also took home an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her touching work as the sheltered Edie who is forced to mature quickly in response to the violence and corruption permeating around her. Steiger, Cobb, and Malden all found themselves cancelling each other out in their supporting category, with the statuette going to Edmond O'Brien -an excellent actor- for THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA.The remainder of golden hardware recognized ON THE WATERFRONT for the screenplay, editing, black & white photography, and art direction/production design. The accolades continued long after the Oscars. In 1989, ON THE WATERFRONT was selected by the Library of Congress to be inducted into the newly established National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically,.an aesthetically significant\". When the American Film Institute released its top 100 list, ON THE WATERFRONT landed at #8. It even found itself on the Vatican's own list!!! And Brando's \"I coulda been a contenda\" monologue is one of the most imitated in the movies.And I haven't forgot about Elia Kazan. Despite his divisive actions, Kazan's direction won him his second Oscar. All in all, ON THE WATERFRONT is a powerful motion picture that demands to be seen, in spite of the warts of its director.",

            "content": "\"On The Waterfront\" is a classic that instills respect in any cinema lover. The way the film explores the dialogues and interpretive skills of the cast is the best it has: the actors have excellent material and were brilliantly directed by Elia Kazan. The result is evident: a film that is a work of art and a piece of culture and memory, which won eight Oscars at that time (Best Film, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Black-and-White Cinematography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Editing), which is always an achievement.The story is very interesting and revolves around the control that a small group of criminals have over a New York dockers' union: after the murder of a docker, young ex-boxer Terry Malloy begins to distance himself from the mob boss Johnny Friendly and, greatly encouraged by Father Barry, chooses to denounce what is happening to the authorities, aware that he will pay the consequences.The strongest point of the film is its excellent story, and the eloquent and excellent way in which the cast worked and performed, reinforced by memorable and extremely high quality dialogues. The film is full of quotes worth mentioning and anthological moments, such as the great and tense dialogue between Terry and Friendly in the back of the taxi or Terry's suffering and pain-filled walk, even in the final part of the film. I have always said that a good story and capable actors are the key to making a great film, and \"On The Waterfront\" is proof of my idea: without artifices, effects and decorations, it focus on the essential things and get everything it want.The great cast is excellently directed by Kazan, who achieved with this film one of the most impressive and remarkable works of his career as a director. Marlon Brando is a good actor and achieves stardom with this film, where he was still far from the roles of the sunset of his career. Lee J. Cobb is very good in the role of mobster: discreet, he gave the character a personality that swings dangerously and quickly between sympathy and brutality. Eva Marie Saint is extremely effective in her role, although the film is poorly tailored for female characters and she appears only to be the love interest of Brando and the sister of the dead docker. Karl Malden brings to life the most human and most influential character in the entire film: a Catholic priest who does not shy away from using the pulpit to fight what he believes to be evil and wicked, even if he eventually has to suffer.Technically, it is an extremely discreet film. There are no visual or special effects that go far beyond the most basic. The cinematography, in black and white, is very good and is loaded with a very welcome elegance. The sets and costumes are equally good and are in accordance with the period, the environment and the social context. The soundtrack is not particularly impressive, but bets on elegant and pleasant enough jazz themes.",

Despite overdoing the Method thing here, Brando is always interesting to watch, and nobody does blustery and earnest quite like Cobb and Malden, respectively. Steiger is fine, as is Saint in her film debut. Bernstein's score is rather strange, with sporadic and unexpected bursts of what sounds like the rumble music from \"West Side Story.\"",

            "content": "While he'd already made his mark in the industry with noted performances in A Streetcar Named Desire, Julius Caesar and The Wild One, 1954 was the year in which Marlon Brando became etched in Hollywood history with his Oscar winning performance in the critically lauded and instantly renowned On the Waterfront.Teaming up once more with his Streetcar director Elia Kazan (who also won one of Waterfront's other 7 Oscars outside of Brando's Best Actor gong), Brando's much copied and effortlessly cool performance as wannabe pro-boxer turned small-time hoodlum and dock worker Terry Malloy is the type of performance that changed the shape of feature film acting moving forward and to this day remains an impressive piece of work in a film that whilst melodramatic and heavy-handed in parts, deserves its place amongst the classics of American cinema.From the moment we are first introduced to Malloy, clad in his leather jacket after a hard day's work on the unforgiving docks of New York City, docks run by Lee J. Cobb's corrupt docks boss Johnny Friendly, you know that Brando was born to play the role of a man whose tough exterior clearly houses a softer heart, a heart that finds itself falling for Eva Marie Saint's softly spoken Edie.There's nothing ground-breaking as such about Waterfront's plot, particularly in today's climate where the set-up and pay-off of the film feels more familiar with various incarnations of this story taking place in the time since initial release, but with Brando front and centre throughout most of the films runtime and his strong chemistry with Saint (in her film debut) a joy to behold, Waterfront is an engaging piece of dramatic film-making that has aged far better than many of its counterparts of the time that don't have the assured directional hand of Kazan guiding them throughout time or the ageless performances of its leads holding up to today's standards.The whole production under the eye of Kazan is one of the highest quality, engaging the services of legendary composer Leonard Bernstein and shot under the watchful eye of Oscar winning D.O.P Boris Kaufman, Waterfront's impressively constructed world of steamy docks, pigeon-clad rooftops and gritty warehouses makes for a lived in world that feels as alive today as it did all those years ago.Final Say -Backed by a legendary turn from one of the all-time greats, On the Waterfront is still a powerful and impressive feat of dramatic film-making that is mandatory viewing for any one that considers themselves a die-hard cinema fan.4 pigeons out of 5",

The police and the Waterfront Crime Commission know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play deaf and dumb, submitting to their oppressed position rather than risk the danger and shame of informing. Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a dockworker whose brother Charley (Rod Steiger) is Friendly's lawyer.In 1952, director Elia Kazan was a witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in which he identified many alleged Communists in the film industry. That brought him severe criticism. This film is said to be his response to that, featuring another character who is willing to turn in his family and friends. The connection seems questionable, though -- in the film, people are clearly getting killed, while in real life, those wanted by HUAC were harmless, and were persecuted for their beliefs. Kazan was on the wrong side.If this film and \"Angels With Dirty Faces\" taught me anything, it's that Catholic priests and the mafia don't mix. Apparently, they have strong feelings on organized crime and really know how to reach the hearts of criminals.While Eva Marie Saint really caught my attention, the role of Terry (Brando) is by far the best. He's not altogether bright, but a good soul, caught up in a battle between the best interests of the dock workers, his own best interests and his family. He loves his brother, but is it right that he had to throw away a clear shot at the boxing title? I was moved by this film, and maybe even teared up a little bit. I was impressed, knowing Brando more for \"The Godfather\" (which, as great and memorable a film as it is, is not a strong role for him). People should give this film a chance.

Skelly aka Johnny Friendly, Lee J. Cobb. It's when longshoreman Joey Doyle agreed to testify against Friendly that things started to get real ugly.Getting Joey's friend and fellow longshoreman Terry Malloy, Marlon Brando, to unwitting set him up by getting Joey to go on the roof of his apartment house, to get one of his lost pigeons, Friendly's thugs grabbed and threw Joey down off the roof killing him. Terry would be haunted by Joey's death in his being an accomplice in it. Later when he meets Joey's sister Edie, Eva Marie Saint, and falls in love with her Terry's guilt eventually leads him to do what Joey was expected to do, by the crime commission and Johnny Friendly, testify in open court against Friendly and his mobsters that are running the docks.One of the great human dramas coming out of Hollywood in the turbulent 1950's that had as it's hero a man who would do the unthinkable by testifying against his fellow workers, no matter how mobbed up and corrupt they are, and in the end almost pay with his life for doing it. Johnny Friendly and his mobsters were the reason that what Terry did what he was forced to do after he had struggle with his conscience almost through the entire movie. Terry who at first was a 100% union man and who's belief in not talking to the commission was the only and right thing to do started to see the light when he got to know Joey's grieving sister Edie and her dad Pop Doyle, John Hamilton. Being the last person to see Joey alive Terry was called to testify to the commission about Joey's \"accidental\" death. As Johnny Friendly got paranoid about Terry's relationship with Edie, Terry's hesitation in keeping quite about it lead to an explosive taxi cab meeting with his older brother Charley \"The Gent\" Malloy, Rod Steiger, Johnny Friendly's mouthpiece and right hand man. Not wanting to turn his younger brother over to Friendly's thugs who would murder him Charley in return ended up dead for not being able to guarantee his silence.\"On the Waterfront\" brings out human emotions at their rawest with Marlon Brando's Academy Award performance as Terry Malloy who becomes an outcast from his union and even his life long friends in and out of the docks for being a rat, squealer, against those he worked with. There was a lot more to Terry's actions then trying to gain favor with the commission, which could really do nothing for him. It comes out in the movie that Friendly & Co. were anything but helpful to those that they represented by taking their union dues and then shaking them down, by kicking back a sizable amount of their paychecks, just to get work on the docks.Friendly in the end made the biggest mistake of his life by instead of laying low and riding out the storm of the crime commissions investigation of his corrupt union decided to quite anyone on the docks who was willing to testify.Terry with the support of both Edie and longshoreman fiery preacher Father Barry, Kal Malden,in the end did talk and implicate Friendly and his thugs. This only lead to Terry being beaten almost to death in the movie's final showdown between him and Johnny Friendly. The cowardly Johnny Friendly not being able to take on Terry all by himself also needed a number of his strong-arm men that included three ex-heavyweights, Tony Gelento Abe Simon & Tami Mauriello, who challenged the great Joe Louis for the heavyweight championship to do the job for him. Terry beaten to the point where he could hardly stand on his feet staggers toward the dock work area with the now admiring longshoremen, who at first wouldn't even talk to him, not willing to go back to work unless Terry was there with them The film ends with the dock workers filing in after Terry as he makes it inside and collapses.Excellent performances all around with a young Eva Marie Saint in her first movie role holding her own against her Academy Award winning co-star Marlon Brando as the sweet innocent and courageous Edie Doyle. It was Edie who saw through the fake and phony toughness of Terry Malloy in his trying to be macho but realizing that he was much tougher when he showed his true feelings in his sensitivity to those being abused, and even murdered, around him and willing to put an end, at the cost of risking his life, to it.",

A story about an ex-prizefighter who has turned into a longshoreman in New Jersey. Things start to heat up as his gangster of a union boss (Lee J.

Often films in the 50s still showed clear signs of theatre. Small, closed sets, a bit overplayed acting and the flow of the story is pretty episodic. Whereas I could easily imagine seeing a film such as this one in the decades to come. Brando's Terry is a man of few words, but you can still clearly tell what he's feeling from scene to scene.Another showstealer is Karl Malden's Father Barry, a local preacher that takes it as his task to oppose Mr. Friendly, the union boss. It's refreshing to see a man of faith represented like this. As a man willing to mix with the people and call things as they are, without in any way taking away from his religiousness. In fact he gives one of the best talks about Christian faith I've seen on film.But to be completely honest, I didn't find the story that captivating. It's done well enough, certainly, and the characters are fantastic, but the plot itself is predictable and nothing I haven't seen in newer films.

Brando's performance in this film, in my opinion, is the greatest acting I've ever seen.  The scene in the car with Charlie (\"I coulda been a contend-uh, I coulda had class\") is the most famous.  My favorite moment, though, is the first moment when you realize how conflicted Terry is in the first scene.  He is right in the thick of a mob meeting and watching him shows exactly how an actor should do his job.  His character is made totally believable.  The film on its own is brilliant.  Without Brando, On the Waterfront would be a great film with a good cast.  With Brando, Waterfront is a great film with the perfect cast.",

The Cab scene is an incredible portrayal of Marlon Brando's amazing acting ability and the thought and feeling that separates this film from being 'just another gangster film'.I also greatly enjoyed the rooftop scenes, as the director and actors played with the bumps and ledges in dynamic ways, with Brando looking over the lip of a roof, and people running the length of the roof, jumping up and down off the ledges and coming to a halt, eyes at another person's foot level. The rooftop added an incredible depth and intrigue to the parts of the film that were staged there, and I have never seen such well orchestrated rooftop scenes in a film.On The Waterfront is a marvel of acting and directing that really captures the skill and power of Brando's performance. While a little slow at times, it truly is an excellent film.",

            "content": "Marlon Brando plays longshoreman Terry Malloy who \"coulda been a contender\". That famous line, from one of the most famous scenes ever put on film, is the thing most remembered about On the Waterfront. But this film is so much more than one memorable scene. It's a gripping, powerful drama. It's a film which presents a simple yet fascinating story, a story which can be both inspiring and tragic. At its heart it's a story of one man, Terry Malloy, struggling to do the right thing. And Brando's performance in the role is simply stunning, justifiably hailed as one of the greatest performances of all time.The plot centers on corruption on the docks where Terry works. Union boss Johnny Friendly, played rather bombastically by Lee J. Cobb, is in complete control on the waterfront. His illegal activities are not limited to lining his pockets with ill-gotten cash. Right at the film's beginning it is a Johnny Friendly-ordered murder which sets the plot into motion. Terry finds himself an unwitting accomplice in the killing of a dockworker who dared to testify against the union. That's what happens to rats and Terry's no rat. He's content to dummy up and say nothing until he meets the dead man's sister. Eva Marie Saint plays Edie Doyle, a woman who will push Terry to do the right thing. Determined to find out who killed her brother Edie enlists the help of a local priest, Father Barry, who overcomes his initial reluctance to take it upon himself to clean up the docks. But for all their good intentions Edie and Father Barry are never going to be able to make much headway unless they have cooperation from someone on the inside. And as they proceed they will be reminded all too clearly of the grim consequences for anyone who dares to speak the truth. Despite the danger, for both himself and for his brother who happens to be Johnny Friendly's lawyer, Terry Malloy begins to see what it is he must do. A conscience can be a dangerous thing. But finally Terry Malloy is gonna be somebody. He's not a bum anymore.Perhaps the film does lay it on a bit thick in its presentation of Terry Malloy as the Messiah of the docks. But knowing director Elia Kazan's own personal life story that's understandable. The statement Kazan makes to his critics with this film is quite clear. There is no denying the power of this story, a story which holds up brilliantly more than half a century later. And the cast is almost uniformly terrific in bringing the story to the screen. Brando's legendary performance obviously stands out but the contributions from those around him are key as well. Brando got his Oscar but so did Saint who did wonderfully in her first film role. She plays off Brando so well. The relationship between Edie and Terry is a fascinating one as she uses him to seek justice for her brother without really knowing the role he had to play in her brother's demise. As Terry finds himself falling for Edie the secret he keeps from her always lurks in the background. There's that conscience again.Apart from Brando and Saint there are three more major roles. Cobb makes for a terrific villain. The sense of menace when Johnny Friendly is on the screen is quite palpable. Karl Malden is very good in his role as Father Barry although he does have a few moments where he's a bit over the top. One scene in particular, with Father Barry giving a speech over a dead body in the hold of a cargo ship, sticks out as being a little awkward. It doesn't quite seem to fit with the tone of the rest of the film. But all in all Malden does well. And then, playing Terry's brother Charley, there is Rod Steiger. His may seem like a small role, not nearly as important as those of the other four big name stars. And then he steps into the back of a taxicab and steps right into film immortality. Brando and Steiger, Terry and Charley, two brothers in one of the most emotional, heart-breaking scenes you will ever see. You can feel the pain these characters feel. Brilliant acting, brilliant film-making. It's a scene which is a perfect centerpiece for a classic film.",

            "content": "\"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody. . .\" It's endlessly quotable, and there are also two stories behind the famous scene in On the Waterfront. The first is obvious: \"they\" forgot to project a screen video behind the car and instead randomly stuck window blinds behind the window. It's silly, and once you notice it, it's impossible to un-notice it. The second is a story oft-repeated by Rod Steiger: he shared in interviews that Marlon Brando hurt his feelings by leaving the set after his closeups were done, as Rod had to film his closeups on his own. Everyone's heart went out to Rod; however, when you hear the other side of the story, your loyalties will undoubtedly shift. Marlon's mother died during filming On the Waterfront, and he left the set early every day for therapy.The casting of this gritty classic was difficult, since it was originally written for John Garfield. John would have been perfect for the part, but since he died, someone else had to fill his shoes. Ironically, the man who filled in for A Streetcar Named Desire, another story originally intended for John Garfield, filled in for this movie. Frank Sinatra lobbied heavily for the part, fresh off his Oscar for From Here to Eternity, because the story touched him personally. As a kid from Hoboken (where On the Waterfront was set), he intimately knew the tough characters and crooked situations present in the screenplay. As the story goes, Frankie was promised the part as a bargaining chip to get Marlon Brando interested, and since he was only given a verbal promise, the studio wasn't held accountable for breaking it. Adding insult to injury, Frankie signed on to play \"the lead\" in Guys and Dolls the following year, only to find out later that Marlon had achieved the specific name of Sky Masterson in his contract, bumping Frankie down to play second fiddle.Some movies are just full of more interesting stories behind the screen than in front of it. To me, learning all the stories behind On the Waterfront was far more entertaining than the film itself. It's a bleak, grisly drama where no one can get ahead and success at the end of the day means not getting stabbed, beaten, or pushed off a tall building. But in the midst of it, there's a priest who smokes cigarettes and has a perpetual twinkle in his eye, and a hope that a boy from the wrong side of the tracks might find love with a girl from the slightly-better-side of the tracks.There are some good moments in the film, although I'm usually the first to dismiss it. My favorite scene is when Marlon Brando takes Eva Marie Saint out on their first date. He tries to make a good impression even though he thinks it's only a matter of time before she realizes she's too good for him. The iconic music is also symbolic of the protagonist taking a stand alone against the bad guys.But all in all, I find it overrated. Karl Malden seems to be constantly winking at the camera, telling audiences, \"I may be a man of the cloth, but I'm just as tough as all these punks here,\" and it's extremely unrealistic. Eva Marie's talent is nonexistent, and when she tries to put emotion into the scenes where she mourns her brother's death, it makes you cringe that those were the takes Elia Kazan kept. Lee J. Cobb is sufficiently menacing, but Rod Steiger, for all his complaining, isn't given anything to do. Marlon doesn't put as much into his character as he could have, or maybe as someone else could have. There are moments when he could have injected pain, disappointment, or deep hopelessness, but instead he seemed to be staring off into space. I'm always inclined to cut a person slack when he's in the midst of a personal crisis off the screen, but I don't think he should win an Oscar for it.",

            "content": "Terry: You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.So goes the most famous line of this movie. It has made an impact on a lot of people over the last sixty plus years, not least on a young Martin Scorsese, who used this same line in one of his greatest accomplishments, Raging Bull. It is a line that sticks in the minds of people for the same reasons that all regularly quoted film lines do: they work well in the movie and they are easily able to be brought out into the real world.And such is this film: it strikes a balance between living in a world that exists only in the mind of Kazan and living in the unaltered real world. It is a cornerstone of film history, almost to the point that analyzing it as a film alone is almost irrelevant. But as a film reviewer, such is my burden, and so I will away.Thus, what will not be brought up in this review beyond this paragraph are Kazan's political beliefs. There is a theory that he made this movie to justify testifying against important Hollywood directors to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). I could spend far more than a thousand words talking about the Red Scare's impact on Hollywood, but I for now have neither the time nor the drive to do so. So for now, I will just say that the fifties have a far more pleasant reputation than they deserve. This is a decade in which it was taught that hiding under a desk would protect you from nuclear attacks. If you weren't right in line with the government, you were accused of being a (gasp) a Communist. Of course, you likely already know this. I'm just emphasizing. But again, film is not about politics or restrictions. It's about art. So let's enjoy the art.Any experienced filmwatcher could tell from watching any five minutes of the film that is was made in the fifties. This is not a bad thing. In fact, these stylings work to the film's advantage. This is not a film about gore and stylized violence. There is a place for that (I'm looking at you, Tarantino) but it is not here. This is a film about hardship and loss and suffering and being unable to do much of anything about it. This is a film about hollowness and how it affects desire. This is a film about dreaming of a life you perhaps could have achieved if circumstances were not what they are. And this is a film about all that I have listed above making someone willing to do most anything to get out of their situation.While not dealing with The American Dream (TM) as much as, say, The Godfather, this is a quintessentially American film. That's one thing I love about older American cinema; you can tell that it was made for this country. Note that I'm not saying that this country is better than any other; just that I like film that shows where it was made, as you'll see if you read the reviews of some of the foreign films that I like.This film and A Streetcar Named Desire are the two best examples of the heights of 50s Brando. Watching him act, you can see how he inspired some of the greatest stars of the generation after to pick up acting. To state the obvious: his performance is outstanding. Brando is a man one could perhaps say is the greatest movie star of two different decades, this one and the 70s. He starred in a number of great films and delivered a number of great performances: I suggest that you check them all out.This film does not do everything right. Thematically, Brando's character should have died at the film's end. In fact, that was the original ending of the screenplay before Kazan changed it. In addition, there are a few minor tweaks here and there that perhaps would have made for a more effective film. But what the film does right, it does so very right. At some points, it leaves you as gobsmacked as you would be if Usain Bolt ran the hundred meter dash in nine seconds flat. The tone is crisp. Kazan knows exactly what he's going for and he and Brando get it right almost every time. The acting is passionate and emotionally resonant. The writing is tight and superb, elegant yet unpredictable.If I had to sum up the film in one sentence, I would say this: A film both timely and eternal, chilling and heartwarming, this masterpiece deserves its position in the halls of great cinema. Hopefully, you are not like Terry, the main character of this film. Hopefully, you can at least watch this film without obstruction or restraint. If so: do it.",

            "content": "For the first time ever I just watched the 1954 classic \"On The Waterfront\", and I must say overall the film is very courageous with plenty of suspense, drama, and personal conflict to make a viewer feel pleased. The legendary Brando gives a fine performance as a conflicted and guilt ridden torched soul by the name of Terry Malloy. Malloy who's an ex-fighter remembers(I \"could have been a contender\" which is the films most famous and quoted line) anyway he now works for mob union boss Johhny Friendly(Lee J. Cobb) on the crime plagued shores of the waterfront. All along the way though the viewer can see the guilt and remorse problems of the central character as with each passing scene you want to tell Terry to stand up and face the truth and leave the corrupt world of blood money and favors. The film has a special love theme brought about when Terry falls for a young blond and becomes the lover of Edie Doyle(Eva Marie Saint) it is by the inspiration and warmth of her that Terry is pushed to see the new light and it's even more obvious when Terry's brother(Rod Steiger) is killed. Then the search for the truth and integrity is a must as a conflicted man must face the underworld head on to achieve real peace and comfort within, and most of all his conscious is set free. Really the final scenes are unforgettable with high drama and courage. Great performances are given also from Karl Malden as a concerned and fiery town priest, and Lee J. Cobb is ruthless as can be as the underworld boss Johhny Friendly. A classic film from the legend big Marl he clearly gives one of the finest and most courageous performances in film history, it proves a person must face inner conflict and let the truth shine and face corruption head on.",

Also before Brando, American actors such as Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant and James Cagney had THE looks, and attitudes. When Marlon Brando entered the scene, he put his method acting skills to work and by combining his handsome-American look with his acting at Shakespeare proportions and became the most influential in film history. Like most actors, Brando played a wide variety of character very well. Unlike most, he possessed a sense of raw naturalness and emotional intensity that only Laurence Olivier rivalled. Brando's portrayal of Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire captivated audiences around the world. A few years later, Brando wins his first Oscar in his greatest portrayal: former-prizefighter-turned-mob-enforcer who heroically takes a stand against his superiors.Terry Malloy aspired to become a successful boxer but is now an errand-boy for the mafia on the dock shore. He witnesses a murder that shocks him at first, but later brushes it off. When he falls in love with the man's sister (Saint), Terry starts feeling guilty and responsible for not saying something to the police. He meets a priest (Malden) that urges him and gives him confidence for his actions. Eventually, Terry boldly stands up against the mob that can reinstate peace.While The Godfather is Brando's best movie, Terry Malloy is his best piece of acting. His character is so familiar, yet original. The great amount of power and intensity that Brando brings is unmatched. It's not just a guy yelling at little things, it is a charming and self-centred man whose conscience gives him the courage to become a hero. Brando blew me away, more than almost every performance I've ever seen. I know I will never see a better piece of acting in the future. Every actor tries to make acting look natural and dramatic roles look intense, but this was the first great bit of non-Shakespeare acting.While this does not have much of an iconic look to it like Brando's other roles, it is still the best portrayal and the movie that changed acting forever.4/4",

            "content": "Bud Schulberg's hard-hitting story and screenplay was destined to become an instant hit and in the directorial hands of craftsman, Elia Kazan was turned into a worldwide phenomenon. Schulberg's writings covered a curious variety of topics from corruption within the fight game 'The Harder They Fall' to the plunder of bird plumage in 'Wind Across the Everglades' - even taking a serious shot at Media and the promotion of corrupt charlatans as 'hero's' with 'A face In The Crowd'. In his early war years, Schulberg also gathered evidence for the Nuremberg trials - not one to hold back on the trail of inhuman activities.Adding immeasurably to the power of 'Waterfront' were the towering talents of Composer Leonard Bernstein - creating a haunting musical soundscape that gave life to the settings and soul-searching torment of its characters. Performances, guided by Kazan, were career cementing for Brando, Eva Marie Saint (introducing) and Karl Malden, along with a hand-picked cast of powerhouse support players all destined for solid careers. The violence portrayed within this picture was not simply sensationalistic (as it was for many that tried to copy 'waterfront') but rather to make a statement against violence, in an effort to bring justice into a corrupt institution. It still packs a wallop today as it did 70yrs ago. Boris Kaufman's striking B/W cinematography ('Patterns' 56) adds considerable visual power.The Columbia DVD features a good image and sound transfer and I'm sure will have since been remastered in HD.",

A showcase for well-crafted melodramatic writing with a purpose--the specific elements may be familiar, but they're assembled with the precision of a craftsman; even more so, it features a trove of galvanizing performances (the main cast had no shortage of great pieces of acting in their careers, yet rarely were any of them better than they were here). No matter how many times someone watches it, the famous scene inside the cab always packs a wallop. Made in part by Kazan as a response to the negative reaction he received after appearing before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, a decision that remains hugely controversial to this day; less controversial is this film's status as a masterpiece, marred only by a couple instances of overbearing use of Leonard Bernstein's otherwise terrific score.

I coulda been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am.\" Ah, the earnest dialogue spoken by Marlon Brando in one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Brando sitting in the taxi with his brother, Charley (Rod Steiger) trying to explain his reasoning why he opposes Johnny Friendly, Hoboken's most powerful man with a gun pointed to his face. This scene is so earnest, so powerful, delivered perfectly by Brando, who does fantastic by showing a sweet, gentle side to his nature despite performing the tough-guy act. As the great critic Roger Ebert quotes, \"What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress?\" Before we get too much ahead of ourselves, I should at least point out this movie I'm reviewing is On the Waterfront, arguably one of the greatest movies ever made. It is special in many ways, but it is unanimously praised in how it changed the landscape of acting. The casting of Marlon Brando helped dearly. He changed how things were in a film. He made acting less predictable and did things never done before in cinema. He provided such texture to his role and in each scene he is in, you can see how he manages the line between gentleness and tough-guy act. Director Elias Kazan made a point not only Brando's acting was better than most, it was also more influential than most. He brought such a tenderness to his character and he won Best Actor at the Academy Awards in 1954, which he wholeheartedly deserved.I really found the plot interesting, and there is actually truth behind the plot. Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a young man who tends to his pigeons and works on the docks for a corrupt boss of the unions, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), while he dreams to be a boxer. One day, he witnesses a murder committed by some thugs of Friendly's. Terry becomes close with the sister of the victim, Edie Boyle (Eve Marie Saint) because he feels responsible for her brother's death. She introduces him to Father Barry (Karl Malden) who attempts to have Malloy take a stand against Friendly in order to smash the racketeering.As I mentioned in the above paragraph, this film is based off some truth. The film has an obvious political agenda, based off the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Commission) hearings. The director, Elia Kazan was called to the committee, and he named names. Names who were affiliated with the Communist Party. Critics have commented in the past that this film may have hidden, political motives, because of what he did at those HUAC meetings. I actually believe the film is based off that, but I applaud him in making the film. No one should be afraid to state what they believe in. Another part of history is the longshoremen of the Hoboken docks. Hoboken had trouble in all its racketeering, so that all plays an influential part in the movie.The main role of any director is to get the best performances he can out of his actors. Well, Kazan was certainly up for the task in this film. Everyone churned in amazing performances. I already gave my love letter to Brando, who previously worked with Kazan in 1951's A Streetcar for Desire. The film could have turned out to be very different. Frank Sinatra was originally cast as Terry, but the producers went ahead to cast Brando instead. The best move they could have done. This is Eve Marie Saint's first film role, and she eagerly rises for the challenge. A perfect foil for Brando. Her scene with Brando in the bar as they talked about feelings for each other is another priceless cinematic scene. Another important role was Rod Steiger, who played Terry's brother, also mixed up with Friendly. That taxi scene was incredible, as Brando and Steiger had amazing chemistry. Despite opposite views, the brothers very much love each other. Karl Malden as Father Barry does a wonderful job, although it feels like his acting is overshadowed by the heavyweights. Finally, Lee J. Cobb as the union boss, Friendly does an excellent job. I loved his final scenes of the movie. His fate is very deserving, and without spoiling much, I was laughing in the face of Friendly's as the movie came to a close.Overall, this is just one incredible film. If you were to say that this is the best film of all time, I would have no issue with that. This is one of my favorites , and it's one of those few films I can find no fault with. From the masterful direction to the skilled direction to the expert cinematography, there is much to love about the film. This was nominated for twelve Oscars and won eight of them. Brando and Saint took home awards and so did Kazan as director. Cobb, Malden, and Steiger were all nominated. This gripping crime thriller should be a showcase for film professors everywhere. This film changed the perspective of acting and it changed American acting for the better. The film and the muckraking articles that inspired it brought light to crime in the Hoboken streets and perhaps those streets became cleaner in the immediate aftermath. If you love movies, check this film out.",

Overall, \"On the Waterfront\" is really portraying union bosses as corrupt, but it does side with the workers. Marlon Brando is in top-notch form as Terry Molloy, the hired thug who sides with the workers after the mob leaders murder his brother Charley (Rod Steiger). A good parallel to Terry's inner conflict is Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint): she's pretty but rough. Anyway, this is a movie that everyone should see, especially as labor conflicts continue into the 21st century.It seems like they must have been a little uncomfortable filming Eva Marie Saint in her slip in that one scene.",

            "content": "With director Elia Kazan's death last fall and Marlon Brando's death in July, it seems appropriate to revisit this film now, and owning the DVD version is certainly a worthwhile investment with all the extra contextual information provided. First and foremost, fifty years later, this film is still an absolute stunner. Kazan, with screenwriter Budd Schulberg, has fashioned a pulsating story about Mob informers amid the highly corrupted longshoreman unions on the New Jersey docks in the fifties. The focus is on the evolution of Terry Malloy, a former boxer who has been relegated to play errand boy for a nasty union boss, the ironically named Johnny Friendly. Terry's brother Charley, a crooked union lawyer, is the one who got him to give up boxing and take the menial job. Terry is satisfied with his status until a neighborhood pal gets thrown off a roof to prevent him from testifying to the crime commission. Terry is then driven headlong to his conscience by local priest Father Barry and Edie Doyle, the potential informer's sister. The interactions among these characters have great passion and feel deeply truthful thanks to the sterling cast, a virtual Who's Who of Actors' Studio top-of-the-class alumni, which was not coincidentally started by Kazan.This movie has more in common with post-WWII neo-realism as introduced by filmmakers like Roberto Rosellini, than with other Hollywood studio-produced fare at the time. It is this hard-edged black-and-white atmosphere that Kazan depicts with passion and often sensitivity. Leonard Bernstein's symphonic score, easily among his best work, accentuates the emotions in key scenes with varied colors and swelling power. The ensemble acting is uniformly superb down to the smallest roles. The obvious standouts are Lee J. Cobb as Friendly, Karl Malden as Father Barry and in their screen debuts, Rod Steiger as Charley and Eva Marie Saint as Edie. But of course, the emotive force of this story comes from Brando, probably one of the most definitive performances ever filmed. At the beginning, his character seems too dim-witted to carry such a heavy story of redemption, but Brando's incisive portrayal immediately gets to the heart and soul of Terry's journey, his slow awakening to what he needs to do to save himself at the end. Just watch him try on Edie's glove in the park; react to her anger over her discovery of his role in her brother's death; explain himself to Edie in the saloon; stagger in his bloodied walk at the end, and most especially, confront Charley with his own disappointment in the much-played cab ride scene. All should be used as flawless examples in a master acting class. One could forgive all of Brando's later excesses and expensive star slumming for this one performance...it is simply that good.Granted there are flourishes of melodrama heightened by Bernstein's music, but they are forgivable given the driving power of the story. Enough has been said of the parallels between this movie and Kazan's own role as an informer during the Communist witch-hunts at that time. Whether you see this film as a parable to justify Kazan's decision to name names doesn't really matter when judging the film's merits. It stands on its own as a cinematic masterpiece. It's a must-see.The DVD transfer is very good, obviously taken from a pristine print. It contains a good featurette, \"Contender - Mastering the Method\", which has various people talking about the quality of the film as well as some insightful comments from Steiger himself. There is also an interview with Kazan, which is actually more revealing for what he doesn't talk about than what he does discuss, e.g., falling out with Arthur Miller, testifying to the House on Un-American Activities. Some interesting revelations emerge in these pieces, e.g., Brando's own disappointment after he saw his performance, Brando going to his therapist appointment during Steiger's close-ups in the cab scene, Kazan hating producer Sam Spiegel for pinching pennies during production. The alternate audio tracks by critic Richard Schickel and Elia Kazan biographer Jeff Young are informative though a bit on the gushing side. It is also worth noting that Kazan and Schulberg teamed up again two years later with their fascinating indictment of media celebrities, \"A Face in the Crowd\" (also strongly recommended).",

The Bernstein score is an annoying and distracting retread of \"West Side Story\". The screenplay is full of stilted dialog, with a plot (apparently developed with the creative consultation of J.

            "content": "Director, Elia Kazan, beautifully photographs this classic drama about life on the docks of New York. What really makes the shooting of this film incredible, is the fact that this film looks great, either in 4:3 or 16:9. Marlon Brando plays an ex-prize fighter, Terry Malloy, who witnesses a murder and afterwards, starts befriending the sister of the dead man. From this point, we see a fantastic performance, well photographed, film-noir-type, drama, involving some deep characters and a study in corruption. It's also a commentary on shady union practices, 1950s style. The cast is prefect for this film. Some of them, are just getting started in the movies.This is a pretty good, classic film. It projects the possibility of a slow pace, but that allows you to take in all the images and study the expressions on the actors' faces. The emotions generated, just highlight, even more the excellent performances by the cast. Other than the \"Contender\" scene, brilliant as it was, I felt that Brando, was almost overshadowed by the exemplary acting of the supporting cast, especially Karl Malden, Rod Steiger and Eva Marie Saint as Edie Doyle. That says a lot. It contains some of the best acting seen in a film. It's all about the facial expressions and the amount of energy that comes from that.The performances and the execution of the plot is classic filmmaking at its best. Kazan uses all the great, classic filmmaking styles needed to make a masterpiece. The use of audio techniques are utilized the best, when Malloy tells Edie he was involved with the death of her brother. When Brando begins to talk, Kazan slams overtop of his dialogue the deafening sounds of the ship's horn behind them going off. You can't hear the words, but the facial expressions and emotions coming off of each character speaks volumes. It's a creative way to execute that scene.The \"Contender\" scene is totally not shot in a car, but in a little set piece, probably built in the studio, that Brando and Rod Steiger sit in. It works great though, because as Kazan mixes in car traffic sounds, he also uses interesting light techniques to make it look like they are moving down the street, past street lights and headlights. Every scene was its own little short story and the film does keep your attention, as it methodically unfolds. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. It is a textbook example of how to make a really good movie. It also plays a big role in film history as it rolled through the Academy Awards, winning eight Oscars.8.4 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

I prefer his acting style in 'On the Waterfront' to the one in 'The Godfather' or 'Streetcar Named Desire' because this one is more subtle and natural. The audience could tell Brando is really trying hard to act in the last two movies rather than him assimilated to characters.I love watching Terry's growth, understanding injustice of Friendly Gangs, having courage to fight the fears of being hurt or broke, and overcoming the prejudice of laborers. Terry goes through so many developments in the movie, and Brando delicately acts out each development.I also love how the director portrays Terry at the end of the movie. He stands up and walks again. This scene reminds me of Jesus' road to Calvary. He proved he was the son of God to people watching, and Terry proves he is more than 'a bum' who deserves respect and rights to be a leader of them. The camera follows Terry's point of view, and it becomes shaky and blurry as he walks to the pier. This intensifies Terry's hardship and dramatizes real union's win over the war against Friendly gang.",

But Brando's character eventually starts to question the situation.Brando is good in the lead role. He creates an interesting character who has different sides in him. The best thing about the film I think is the strong message it sends...about not closing your eyes for injustice but to face the truth.

            "content": "Marlon Brando is one tremendous screen presence, carrying one of the most realistic performances of the often very staged older cinema. Realism in his relationships with the rest of the characters protrudes greatly, especially in the most famous scene in the film, sitting in the car with his brother, delivering that passionate monologue to his brother, whose resistance to compassion is chiseled away. Actually, he meets his match with Lee J. Cobb, who delivers on an incredible level as the horrible union boss, creating a very raw villain that draws pure hate from the audience, additionally because of the context the story is in, as he bullies salt-of-the- earth working class people.Yes, On the Waterfront is a good film with strong lead performances, but by today's standards, as much as the masses of its generation look back upon it as one of the all-time greatest films of all time, the film is dated in the least fascinating sense. Eva Marie Saint's role is, like most of the female roles in most of the rest of the films of the 1950s, unfortunately subjugated as the love interest, objectified rather than fleshed out to make a very good film like this even more dramatic. Instead, it condescends the ability of its own sympathetic female character like the general remainder of mainstream films. In On the Waterfront, the two-dimensional drawing of the characters does not stop at women, however. It extends to the transparently token role of Karl Malden's priest, whose purpose is terribly obvious, and that is to communicate directly the film's profound moral message. He only arrives on screen to present us with monologues that rivet the sympathetic workers and frustrate the bad guys. Another role that is, at least by now, very clich\u00e9 is the role of the dense, squinting sidekick to the union mob whose only line is a reply to someone asking for the posse's approval, and it is always, \"Definitely.\"These elements that I criticize are not necessarily flaws, because the film clearly works. It's powerful, but by today's standards, the film is unfortunately weakened. The standards I speak of are not even necessarily cinematic. They are social in general. The film needs no crutch; it simply bears all the standard weak points of formula films that are designed to work for the specific point in time, which in this case is the mid-1950s. Now, the kid massacring the pigeon coup in response to a character who talks to the police would not have as much of a sympathetic portrayal as it does in this film. It certainly does not arouse sympathy in me, as I am a devout animal lover.The director, Elia Kazan, fashions a tight movie that has its great flashes of realism in terms of chemistry between people and the conditions of environment, and reveals his squealer perspective, being one of the maniacs who participated in ratting out Hollywood writers and directors on the Black List, and propagandizes his standpoint on ratting out by glorifying and commending it here, showing those who don't approve to be naive and apart of an unfortunate, insulated community that simply doesn't know any better. In the film, it works. In reality, what he did is monstrous. But as a director, he is quite good, because, all things considered, On the Waterfront is a deserving classic.",

            "content": "On rewatching \"On the Waterfront\" recently, I found it to be preachy and schematic, more like a dose of medicine than a form of entertainment. However, I think that's what sometimes happens to socially relevant films when the context in which they first appeared is long past, and this fact should not be held against the movies themselves. Despite any cracks that may have surfaced in the facade of Elia Kazan's film over the years, it still remains a blisteringly powerful movie.Marlon Brando had a singular appeal as an actor. He attacked his roles like a wounded bull, bluntly charging around the screen while letting glimpses of a vulnerable and aching center show through. I would have said that his performance here as Terry Malloy was his best -- if I had not seen the woeful \"Last Tango in Paris,\" a dreadful movie that nevertheless showcases Brando at his highest level of greatness. His \"I coulda been a contender...\" soliloquy in \"Waterfront\" has been hopelessly parodied in the intervening years, but I hope that doesn't prevent viewers new to the film from appreciating what a truly heartbreaking and moving cinematic moment Brando creates while delivering it.Watch also the supporting players in this film, particularly Rod Steiger as Terry's brother, both stronger and weaker than his younger sibling, who obviously admires Terry even while he's baffled by him. Even though Brando gets all of the choicest lines in the above-mentioned contender scene, Steiger matches him every step of the way with his hang-dog, nuanced facial expressions. Lee J. Cobb blusters and shouts his way through his performance as the mob heavy; he serves the function required of him but grows tiresome by the time the movie ends. Karl Malden gives an impassioned performance as a local priest and Eva Marie Saint single-handedly provides the film with some much-needed estrogen. She never gave another performance to equal this one.I greatly admire Elia Kazan as an artist. I don't care about his personal actions or beliefs; he made great movies, and what he did in his private life does not change that fact. He could make virtually any material better than it would have been in the hands of another director, and what saves \"On the Waterfront\" today from its heavy-handedness, aside from the remarkable acting, is Kazan's fierce commitment to the material and his explosive directorial decisions.\"On the Waterfront\" may be flawed, but it's still a classic.Grade: A",

Basically the Hoboken, New Jersey waterfront is being overrun with mobsters, and the Crime Commission, supported by Father Barry (Oscar nominated Karl Malden), is trying to cut down the underworld infiltration. Workers are being turned against each other, and without knowing it, dock worker and ex-fighter Terry Malloy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Marlon Brando) gets involved in and witnesses the murder of longshoreman Joey Doyle. The murder was orchestrated by mob boss Johnny Friendly (The Exorcist's Oscar nominated Lee J. Cobb), along with other illegal activities on the dock, with the help of Charley 'the Gent' (introducing Oscar nominated Rod Steiger), Terry's brother. Terry is beginning to understand that his actions were wrong, and has his conscience turning, especially when he has Joey's sister Edie (introducing North by Northwest's Oscar and BAFTA winning Eva Marie Saint) looking for those responsible. He also wants to really make a difference on the docks, Father Barry urges him on, and it all comes to a head with a severe beating, until Terry manages to make the important change for the current circumstances.

This film really got me started on my love of classic movies- I spotted a VHS copy in a department store bargain bin one fateful day in 2003 (I was at the humble age of 14 back then) for $9.95, and took a chance on it; thus discovering the brilliance of classic film, Brando and the art that is movie-making.This is truly a BRILLIANT film. I believe the key to any 'classic' is a great story behind the cinematic techniques, level of acting and direction- and 'On The Waterfront' encompasses all of the aforementioned facets.Set in the tough 1950's New York waterfront, this film is a gritty experience. Marlon Brando stars as Terry Malloy, an ambition-starved, ex prize-fighter who begins the film with little to no goals in life. Having been 'bought' by corrupt waterfront boss Johnny Friendly (fine supporting work by Lee J Cobb); under the orders of Friendly and Terry's older brother and high-ranking associate of Friendly, Charley (Rod Steiger, amazing performance), Terry is used as a pawn in the death of Joey Doyle, a worker who dared to speak up against the ill treatment that the men on the waterfront were receiving. Terry is shocked by Joey Doyle's murder, and his views on life are slowly changed by his falling in love with Joey Doyle's kind-hearted sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint, in her Oscar-winning role), and the influence of a priest, Father Barry (Karl Malden, of 'Streetcar' fame, in another good role).I'll leave the basic plot there, as it would be a shame to ruin the story for potential viewers. I remember the power of my first-viewing and the emotional hold it had on me- I hope many others in future will experience the same thing.The central romance between Brando and Saint's characters adds a touch of innocence and lightness to the darkness of the waterfront. Edie is sweet and good-natured, always trusting the people she loves. Edie brings out a softer, tender side to Terry that he has never known before. It is heartwarming to watch Edie and Terry fall in love, as Brando and Saint have very good chemistry so it is utterly believable.Lots of classic scenes- most notably, the taxicab conversation between Steiger and Brando. Emotions running high, extraordinary acting- it's great stuff. Max Steiner's score works well among some of the more 'emotive' scenes. Another great moment is Terry's 'confession' to Edie- where their voices are blacked out by a steam engine, and a close-up of Saint's gloved hands covering her mouth, reveals the horror and disbelief that Terry was involved in her brother's death.Brando's acting performance is one of the best ever committed to screen-on a par with his own 'Don Vito Corleone' in 'The Godfather' and the brutish Stanley in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.A must-see.10/10",

            "content": "You have to watch each film for its own value, without caring what its history is; and that's very difficult when you watch a film that's considered a classic, like Elia Kazan's \"On the waterfront\". But this classic is indeed a very good movie and the best way for me to honor it is writing about it as if it was any other film. However, it is important to note that, as other classics, we watch films like \"On the waterfront\" in a different way now.There are some moments in the movie where you feel like laughing (and sometimes you do), but you can be sure that when the filmmakers planned them, there was no intention of laugh whatsoever. So there is a mixed feeling of 'this is ridiculous' and 'this is powerful' at the same time when Father Barry (Karl Maden from \"The Streets of San Francisco\", as my cousin Pancho pointed out) convincingly grabs a cigarette and puts it in his mouth\u0085But it's not a normal cigarette. It is said that screenwriter Budd Schulberg made a lot of research about the situation of the movie; workers who don't get all of their rights because \"the waterfront\" is controlled by the mob men, who walk around in expensive suits while some people don't get the chance to do their job. It is also said that Schulberg put lives of real individuals in his screenplay, which led to courtroom confrontations for the movie company after the film's success.In conclusion, \"On the waterfront\" made some noise on the real world, because it generated some decisions and changes about a problem and because it was clearly a well-made film. The way the characters are observed throughout the ride by Boris Kaufman's cinematography is the evidence of a work of variations. During some scenes where main character Terry (Marlon Brando) is talking to girlfriend Edie (Eva Marie Saint), the camera forgets close ups and watches the actors from far away, examining the whole background with detail; when Father Barry is speaking to the workers of the waterfront in what is probably the movie's most powerful scene, a camera shoots him from above at times, rejecting the obvious move that would be shooting the workers' faces. Of course that in scenes like these, the camera uses close ups and examines emotions, but not doing it all the time is an interesting detail. In the moments when it does examine characters, there's nothing better than Brando's expressions. In some ways, his approach to Terry is not so different from his Ken in \"The Men\", because they both share a hidden story of redemption. It's like self-redemption due to the fact that they have to do things for themselves before proving anything to anyone else.That might not be the main aim of \"On the waterfront\", but Brando sure makes it look that way. Playing two characters so related on the inside and making them different on the outside is something few actors can achieve\u0085Brando's power here is as strong as ever, but he's joined by a cast so strong that is difficult to say he is superior. His interpretation made me understand, finally, where Stallone took the inspiration for \"Rocky\". It had to be from here; and you can analyze it as a great performance inspired by a great performance. The brutal honesty; the misunderstanding of the world around them is something that connects these two characters and many more...All of them iconic.The rest of the male cast is a growing delivery of emotions; going from Lee J. Cob as a horrific villain, through Rod Steiger's Charlie Malloy (Brando's character brother) and finishing in Maden's astonishing turn as Father Barry. Eva Marie Saint, in her first movie role, is not great by herself but is a better companion to Brando than say, Teresa Wright; and that's good enough.If I had to make one complaint, it would be one only and it definitely diminishes the quality of the film: the score. I had the same feeling during \"The Men\"; where the score becomes louder than the characters' voices and, at times, is so exaggerated that it turns to something laughable. Composer Leonard Bernstein has done respected and interesting things, but the score of this film is not one of those. It would be fair to say that movies like \"On the waterfront\" are not made anymore; but it's unfair to condemn the contemporary cinema; which keeps creating good movies, and Brando graced the screen in some of them too.",

            "content": "'On the Waterfront' is a tour de force that really has it all \u2013 a great script, outstanding acting, and great direction. It tells the story of a group of longshoremen who are being coerced into silence by their corrupt and mob-connected union bosses. These are tough guys who work backbreaking jobs and have a code of not ratting out others. It's this ethic combined with the threat of being denied work or killed that keeps them all in line. We're sucked in immediately when in the opening minutes of the film there is a brutal murder to silence one of them, in which Marlon Brando finds himself unwittingly an accomplice.Brando is absolutely brilliant in this movie, and it boggles my mind that he considered his performance to be subpar after he saw it. He is a genius in the big moments and in the small ones he creates. Karl Malden is also outstanding as the priest who tries to rally the workers to stand up for themselves, and Lee J. Cobb and Rod Steiger turn in strong performances as the mob boss and one of his lieutenants (and Brando's brother), respectively. It's a shame that these three were all nominated for best supporting actor but split the vote so that none of them would win, though the film won 8 others, including Best Picture.The scene in the taxicab with the brothers, where Steiger implores and even threatens Brando to remain silent, is one of the best in movie history \u2013 not just because of the fantastic script, but also because of Brando's acting. He recalls having to take a dive in a fight for a mob, and when his brother blames his manager for trying to bring him along too fast as a young boxer, running his career, he responds: \"It wasn't him Charlie, it was you. Remember that night in the Garden, you came down into my dressing room and said, 'kid, this ain't your night. We're going for the price on Wilson.' You remember that? This ain't your night! My night \u0085 I could have taken Wilson apart. So what happens, he gets the title shot outdoors in a ballpark and what do I get, a one-way ticket to palookaville. You was my brother, Charlie, you shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You shoulda taken care of me, just a little bit, so I wouldn't have to take them dives for the short-end money.\"Charlie: \"I had some bets down for you, you saw some money.\" \"You don't understand! I coulda had class, I coulda been a contender! I coulda been somebody! Instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charlie.\" That scene of being let down by a loved one is so poignant that on its own it makes the movie worth watching, but it's rock solid throughout, even if a little on the dramatic side at the ending. Kazan provided great direction with scenery that looked realistic because it was, having been shot in Hoboken with many of the extras real longshoremen, and on rooftops with aerials and dovecotes. I absolutely HATE the idea that Kazan made the film in part to justify his own testimony to congress during the McCarthy years, but it's a sad fact about the backstory of the film.With that said, I have to put that aside and give it credit for being a great, great film. Aside from the taxicab scene, there are a couple of others that give me goosebumps every time I see them, one of which is Malden calling out the bosses in a speech despite being threatened and having garbage thrown at him (\"Every time the mob puts pressure on a good man and stops him from doing his duty as a citizen \u2013 it's a crucifixion!\"). This is a tough, gritty movie, about the little man overcoming intimidation to stand up for himself against evil. The theme is timeless, and the movie creates timeless, immortal moments.",

This 1954 Classic, which took home eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, is a must watch for those, who think, Black & White lacked much color!Elia Kazan's Direction, which won him an Oscar, is breath-taking. His understanding to this rough & edgy story, deserves distinction marks. Budd Schulberg's Oscar-Winning Screenplay, is simply great. Like it's story, even the characters come up strongly, especially the protagonist, Terry Malloy, played by Brando. Cinematography by Boris Kaufman, again Oscar-Winning, is perfect. Editing, again Oscar-Winning, is razor-sharp.Performance-Wise: Brando, Brando, Brando. The Magic of this Supremely Talented Actor is once again proved with his performance here.

            "review_title": "Snitches Get Stitches",
            "content": "On The Waterfront is one of the most strikingly humble films to ever come out of Hollywood. Inspired by a series of articles on union violence and longshoremen corruption titled \"Crimes On The Waterfront\" by Malcolm Johnson, On The Waterfront doesn't get classified within the ranks as a gangster film or a film noir even though elements of both genres are present within it. The film has several noir trademarks including a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace however as common with the genre, there is no glamour within its cynicism - there is nothing glamorous in On The Waterfront. Set and filmed on location in Hoboken, New Jersey where men scrap by making a living, this neo-realist world of dock-side urbanity is absent of any Hollywood artifice. You can feel the chilly atmosphere from the cold breath coming from the actor's mouths to the smoke emanating from trash burnt by homeless on men the street. Even the rooftops themselves showcase a vast urban jungle of chimneys and TV antennas encompassed within the use of deep focus as the docks, the city and even The Empire State Building dominate the background.The ecosystem of Hoboken's waterfront is a world in which no one sees anything or hears anything. The longshoremen who work there operate by a system known as D&D, no not Dungeons & Dragons but Deaf & Dum. The waterfront is controlled by a corrupt union led by Michael J. Skelly aka Johnny Friendly (Lee J Cobb) and his right-hand man Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger). On The Waterfront is a film of four powerhouse performances as the cast attempts to out-Stanislavski each other with Cobb and Steiger making for a very entertaining scenery-chewing combo. The intimidating and manipulative figures with their cigars, fedoras and expensive coats attempt to make their racket sound justified and legitimate (\"But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin watchman's pension!\") and even features some early semi-cursing (\"Just too much shhhh, Marquis of Queensbury. It softens him up\") delivered in those thick New York accents (Steiger himself would go onto play a similar character in The Harder They Fall).On The Waterfront paved the way for the Italian-American dominated DeNiro/Pacino/Scorsese/Coppolla school of cinema, thanks in part to the method acting performance of one Marlon Brando as cooperator turned informer Terry Malloy. One of the aspects which make Brando's performance so striking is the balance between being macho and tender. Beneath his exterior, Terry has a soft side and a conscience with one of the avenues which really showcases this is his interaction throughout the film with pigeons. It is somewhat wholesome that Terry Malloy spends his free time pigeon-raising as a hobby, once a common practice on the rooftops of New York City although one which has waned since the 1950's. The pigeons also serve an additional means of being metaphorical of the film's themes. Early in the picture, Terry describes how hawks perched atop big hotels will occasionally swoop in and snatch a pigeon. The pigeons can be seen as symbolic of the longshoremen with Johnny Friendly and his band of union thugs being symbolic of hawks. This metaphor is best showcased in the harrowing sight of the workers outside the dockyard trying to get the work tokens after one of the bosses throws them up in the air, similar to how pigeons will frantically go after birdseed after it has been thrown on the ground.The film's method acting prowess reaches its height with the famous scene in the back of the taxi (putting to one side the oddity of the taxi having Venetian blinds in the back window). The back and forth between Brando and Steiger is some of the rawest acting ever committed to celluloid. You can really feel the affection between these two brothers and I'm particularly struck by Steiger's line \"When you weighed 168 pounds, you were beautiful\", it really conveys the platonic love between the two. What makes Brando's most famous line on his squandered career as a prizefighter (\"I coulda had class..\") so effective is not only the sheer tragedy it conveys but as a viewer, anyone can apply their own experience to the quote with any great opportunities one could have missed out on in life.The picture's female lead comes as Eva Marie Saint in her film debut as the virginal and innocent Edie Doyle, whom acts as a counterbalance to the rough and unsanctified Terry Malloy. A love does blossom between the mismatched couple of the bad boy and the catholic school girl (who cares for a six-toed, cockeyed cat) acting as a form of relief to the otherwise dower nature of the film. The picture's other face of saintly conviction in the form of the great Karl Malden as Father Pete Barry, a na\u00efve figure at first who goes on a learning journey and acts as a stand-in for the audience themselves to understand how this world operates. Like Father Flanagan in Boy's Town or Father Jerry Connolly in Angels With Dirty Faces, it's intriguing to see there was once a time when men of the collar would have been portrayed as heroes in media instead of pedophiles or simply being the butt of jokes (\"These are small, but the one's out there are far away\").On The Waterfront is widely interpreted to be director Elia Kazan's response to those who criticized him for identifying eight (former) communists in the film industry before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952. There are those who deny this, however, I feel the film is too on the nose for this not to be the case with lines such as Father Barry's monologue in the church (\"There's one thing we've got in this country and that's a way of fightin' back. Now, getting the facts to the public, testifying for what you know is right, against what you know is wrong. And what's ratting to them is telling the truth for you\") to Terry's angry outburst during the film's climax (\"You hear that? I'm glad what I done!\"). In popular culture, a so-called snitch is almost universally presented as a bad person, as indicated by the associated slang (rat, tattle-tale, fink, narc, squealer, stoolie, weasel, Judas). However, On The Waterfront is a film in which the informer is the hero. So what are the ethics of informing or snitching? Since On The Waterfront is a film in which the characters are motivated by biblical morality, what does the good book say on the matter? From GotQuestions.org:\n(The Bible) records the accounts of several informers. Sometimes the informers acted evilly; other times, nobly. Examples of evil informers include the Ziphites, who betrayed David into Saul's hand twice (1 Samuel 23:19-20; 26:1; cf. Psalm 54); Doeg the Edomite, who \"snitched\" on those who helped David, resulting in a massacre (1 Samuel 21:7; 22:9-19); the Persian satraps who \"snitched\" on Daniel (Daniel 6:10-13); and, of course, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the Lord (Matthew 26:14-16). Examples of noble informers include Mordecai, who informed the king of a plot to assassinate him (Esther 2:21-23).To summarize, the difference between good snitching and bad snitching can be interrupted by its effect on innocent people. However, if passing along information can upload justice and thwart evil, then informing or snitching can be seen as a moral good.I had long assumed On The Waterfront must have been among the last films shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio prior to Hollywood's mass adoption of widescreen since that was the only ratio I had ever seen the film being presented. However, with the film's Criterion Collection release I was surprised to discover On The Waterfront exists in three different aspect rations including the widescreen presentations of 1:66:1 and 1:85:1. What is the best viewing option? The presentation on 4:3 is not a pan & scan of a wider alternative but rather the widescreen versions are cropped from the full frame 4:3 version. I didn't have an issue watching the film in 1:66:1 but the wider 1:85:1 version cuts out too much information from the frame and feels unnecessarily claustrophobic. Personally, I find the near square frame of the 4:3 version to feel more cinematic than its wide-screen alternatives.On The Waterfront concludes with Terry Malloy striping Johnny Friendly of his authority following a fight with his goons, as Terry pulls off a Christ metaphor as he walks and stumbles three times upon reaching the dockyard entrance, silently demanding to be allowed in for a day's work despite being blacklisted following his testimony. Multiple factors cause this ending to make the hairs on your neck stand up. Firstly, the music by Leonard Bernstein (in only one of three film scores he composed) with its bombastic use of drums heightens the drama. Furthermore, there is the union man starring Terry in the face and triumphantly shouting, \"Alright, let's go to work!\" followed by the men walking behind Terry while ignoring Friendly who is in a fit of rage. Finally, there is the sense of finality which comes from the concluding shot of the dockyard door closing after all the men have entered. According to author James T Fisher, the longshoremen involved in the real-world events which inspired On The Waterfront have stated the film is misleading and not an accurate depiction of real-life events, and watching this ending there is the part of your brain questioning if this would this happen in real life but within the context of the movie, it does not at all feel contrived. An ending which involves men arriving at their workplace in the morning ahead of a shift, yet it leaves one with a sense of euphoria. Workers of the world unite, I guess.",

            "content": "On the Waterfront is directed by Elia Kazan and adapted to screenplay by Budd Schulberg from a series of Malcolm Johnson articles. It stars Marlon Brando, Lee J. Cobb, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger and Pat Henning. Music is by Leonard Bernstein and cinematography by Boris Kaufman.Terry Malloy (Brando) was once a boxer with potential and big dreams. Now working as a longshoreman on the docks for mob boss Johnny Friendly (Cobb), Terry witnesses the murder of a fellow dock worker and finds himself conflicted about if he should inform to the crime commission about what he knows, more so as he gets in tight with the dead man's sister.As good as anything Kazan, Brando and Kaufman ever did, On the Waterfront strips it down to a stench filled corrupt part of New York as honest hard working men battle to make ends meet under the rule of corrupt mob led union bosses. The dialogue is almost lyrical in its simplicity, deftly at odds with the dull pallor of the environment involving barely livable housing and misty docks holding awful secrets.Although a defence for squealing, with the finger pointed at those in the high chairs here, it's a seminal classic that deserved every Oscar win and nomination that it got. From the electric \"contender\" speech (watch Steiger's facial acting here), to Brando's heart aching discovery of his beloved birds being killed, and onto the unforgettable punch the air finale, this is as good as classic cinema gets. 10/10",

            "content": "\"On The Waterfront\" is a 1954 crime drama directed by Elia Kazan starring Marlon Brando and Karl Malden.\n\u26aa\nAll in all, this Elia Kazan essential film packingly explores the organised crime and dangerous mob criminality on the waterfront by reference to the conflict of a man torn between love and loyalty, masterfully portrayed by Marlon Brando, and thanks to a perfectly balanced pacing, intense and insightful writing and an outstandingly performing cast, it becomes a crime drama per excellence that displays masterclass storytelling at its finest and knows to grab you in a way you will not see coming at all.\n\u26aa\nA few months ago, I was introduced to the works of both Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando when I watched their first collaboration, the marvellous adaptation of Tennessee Williams' outstanding play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", and after that, I was so tremendously excited to check out more of them. By a fortunate coincidence, I stumbled across this classic here when I rummaged the bargain table at my local store, and for only five bucks, I had to get it. As it turns out, it was one of the best decisions I have made this year, as this film blew me away more than I expected. I thought that their first cooperation was impeccable, but this one beats the hell out of it. Brando plays the longshoreman Terry Malloy, an ex-prize fighter who works for the local mob boss Johnny Friendly, who happens to control every pier and every dock in the area. What amazes me the most about this film is how it manages to do the splits between being a sensitive character study and being an intense crime flick with some subtle film noir vibes, because next to Terry's inner conflict, it gives an insight into how organised crime works. Malloy, superbly portrayed by Brando, is an incredibly elaborated and eclectic character, because even if he is the henchman of the local mob boss and acts all tough all the time, there is still this turmoil and the myriad of emotions resulting from this buried deep inside of him. On multiple occasions, he complains about how he could have been a legendary fighter if he had followed his dreams instead of hanging around with the mafia. He has been entangled in this construction most of his life, so what is it that makes him reconsider his whole life? The simplest answer: love. After his latest job, he gets to know the sister of the poor fellow he and his colleagues silenced after he spoke up. The thing is, he is somewhat sensitive and couldn't deal with the fact that the man has been killed even if it wasn't necessary, but at the same time loyalty kept him from speaking up to his benefactor and boss, Johnny Friendly, threateningly played by Lee. J. Cobb. To me, it feels like he at first just gets involved with the dead fellow's sister Edie simply because he tries to appease his remorse, but the more the film moves on, the more his affection towards her becomes genuine. Seriously, the chemistry between Brando and Eva Marie Saint (who delivered impressively in her feature film debut) increases gradually, and while it looks like the romance is artificial in the beginning, it is authentic as hell in the very end. Romance brings out the version in him he always wanted to be, but this change of heart entails a severe conflict that defines this film: Who does he swear fidelity to? The crooked man he has worked for most of his life and who enabled him to have constant work or the girl that he fell in love with and deserves justice for what she has been through? It is up to him to decide whether he wants to change the world or let it stay the same, and Brando conveys this inner disunity exceptionally. I as the viewer asked myself \"What would I do if I was him?\" and wasn't able to come to a conclusion. This film affected me in a way I wasn't expecting. On one hand, you don't bite the hand that feeds you, on the other hand, you have to be true to yourself. The tension builds up accordingly to how this conflict becomes more severe, and while I was interested but somewhat neutral in the beginning, I was gradually more packed by this film. Seriously, it has been a while since I was thus intrigued by a film and felt it so intensely. And in the last third, the entire conflict gets out of hand completely. After the mafia, threatened by their former ally, kill Terry's brother, he wants to get his retribution and ultimately decides to testify in court. As a result, he has done the right thing and avenged his brother, but at the same time, the union and most of his friends disgraced him for ratting on the boss. And this is where my favourite part of the entire film begins: in the last twenty minutes or such, all feelings erupt, resulting in one of the most powerful displays of acting and climatic writing I have ever seen. Regardless of his status, Terry goes to the docks and faces off with Johnny Friendly, they even engage in hand combat, before the mobster comments his henchmen to step in. All union workers watch this unfair fight from afar, but you can see in their faces that they are about to change their minds forever. They don't in fact join the brawl but refuse to work for Friendly (who than goes diving involuntarily) and instead state that they only continue to work if Terry leads them. The scene when Terry gets up, completely smashed up and barely on his feet, and spearheads his colleagues, who follow him without reservations, gave me severe goosebumps. You don't destroy a mob boss by beating him up, you defeat him by no longer obeying him, and this is exactly what happens in this magnificent final scene. No mindless free-for-all but masterful warfare. And that impressed me tremendously. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this film to be this great, because it has happened in the past that older Academy Award winning films aged terribly, but in this case is not the case at. The acting, the writing, every single line of dialogue, the setting - it is all brilliant. Before he was Don Corleone, Marlon Brando wrote cinematic history by crushing the mafia on the waterfront, and honestly, as of now, I think this is the best film from the fifties I have ever seen. It truly is a showpiece of dramatic writing.",

Eva Marie Saint demands the identity of her brother's killer. The local priest challenges even further when violence breaks out. The result is a film that is both thought provoking and convicting with strong plotting. Directed by Eliza Kazan with much made regarding his Communist involvement. The film plays like an apology or reasoning. He previously worked with Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire. Here he turns it up a notch further. Brando delivers a powerful performance as a man caught between betrayal and confession for the sacrifice of love. Rod Steiger plays his brother placed in a fatal position. Saint is effective as a woman seeking the truth and as a result influences Brando's conscience. Lee J. Cobb plays the ruthless villain who makes the rules until challenged by Brando. Karl Malden brings a moral centre to the film as a priest moved towards the action that many are reluctant to take. Provocative and powerful filmmaking masterpiece. Score: 10 / 10",

            "content": "In some ways, it is a shame to think exactly how long it took the legendary Marlon Brando before he won his first Oscar, but realizing that he won it in 'On The Waterfront' deeply warms and satisfies anyone's heart with his legendary performance being praised to death. The film itself, is one of incredible style, showing plenty of talent and skill and leaves an undying message that will live forever, much like this legendary picture has.Marlon Brando stars as an ex-boxer named Terry Malloy, whose life has turned to misery and misfortune since been conned out of boxing. This is highlighted in his iconic line, \"I coulda been a contender\u0085\" which has been parodied everywhere since then. It has become such a Hollywood classic that it cements a spot in the top 5 movie quotes of all time, according to the infamous AFI. Terry Malloy blindly takes part in the death of Joey Doyle and is willing to play D & D (deaf and dumb) for his boss, Johnny Friendly, portrayed by the legendary Lee J. Cobb. At this same time, a series of murders and crime ensues as Terry meets and begins a relationship with Joey's sister, Edie portrayed by Eva Saint Marie in her debut.Every single performance in this film is incredible whether the obvious Marlon Brando, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, Eva Saint Marie or even smaller roles such as Rod Steiger. Brando's performance is quite possibly, the greatest cinema has ever seen rivalled only by his performance 18 years later, in The Godfather. He brings a certain energetic feel to the film, boosting the brilliance of his performance by his speciality, method acting. Had anyone else been cast, no matter how legendary, I fear that they couldn't bring the certain endearing aspect that Brando does, the confusion, the anger, the disappointment and most importantly, portray the innocence of his character. Brando excels at each aspects of this film. He is not alone in terms of fantastic performances.Lee J Cobb plays Terry's boss, Johnny Friendly and portrays him with brilliance. He brings yet again, a rather endearing personality to it and later unleashes with an intense, dirty and evil performance. The scene towards the end of the film, where he begins pounding Terry is vicious and completely believable not only from Brando's side but from Cobb's side. He certainly has a way with playing bad guys! Karl Malden is terrific as the priest in this film and it is his second film with Brando, the other being 'A Streetcar Named Desire' He is once more, fantastic as a supporting character knocking some sense into the kid inside Terry. The scene where he objects to Terry's desperate need for murder was just brilliant. Malden brings a certain frustration towards Brando's character, some heart and most importantly, is evident that he brings some sense into Terry.Not only do we have the brilliance of Brando, Cobb and Malden but it is mindblowing to think that Eva Saint Marie won herself an Oscar in her film debut as she plays Terry's love interest, Edie. Whilst her performance may not be up to scrap with the others, it is nevertheless an absolutely fantastic performance especially considering it be her debut. The brilliant thing about 'On The Waterfront' is that it becomes so easy to get lost with the fact that there are actors acting out parts of this film due to how realistic and how grabbing the performances are.The story is an extremely touching one, full of emotion and a realistic take on crime. The film itself is an extremely inspiring and positive one sending the undying message that even the average \"bum\" like Terry can do good like he does by the end of the film. It realistically presents what life can be like and the addition of the two kids who are often shown present with Terry are just brilliant, resembling the innocence of the kid within Terry.At 100 minutes, the film is flawlessly written, directed and paced and keeps a certain intensity all throughout. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous and all themes tackled in this film provide us with hope in life, especially for those who are often discriminated due to various reasons. 'On the Waterfront' is simply a movie that can knock some sense and hope into anyone and it does after all, feature one of the all time greatest performances!",

            "content": "At what point do personal activities of the artist infringe upon his/her professional work? While \"Gadge\" Kazan is acknowledged for his ground-breaking directoral achievements during the 40s and 50s, both on stage and screen, he is also the \"finger-pointer,\" the \"snitcher,\" whose explicit testimony before '52s House of UnAmerican Activities Committee led to the tragic ruin of many Hollywood careers.How ironic that he chose socially conscious scripts for his projects--dramas which upheld free speech, political and ethnic tolerance, and human rights. In his production of \"On the Waterfront\" he has Karl Malden's Fr. Barry condemning those who refused to speak up in the name of justice.  \"Gadge's\" far left sympathies in this in other scripts (like \"Gentlemen's Agreement\") are completely bewildering, when one considers the director's astonishing HUAA testimony--which came on the very heels of \"Waterfront.\"What is one to think, as one watches such Kazan leftist productions, knowing the real life actions of this artist? There's a saying that who we are isn't what we think, say or believe, but what we do.  \"Gadge's\" decision to name names, unfortunately, is something that can't be easily erased or forgotten.  Are we to completely overlook or forget this, though, when viewing such an accomplished work as \"On the Waterfront?\"  For myself, it's difficult to listen to the compassionate lines of Fr. Barry in complete comfort. I can't help but wonder whether this and other Kazan projects are just to help deflect the director's own political indiscretions.Of course, this isn't an isolated case of art vs. life.  Along the same lines, James Cagney sought a vehicle to diminish his having been tagged \"communistic\" by earlier period conservative groups--resulting in \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\"  Who could call Cagney anything but \"patriotic\" after being bombarded by the volume of flags flying in that production?  The ploy worked: Cagney was \"acquitted\"--and the public was left with a delightful movie. Like \"Dandy,\" \"Waterfront\" is also fine film, still being enjoyed by audiences today.  So where does life leave off and art begin?  That's a question I guess only the individual can determine; as far as I can tell, there's no single pat answer. Or to pose it another way, can art be a case of ignorance is bliss?",

            "content": "I have decided to check out movies from the days of early, black-and- white cinema more consistently and one of the first picks I chose was this film, 1954's On the Waterfront. Needless to say, it certainly lives up to its reputation as a timeless classic and one with an obvious political agenda, back in the HUAC days. But this is a simple story about revenge and corruption within the unions. It's a very transformative film and it has Marlon Brando at his very best as the man who is afraid to stick up for himself, at least at first. Elia Kazan, whose name might strike a chord with those familiar with history, directed a film about a poor dockworker named Terry who lives his days by caring for his pigeons and working for a corrupt union boss named Johnny Friendly. After he witnessed the murder of a man, he becomes close with the dead man's sister, Edie whom introduces him to Father Barry who tries to convince Terry to snitch on Johnny Friendly. This film has a great cast and they all deliver excellent performances. Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of all time and he has proved that here as Terry, the man with a big heart but a semi-cowardly one. Eva Marie Saint in her film debut has several powerful scenes including a big one with her and Brando trying to speak over the loudness of a ship. Karl Malden as Father Barry is undoubtedly great as the man fighting for a righteous cause and Lee J. Cobb is sinister, but excellent in his role as the crime boss ruling the waterfront streets. Overall, On the Waterfront could perhaps be one of the greatest films ever made. There is not one issue to make about the film, which is rare in this cinematic world. Film professors should use this film as an example for showcase acting and even technical things such as cinematography. But this is a gripping crime film featuring Marlon Brando at his very best and one of the greatest films of all time. It's funny since this film is based off muckraking articles about Hoboken crime. But nonetheless, an incredible movie. My Grade: A+",

            "content": "One mark of a true classic is how much it improves over the years, and by that standard this hard-hitting drama certainly qualifies. The key to its longevity would have to be the combination of a memorable story with sympathetic characters, led by Marlon Brando's Terry Malloy, a dumb but sensitive ex-boxer who (reluctantly) stands up against the corrupt Union brotherhood controlling the New York City docks. The pivotal scene is still the midnight taxi ride, when Malloy confronts the betrayal of his brother Charley (Rod Steiger) in what was destined to become a golden moment in film history. From the way the exchange was framed and shot (with the camera held steady before the two actors for the duration of the scene) it's clear director Elia Kazan knew exactly what impact the scene would have. Screenwriter Bud Schulberg's message sometimes comes across too strong (angry preacher Karl Malden's sermon in the hold is hard to swallow), and by the end of the film Malloy is elevated almost to divinity, rising from a near-fatal beating to lead his fellow dockworkers to glory. But the film passes the test of time to show how an entertaining melodrama doesn't need to insult the viewer's intelligence.",

Like many great movies, it was a surprise success, there was also a great deal of controversy. Since it depicted the union of stevedores as being controlled by a ruthless organized crime syndicate, there were many voices of protest from the actual leaders of unions.\nMarlon Brando plays Terry Malloy, a former prizefighter that now works unloading cargo ships. The local mob completely controls the union and they will tolerate no dissent, they decide if a man works or not. When Malloy's friend is killed and he starts becoming involved with the friend's sister, Malloy must decide whether to continue to go along with mob rule or to become a government witness.\nIt is my personal opinion that the best performance is by Karl Malden as the local priest that stands behind the men that want to get the crooks out of the union. His passion and principles provide a role model for the others to do the right thing. This movie provides one of the all-time best lines, \"I coulda been a contender.\" This is a movie that you watch every few years to see how actors truly play their roles and say their lines.",

The well-written story and the effective waterfront atmosphere might really be its greatest assets, since they in themselves allow for interesting characters and many dramatic possibilities.  The whole cast is good, and Elia Kazan's direction moves things along at a good pace, while putting all of the pieces together to make an engrossing and entertaining movie.Brando is usually singled out for his performance, but in reality he looks so good because the role is so well-conceived, and because the cast as a whole fits together so well.  Lee J. Cobb's bluster, Karl Malden's iron will, Rod Steiger's coldness, and Eva Marie Saint's sensitivity all fit together nicely with Brando's cocky but oddly thoughtful character.  The story makes good use of all of these, and of the settings, which create an atmosphere that is almost like a character in itself.  Aside from a few unduly melodramatic moments, the entire movie is both absorbing and believable.Wherever one wishes to assign the credit for it, \"On the Waterfront\" is a fine classic that capitalizes on all of its opportunities.

            "content": "It's easy to feel ambivalent about \"On the Waterfront\" because, in some ways, it's director Elia Kazan's defense of his decision to name names before the HUAC. And at times, when the movie aims for universal moral significance, it comes off as preachy. But if you are able to put that subtext aside, the film works very well on a smaller scale--as a study of the growing ethical conscience of Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), longshoreman and sometime employee of corrupt union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Helping Terry--and also becoming better human beings in the process--are Father Barry (Karl Malden), the local priest, and Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), a young woman who knows firsthand what Friendly is capable of doing.\"On the Waterfront\" is the first movie in which I really \"got\" Marlon Brando. He was always bold, inventive, energetic, and charismatic, but in \"Waterfront\" he has the most convincing inner life. A lesser actor would have assumed that because Terry is a longshoreman and former boxer, he's bound to be tough and swaggering, and consequently would have over- emphasized those aspects of Terry's personality. But Brando makes clear from the first scene that Terry is confused about who he is, has a surprising lack of self-confidence, and yearns for something better in life while barely being able to articulate that yearning. He can be brash around Edie, but only because he so wants to impress her. At one point, Edie accuses Terry of lacking any \"sentiment or romance or human kindness,\" and these words sting, because Brando's performance reveals that Terry has all those qualities latent within him.It may be unfair, but such a powerhouse performance makes it easier to find fault with the other actors. Thus, when Malden and Saint have trouble making their characters' most moralizing speeches sound sincere and convincing, it really stands out. Still, both actors do impressive work. I like the father-son relationship that develops between Malden and Brando (especially because it's so different from their relationship in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"), as well as the awkward, touching romance between Brando and Saint. Rod Steiger is also very effective as Charley, Terry's brother.Whatever Kazan's politics, he was a talented director, basically unobtrusive but with a few showy moments. The location shooting creates an excellent atmosphere--you can almost feel the cold, damp air. Kazan is obviously interested in symbolism (the pigeons, Joey Doyle's jacket, the religious overtones, etc.) but sometimes this becomes heavy-handed rather than clever.Indeed, the final scene of \"On the Waterfront\" falls into some melodramatic clich\u00e9s, with Terry becoming an inspirational rebel-martyr, Pop Doyle pushing Johnny Friendly into the water, and Friendly shaking his fist and cursing the longshoremen. But Brando's performance again carries the day. When Terry confronts Friendly--\"You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinkin' mug! And I'm glad what I done to you, ya hear that?\"--he finally raises his voice. He is finally confident. He is finally happy. And I challenge anyone not to feel that same elation.",

Director/screenwriter Elia Kazan was one of many (including Waterfront actors Karl Malden and Lee J Cobb) who ratted their left-wing movie buddies out to the pathetic drunk Senator Joe McCarthy and the idiotically named House Un-American Activities Committee, ruining many lives and careers, but he was unique in making a film about what a hero he was for doing it. Let's remember that Kazan's victims in real life weren't gangsters, like Johnny Friendly and company, but idealistic, law-abiding citizens who were exercising their thoroughly American freedoms of speech, belief and association - people who, right or wrong, wanted the world to be better than it is.Politics and morals aside, simply as a motion-picture entertainment On the Waterfront is wildly overrated, and I thought so even when I was a kid who knew nothing about the facts behind the story. Marlon Brando overbalances the film (as he does every film he's ever been in) with his faux-heroic idealisation of Terry Malloy, one of the long line of sullen, self-pitying egotists in whose portrayal he specialises. You could kick most of Brando's characters for an awfully long time before you got tired. With a star a little less in love with himself, and capable of a more nuanced performance, Waterfront would be a watchable enough 1950s lowlife drama, the run of what was a pretty enjoyable mill.

It's not just hype, this is masterful cinematic story telling at it's best with a flawless cast, led by Marlon Brando in arguably his career defining performance. My favorite movies tend to be about classic underdogs rising up against insurmountable odds, ultimately rising victorious, and in some cases as you have here, bloody but unbowed. This one will always be in my personal top ten.A lot of it has to do with the dialog, sharp and witty, directly to the point. As in this early exchange between a couple of supporting players: (J.P., Johnny Friendly's loan shark) - \"When I'm dead and gone you'll know what a friend I was\". (Dugan responding) - \"Why don't you drop dead now so we can test your theory\".Once you've seen the picture once or twice, it's worth it just to go back and study Brando in his characterization of the young dock worker Terry Molloy. Virtually every one of his scenes is deftly nuanced, it all comes across so natural and convincing. The best of course is the gut wrenching car scene with his brother Charley 'the Gent' (Rod Steiger). For Terry, it's agonizing to know that he coulda been a contender, and you know Charley knows it too. Certainly the Academy knew it, proffering on Brando it's Best Actor award for his portrayal. In fact, Oscar found favor with the film in a total of eight categories, including Best Picture. One of the great things about these classic films is the perspective they give of simpler times in a bygone era. When Terry and Edie (Eva Marie Saint) discuss her schooling and where she lives, she describes Tarrytown as being in the country, a place Terry doesn't like because the crickets make him nervous. The last time I was in Tarrytown I would hardly be able to describe it as 'country', and it certainly didn't take a half century to get that way.\"On The Waterfront\" is one of those films that just get better with repeat viewings, and in my case, I try to do so annually. It's a treat just to kick back and enjoy each actor's performance and their contribution to the total package. Like the trailer says, it's a motion picture you must see.",

Oh, yeah, sure he pulls it off without a hitch, but it's like Hanks in Forrest Gump.  Nothing special.  Karl Malden is his usual blank self.  Eva Marie Saint is on Malden's level too.  So, with our hero caught in a Braveheart level of good/evil, you can anticipate everything that happens.The camera is noir in thought, romantic in action.

Confidential', I'd say noir has evolved from B&W.  Now I have to decide whether it should stay in B&W.  Overall, really pointless.  Brando has done better work on better movies.  2 out of 5.",

            "content": "NOTE TO READERS: Ignore the spoiler warning above, it is merely there to keep me right. This review may only contain very mild spoilers,NOTHING that gives away the film's ending, so read freely.The industrial waterfront is held in an iron grip by cruel crime boss Johnny Friendly(LEE J. COBB)and the local mob. The longshoremen are paid a pittance for their vigorous labour, that's even if they are given work. Friendly manipulates the men through fear to stop them reporting mob activities to the authorities.Ex prizefighter Terry Molloy(MARLON BRANDO)is a longshoreman. He has spent most of his life \"crawling\" and doing \"favours\" for Friendly. One such \"favour\" results in the death of a fellow longshoreman who \"squealed\". Pierced by guilt as he didn't reckon with murder, Terry befriends the man's sister, Edie Doyle(EVA MARIE SAINT).Edie is blind to Terry's part in her brother's death and falls for him. Clergyman Father Barry(KARL MALDEN) urges Terry to come clean as he too is disgusted by Friendly's methods as well as Terry's refusal to confess.However,Terry is sickened by a more personal act of mob brutality, which compels him to finally make a stand against Friendly's empire.Masterfully directed by Elia Kazan, ON THE WATERFRONT is an allegory on McCarthyism.Kazan,who formally had Communist ties, came before the House of Un-American Activities in 1952 and gave the names of 8 suspected Communists within Hollywood. This is mirrored stupendously in the film when Terry, who works for Johnny Friendly, gives incriminating evidence against the latter at a tribunal.ON THE WATERFRONT more than deserved it's 8 Oscars. The granite edged script is skilfully written and penned with serious effort. The political undertones are cleverly welded in, along with fascinating characters. The overall tone of the film I find extremely inspiring. Terry Molloy is a confused brute who finds love in the tender caress of a woman. This changes his perception of the world for good, subsequently driving him on in his fight against injustice. Although he's not one of my favourite actors, Marlon Brando was definitely Oscar worthy material. His tough,streetwise,smooth talking performance is a powerful tour de force. Lee J. Cobb is on fire as Johnny Friendly, the brutal, steel jawed, fearsome mob leader. I consider Cobb to be one of the greatest actors in classic cinema. He blisters with charisma and should have clenched the Oscar for which he was nominated. Both Brando and Cobb are at their most electrifying in the final confrontation between Terry and Friendly. Karl Malden,magnificent as Father Barry, is given some of the greatest lines in the whole film. This evident in a speech he gives. He uses poignant biblical allusions when chastising the longshoremen for their \"silence\". This scene is one of the potent and awe inspiring I've ever seen in a film. Rod Steiger was brilliant as Charley the gent,Terry's brother and Eva Maria Saint was equally impressive as Edie. Kazan cranks the tension all the way up to the top for the second half of the film. The scene which has a furious and embittered Terry brandishing a gun and having a heated argument with Father Barry was both chilling and utterly gripping. I could feel Terry's raw desperation and hatred in this scene as well as in the sequence where he confesses to Edie about his part in her brother's murder. This scene is incredibly shot. A ship's horn blasts in the background as Terry explains to Edie. The dialogue cannot be heard, we only seen the horror on Edie's face and the guilt on Terry's. With scorching intensity, the already mentioned final confrontation between Terry and Friendly was absolutely finger biting and again, grippingly taut. The dialogue exchanged between the hardened Terry and rough voiced Friendly was spectacular. The whole sequence blazes with suspense, there's no doubting that this is the most awe striking scene in the film. The subsequent conclusion is what I consider to be one of the best endings in the history of cinema. I would describe it as both moving and strikingly compelling. The orchestral score tightened the tension into a sharp knot. It built up suspense in the film's second half magnificently.Elia Kazan's masterpiece could only be described as a searing comment on society with tremendous bite. Marlon Brando gives an outstanding performance which may only be rivalled by his portrayals of Colonel Kurtz and Don Vito Corleone. Lee J. Cobb embodies the spirit of Johnny Friendly sensationally. He should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor, Karl Malden was definitely hot on Cobb's heels, but sadly neither of them won the award. The film is packed with stellar performances from all concerned. The robust script, rich dialogue and staunch characters and portrayals make the film an Oscar worthy effort. ON THE WATERFRONT is a raw, hard hitting, spine chilling account of the dangers of being a \"contender\".10/10.",

It's a movie that shows that all you really need to create a movie is a good script and some wonderful actors.But of course you don't do this movie justice by saying that only its story and acting is good. The movie is one that is great at basically every level and it's why the movie still hasn't lost any of its strength.It's story is actually quite simple but gets driven by its great characters. I love how the characters get build up and put down in this movie, not just by its actors but also its great script and brilliant directing. It are the characters that keep the movie and its events going at all time and is what makes it such a throughout intriguing and powerful one. The movie feels realistic, which makes all of the emotion of the characters and events work out so effectively. It's a story with some great elements in it and is foremost about standing up for your rights and make and live your own life.I honestly don't know how good this movie would had been without Elia Kazan's directing. It's so spot on. He has an incredible eye for the development of the story and characters, which makes the movie progress perfectly. He at the same time also had an eye for its environments, which work out very moody for the movie. The movie has a constantly mist like feeling and look over it, which just suits the story and its characters perfectly.Most of the actors give the performance of their life in this movie. I can say that this is Marlon Brando's best performance out of his career. It was also the movie that won him his first Oscar, which he still picked up himself and did not send in a fake Indian to collect it. Another person that won an acting Oscar for this movie was Eva Marie Saint, who actually made her film debut in this movie. And what a great career Karl Malden actually had, looking at the role he has played throughout the years. This one is up their with his very best ones. And how great was Lee J. Cobb in this? A perfect classic villain, with still an overall sense of realism to him. Basically every actor did a wonderful job in this no matter how small and short their roles were.A pure and perfect movie.

            "content": "'On The Waterfront' is a rather simple story about union/mob corruption on the NJ side of the New York harbor area. What makes it special is the acting of Marlon Brando, as exemplified in the 'I coulda been a contender' scene in the taxi with Rod Steiger who plays his brother. The DVD which I got from my local public library has a nice B&W transfer, mono sound, and some interesting extras, the best being the interview with director Elia Kazan. Good movie for its history in the development of cinema.SPOILERS follow, for my recollection, quit reading now, OK!?Terry (Brando) is a dumb ex-fighter whose brother is the union boss's (Lee J Cobb) right hand man. So Terry gets easy jobs, all he and others have to do is play dumb, help cover the corruption. Terry witnesses Joey being pushed off a roof for having talked, Terry later meets Joey's sister (Eva Saint) who ends up trying to get him to be honest, when he tells her 'Quit worrying about the truth all the time, worry about yourself', and that sums up the movie for me. They become romantic, but only after Terry's brother is killed does he get angry enough to testify. About the girl he says, 'She's the first nice thing that ever happened to me.' The end is a bit melodramatic, after Terry gets beat up at the union office, the other men refuse to work unless Terry is first to go in, the bad union boss gets his comeuppance, he knows he is on the hot seat.",

Interested in the story, the noted book became the basis for the movie, later Directed by Elia Kazan. It relates the story of a young ex-boxer named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) who is in the employ of corrupt Union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). In that position he is advised and counseled by his older brother Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger) who also works for the crime-riddled organization. Not satisfied with extortion and racketeering, Friendly goes further by intimating his longshoremen into compliance which eventually includes assault and murder. The situation becomes intolerable until a courageous parish priest named Father Barry (Karl Malden) convinces Terry and a motley group of hardworking laborers to fight for their rights. This eventually puts the two forces into a collision which in the annals of Cinema has become a Black and white Classic. Indeed, it's also a foundation for some of the most memorable lines in film. Furthermore in the ensemble of the great cast members are those who have become easily recognized actors of later screen movies. Many of your own favorites are in among them. Easily recommended to any and all movie aficionados. ****",

Influenced by his love, Edie, a priest named Father Barry, and his brother Charley's death, Terry finally turns in Johnny Friendly, the dockers' union boss who killed Joey Doyle.  Terry feels guilty because he knew about Joey's death, and never told anyone.  He feels bad because Edie was obviously close to her brother, and Terry was partially responsible for his death.  And when Johnny Friendly murders Charley because he doesn't kill Terry, it's just the last straw for Terry.  The final scene is magnificent, when Terry keeps fighting Johnny and his comrades until he wins.  Eva Marie Saint gives a great, Oscar-winning performance as Edie Doyle, and the three supporting actors are also wonderful Oscar nominees.  There are Karl Malden as Father Barry, Rod Steiger as Charley Malloy, and Lee J. Cobb as Johnny Friendly.Everyone has seen the \"coulda been a contender\" part at least 10 times, but you never truly appreciate it until you see the whole movie.

            "content": "Occasionally I discover (or, in this case, rediscover) a movie that strikes me with its perfect shot compositions within its first few minutes. The Big Country was like this, but On the Waterfront struck me the same way. The scene in the back of the bar near the beginning of the film that introduces Johnny Friendly and Terry Malloy is so remarkably framed with Elia Kazan using extras to provide visual context around characters, implying power dynamics and relationships. I remembered little of this film from the last time I saw it as a teenager, but I certainly had no inkling of the effortlessly classical compositions awaiting for me.When people talk about Kazan's 1954 feature, they rarely start with its visual aspects. It's either the connection to HUAC or Brando's central performance that take first priority. Well, why be like everyone else? This movie looks amazing. Aside from its perfect shot composition, the film, shot on locations at and around a real pier, echoes the nascent Italian neo-realist movement while maintaining its own distinct, more classical style. Kazan said something along the lines of it should look like real life, but the creative team should never lose sight of the fact that they were making a movie. It provides the film with a grimy, lived-in feel while, at the same time, imprinting the film with an distinct artistic imprint that uses the reality of the world without being used by it.The story, as we should get to, is about a young hood, Terry, who had an unsuspecting hand in the murder of a longshoreman who was ready to talk to the police about illegal activities of the union. Terry is automatically hit by guilt. He had liked the guy and had no idea that he was going to get pushed off the roof to his death. When he meets the man's sister, Edie, his attraction to her mixes with his guilt and he reaches out in his own awkward way. Neither have any real experience in love, so their budding romance is halting, hitting snags and twists and turns along the way. Eventually, Terry has to reveal his complicit role in the brother's death in a scene that is striking for the way it delivers the information. We already know the details of Terry's involvement, so hearing the confession itself isn't really necessary for the audience. So, as we watch Terry plead with Edie for forgiveness, a nearby boat blows its whistle, drowning out all other sound and we only watch the two faces. It's such a great way to cut through unnecessary detail and attack the emotion of the scene head on.Terry's guilt isn't limited to his budding romance with the good-looking blonde. He's been groomed by the union because of his relationship to the boss's number two, Terry's brother, but he cannot let go of the idea that the actions of the union don't trump his own feelings of right and wrong. So, he fights with himself about what to do. The union sees this as a sign that he will turn on them and they grow wary, and they end up being right. Terry turn's state witness and tells everything he knows. Johnny Friendly is, of course, pissed and takes out his rage on Terry, sending Terry's brother Charlie to bring Terry in for a hit. But Charlie can't turn in his own brother and lets him go, leading to Charlie's murder.In the face of all this, Terry still heads down to the docks, ready to face Johnny Friendly directly. He's angry and he's going to give Friendly what he deserves. In the famous scene in the cab, Terry talks about how he threw the fight that could have led to him getting a title bout. With that in the back of the audience's mind, Terry gets into a fistfight with Johnny, and Johnny wins. It's never said, but I believe Terry was smart enough to know that if he were to beat Johnny in a physical fight, he was going to lose the overall fight about Johnny Friendly's power, so he threw the second match of his life. He's beaten bloody, but Johnny Friendly loses the little authority he had left over the union.It's a triumphant story of one man facing a system and winning. Filled with great performances, a rousing score from Leonard Bernstein, and dripping with visual beauty from beginning to end, On the Waterfront is a fantastic picture.",

To recap briefly; the film's director, Elia Kazan, was what was known as a 'friendly' witness at the HUAC Hearings or, to put it in plain English, he 'named names' on the stand, testifying on oath that several colleagues and friends had been or possibly still were, members of the Communist party. In a different climate that would not have been viewed as a heinous offense but in the hysteria of the Cold War Communists were portrayed as three-headed monsters. By naming them Kazan more or less condemned them to a 'Blacklist' and rendered them unemployable. In On The Waterfront the character Terry Malloy is a symbol for Kazan himself but in this case when he (Malloy) 'names names' to a similar committee as HUAC he is portrayed as a hero rather than a traitor, ie. Kazan is attempting to justify betrayal. Now, if we can somehow get round this and watch the film as just that, we have a very fine film with some excellent performances especially from the four leads, Brando, Malden, Steiger and newcomer Eva Marie Saint.

It really was interesting going into this movie completely blind and then being amazed at how great it was. I just love the characters in this movie. I didn't even know what the title meant. There's a nice little title drop and it's revealed the film is simply about working on the docks, literally near the front of the water. I live in Florida, you'd think I've heard of that before.The best character is probably the preacher. I just love the use of religious role models in films, particularly with how this guy talks about how we should be loyal Christians. Even as he's getting hit by random objects, he continues to discuss the importance of his beliefs. I also feel like this movie was just the right length. It's actually pretty short for a Best Picture Winner, but there's nothing wrong with that.

Being to acting what \"Citizen Kane\" was for directing, in \"On the Waterfront\", Brando displays an infinite range of contradictory emotions as Terry Malloy, the former prizefighter, official longshoreman and officious muscle-man of Johnny Friendly, the mob-connected union boss played by Lee J. Cobb. The film opens with one of these contradictions through his involvement in the murder of Edie's brother, who was about to finger Friendly to the Crime Commission, immediately followed by guilt.Basically, Malloy didn't know they were going to kill Joey but is still unable to share his feelings, torn between his brother's status as Friendly's right-hand man -Charley the Gent, played by Rod Steiger- and his growing romance with Edie, the first to see the sweet and delicate gentleness behind the tough-guy facade. But doesn't Brando's performance make it obvious? There is something in Rocky Balboa obviously borrowed from Malloy, working for a loan shark to make a living, but being constantly called a bum. Some souls believe in Malloy though: he's coerced by Edie, and Father Barry (Karl Malden) the 'Christian voice' to testify against Friendly, instead of playing \"D and D\" (Deaf and Dumb) but Malloy can't make up his mind. \"Being a rat or a bum\" is his cornelian dilemma, and the legendary taxi scene is a microcosm of his existential crisis.",

            "content": "On the Waterfront is kind of like Crash. Both movies are contrived, meaning that the situations are not organic, but they're forced for the soul sake of moving the movie to it's conclusion. Elia Kazan was a very good director, and there will always be a controversial opinion on how he named names with the HUAC in 1952 until the end of time. The Real source to blame in that situation was the HUAC, as if we were all in the Salem Witch Trials or something, those buffoons.However, Kazan did what he did, it hurt his career, but I still don't look at his career with that involved, I look at his career on his filmmaking only, and whether I think he had no backbone doesn't matter to me when I'm critiquing one of his films. I just really didn't care for On the Waterfront that much. It's not that good.I'm not a huge fan of Casablanca either but I can see where it makes the AFI 100 best films list, it's a pioneer movie that paved the way for many movies that were made then and now. But On the Waterfront isn't a pioneer of any kind, nothing new had been utilized.High Noon,in a way, has a similar story as On the Waterfront accept for the 'being a stool pigeon' or a 'D&D'(No not Dungeons and Dragons)factor in On the Waterfront. I would recommend watching High Noon instead, it's a better story, it flows more naturally and is more believable about the circumstances that are going on, and also I believe universally anyone can identify with High Noon.Kazan liked to relate to the films he did, if he didn't relate to them he usually didn't do them. One can see why Brando's character Malloy rats them out (I mean, they killed his brother and they were just the clich\u00e9 bad guys). But if Kazan was trying to make what he did in 1952 with the HUAC seem justified in anyway, then he failed, not quite the same, not at all.Then the kids kill all of Malloy's pigeons, they killed all of them for him being a rat! 'Yeah I guess ratting out a guy who is a psychopathic, controlling murderer who killed my brother isn't really a cool thing to do' :/ Some of the common sense goes out the window in this movie and there seems, again, a lot of forced situations, a lot of holes and gaps.If you're going to watch On the Waterfront, then the good things about the movie are as follows: Kazan's eye is very good, Brando is terrific and now I see why, when Rocky came out in 1976, critics were saying Sylvester Stallone was the next Brando because Brando plays a slightly different version of Rocky in this movie.Brando was amazing, and in my opinion, one of the top five best actors in our lifetime. The rest of the acting is exceptional and that's why I'm giving this movie the rating I'm giving it, based predominately off the acting and directing. Oh, can't forget to mention Rod Steiger either, he's always fun to watch, terrific actor as well.",

            "content": "Not so much of a great film as a great young actor. Marlon Brando is quite convincing in this early role. But the plot of the film is both true to the core and false to the bone. We are in New York, on the harbor, on the side of the dockworkers and the very strange atmosphere that existed in not so long ago a time and that may still exist in some harbors in Europe and the USA. To get a job, a daily job quite too often, short time anyway, you had to come in the morning to be selected in order to answer the numbers required by the bosses, in that case the authority of the harbor. These names were selected and called by the union itself. Such a power and the very comfortable income you can get out of it is of course captivated by some union leaders who look more like gang leaders than union leaders. And they accepted no dissent in the rank and file. Killing was even a game that brought some entertainment to those bored Mafiosi. Till one murder too many was done and performed on someone who had the heart of the dockworkers and a daughter who wanted him to be eulogized. That was enough to trigger an explosive situation, in which the local catholic priest is playing the \"good devil\" for these gangsters and the \"guardian angel\" for the dockworkers. Apart from that the film is rather trite. The end though is a marvelous piece of work. The defeated union leaders are rejected by a unanimous vote of all dockworkers in support of Terry Malloy who was the stake of the fight and thus vote with their feet against the already forgotten union leaders. But one detail may not be as visible as it should be. The dockworkers are able to walk to the ships when, and only when, the representative of the harbor authorities let them go through. In other words the gangsterized union leaders are only defeated because the harbor authorities say so. It is not class struggle but it is gang war and company within the union with the support that can change from one moment to the next from the bosses in the harbor. Do not think these practices are finished. Far from it. They are an everyday reality in some professions where the unions, or rather some groups of unionized people, have taken the control of the workforce. It is true in harbors, but also in airports and in train-transport companies, at least in Europe. And even if that is waning away little by little.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

The issue of whether or not to testify before HUAC was difficult and complex:  You were damned if you did and damned if you didn't.  Paranoia over Communist infiltration not only of the film industry but also of American life was very real at the time (and not without some justification) and hovered over American life during the fifties like a dark cloud.  There are no shades of gray in the simplistic \"On the Waterfront.\"  The audience never for a minute feels that Terry Malloy did anything wrong by informing against Johnny Friendly and his mob. They were murdering thugs and deserved to be brought down.  When the dockworkers turn against Malloy for doing so (even Edie's father!) it comes as a distinct shock.  The audience-pleasing happy ending drives home Kazan's all-too-easy rationalizations.  This is a powerfully directed and acted melodrama, no doubt, but it's really not a great movie.  What keeps it alive today are the intimate moments between Brando and the other characters in the film, particularly Rod Steiger and Eva Marie Saint, both of whom have never been better.",

It's not impossible to find flaws, whether it's a slightly withheld violence (the man under the falling whiskey is slightly awkward) or it's preachiness (the priest, naturally, sermonizes). But these are nitpicking comments that you can make only when looking for flaws. In a normal sense, this is a beautiful, moving, vigorous, tightly conceived, and yes, flawless movie. It works on every movie-making level--acting, photography (thank you Boris Kaufman), music (thank you Leonard Bernstein, yes!), editing, directing (Kazan, of course), and story (based on a Pulitzer winning series of articles about real longshoremen). And the star power is enormous, despite the bad vibes Kazan was getting from Hollywood insiders for cooperating with the anti-Communist crazies. People have associated the basic plot of this film with Kazan's own personal troubles (with telling and not telling on your friends).Whatever his politics, Kazan has pulled together a masterpiece of 1950s cinema. It's American to the core, but it has a sensitivity that feels aware of new European trends, such as the Italian neo-realists, who were concerned with real people and real social situations. Malden, Saint, Steiger, Cobb, and of course Brando are all hugely effective (and some might say several of these actors, such as Lee J. Cobb and Eva Marie Saint, never did better). So no more here.

It is a vastly overrated film, given way to much credit for its, \"original\" for its time (as far as Hollywood product was concerned)naturalism or \"realism.\" The performaces of the actors are worth watching, but this isn't Brando's best performance. If you want to see that, find and watch the movie \"Burn.\" The whole movie plays like an overblown TV special, with a big \"message,\" which is hammered home with no subtletly at all. One thing you can say about Kazan is that he really did improve with time. \"East of Eden\" is vastly superior to \"On the Waterfront,\" and Dean's performance much more subtle than Brando's. I guess Kazan had to play ball for a while and hit it big first, before he could call the shots. And of course, winning the Oscar for best picture, rarely means anything, just look at \"American Beauty\" (haha, what a laugh!) \"A Face in the Crowd,\" \"Splendor in the Grass,\" and of course \"America, America:\" these are his real masterpieces, flawlessly subtle and detailed and vast in scope, rewarding of close attention. And by the way, Kazan should've phinked on those Commies and did the right thing.

This is complicated further when he falls for Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint) whom was the sister of the man that Terry had a hand in determining his fate...I have to admit that I did struggle with this film to an extent in the early stages; there's quite a lot of toing and froing with the narrative as the wider corruption begins to unravel (which sometimes made it hard to follow). However, once the film settles down it does become an excellent character study about one man wrestling with his conscience ultimately for the greater good.The film is anchored by a wonderful performance by Marlon Brando (many people will remember him for his cotton-ball filled mouth mumbling performance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather, but he was far better here and this is where he could showcase what a talent he was). You could argue that Malloy is not the most multi-layered of characters, but it would take a really hardened judge of character not to be behind him in this film.The supporting cast were great as well with veterans such as Malden, Cobb & Steiger all being excellent in support; even though Cobb here (in terms of his appearance reminded me of Robert Mitchum).On The Waterfront ends on a high note and that brilliant final scene will still resonate in my mind for some time to come.

            "content": "Over a half a century after it's release On the Waterfront's legendary status has lost a little lustre as a gritty, realistic look at union corruption and instead taken on an operatic patina filled with grand performances, overt symbolism, and a magnificent music score.Method acting was in it's film infancy and in Waterfront we are witness to what most consider the finest film performance in history with Marlon Brando's Terry Malloy. Unlike any actor before him Brando dug deeper into his character's motivation to give us a conflicted and identifiable everyman (\"I coulda' been a contender\") void of glamor and intelligence that took acting to a new level. One might argue that \"Streetcar\" does this but Brando's Kowalski is nearly all brute whereas in Waterfront he displays a greater level of sensitivity refining the gruff moody exterior of Malloy so as to include a thuggish eloquence that expands and elaborates on the nature of modern man's confusion with his role in society.Bolstering Brando's remarkable performance Rod Steiger, Lee J Cobb, Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint contribute powerful performances that hold their own in scene after scene with him. We have been reminded ad nauseum about the utter greatness (justifiably I would add ) of the taxi scene with Brando and Steiger but the the equally fine moments with Saint at the playground and in the bar resonate with just as much power.It seems to have become politically correct over the years to denigrate Waterfront's director Elia Kazan for ratting out fellow travelers. Many dismiss Waterfront as his attempt to justify his actions seeing it more as political propaganda than art. One can argue Kazan promoting himself as a Christ figure but the most honest way to approach Waterfront would be cold and objective, eschewing outside interference and innuendo and focusing on the story and presentation itself. In addition to his flawless acting troupe Kazan creates a superb ambiance with on location sets, local dock wallopers and an imposing group of washed up pugs (ex-heavyweights Tami Maurielo, Abe Simon, Two Ton Tony Galento)who provide muscle for union boss Johnny Friendly. Cinematographer Boris Kaufman adds to this with subdued low contrast photography that has a washed out bleakness apropos to the film's mood. Finally there is the Leonard Bernstein score which brings the film to it's high dramatic operatic level. It is an integral part of nearly every scene impacting both the suspenseful and sensitive interplay of action and performer. It is an appropriate Greek Chorus for one of the masterpieces of the art form in which the passage of time has forced a reformulation and reassessment of the elements that make it a classic and upon doing so does not find it wanting or diminished.",

Yes, he's ably supported by the rest of the cast, but you genuinely believe he is a washed up boxer, who is fighting with his conscience after the murder of someone he is supposed to have helped. He really owns the Terry Malloy character, exuding just the right amount of self respect and pathos. The scene in the car, with Rod Steiger, has got to be one of the best examples of this in cinema.The fact that 'On The Waterfront' is in black and white adds to the harshness of the situation that the dockers, and particularly Terry Malloy, find themselves in. You either keep quiet and mind your p's and q's, or you go down for the dirt nap.And at no point do you feel that you can guess the ending, keeping you on your toes right until the final scene, and I mean right until the final scene.The directing, dialogue and soundtrack all add to the flavouring but this is a Brando masterpiece, make no mistake.",

Every gesture, manner and intonation in his voice bespeak a purpose, a sign of a truly great actor.\nExceptional supporting cast include Karl Malden (Father Barry) and Lee J. Cobb (Johnny Friendly). Malden, a sympathetic and sermonizing local priest, acts as a moral compass to the conscience-stricken and guilt-racked Terry Malloy, goading him at every turn to do what is right.  Lee J. Cobb is brilliant as the corrupt, union boss, whose grip on power becomes more precarious as the law closes in on him, occasioning him to act more desperately. The film is nicely shot in black and white in a locale that is gritty and bleak, just the right tone and mood for the film.

It was mainly Jewish film industry people who suffered in those trials. It is based on a true story about Union Corruption on the waterfront and a rebellion by the longshoreman against it. Interestingly enough this waterfront scenario was the birth place of the Mafia who controlled it during the second world war. The USA Navy Intelligence sought co-operation from the waterfront mafia on Nazi espionage and infiltration in exchange for immunity from their criminal activities. The head of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover continued top protect the waterfront based Mafia as part of the fifties anti-communist hysteria of the fifties until it make a dominant force in American life throughout the latter part of the 20th century with even the murder of JFK on its books. Marlon Brando plays a rugged handsome longshoreman and ex-prize fighter who rebels against the Union Terry Malloy who rebels against his corrupt Union only after his wife's (Eva Marie Saint) brother is murder by that Union. The film and its style would hardly suit a major part of the film market today and is definitely for movie buffs and film students. Most of the merit of the film revolves around Brando's sex appeal and style rather than anything too profound about the human condition or great acting. In fact Brando has always been a little difficult to understand because of his mumbling working class American accent. Having said that its a classic work by a classic director with classic actors. Reviewing established classics is a bit silly but sometimes worthwhile if you are providing an alternative view or trying to imbue the spirit of the film in a new audience.

Budd Shulberg's terrific screenplay, in part loosely based on earlier efforts by former collaborators Elia Kazan and Arthur Miller, is a very human tale of Terry Malloy's moral journey towards discovering his conscience and his responsibility to speak the truth regardless of the odds against him. Although both Kazan and Schulberg used this as a way to justify their own naming of other so-called suspected artists with supposed communist ties, the over-arching theme is far bigger than the personal axes of these men.Kazan is at his directorial best. Casting and guiding many up and coming, as well as veteran NY actors from new faces like Eva Marie Saint to the great Lee J. Cobb. Keep an eye out for future major stars and character actors in small roles like Martin Balsam as a crime commission investigator, Pat Hingle as a bartender, Fred Gwynne as Slim the henchman and the great Nehimiah Persoff in a silent bit as a cabby. Kazan also coaxes great bits out of former prize fighters \"Two-ton\" Tony Galento and Tami Mauriello as well as many real-life dock workers.Kazan paints a gritty portrait and both actors and non-actors alike meld neatly together. Shot in almost a documentary style, actors are shot without make-up and in the extra cold weather are allowed to appear more as real people striving mightily for what they want.Karl Malden is outstanding as Father Barry. His handling of the difficult \"Christ in the Shape-up\" speech is a testament to his understated but considerable talent. Lee Cobb almost steals the movie as Johnny Friendly. Eva Marie Saint makes a striking debut as Edie with a beautifully multi-layered performance. Other great turns by Rod Steiger, Rudy Bond, Leif Erickson as well as John Hamilton as \"Pop\" Doyle and Pat Denning as \"KO\" Dugan round out a strong and exciting cast. But above them all stands Marlon Brando in perhaps his best screen portrayal. Brando is particularly moving in his scenes with Eva Marie Saint; especially the scene in the park and later in the bar. Brando as Terry creates such a humane, tragic, magnetic, guilt-ridden, funny and deep performance. Out of all of his great roles, this is my favorite.The often unsung contributor to the soul of Waterfront is the beautifully lyric, haunting and exciting score by Leonard Bernstein. This was written just prior to the Maestro's writing of \"West Side Story\".A great film on many levels and one I never tire of seeing",

            "content": "On the Waterfront is absolutely one of the best films ever made. It is made with incredible sharpness and technique that no other film has topped since it was made. Marlon Brando gives a pitch-perfect performance, Eva Marie Saint is wonderful, Karl Malden is brilliant as the Priest, Lee J. Cobbs is absolutely frightening as the Mob Boss, and Rod Steiger is amazing as Brando's brother. Brando plays a character torn by morality and whether or not to rat out his brother as well as his boss in a murder of Joey Davis. Obviously, his brother and the Mob attempt to convince him to not rat them out but since he becomes romantically entangled with Joey's sister, he is torn now between what is right and wrong. Brando plays his character with such depth and intellectuality that no other actor could play him better. That is what makes On the Waterfront quite simply a divine film on all levels and truly deserved all 8 of the Oscars that it received for its production. Elia Kazan has etched his name among such great directors as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick with this film that is the second best Mob film ever made, second only to The Godfather. Again, Perfect acting, directing, writing, etc. makes this film a true classic.\nLenny's Grade: A+",

            "review_title": "So Different for that Era",
            "content": "\"On the Waterfront\" was a huge divergence from the movies I've been watching from that era. It could've easily been a movie from an era much later. Everything I've been watching from the 40's and 50's has seemed theatrical and staged while OTW has a real look and feel to it. Set on the docks and streets of New York City, it just seemed more down to earth, regular, and less ostentatious.It begins with the main character, Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), setting up an associate of his to get thrown off of a tenement building roof. Terry didn't know the mobsters were going to throw Joey off the roof, he thought that they were going to \"wise him up\" or rough him up at worst.Joey was a dock worker like many other guys. Unlike the other guys who practiced \"D and D\"-- which stands for \"deaf and dumb\" not Dungeons and Dragons--Joey spoke up about the mob's involvement in the longshormen union which was run by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Johnny Friendly and his boys made up the executive board of the union and, along with regular union dues, they demanded an extra payment from anyone who wanted to work. If you didn't kick in that extra few bucks that day, you didn't work. This very thing was explored a little in the movie \"The Mob,\" but OTW expounded upon it and made it more visceral.Joey's murder made Terry have a crisis of conscience. He had a bit of fealty to Johnny Friendly and the mob, but tearing at his soul was Joey's bereaved sister, Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), and a priest, Father Barry (Karl Malden), who made the docks his pulpit.At the heart of why this movie was so excellent was Marlon Brando. His style of acting was different from Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, and other actors of that day. It was less theatrical and more real. When he emoted and spoke it wasn't as though it was scripted, he WAS the down and out ex-boxer trying to figure things out. He did an amazing job and it was great to see him prominently in something before \"The Godfather.\"HBO Max.",

            "content": "\u00a8You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley. \u00a8 If you aren't moved by this quote then perhaps it's because you haven't seen 1954's On the Waterfront. I know the phrase isn't all that memorable if you read it on its own, but if you have seen this scene before then you probably get goose bumps just from reading it. Marlon Brando delivers this line to perfection in one of his best performances in a 5 minute scene with Rod Steiger in the back of a cab. It is considered by many as one of the best American scenes in film and in my opinion it is one of my favorites. I didn't care that the taxi had Venetian blinds in the back window or that the set wasn't great, all I really cared about were the two characters and the way they delivered each line. It is not only one of the most touching and memorable scenes of the movie, it stands on its own. If the film sucked for 100 minutes but still had this great cab scene in it I'd give this movie 10 stars anyways because it's just worth it. However the other 95 minutes don't suck, they are great as well so On the Waterfront ranks among the best films in history. Elia Kazan did a terrific job with the direction getting the best out of every actor on the set, the black and white cinematography by Boris Kaufman gave the film the realistic mood it needed, the screenplay written by Budd Schulberg and adapted from Johnson's news articles about the mobs that ruled the docks was inspiring, and the original music by Leonard Bernstein made this a perfect film. The film has aged very well even now 55 years later, and one can still appreciate the eight Oscars it won. The film truly captures the essence of the fifties and the social injustice that was going on in the waterfront.Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a former boxer who had a lot of potential but wasn't able to ever get a chance to fight for the title. He has been working at the docks ever since following orders from his corrupt boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) and his partner Charley (Rod Steiger) who is Terry's older brother as well. Terry is uneducated and Johnny is like family for him, so he always is willing to do favors for him and his brother. One day they ask him to turn in one of his friends so they can convince him not to speak out against them in court. Malloy follows orders although little did he expect that they were going to murder his friend. He has mixed feeling about what happened but he lives under the \u00a8D and D\u00a8 code, which means being deaf and dumb so he is not willing to tell anyone what has happened. The victim's sister, Edie (Eva Marie Saint), is an innocent catholic educated girl that is trying to find out what has happened. She meets the priest, Father Barry (Karl Malden), and begs him to try to find out who killed her brother. It's not long before Terry falls for Edie and she sees past his apparent tough guy attitude. There is some sweetness and kindness in Malloy who enjoys spending time in the rooftops tending to his pigeons. Terry struggles between remaining faithful to his boss and brother and speaking out against the injustice going on in the waterfront. Meanwhile Father Barry tries to stir some courage out of the workers who are being exploited by the mob.On the Waterfront is considered a masterpiece because Kazan was able to capture the injustices that were going on in the docks during the era in a very realistic and powerful way. He was against remaining silent and thought people should always speak out against evil. The worst thing one could do was to remain silent like the workers in the waterfront did because that just allows more evil to take place. Some think Kazan used this movie as an explanation as to why he whistle blew against some of his partners during McCarthy's communist witch hunt. I think the film is much more than that however. The priest figure in the film serves as a symbol as to how sometimes the church remains silent against the abuse of the powerful over the poor. The Church should always take an interest towards the weak and defend them, and that is sort of what Father Barry does in some very memorable speeches. Terry's character is also a key element of the film as we all can identify with what he was going through. He had a conflict of interest, but had to do what he thought was the right thing. The way he let himself be cheated out of being a contender for the boxing title, in a way represents all those wrong decisions we regret from our past that could have changed our lives in the future so we can easily identify with his character. Marlon Brando is such a great actor and he truly gives one of the best performances I have seen in a film. This film is required viewing for everyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

I coulda been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am\" it is exciting to hear but the whole movie play after a while gets dull till the great ending where Terry had to battle it with Friendly.Shot in over 36 days, and based on a 24 part series of articles in the New York Sun by Malcolm Johnson detailing the rate of crime and corruption going on the waterfront of Manhattan and Brooklyn. The series was titled \"Crime on the Waterfront\" and it won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting.The movie plot has the protagonist Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) a former boxer who took a dive once in the ring so that a Mobster Johnny Friendly could clean house. Now Terry works for Friendly thanks to his brother Charley, Friendly's faithful companion.Friendly used Terry to coax a dockworker Joey, out of his apartment where Joey was killed, to signify Friendly's control over the docks.Now Joey's sister is in town trying to get justice to what was done to her brother, nobody wants to snitch on the mob, but Terry's relationship with Joey's sister was pushing him down the route of a snitch. Charley warns Terry to layoff Joey's sister but their love for each other keeps him going back.Some of the movie characters are actually based on real life people, like Terry Malloy's (Marlon Brando) character was based on Anthony DiVincenzo, who testified before a real-life Waterfront Commission and was ostracized for his act. The movie was made later on, on what seems to be DiVincenzo story and DiVincenzo sued Columbia Pictures for it with the two later settling.The movie has received critical acclaim since its release; it was a box office success and it received eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Marlon Brando and Best Director for Elia Kazan.Elia Kazan too has faced many judgments and this film is kinda similar to his life. House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952 summoned him to name people who were communist he named 8 people and because of that he lost many friends.Elia Kazan is a masterful director; he makes the best of his actors, bringing out the drama and emotions needed to push the message across to the viewer.On The Waterfront is a well written classic and it is a nice watch.www.lagsreviews.com",

His romance with Edie Doyle, played fearlessly by Eva Marie Saint, is sweet and tender as well as tough to watch as we see these two people who have been close their whole lives but on different spectrums come together and find each other. Lee J.

            "content": "I know I might get shot for this, but I didn't think \"On the Waterfront\" was one of the most spectacular movies ever made.  Naturally, I was a little disappointed watching it for the first time, but I still liked it.  At least Marlon Brando's performance as long shoreman/ex-prize fighter Terry Malloy wasn't exaggerated at all.  I thought he was terrific and his Oscar was well-deserved.  Karl Malden is equally terrific as his friend/mentor, the priest.  Even when he sticks a cigarette in his mouth, he proves to be a strong moral protagonist.  Lee J. Cobb, whose long line of great performances include \"Twelve Angry Men,\" is powerful as Johnny Friendly, who's anything but.  This was Eva Marie Saint's first feature film, and she was good, though not exactly Oscar-worthy.  The key scene, where Terry explains to Edie (Saint) that he knows who killed her brother, is exceptionally done with very creative use of sound.  We discussed that particular scene in film class.  Other than that, I wouldn't say there are any scenes that will stick in my mind.  Of course, I will always remember Brando's \"I coulda been a contender\" speech, because that's one of those quotes that constantly pops up.  I wish the character of Charlie (Terry's brother) could've been better developed.  I thought the music, though well-composed, was sometimes overdone and added to the melodrama.  The use of close-ups (like in many old movies) was nicely done, though, and so was the lighting.  Though the film tries to be compelling, it takes on a melodramatic tone. Some of the scenes, though sad and dark, came expected to me.  I can't say there were any big surprises.  Maybe I had to be around during that time period.  I'm not going to be totally close-minded.  I'm just giving my honest opinion of the impression I got on my first viewing of this vintage motion picture.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",

            "content": "A triumph of movies in its realistic depiction of a man alone bucking the system, \"On The Waterfront\" scores in another department for me. It's a prime example of a film overcoming what the late Roger Ebert liked to call \"the idiot plot.\"As Mr. E. put it, the idiot plot is where a movie depends on its characters acting like complete dolts in order for it to function. Here, an idiot summons a pal to a roof knowing his bully buddies who want to silence the pal wait there, not figuring that they might, you know, push him off said roof and silence him for keeps.A priest kicks off a tense meeting by asking who killed the guy, thinking somehow someone will just blurt it out and not figuring a public forum might intimidate them into further silence.A union boss figures the best way to keep idiot #1 quiet is to kill his brother and hang him on a hook for him to see the night before said idiot is scheduled to give testimony. Oh, and when the guy tells what he knows anyway, the boss blows his top and attacks him in front of the press.Still, \"On The Waterfront\" triumphs over such qualms and delivers a solid story, aided by powerhouse performances. Marlon Brando centers everything with an assured turn as Terry Malloy, a former boxer turned goon for Longshoremen's Local 374. Sure, Terry's an idiot, but he has a lot of heart: \"I figured the worst they were gonna do was lean on him a little bit. Wow. He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.\"Brando's scenes with Eva Marie Saint as Joey's sister, Edie, retain a kind of raw power, of two people finding each other in a cruel world and making something good amid the carnage. Their scenes together have an intimacy and subtlety that make them stand out more. One critical moment between them, easy to miss, is when during their first extended time together, after she lets him do most of the talking, she quietly reveals she has had her eye on him for a long time, back at school when he was a troublemaker and she was just a mousy kid in braces and braids.Director Elia Kazan was at the midpoint of his distinguished career, and gets a lot of mileage off of scriptwriter Budd Schulberg's tough-talking script. The scenes around the pier hut where the union boys run their scams are crisp and flavorful, dominated by Lee J. Cobb's nasty Johnny Friendly. \"Everything that moves in and out, we take our cut,\" he boasts.Here and elsewhere, there is an \"on-the-nose\" quality to the dialogue, and to the way the film is constructed. It's manipulative the way we see Terry shot in the mesh of his pigeon coop like he's in a web, or how a crossbeam gives an aspect of a crucifix whenever Edie appears. Yet it works. \"On The Waterfront\" is a kind of passion play for organized labor, arguing successfully that tolerating corruption makes for a sin of omission.The famous \"coulda been a contender\" scene with Brando and Rod Steiger as his brother Charlie remains parody-proof, and the socko ending with Terry's big confrontation at the dock remains one of the great moments of cinema. They are rare big scenes that fully earn their acclaim.I don't love \"On The Waterfront.\" I find it too pushed in places, and not very convincing. But it still holds up well as a testament to what movies can do, and how they can make you feel.",

What more could you want from the legendary talent of a director like Elia Kazan helming a dramatic epic with the likes of Marlon Brando and Karl Malden? On the Waterfront tells the story of Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) a washed up boxer who wants to separate himself from his mob involvement. He works for mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) who is also the corrupt head of the dockers union Terry works for. When Terry witnesses Johnny Friendly's men kill a man he finds himself getting involved with the murder through the sister of the deceased Edie Doyle, played by Eva Marie Saint in her first ever film appearance, as well as Father Barry (Karl Malden) who urges Terry to fight against the corruption he is a part of. It is a smart, moving, and powerful story that will leave you very satisfied and stricken with amazement. On the Waterfront is a true spectacle.On the Waterfront is simply just a showcase for how to make truly good films. It is so iconic to its time period and 60 years down the line it stands as a defining film of its era. It's one of those films that just makes you go, 'They don't make 'em like they used to.' And it's true. In the contemporary world of filmmaking today you wont see films with this kind of raw classic greatness to them. Movies today have a certain updated persona to them, which is fine. It makes a classic like On the Waterfront a more important place in the classic days of cinema. I love contemporary filmmaking, so this is one of those films that will never be one of my absolute favorites, but I can't deny how tremendous of a film it is. There is no denying that it is one of the greatest films of its generation that deserves its place in the movie hall of fame. I myself loved it and I don't plan on ever forgetting about this film.It is just incredible when you watch a film like this where every aspect comes together so beautifully. Starting with Budd Schulberg's gripping screenplay and working your way from there, everything about On the Waterfront is tremendous and no aspect faults the film. Elia Kazan's direction is marvelous here. He was a director far ahead of his time and he proved it with his smooth and gracious cinematography in On the Waterfront. There isn't a wasted shot in this film as Kazan experiments with all sorts of angles and motions that aesthetically bind this film into something beautiful. Then of course there is the acting. There's a reason Marlon Brando is considered one of the greatest actors of all time. And that reason is simply because well... its a fact. So few actors can accomplish the raw natural talent that Brando displays on screen. Everything about his acting seems so fluid and visceral. Not only does he delivers lines with such an intense sincerity, but everything he does between and around his lines is equally incredible. Brando encompasses his character of Terry so well and never once comes out of alignment from the character.I said it once and I'll say it again. They just don't make 'em like they used to. On the Waterfront is one of the most defining films of its time and will forever be remembered as such. Every aspect of the film is as excellent as the next. Nothing seems out of alignment in this film. It is what great filmmaking is all about. You would be a fool not to see this film.",

I did a paper on Marlon as well for the class and everyone told me the paper was excellent and if I had seen On the Waterfront, unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere, not even for a buy at a store. Finally Hollywood Video had it and I rented it without delay. This was an incredible film.I'm going to talk about my favorite scene and most would agree Terry Malloy and his brother, Charley in the car. \"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.\". It just broke my heart because I think would could all relate to it, an adult letting someone down and being the typical bad seed because of who you are and where you come from and your roots. That scene in my opinion is the best acted scene in film history, period.The love story between Edie and Terry was beautiful and so real. Edie's brother is murdered and Terry didn't commit the murder, but he was apart of it and she doesn't know. He knows though and how could he tell the woman he loves that he helped murder her brother? She does forgive him, which I loved because I think they needed each other to get away from all the bad things going on in their lives.The whole story is just heart breaking and a great one to watch. I don't know how to put this movie in the words it truly deserves, just if there was a blue print on how to make a great film, I would highly recommend On the Waterfront.10/10",

            "content": "BRANDO, Marlon. (b. 1924) The founder of the mumble-method acting technique, this unusual performer with the naivety of a child and the mind of an infant, struck everyone as an enormously talented, focused and self-deluded, juvenile man. He perfected his mumbling method by avoiding to open his mouth more than a millimeter while he spoke the text; he made sure the tongue would not move more than its involuntary muscles demanded from it; his jaw was totally relaxed and refused to move in accordance with the basic rules of human enunciation. Brando is also the father of the method-method, which he originated. But unlike David Arquette and Keanu Reeves, Brando doesn't think that the method-method was a method employed by an actor when he prepares to play a Methodist minister.He has honed his skills first with Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg, then with Stanislavsky. Strasberg still raves about Brando's days as his student; he says that Brando did the best impersonation of a chicken he ever saw. Stella is equally full of praise, reminiscing often about Brando's terrific portrayal of an 18th century chair. In one of Marlon's frequent bouts of brilliant inspiration, he suggested to Lee and Stella that they do an acting exercise in which he plays them and they play him. Brando got so deep into his character(s) that he at one point told the two that he was kicking them out of class for playing Brando so badly. Lee and Stella found this humorous and laughed, but only until they realized he wasn't joking. They then told him: \"but YOU are Brando, and we are Lee and Stella\", to which he reacted by mumbling something no one understood but which was clearly not friendly. When the two refused to leave class, Brando got violent and tried to throw them out of the building, but his feminine side, the Stella side of his double-character act, softened him down and he backed off from throwing Lee through the window at the last minute. After a while, with the help of medication and Brando's family photo-albums, Brando remembered that he's Brando and became Brando again. A day later, wanting to stretch himself artistically even more, Brando suggested that he play Lee pretending to play him, while Lee played Brando pretending to be Lee, and Stella played Brando and Lee pretending to be gay lovers. Lee and Stella, afraid of the results of such a bold experiment, turned the idea down. Brando was unhappy about that, and soon enrolled in Stanislavsky's school.Armed with both the mumbling method and the method-method, Brando tackled the world of movies. In \"The Men\", Brando prepared for the role of an invalid war-veteran by spending three years in the Korean War, and later cutting off his left leg. In \"A Streetwhore Named Desire\" Brando plays a Polish-American garbage man who rapes his sister-in-law and then smashes a TV set over his neighbour's head; he prepared for the role by spending three months in Poland, collecting his friend's garbage-bins, marrying with a woman who had a sister, sleeping with that sister, then by throwing TV sets around his house. In \"The Wild One\" Brando plays a dim-witted football player who gets a motorcycle for Christmas by Santa Claus, and proceeds to ride it around in circles until he gets dizzy and falls down; Brando prepared for this by becoming a professional football player, reading every book on Santa Claus, learning the geometrical principles of a circle, and riding a motorcycle from L.A. to Boston and back. In \"On The Water Aunt\" he plays the nephew of a woman who spends all her time in a swimming-pool, who decides to have sex with her when his girlfriend leaves him; for this role, he swam the British channel, called his aunt from Nebraska and... You get the general idea.Brando was very difficult to work with. While working on \"Mutes On The Bounty\" he constantly nagged the director that he preferred to sail a ship that has a big moose's head on the front. When Lewis Milestone told him that he wasn't making \"a damn Viking movie\" Brando reacted angrily saying that mouses were an endangered species and that problem needed to be addressed. Later on, Brando fell in love with co-star Tartita, a Hawaiian girl, and demanded that an extra scene be written in with a massive orgy between the ship's mute crew and the local girls. \"I wish Marlon were the friggin' mute he f****** plays in the damn movie,\" was all the inflexible director would say about the shooting when it finally ended.Brando has always been there for the underdog. In protest to what America did to American Indians for 300 years he refused to accept the 1974 Blowscar, blaming then-President Ford for not doing enough to \"prevent the cowboys from killing so many Injuns\". In 1979 he refused the Blowscar because he felt that the world wasn't doing enough to save the Chinese people from extinction. In 1983, he refused a Blowscar because his neighbour killed handicapped squirrels. In 1991, he refused yet another Blowscar because he was angry that he didn't get it the previous year when he had planned to reject it to make a statement about field mice losing their habitat in east Nepal. He has recently taken an active role in fighting the persecution and mistreatment of old Nazi war criminals, and has taken a stand against the misuse of Spaniards in bull-fighting.Later in his career, having expanded to 3 tons, he did roles only for exorbitantly high fees, usually paid in wagons of food. For \"The Score\" he received ten tons of tuna, three tons of ketchup, eight tons of burritos, and 10,000 gallons of pure fat. In recent years his roles have been limited to playing whales, elephants, sea-cows, and walruses.",

            "content": "Marlon Brando and the rest of the cast did a fine job in this movie, but for me the show-stealer was Karl Malden's performance as Father Barry, a social activist Roman Catholic priest who gets involved in the fight against corruption in a Longshoreman's local. Malden was very good in the role - moving Father Barry from initially cautious about getting involved to ultimately passionate about his involvement. It was an interesting performance from Malden in a believably compelling movie depicting union corruption and the intimidation and exploitation of the workers by those who were supposed to be looking out for their interests.Brando played Terry Malloy, a young ex-boxer who's now basically a union tough working for the local president, known as Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Terry begins to have an attack of conscience when he sets up a young kid to be killed, after he thought the kid was only going to be roughed up a bit. Along the way he meets up with and falls for the kid's sister (Eva Marie Saint) and ultimately ends up testifying against Johnny in a corruption trial. The last scene of the movie, as the workers rally around Terry after he gets beaten and bloodied by the goons used by the union leadership and Johnny is left abandoned by the workers he had previously controlled is a very moving scene. (Some of Terry's words as he reflects on his boxing career - and his use as a tough employed by a local union - obviously influenced \"Rocky\" in 1976.)What you have here is not especially flashy - but it's a well done movie with a good cast.

            "content": "Winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture, and widely considered by many to be one of the greatest American films ever made, On the Waterfront would've been a delightful cinema for me if I hadn't already seen its Bollywood ripoff numerous times since its release, due to which this one only felt predictable, somewhat boring & not very satisfying.On the Waterfront tells the story of Terry Malloy, a longshoreman who was once a promising boxer but now only runs errands for his brother, who's the right-hand man of the union boss who controls the waterfront with his mob influence. The plot follows Malloy as he struggles to stand up against the widespread corruption around him and fights for the rights of dock workers.Directed by Elia Kazan, On the Waterfront effectively addresses the themes of corruption, power, loyalty, betrayal & regrets, is elegantly narrated from start to finish, and benefits a lot from knockout performances from both Marlon Brando & Lee J. Cobb. The black n white photography, composed editing, relaxed pace & dramatic score also compliment the story amazingly well.But the real highlight of On the Waterfront is its acting powerhouse. Featuring a stellar cast of Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger & Eva Marie Saint, the work put in by everyone is top-notch with Brando & Cobb leaving the most lasting impression. Although Brando's rendition of Terry Malloy is simply brilliant, it was Cobb who stole every moment as the corrupt union boss with his spectacular performance & dominating screen presence.On an overall scale, On the Waterfront is a dramatic tale of corruption, power & its abuse that doesn't really step on the wrong surface at any moment over the course of its runtime and yet the whole experience of sitting through it was quite underwhelming for me. It's not that I didn't buy any of it or wasn't impressed by what it had in store, I just expected more from it. More or less disappointing on account of its legacy, On the Waterfront is a good film by every means but I'm not sure if it's a great one.",

Shot in New Jersey for verisimilitude, Brando is surrounded by quintessential heavies and some actual dockworkers in his portrayal of a jaded young man confronted by the uncomplicated and idealistic vision of a young woman (Eva Marie Saint in her first film role).The compelling story is based upon actual happenings on the New Jersey docks, where mob bosses controlled every transaction and corruption reigned.As good as this film is, its legacy is clouded by a complicated back story involving director Elia Kazan, whose attempt to find a moral imperative in the actions of Terry Malloy might be suspect due to his own involvement with the HUAC.The music of Leonard Bernstein is sometimes jarringly overwrought, but other times beautifully expressive.Every film buff should watch this film with an appreciation for its contributions to the school of method acting in cinema.",

            "review_title": "A Cathartic Drama of Guilt and Forgiveness",
            "content": "\"On the Waterfront\", directed by Elia Kazan, is one of the most prominent films in the history of cinema, and is seen by many as a perfect achievement in the field of acting, direction and cinematography. Let alone seeing the film as the best American political allegory ever made. What is more, Kazan has not only managed to reflect the occurrences of the Black List era but also in the prism of his personal perception and thus, successfully evaded the trap of historical banality. He has, in a way, broken down the reality to pieces and re-assembled it in front of our eyes in a magnificent form which will catch the viewer's eye. No matter how many times you have seen it.At its heart, the film is really an inner drama. A story about a character who is unable to express his emotions and, therefore, the actor must, by embracing the emotional memories of the character, find other means beside dialog to express his inner struggle. Not surprisingly, it is due to this why \"On the Waterfront\" was Marlon Brando's bravura and has now grown to be the symbol of his method. Moreover, Foster Hirsch, an American expert in film acting, has pointed out how \"On the Waterfront\" includes the best acting ever recorded on film. One can be sure that his statement doesn't merely include Brando and Eve Marie-Saint but also the real workers of the streets who were hired as extras.When it comes to political films, \"On the Waterfront\" is undeniably among the finest. Although the events portrayed in the film aren't identical of those which Kazan faced during the Black List, they are strikingly similar. Or, on a symbolic level, yes identical. For this is really a story about a man who, relying on his own personal intuition, thinks that he is doing the right thing but still gets abandoned by the community. Here lies a direct link to Kazan's experiences during the Black List: how he was coerced into ratting out his former friends of the Communist Party. The way how Brando interprets the despair, which is due to the disbelief of others in his sincerity and innocence, is absolutely stunning and heart-rending. Apart from being a poignant cross-section of the Black List era, \"On the Waterfront\" also reveals more timeless issues regarding the shadows of democracy and the cruelty of capitalism. It evidences how the liberal world works and what it in reality allows. However, what is most masterful is the fashion in which Kazan associates this with the inner struggle of the protagonist. Thus, both of the film's aspects -- the social and the spiritual -- are in a constant dialog with each other and thereby form an aesthetic synthesis. For, in addition to social themes of money, corruption and power, the film drills down to problematic childhood and its subsequent consequences while processing such themes as loneliness, absolution and forgiveness.Obviously influenced by the works of Roberto Rossellini, Boris Kaufman managed to bring neo-realist touch to \"On the Waterfront\", which was veritably revolutionary in Hollywood. Almost with laconic portrayal -- in the simplest style of the world -- Kazan achieves to depict the wonders of life. Only reality, nothing more. When you put Brando's acting on the top of all this, you've got a uniquely timeless classic in your hands which you should not miss.",

            "content": "Shot across from Manhattan in New Jersey (early 1950's), this classic movie is the story of a former stool pigeon named Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) and a courageous priest, Fr. Barry (Karl Malden) who take on the union gangsters in control the dock workers on the waterfront. Along the way, there is some fine acting from Lee J. Cobb as the union kingpin, Rod Steiger as Charlie, Terry's brother, and Eva Marie Saint as Edie Doyle, Terry's girlfriend and brother of Joey, a slain worker.A killing at the start of the movie triggers the war, when a worker named Joey became a little too big for his shoes. Many battles follow. His friend Terry Malloy, played by Marlon Brando, unknowingly gave him away. Malloy becomes a friend of Joey's sister (Eva Marie Saint) and falls in love with her. Her father also works on the waterfront and even shows up for work on the day after Joey dies so the family can pay for the funeral expenses. It is well known that to get work on the waterfront, one has to play by the rules, which means keeping your mouth shut and ignoring what's really going on.The priest sees what is happening in his own parish and decides that it is his moral responsibility to act. He sets up a meeting for the workers to be held in the church and becomes the catalyst for action. The union thugs show up at the church and terrorize and beat the ones they catch. Terry's girlfriend wants him to take a stand and while he is slow to come around, Terry eventually listens to the counsel of the priest. Terry co-operates with investigators and is banished by the union. Karl Malden's role as Father Barry, a priest who translated the gospel message into practice. In a speech over the body of a dead worker, he tells the dockyard men that he sees Christ crucified each time one of the men is killed. Malden received an Academy Award for his work in this movie.The end of the movie is dramatic and emotional. It follows much bloodletting, bullying and humiliation. There is an air of reality with the on location shooting on the docks, in the streets and on the rooftops, where Terry tended and fed pigeons as a hobby. The TV antennas coming from the buildings clearly date the movie from the early fifties...totally unintended.The movie is a great story with real heroism in a world where union crime was a reality. It is backed up by great performances, particularly by Marlon Brando who grows in stature as the movie progresses.",

Sure, it's about corruption and violence, and i's interesting to note that the director made it as a result of what was happening to him in that time, with the HUAC and all of the communism fear in Hollywood. Still, the film never does anything very interesting, aside from a few really entertaining scenes here and there.

On the Waterfront however makes this competition quite interesting posing the decision between friends and good morals.  Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) witnesses a murder and has to decide between betraying his friends or doing what's right and getting the girl, Edi Doyle (Eva Marie Scott), he loves. \t This movie has the perfect plot line for a movie, but unfortunately with this comes much ungrateful unfitting music, forced acting and scenes that seem to be shot by a three year old having a hissyfit.  In many parts of the film the music seems like it is going to lead up to something big and then the scene ends leaving the viewer in utter disbelief that pinnacled music was brought up to a point of nothing.  When the viewer would see something important happening it wasn't accented at all by the music but followed by awkward silence.  The music throughout the whole film is not only unfitting but also very cheesy. \tTerry Malloy's love, Edie Doyle, should have received an award for most likely to not impress a stoner at his peak of intelligence instead of Best Supporting Actress.  Every scene that she was in, she forced out her words and feelings like she was being controlled by a very bad ventriloquist. Some film critics have said that they have cried from her touching performance, I think I cried after laughing so much at her awful acting. Edie wasn't the only actor whose skills seemed rather forced, Father Barry (Karl Malden), also had his moments to have his strings pulled.  Most of his speeches, like the rousing speech at the packing plant, were very well done; but sometimes Father Barry would act more like monkey on a leash rather than a priest. \tWith so much jeer for the film there is probably a greater amount of cheer. Marlon Brando does a very good job of playing a former prize fighting Terry Malloy who tries to fight the mob and be himself.  Marlon Brando took the part of Terry Malloy and molded it into the perfect part to make this film a little less than wonderful.  The other great points of the movie were the scenes of the mob.  Head mobster Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) does a very good job of intimidating others and showing that he deserves to be the head honcho. \tOn a ten point scale I give this movie an 8.  I loved the ultimate decision between friends and evil, which many of us come across everyday of our lives.  Marlon Brando makes a land shattering performance and the mob scenes are very well done.

The story, particularly the climax, is just strange and ultimately leaves too many very important unresolved plot elements completely unresolved and, really, just completely forgotten.The film introduces multiple murders, including the murder of Terry Malloy's brother, Charlie. Which is revealed through a half-assed attempt on Terry's life. This pushes Terry to finally oppose Friendly and testify against him in court after briefly seeking revenge in an absolutely ridiculous manner. After the testimony, the murders are never addressed again. Terry's primary motivation is getting back to work, not securing justice or even vengeance for his murdered brother. It's really makes no sense from both a character and a story persepctive. The climax of the story is Terry and the longshoremen breaking Friendly's corrupt control of the union, not him being brought to justice for the murders. We never see Friendly arrested, charged, indicted, go to trial, or convicted. For all we know, he murders Terry to stifle his testimony, uses his mob connections to re-establish control of the union, and everything goes back to the way it was. I feel like they really dropped the ball on this one.",

It is a young Marlon Brando who paints a tragic portrait of working class America, and in turn creates a timeless tale for the ages. An expertly realized and riveting drama, Elia Kazan's white-knuckle direction transforms this picture into an experience not to be missed. Crime. Drama. Passion. Redemption. 'On the Waterfront' has it all, a textbook definition of great cinema.'On the Waterfront' meets us where religion and corruption cross, and morality collides with deception. Martin Scorsese with a dash of Rob Reiner (the 'Princess Bride' Rob Reiner, not the 'Rumor Has It...' Rob Reiner), for this is a picture both for the crime drama aficionados and hopeless romantics. It resonates even in this day where the small-town mob can be used interchangeably with greedy CEO's caught in the middle of headlining scandals. It's a gripping story, not only in its powerful story, but in its masterful execution. Its black-and-white picture reinforced with bleak but beautiful cinematography, and a haunting score to intensify a thick and brooding atmosphere.'Waterfront' tells the simple story of a 'bum' who battles his conscious to do what's right, but the themes and messages are something that do transcend film. It's Marlon Brando's spellbinding performance that really gives us a chance to see the many layers of not only his character, but of the film. Brando exudes charisma, and his very human appearance here is a true classic and attention grabber. But it is also Eva Marie Saint who turns in an utterly fantastic performance alongside Brando, and it's one of the most tender and heart-wrenching I've ever seen. You can't not root for these two, and they create many lasting and memorable moments together on-screen that deserve to be seen.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",

            "content": "-Spoilers-It's easy to see why `On the Waterfront' has become such an iconic film since it's release in 1954.  Marlon Brando plays a redeemed thug, a guy who finally does the right thing after (sometimes unwittingly) doing some pretty bad things in his life.  The odds seem stacked against him that he can expose the mobbed up and murderous longshoreman's union leader (excellently played by a growling Lee J. Cobb), and he certainly does not come out of the `final showdown' without a lot of physical and emotional battery.  `On the Waterfront' is the rare `hero' film that does not compromise reality; rather than an easy outcome, our hero has to deal with some pretty rotten things happening in his life, and because of this, `On the Waterfront' maintains an essential dignity.While watching `On the Waterfront', I couldn't help but imagine that this was a film that Kazan used as a metaphor in his defense of his actions during the HUAC nightmare.  I'm sure that this is probably already well documented somewhere, but some of the drama and writing would certainly support this.  `On the Waterfront' is a great film for many reasons, but probably mostly for its agelessness.  The themes presented are no less relevant today than they were in 1954, and will, in some way, always be timely.--Shelly",

Well, the film raked in eight Oscars, undoubtedly because - maybe among other things - the film is an absolute stand-out and has deservedly earned its classic status in its own right. But all the controversy aside, one thing is for sure: It's Marlon Brando's great hour. While Karl Malden's as a priest, Rod Steiger as his brother and Eva Marie Saint playing his girlfriend all deliver remarkable performances, Brando is heart and soul of the complex protagonist, longshoreman Terry Malloy. The former prize fighter gets caught up in the schemes of corrupt union bosses, he's involved in the murder of the brother of the girl he falls in love with and the harsher his reality gets the more his inner struggle tears him apart.Most famous of course are the confrontation scene in the taxi with Rod Steiger or his casual improvised playing with a glove while delivering pitch-perfect character dialog. Always on the edge balancing between a strong macho image and his soft side Brando pulls out all the stops and is captivating in every moment he has, whether he plays the unsure, vulnerable guy or the protective, the fearless, the avenger. \"I could have been somebody...\" he says in the film, in a way sealing the fate of another man with his implicit accusation.

            "content": "This is a movie with so many extraordinary strengths and legendary parts that it is hard to even view it objectively any more. For many years when I was young- many years ago, this was my favorite movie. It had a mythical quality for me.So let me just sum up what I think are the great and remarkable things that make this movie a must see: 1. Clearly, Marlon Brando. This is rightly considered to be one of the great performances in film history. Of all the brilliant choices he makes in crafting this role, there is one which (as an actor myself) I would like to point out as an illustration of his peerless technique.The scene is the one in which Terry and Edie are walking along the waterfront in the park, having just met, or rather rediscovered each other for the first time since childhood. At one point Edie drops a glove- a small white dress glove, and Terry picks it up. As he sits on a child's swing, telling her his philosophy of life, he absently pulls the small white glove on his hand.Whenever I watch this scene I literally shudder with pleasure at this gesture. It unleashes a flood of connotative information- Terry's vulnerability, his background as a boxer, his brutishness against the purity of the white glove. I don't know if this was an improvised or planned moment on Brando's part, but it demonstrates the genius that informed his instincts.This is a performance that any actor can go to school on.2. The locations and cinematography. Films are simply not shot entirely on location anymore and it shows. No amount of art direction will ever create a setting as convincing as this real one. Legend has it Kazan wanted the pale, sunken cheeks that filming during a cold New York (actually Hoboken) winter produced. This film is not only a great piece of fiction, but also a significant historical record.3. The score by Leonard Bernstein. Others may find this a little much, but I think its some of the great music composed for the movies by a great composer. I particularly think of the moment when (spoiler) as Terry is being called for Charlie and at the last minute he and Edie narrowly escape a truck, the truck passes to reveal Charlie's body. The score resolves from a pounding tension to a lyrical passage. A composer might be able to illuminate what he does here with the chord change- I can't, but it is very powerful, and very moving.4. The scene. For me the great pivotal scene only begins with the classic taxi cab scene- it doesn't end there. In one uninterrupted dramatic build we cut from the cab being driven into the back of a truck to Terry pounding on Edie's door. This is an almost equally famous scene as he breaks open the door, smashing the jamb, she fights him off and they finally collapse in an embrace, wedged in the tiny hallway of the apartment. There is the most momentary release of tension, and then we hear them calling Terry, telling him that Charlie wants to see him, and we are in the alley with the truck bearing down on them. This is all one long build from the cab, reinforced musically, and climaxes with the discovery of Charlie, hanging by a meat hook. The emotional complexity that Brando brings to this moment, as he gently lowers him, is heart-rending.Obviously, I could go on about the entire film, which I think has the same level of texture, detail, and emotional complexity in every scene. The cast is uniformly brilliant as is the direction. A masterpiece.",

Both the director and writer testified against various Hollywood people to McCarthy and/or the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Both were disillusioned former members of the communist party of USA and as such it is really impossible to miss the allegory in Terry's story and alleged heroism. This isn't even about any moral qualms about what they did (through yes awful actions on their part) one might have, it just makes the film uncomfortable to watch as it sure feels like they both are trying to appease their conscience in a hamfisted way. Fortunately, other people involved, Brando most of all, didn't have that baggage and largely rescues the film from being too specific in its political content.The film is a gritty, hard boiled crime melodrama and on that level it is exceptionally well crafted. Kazan, as director, paints a sordid picture of hard boiled crooks captured in stylish black and white, shadow and light. Schulberg's script has sharp pointed dialog and effortlessly moves the story to its logical conclusion. A lot of people fixate on Brando but honestly all of the acting is very, very good.

Marlon Brando's performance is amazing here, and it's a style of acting you can see influencing the generation of actors that followed in his wake. But the rest of the cast also deserve praise, especially Eva Marie Saint, who matches Brando whenever she's on screen with him.I also really liked how so much of it seemed to be shot on location, which gave it a grit and authenticity not often seen in movies that are this old. Adding to this grittiness is the level of violence in the movie, too, which packs a punch without being gratuitous.The film also has a great ending, and a number of scenes which have become iconic, thanks to pop culture.

Throughout the story, we see Terry's internal struggle between the way things work and the way things truly should be and Brando fleshes out this internal anguish flawlessly. In the few scenes where he truly lets his emotions go, my heart breaks. Standing on the side of the just is Father Barry (Karl Malden, in another impeccable performance), the local priest who encourages longshoremen to stand up against Friendly. Though the true reason for Terry's uprising is in the heart of Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint in an Oscar-winning debut performance), the sister of the man Terry set up at the beginning of the film. The two of them sizzle on screen together as their adorable, intense romance blooms despite the chaos surrounding them.

            "content": "Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time, this gritty story of corruption in the longshoremen's union and one man's courage to resist the mob bosses, hits with the force of an emotional sledgehammer.  The film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 8 including best picture, best actor for Marlon Brando, best director for Elian Kazan and best supporting actress for Eva Marie Saint in her feature film debut.  The acting talent was so deep that four cast members (Saint, Malden, Cobb, Steiger) were nominated in the best supporting actor category.  The film was also rated number 8 on AFI's top 100 list of the twentieth century.  The story focuses on Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), a small-time former boxer whose brother was highly placed in the corrupt longshoremen's union. Terry lures out Joey Doyle, an informant and friend of his, so the mobsters can deal with him.  Terry thinks they are going to rough him up to keep him quiet, but instead, they throw him off a roof to his death.  The guilt begins to gnaw at Terry, compounded by the fact that he is falling in love with Joey's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint).  He is further urged to inform on the mob by Father Barry (Karl Malden) setting up a dramatic confrontation with the union.The setting was highly realistic, filmed on the docks of Hoboken, NJ with the New York City skyline as its backdrop.  Most of the extras were actual longshoremen who worked on those same docks.  The use of black and white film rather than color only served to enhance the dramatic effects.This film was a vehement and personal political statement by Elian Kazan. Kazan had just finished testifying before the House Unamerican Activities Committee, naming former associates who were affiliated with the Communist party.  As a result, he was ostracized by most of the filmmaking community. `On The Waterfront' became his personal mission to justify his testimony. He looked at Terry as his own alter ego.  In one scene, a union boss shouts, ``You ratted on us, Terry,'' and Brando retorts: ``I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all those years.  I didn't even know it.'' This was Kazan's defiant statement in response to the vituperation of his critics.  For this reason the film was reviled by the Hollywood elite and Kazan vilified as turncoat.  In his 1988 autobiography, he wrote about how he felt after the film won 8 Oscars: `I was tasting vengeance that night and enjoying it. `On the Waterfront' is my own story; every day I worked on that film, I was telling the world where I stood and my critics to go and **** themselves.''The political agenda aside, this was brilliant filmmaking.  The story had gut wrenching power, a classic struggle between good and evil with one man defying insurmountable odds and certain death to stand by his beliefs.  It contains one of the most memorable and most quoted scenes in film.  Brando gives his now famous `I coulda been a contenda' speech in chastising his brother for selling him out and making him take a dive so the mob could win the bets they laid on his opponent.  The ending of the film is one of the most triumphant in filmmaking history. The acting was superlative across the board.  Brando's performance is without question one of the most unforgettable ever.  His character was a simple man with extraordinary courage making him an amazingly attractive hero.  The anguished torment he portrayed was deeply affecting.  Karl Malden was electrifying as the defiant priest who stood with the union members to encourage them to oppose corruption.  Lee J. Cobb was also fabulous as Johnny Friendly, the crooked and maniacal union boss who would stop at nothing to maintain power.  Rod Steiger gave a fantastic performance as Terry's older and `smarter' brother who was nothing more than Johnny Friendly's stooge.  Eva Marie Saint was compelling as the courageous sister of the slain longshoreman.  Also playing minor roles were a very young Fred Gwynn and Martin Balsam.This is one of my favorite films of all time.  Of course, I rate it a 10/10. It is required viewing for any classic film buff.  Its power cannot be adequately described, it must be experienced.",

            "content": "For decades the power of labor unions have been on the decline and as a result income inequality has been on the rise. So today it would be no strange thought to consider more powerfull unions as a good thing.For the ones who share this opinion \"On the waterfront\" must be a sobering film. In this film there is a powerfull union, but is does not use its power to represent the interests of the workers. On the contrary! The union operates as a sort of criminal subcontractor, extorting employers and intimidating workers. Workers who are not \"loyal\" will not work and will not eat!The film is essentially about resistance against this corrupt union. Interesting is the wall of silence that confronts the ones that resist. From the part of the perpetrators (bosses of the union) this is logical. Their source of money is threatened. From the part of the victims (workers) this is not so logical. Maybe a whistleblower confronts the \"loyal\" workers with their own cowardice, and they do not like that.In \"On the waterfront\" Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is the younger brother of one of the bosses of the union and initially very loyal to the union (and his brother). During the film he gradually becomes a rebel, mainly due to the influence of his girlfriend Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), the sister of a whistleblower who has been killed at the beginning of the film.The scenes in which Terry and Edie meet are pivotal to the film. Initially Terry views Edie as a naive idealist and himself as a realist. When he thinks again however he must conclude that for the past few years, despite all his realism, he has been abused by the union and by his brother. When his brother fixed a boxing match and ordered him to lose, they split the money but they did not split the broken career. In a key scene he confronts his brother with his new insights. Even a gun is not enough to make Terry \"loyal\" again.Over the name of director Elia Kazan there is still hanging the blemish of his talking in the McCarthy years. He once said that \"On the waterfront\" was his answer to the critics. Sounds rather incomprehensible to me. In my opinion there is a big difference between whistleblowing against corrupt union bosses and against left wing directors.Despite the possible criticism on Elia Kazan the fact remains that he did make beautiful films. Marlon Brando owes his breakthrough in large part to the Kazan films \"A streetcar named desire\" (1951) and \"On the waterfront\" (1954). His name is forever connected to these movies. That doesn't take away, however that the greatness of \"On te waterfront\" is also attributable to the rest of the cast, such as Eva Marie Saint, Rod Steiger and Karl Malden.",

            "content": "Marlon Brando, one of the best actors in screen history, gives an incredible performance as Terry Malloy, a washed up boxer now working along the steamy cold waterfront piers of Hoboken, New Jersey. Malloy starts out as a not particularly bright punk who has fallen into the heart of the criminal element, which is spearheaded by his ruthless crime boss, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Those members who crack and leak out information about the shady dealings are quickly knocked off, and when Brando's conscious starts to trouble him, he makes an emotionally motivated switch from crooked thug to repentant hero.Great performances abound everywhere. Aside from Brando's magnificent portrayal, there is Eva Marie Saint who is sincere in her screen debut as the good girl who softens Terry's heart. Karl Malden is riveting as a tough-as-nails priest standing up to cold-blooded murder. Lee J. Cobb is despicable as the hateful mob leader. Rod Steiger is unforgettable as Terry's desperate brother, and helps to provide one of the most sensitive scenes in all of cinema history (the famous \"contender\" moment with Brando in the cab).Director Elia Kazan has made one of the great films, and it's a perfect example of what happens in Hollywood when every piece fits together, resulting in an exceptional motion picture. Kazan's settings and visual style are outstanding. His choice of filming on location in the visibly chilly winter, using actual pier workers as his extras amidst a hazy black and white backdrop, makes for an almost documentary feel to the proceedings.",

The other actors are all fantastic too, and at no point was I taken out of the movie by the acting. The dialogue is also nice, and the music and cinematography are good too. The main thing I disliked was the plot. I feel like this movie struggles with what genre it wants to paly to: crime, drama, action?

            "content": "Dear Martin Scorsese, I watched your interview on the special features section of the On The Waterfront DVD. You did make some good points about how On the Waterfront was a pioneer in the way the streets of New York was filmed and looked on screen. You also stated that Brando's performance was unique and you had not seen anything like it before except for John Garfield in Force of Evil. But I was thinking about Sterling Hayden in The Asphalt Jungle. I am not comparing Sterling to Brando. But I was thinking about how both the characters were conflicted by the corruption around them, seemingly unable to escape their terrible circumstances. Brando exuded the lonesomeness and melancholy of the failed boxer trying to save his soul by standing up to the union boss who controls the livelihood of the longshoremen. I see parallels between Brando's performance in On the Waterfront and De Niro's in The Raging Bull. I also think Lee.J.Cobb's performance is seriously underrated. He upstaged Brando in some of their scenes together. Cobb's menacing certainty about his evil manipulative ways was a perfect foil for Brando's confusion. Their interactions were the best part of the film. I wish the writer had written more scenes with the two of them squaring off. I was not too impressed by the weepy Eva Marie Saint or the saintly Karl Malden. On the Waterfront tells a universal story. It is a very depressing film when you think about it. I can never forget the final scenes when Brando is being beaten up by the thugs and all the longshoremen simply crowd around and look on. The shots of them passively crowding around the brawling men like sheep was clearly used by Kazan to convey their impotence. Best Regards, Pimpin. (8/10)",

            "review_title": "The Loneliest Battle",
            "content": "As difficult as it is to resist the temptation, I promised myself that I would write this review without using the legendary \"contendah\" quote from the back of Nehemiah Persoff's cab--the one with the curious Venetian blinds in the back window. Let's see if I can actually follow through with the promise.When director Elia Kazan approached producer Darryl Zanuck with the idea for this movie, Zanuck replied, \"Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?\". Having grown up during the 1950's and 60's in the Newark, New Jersey area, if someone were to suggest seeing a movie about an ex-prize fighter who stood up to union mobsters on the nearby, gritty waterfront of Hudson County, I would have probably declined the offer as well. Why would I need to pay for a ticket to watch a movie about an often disagreeable, prevailing culture that surrounded me from all sides in real life? Both Zanuck and I could not have been more mistaken. Before you jump to any wrong conclusions, as I initially did, first consider the stellar cast, an outstanding script by Bud Schulberg, excellent direction by Kazan, brilliant black and white camera work by Boris Kaufman on location in a brutal, bone chilling Hoboken of the 1950's, and an extraordinary score by Leonard Bernstein that, by itself, builds the tension.Terry Malloy, the lead character played with both depth and skill by Marlon Brando in a performance that earned him a well deserved Oscar, is not just an ex-prize fighter. He is a complex human being who is tortured by agonizing conflict. On one side of the conflict is loyalty to the highly influential organization that dominates every aspect of his local community and to the brother who occupies a very important position within that association. On the other side of the conflict is an instinctive compulsion to fight gross injustice and the tyrannical abuse of power, or what Terry calls \"that conscience thing again\".Terry develops a romantic relationship with Edie Doyle, played with a unique, quiet intensity by Eva Marie Sainte in a film debut that also earned her an Oscar and justifiably so. Edie is a very strong-willed, principled young woman who has been released from rough and tumble surroundings in order to pursue a \"proper\", Catholic college education up the Hudson and a world away in Westchester County, New York. She returns home during a school break only to find herself back in the inescapable and evil grip of this cruel, urban prison. Regardless of how much her abused and embittered longshoreman \"Pop\" (John Hamilton) has sacrificed for her freedom and advancement, there would be no easy way out of the jungle for Edie, at least not just yet, much to Pop's dismay.Although Charley Malloy, played convincingly by Rod Steiger, fights hard to defend his brother, Terry, against the suspicions of mob boss Johnny Friendly, portrayed very forcefully by Lee J. Cobb, Charley is possibly an even more tragic victim of inner conflict than Terry is. Charley is the one who is truly \"over his head\" from his involvement with the waterfront mob, sucked into a life-draining trap from which there is no retreat. Ms. Saint and Mr. Steiger, as fellow Newark natives, may have reached back to their own, personal backgrounds in order to shape their very strong, credible characters.Karl Malden also stands out as the crusading, social activist priest, Father Barry, who, along with Edie, inspires Terry to rebel against overwhelming odds in order to do the right thing and to stand up for his deeply held convictions in the face of an extremely vicious and ruthless adversary. Both Edie and Father Barry face doubts when the going really gets rough, and it's Terry who persists at the end.This film powerfully depicts the classic battle between good and evil while illustrating and then gradually resolving an intense inner conflict that dwells deep within the central character, Terry Malloy, who must fight very hard to achieve his sense of human dignity and \"that conscience thing\" against a very brutal and seemingly insurmountable foe. For me, this is a very inspiring achievement, especially as it is so effectively developed and portrayed in this movie. I am sorry that others cannot appreciate it as I do.",

Brando is ( of course) sensational an actor here but so is Rod Steiger and the ultra-beautiful Eva Maria Saint. Plus, Lee J. Cobb steals many of the scenes he's in. The story is very good, locations are credible and tell much of the story too. It might be a little too talky at times but real life often is just that.Now to Kazan testifying to a Congressional committee in 1952. Despite what pro-communist posters rant there was a time in the world in the 1950s when communism looked like it might takeover the whole globe. Giant China fell to mega-massmurderer/ communist Mao Zedong in 1949 and by 1950 America was at war in Korea after the communist North Korea ( under deadly conquerer Kim II Sung ( see my other reviews)) tried to take to invade democratic South Korea. It was a scary time to be American and be worried all about communist infiltration from within. Kazan, having briefly joined the communists in the 1930s, saw how mixed up they they truly were ( and always will be!). He gave Congressional testimony as a one-time insider and it was noble what he did. He admitted he was wrong to ever have been in it and he repented by exposing so many bad humans still in the sick atheistic communist way--he truly repented a lot for his bad sins while briefly with the commies. A thumbs up to Kazan for turning into a good and smart person. The communist is and always will be the totally wrong way.PS The Bible has many incredible scientific accuracues like round Earth hanging on nothing. And jet streams ( mentioned by description).

Given how powerfully it affected me in 2020, I can only imagine the impact it had on viewers in 1954! There are many things to appreciate about this film. For instance, Marlon Brando puts on a clinic in method acting. His Terry Malloy is utterly fleshed out in every mannerism and utterance. Also, the many intimate scenes, rendered in gorgeous chiaroscuro lighting, between characters bursting under the weight of buried pain and frustration, are all examples of great cinematic storytelling.\nBut THE ONE THING that replays in my mind, after this viewing, is the use of the passion of Christ as the narrative device to bring this story of redemption to its climax. It's especially striking because in all other respects, the story is very contemporary. It tells the tale of our hapless hero's participation in the mob's infiltration of the waterfront longshoreman's union. Then, Terry gradually comes to face to face with his conscience and bears witness against the thugs. Through his subsequent physical suffering, he is ennobled to the status of messiah, cleansing the waterfront of sin, and restoring honesty and integrity to the workplace. It's a great example of how the use of a mythical framework can raise the import and impact of regular story.",

Terry is \"protected\" by his brother's status but this status causes problems.This movie rightly deserves its classic status as a 'film noir'. Elia Kazan's directing evokes a very bleak atmosphere that enhances the superb nail-biting drama.The highest praise must go to the cast, especially Brando for being so convincing as someone who could be dismissed as a \"loser\" yet goes through a soul transformation as his eyes open to a life overwhelmed by inner conflict.During the story, Terry becomes involved with Edie (Eva Marie Saint) who has become a passionate activist against the corruption for personal reasons. Brando and Saint are a perfect and convincing pair in their budding but unlikely romance particularly as Terry has strong feelings for Edie while he keeps a torturous secret from her.Karl Malden also adds greatly to an ensemble cast as a fiery priest who joins forces with Edie to fight against the corruption, realizing that this is his mission as a 'man of God'.And Brando shows his best acting yet again in that classic scene with Steiger (equally great) in their confrontation scene in the back seat of a car.Kazan, Cobb, and screenwriter Budd Shulberg had all revealed names of suspected Communists during the McCarthy trials in the 1950s. It is very evident that they are defending their decision via the content of this film. This is especially so in a scene when the priest is lecturing the union members to 'name names' of the corrupt criminals to a crime commission. This leaves a very eerie and creepy feeling.The final scene seems overly melodramatic and unbelievable in its conclusion.

Besides Brandos talent, the plot is one that is easy to follow, it grips you and pulls you into the story and really gives a ton of insight into the mind frame of Brandos character. The editing was especially great. There were a lot of scenes that show and focus on what Brando would be actually looking at, which also lets the audience in one what the main character is feeling and going through during the movie. The film is filmed on location in Hoboken, NJ which i thought gave the movie a truer sense of feeling. The sights of the streets and docks and the working class hero's all tie into making the film believable, and more impacting on the viewers experience.

            "content": "Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a failed ex-boxer who is now essentially working as an errand boy for crooked longshoreman union boss/mob chieftain Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Malloy rebuffs attempts from the police to enlist him for questioning when one of his friends is murdered by Friendly's thugs, afraid that he will be perceived as a \"rat\" by his co-workers at the docks. However, the inquiries of his dead friend's sister (Eve Marie Sant) and the driven local priest (Karl Malden), along with the refusal of his hit-man brother (Rod Steiger) to follow boss's orders and kill him, drives Terry to do the right thing - no matter what the cost.\"On the Waterfront\" is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of American cinema. Directed by Elia Kazan, who is best remembered for his role in aiding the HUAC investigations into Hollywood in the early '50s, the film has been read as an attempt to explain his involvement in the investigation, with the mob standing in for the Communist Party and the dock workers as his colleagues in Hollywood, many of whom were blacklisted and lost work over the investigation - and many of whom never forgave Kazan.This is certainly an interesting way to look at the film, and there is some credence to it. At first, Terry, a generally good guy who has hit a rough patch in his life, is reluctant to aide the Federal investigation because he doesn't want to betray his friends and he fears the backlash against him. But the efforts of the lovely sister of his best friend and the kindly but driven preacher drive him to do the right thing - and ultimately his colleagues stand beside him and reveal Johnny Friendly for what he is - a cowardly crook - expressing Kazan's hope that he would be forgiven for turning against Communists in the film industry.In real life, this didn't quite happen; Kazan was continually ridiculed for his role in the HUAC investigation, which, for all its excesses, was not chasing after ghosts. To be fair, unlike the (now provably real) Communists in the State Department and elsewhere in the US government/military, liberal intellectuals and artists in Hollywood who were seduced by Communist idealism weren't really a threat to American security, as misguided as their views might appear today. Nonetheless, it's something of a shame that such a talented director was so ridiculed for doing what he thought was right by his clannish colleagues.Politics aside, \"On the Waterfront\" still holds up very well today, in no small part due to the acting. This is one of Marlon Brando's finest performances, when he was at the height of his talent, well before he became an overweight caricature of himself. Terry Malloy is a character who, while not particularly bright or insightful, is driven by a determination that there is something wrong with blindly sticking up for his friends. Once he sees what his bosses are, he risks everything in order to do what's right. He's bitter about his failed boxing career, which we learn was largely sabotaged by his brother Charley, and his inability to connect with something greater than being \"a bum\". Every scene Brando is in is brilliant; this is, simply put, one of the greatest performances of all time, completely naturalistic and utterly believable.The cast is filled with other brilliant actors, with Eve Marie Sant wonderful as Edie, the girl who Terry falls for and drives him in the right direction. Karl Malden gives a powerful performance as Father Barry, a truly inspirational character who is completely honest and clear-cut in his views of right and wrong. Lee J. Cobb is wonderfully understated as Johnny Friendly, with Rod Steiger delivering the finest performance of his career (with the possible exception of \"Doctor Zhivago\") as Terry's conflicted brother (the famous taxi scene between the two is justly considered one of the finest acting moments in film history). Like Brando, Steiger would become a self-deprecating ham late in his career, but here he gives a truly powerful, believable portrayal of a man torn between love for his brother and serving his boss.There are so many aspects that one could focus on with the film, and I'm limited in what I can say. Skilfully directed and shot, with a wonderful script by Budd Schulberg and one of the greatest casts ever assembled, \"On the Waterfront\" stands today as a powerful, inspiring drama.9/10",

            "content": "I'm not a fan of gangster or gangsteresque movies, I don't think Marlon Brando is that great of an actor (very handsome though, in an atypical Hollywood way), and I find Elia Kazan a pedestrian director, so I wasn't expecting much going into this one. Even though this film is considered a classic- but then again, most of Brando's films are considered classics. Streetcar is the only one I've been impressed by so far, to be honest. And that was more because of Vivien Leigh.Not dissing this film, though. Even though it D R A G G E D on and on and on to the point where I wanted to turn it off in the first half, the second half was much better. Eva Marie Saint was pretty bad in her role, but she's forgiven for it, because it was her feature film debut. Her character was slightly too implausible, so that might have been why she wasn't that great. Karl Malden wasn't that much better than Eva Marie Saint, but he was given a rather preachy role.Brando was good- perhaps even better than he was in Streetcar in spots. The role of half-witted boxer Terry Maloy was his equivalent to Queen Christina for Greta Garbo, Rhett Butler for Clark Gable or Margo Channing for Bette Davis. It would have been more surprising if he had failed to be convincing in his role than if he had succeeded.He makes Terry Malloy, who is also an unrealistic character, seem more real than most other actors could have done. But like I mentioned above, it would have been seriously surprising if he had not manged to pull off ths character convincingly. Sure, he mumbles his way though his lines, but his character is a dimbulb! I actually know people who talk like Terry Malloy, I'm ashamed to admit.Elia Kazan directs this film in his usual way. The mobster guys seem very one-dimensional. The fight scene at the end made Marlon Brando look like a weakling, but maybe that was the point? Seeing as it's very easy to grow attached to Brando's character, you may be upset at that bit. This picture is faintly noirish, not only in the gangster parts, but also in that there is no tacky happy ending.Do agree that Bernstein's score was rather intrusive and unneeded at times- I think he's an overrated composer anyway. The film was VERY violent for its time- several people get killed, and not in that way that people did in early noirs (pre-1950) where they clutch their breast pocket or side and slump to the ground. A guy is seen hanging from the side of ths building in one scene.Well worth a watch, but not quite a classic. Marlon Brando was more deserving of his Oscar for this film than Grace Kelly was of hers for The Country Girl.",

The incidents that led to the making of the film are also very similar to what happens through the course of the film. However, the fact remains that the film revolutionized cinema for the years to come. On the waterfront is a somewhat grandiose gangster film with splashes of realism. This element can further be observed in Brando's character Terry. He seems like a typical tough guy with any hint of innocence drained out of him, but in his eyes can you see remorse, pain and melancholy. This can particularly be seen in a scene when he is in a taxi with his brother. That is the magic of Marlon Brando, I suppose, the ability to speak even without bothering a muscle or nerve.",

            "content": "\"You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.\" Based on 'Crime on the Waterfront', a series of articles that won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize by Malcolm Johnson, brotherhood bonds to blood, from gunfire to grief, from rough-'em-ups to redemption, 'On the Waterfront' holds nothing back in showing what it wants to convey to its audience. The time allotted of which we get to spend with these people, do we eventually go beyond seeing them as dock workers to actual human beings with actual emotions and burdens to bear? Let's take a look.\"Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?\" So stated American film producer Darryl F. Zanuck who eventually came clean about his feelings toward Elia Kazan's masterful 'On The Waterfront' (1954). Decades later, the film has thus gone on to become a landmark of cinematic excellence. Shot in bleak black and white, director Elia Kazan wanted his actors to feel as miserable as their cold, flavorless surroundings on the docks.Some strong points in the film were probably the most memorable in the film history archives to date. One particular moment was at they true heart of the movie when Charley (Rod Steiger) begs his kid brother, a washed up post-boxer Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) to take a job offer in the back of a cab and then threatens him with a pistol. Terry grins and slowly shakes his head, knowing that his brother would never pull the trigger on him. Terry knew Charley too well. And it is here where Terry confesses to Charley in a monologue about what and who he could have been.Another key aspect is the decision Terry makes in breaking the code of silence. As he begins to become more tormented by his awakening conscience amidst the violent acts around him, he increasingly leans towards testifying against the heinous crimes the powerful local Mob boss (Lee J. Cobb) and his goons have committed before. As the kid brother of his Mob-connected union boss' right-hand man, Terry admits to Charley, after he bribes him with a plum job and then threatens him with a gun in one of cinema's most famous scenes in film history, that the downward spiral of blame he had on himself he now placed on his brother, his own flesh and blood. Charley had been sent by Friendly to keep quiet, but Charley finally recognizes that he has failed to sway his younger brother into doing what he wanted him to do. Terry realized that violence and illegal acts should be spoken out for no matter what the punishment, as long as he knew it was the right thing to do in his shattered world. All his life he was brought up with not doing anything for anybody and not saying anything to anybody, for a stool pigeon he was not; a perfect metaphor being the many caged birds he kept on the roof in which he could relate being stuck in a slum existence yearning to fly far away from the guns and bloodshed one day. But inside he knew that there had to be a voice to stand up against what he believed was right. And all the crimes he and the longshoremen have witnessed could not keep hi, quiet any longer, despite the entire Mob nearly beating him to death near the end of the film. He may have been battered and bloodied, but he still possessed his untouchable, unshakable dignity.Also, another strong moment occurs was when a dock worker named K. O. Dugan was crushed by a load of Irish whiskey in a staged accident by the Mob, which afterwards the \"waterfront priest\" Father Berry (Karl Malden) shows up and delivers a fiery speech on how violence has truly gotten out of hand amidst the slums. And the big, bloody brawl near the end of the film with Terry and Johnny Friendly was yet another epic scene in the film itself as Terry barely survives it but ultimately wins. A weak part in the film is when he yells his love interest's Edie's (Eva Marie Saint) name outside her door and she tells him to go away after what he had confessed to her prior. But he eventually kicks the door open and grapples her in his arms as the couple kiss passionately.This film goes deeper than portraying sweaty longshoremen, a former boxer and Mob violence amidst a smoggy, cold oasis. It went on to become a true part of cinematic history, ultimately showing to the viewer that speaking out for what you know is right, despite trial and error, can make a world of difference and an inner peace in standing up for your beliefs.",

There is almost nothing wrong with this film.The characters are wonderfully drawn, both by Budd Schulberg, the author, and by the uniformly excellent cast. It is quite a statement that the film one both of the major acting Oscars, and had 3 nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category. Brando is heartbreaking as the man torn apart from by loyalty to his boss/cousin and his compulsion to 'do the right thing', and delivers one of the most powerful performances seen on film.Eva Marie Saint shines in the darkness of the world that surrounds her, brilliantly innocent, pure and wholesome. She matches Brando scene by scene, her calm beauty a counterpoint to Terry's passion, and this contrast is brought out in the cinematography and costume, setting her apart.Karl Malden's priest is excellent, although almost anyone could have been powerful with the lines he is given. He brings across the religious undertones in the battle for Terry's soul in a wonderful manner, realistically portraying a good man in tough environment.Lee J. Cobb, one of the era's great character actors, is brilliant as Malden's opposition, chilling and intimidating, yet wonderfully charismatic. There is a danger that a lesser actor could slip into pantomime, but he never does.Leonard Bernstein's score is simply fantastic (how it failed to win the Oscar i shall never know), and Elia Kazan's direction is the reason, along with Brando's performance, that this film is still considered one of the best of all time. His and Cobb's involvement stemmed from being 'Friendly' Witnesses in the House Unamerican Trials, and the film deals with the stigma of speaking out against something you oppose, their passionate feelings wonderfully shown. This truly is one of the greats, and no one should miss out on it.",

On a more nitty-gritty level, WATERFRONT encompasses gripping drama, unconditional love, and a conversion of protagonist Terry Malloy from his original credo of \"do it to him before he does it to you\" to something approximating the Golden Rule (\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"). Filmed amid unrelenting cold--you can see the actors' breath in most of the outdoor takes--namers-of-names before the HUAC witch hunt of the early 1950s (director Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg) were brought together on-set with those who refused to cave in to the fascism then in fashion (such as Marlon Brando, who played Terry Malloy). It is fascinating to ponder how those whose ethnicity would have gotten them killed in Europe a few years earlier became so easily cowed in real life, yet so apt at proffering the power of an individual to stand in the face of mob rule on the movie screen. The climactic close of WATERFRONT is just as outlandishly capraesque as anything Frank Capra ever directed. I honestly feel IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a much grimmer picture than WATERFRONT, since Terry seems to have a brighter future when the curtain rings down than Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey does at the close of the former feature.",

He gives a aggressive performance that only Brando could make.  Another classic from Elia Kazan who did A Streetcar Named Desire(1951) and East of Eden(1955).  He did this film as a justification for naming names of alleged Communist members in America and Hollywood to be blacklisted by the HUAAC.  What he did was simply horrible because he was responsible for the destruction of the lives and careers of many people and their families and there is nothing he could depict in this film that can justify his actions.\nI have no respect for a man who has no shame for performing such an unforgivable deed.  As a filmmaker, Kazan is one of the best but as a human being he's simply horrible.  He is in this regard the Leni Riefenstahl of Hollywood(at least she does feel shame).  The film is full of memorable lines and excellent performances from the cast.  On the Waterfront(1954) is one of the films that would influence Paul Schrader's film debut, Blue Collar(1978).",

On The Waterfront is a film of many strengths and probably everyone would agree its biggest is the acting. I have not seen all of Brando's films but enough of them to notice how great of an actor he was. Brando is just fantastic here, he delivers all his lines with perfection, he is Terry Malloy from start to finish. The \"I Coulda Been a Contender\" Speech was flawlessly delivered and represents one of the most brilliant moments in filmmaking. Brando's performance here represents one of the best performances by a Leading Actor. Brando maybe the standout in the acting but that doesnt mean the supporting performances arent great. Karl Madden is very convincing as the priest. Rod Steiger is also particulary effective as Terry's more intelligent brother, Charlie. Lee J. Cobb is excellent as the menacing boss. Grace Kelly turned down the role of Edie Doyle and I think that was a good decision, Kelly is too glamorous for the role. Where Eva Marie Saint looks perfect and also gives a brilliant performance as the sweet Edie Doyle who opens up another side of Terry. The direction is perfect from Elia Kazan. The Screenplay should be equally praised. On The Waterfront is a film that could have ended up being preachy but thanks to the script it isnt. On The Waterfront really hasnt dated much in my opinion.

Most importantly there must be a good story line for the character to work with.In Elia Kazan's 1954 classic On the Waterfront, Marlon Brando (A Streetcar Named Desire) stars as Terry Malloy, a man who wants to make it to the big time in the boxing circuit. Instead of fighting he is stuck doing favors for the leader of the waterfront labor union, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb, 12 Angry Men); a man powerful enough to control not only the payroll but the lives of the dock workers.One night, Terry witnesses the murder of Joey Doyle, one of the neighborhood's favorite workers by two of Johnny's henchmen. Sadly, he can't come forward about it. Instead he is forced to work at the docks to try and pick up more insider information. His brother Charlie \"The Gent\" (Rod Steiger, In the Heat of the Night) is more or less the brains for Terry due to too many fights in the ring.Wanting to help out the longshoremen fight Johnny and his gang for better working conditions, Father Barry (Karl Malden, Patton) will stop at nothing. Another one on the path for redemption is Joey's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint, North by Northwest). She along with other faithful workers of the New Jersey waterfront are looking to put an end to Johnny Friendly's reign of terror.The film won a total of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor (Brando), Supporting Actress (Saint), and Screenplay. The other four nominations were three Best Supporting Actor nominations (Cobb, Malden, and Steiger) and Best Score. The hardware is merely the frosting on the cake when looking at what this movie did for the cinema in the years to come.Brando's character broke the mold in terms of acting. For years to come actors who weren't classically trained or method actors could do the big parts and still receive praise and awards. Fortunately for Brando the script he was given was perfect for his portrayal of Terry. This would not be the only role he would be known for. Later in 1972, Brando put on some makeup and became Don Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather.The last part of creating a memorable performance isn't as easy to create. While talking to Charlie, Terry argues that it was because of him that he wasn't a prize fighter. He utters the line, \"You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it.\" Considered by many to be one of the best quotes from a movie in history, this sums up the plight that Terry goes through everyday, knowing that he could have been a real contender in the boxing world.On the Waterfront is a moving, exhilarating, and heart-felt picture. It will have you on the edge of your seat and fighting back tears.",

Yes this film brings with it a whole plethora of emotion and action which culminates in a euphoric feeling of movie goodness. I felt the film to be a solidly sublime movie and here below is exactly why so.The story is a good mix of thrills but also romance and a little good old fashioned straight line drama. The story is not the fastest but not many of the time were and although the running time is not too long, the plot seems to incorporate everything you feel you need to know. It really steps up a gear toward the end and not to spoil anything for a possible pre watching reader but the end is pumped full of tense scenes and you really feel what is going in the characters mind.The acting is some of the best I have ever seen, Marlon Brando is flawless and finding a better performance is hard to come by or think of. I found Karl Malden as the calm but very stern Father Barry almost as good and he really connects with Brando to create some great scenes together. I found Eve Marie Saint to be maybe not as good but powerful as Edie and she works well with both the actors above to make the cast one of the best assembled.Elia Kazan directs very well indeed and his vision is brought out with such ferocity that a seemingly slow moving drama becomes full of life and passion. Budd Schulberg co creates a script which breathes originality and he pursues the right way to script perfectly. I felt that if the movie were made now in none black and white and with a modern twist, it would still work and that is why it feels so relevant to me.It's hard to think of too much wrong with the thing but at a try the more slower scenes and over dramatic acting by some of the extras comes out. The acting I speak of is mostly confined to when large groups mass and they are poorly chosen, I will say though that the cast such as Brando can literally turn a scene into gold by just being there.I think if you like a good old film that really shows the true spirit of the main character then this is for you, you go along with Terry Malloy and feel how he feels at every turn. You may not like it so much if you dislike all the sets and of course black and white, it is a near masterpiece but I do see why some would not like it as much as others do.Overall I gave it a 9/10 and a solid one of that, not quite reaching a 10 but ever so close indeed. This is one movie where you feel it is hard to give a grade, the story gets it a certain point but then the acting and direction come in and give it so many more marks than it already has. Give it a try and you may just really enjoy it, not to mention go around telling people this is the best movie you have ever seen.",

            "review_title": "On The Waterfront",
            "content": "Marlon Brando gives one of the screen's most electrifying performances in this 1954 classic. In the New York port of Hoboken, a corrupt, racketeering union enjoys limited power. Day in, day out, would-be workers gather on the dockside in the early morning, hoping to acquire a day pass to earn a few bucks. The union bosses rule the rooast: their word is law, and anyone foolish enough to challenge them is risking his death. This being young longshoreman Joey Doyle, who's preparing to testify before the Waterfront Crime Commision: the union men use Terry Malloy( Brando) to lure Doyle into a trap that costs him his life. Terry, a former prize-fighter could have been a contender, but now he toils for boss Johnny Friendly ( Lee J. Cobb) on the gang-ridden waterfront. Terry, is not a bad guy, but he's certainly not too bright either.It is only through, the dead man's sister, Edie Doyle ( Eva Marie Saint), and the tough local priest, Father Barry ( Karl Malden) that he begins to see how low he has fallen and to the conscience he never knew he had.The real sensation of this film is Marlon Brando. As Malloy, Brando simply shows the underlying complexity of a simple man, torn apart by conflicting feelings and powerful external forces. It is a performance for the ages. There are two scenes in particular that have entered into my movie mythology. The first one, is, in the back seat of a taxi, and it is a scene in which Terry finally comes to the realization that his brother Charley ( Rod Steiger) has sabatoged his chances in not only boxing, but in life as well. This is the scene made famous by this famous speech by Brando.\" I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.\" Both brothers have realized that something important has just occurred; and when Charley ends up pulling out a gun to persuade his brother to keep his mouth shut before the Commission, you realize it is just a simply act of pure desperation on Charley's part. Almost tenderly, Terry brushes the gun aside, and Charley's fate is sealed. It is a scene that shows the loss of brotherly love and the depth of both Brando & Steiger's acting.The other scene is at the end of the film. A movie-goer would probably know it as the famous stagge scene. Where Malloy after being badly beaten by Johnny Friendly and his goons, goes back to work. \" Put me on my feet!\" Brilliant! Not to mention the display of physical acting Brando does prior to the walk and the during the walk itself.Some other fantastic scenes include the scene where the workers start pelting Father Barry ( Karl Malden) after Dugan has been killed. Father Berry has long wanted to see these men wake up and cast off their servile and aparthetic attitues. He simply points to the dead body and says, \"Boys, this is my church!\" Pure Awesomeness.Eva Marie Saint is also sensational here. Beautiful, and angelic.... No wonder Malloy is so disarmed by her!!! What guy wouldn't be? That scene where Malloy confesses to her. Man! \" Look see this arm? Two inches longer than the other. Thats from years of working and sweating... and lifting and swinging a hook. Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag. I says to myself.... 'That's for Edie, so she can be a teacher or something decent.'\" \" You give it to Joey, to Dugan, to Charley, who was one of your own! You think your God Almighty. But you know what you are? You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinking mug! And I'm glad what I done to you!\" \"You know this city's full of hawks? That's a fact. They hang around on the top of the big hotels. And they spot a pigeon in the park. Right down on him.\"",

The way the workers talk with each other is very enjoyable, though I have no idea how authentic it really is. I also really loved the extras and small parts in this movie, because they all have such distinct faces.While the soundtrack is nice, but the sound mixing is quite bad/dated. Brando is good in his part, but I'm not convinced that he would attract Eva Marie Saint's character in the way that it happens in the movie. How the relationship is portrayed is easy to forgive (as much have happened in the 60 years since this movie was made), but it still takes away some of the realism.",

            "content": "The 1965 film, now viewed, is still fascinating.The movie caused Terry to stir up that big wave, and we saw his psychological changes, from following the waves to the current. He gained love, faith, and at the same time lost friends and family. The final challenge, without the triumph of heroism, even with no victories, stand up and stand out is everything.I think the most interesting thing is that when Terry chose to tell the truth in the court, to uncover the darkness of the union, he would naturally suffer from the teeth of the union, and at the same time was ridiculed by all the dockers. Without the job assigned, all the beloved pigeons were killed. No one likes whistleblowers, even if the content of the whistle is in their favor. The workers on the dock are silent and frightened. They can't bear it. They can only bear the exploitation of life and class. The most terrible thing is that everyone may be part of a crowd of people, but at a loss.Seen in this way, the movie is about a sheep in captivity, a sheep rushed out of the fence, the changes that occurred in it, and the reactions of other sheep. The filming is quite realistic, showing a different and deep human face.The story is simple, but many levels contributed to this wonderful movie. The first is photography, black and white photography, and large facial expressions, which make the film visually distinctive. Secondly, the unique black soundtrack, short tension, cut through the dead silence of the dock.In the end, the performance was very good. He had to praise Marlon and Bailongdu. He had an innate charm. The softness and masculinity were combined into one. Regardless of the face of Joe 's death at the beginning, the kind of self-esteem brought by conscience, the tender and protective desire to fall in love, the hesitation and avoidance swaying between conscience and affection, and the anger in the face of his brother 's death, and finally with perseverance The perseverance that stood up was actually that kind of perseverance, and all of them convinced the character and were encouraged by it. Amazing, love him!",

Regardless of how you feel about the specifics of this story of corruption in the dockworkers union, it really is a basic story of human struggle between right and wrong that we can all relate to. The scenes between Brando and Eva are very touching and realistic, but I must say, the famous \"I coulda been a contender\" scene really is deserving of all it's praise. A very touching scene between two brothers and the eventual ultimate sacrifice that comes from it. Watching this movie for the first time in 2003, makes me long for this time when the really great movies were made.**** (Out of 4)",

This discipline provides my work power. A German quotes says \"Working makes free your soul\". But unconscious workers labours are not useful. Lackness of conscious makes nonsense labours. Of course we can not blame uneducated people for thier ignorance but Unificatiion completes that lackness. I blame labourers who are like in this film because of their immoral behaves.

It captures the lives of dockworkers in a seedy little port-town. These guys break their backs for almost nothing, while their corrupt union bosses reap all the profits.The movie opens with a 'hit' by the bosses. There's word that one of the local workers are gonna come forward to the trade-commission about his buddies little corruption scheme. They make sure to shut him up. They send Terry (Mr. Brando himself), to lure him onto the roof of his apartment building. Terry had no idea that they were gonna kill him. He was informed that they were going to scare him. After this poor guy hits the pavement, the whole movie begins to unfold.Terry falls in love with the dead guy's sister. She doesn't know that he was part of the hit, and he wants to keep it that way. He doesn't know how to tell her. She's the first good thing thats entered his life so far.He knows the only way to redeem himself is to stand up against these corrupt bosses that run the town. Great cinema and dramatic sequences ensue.Hat's off to this whole production. They should show this movie to kids in school. I think it's a good example of the many struggles of The Great Depression. They don't focus too much on the big-time gangster stuff. If you want a movie with Tommy-guns a-blazing, please go watch Dick Tracy. This movie is pretty down to earth for the subject matter.The soundtrack is alright. The music is a little out-of-place at some parts. There's action music during mellow sequences, and sometimes no music at all during action sequences.

On the Waterfront contains the same level of ominous intensity that I find in the Godfather twenty years later. It must have been something to experience this movie when it was first released as it resembled very few films that I can think of that combined gritty realism with a relevant social commentary that is every bit as valid today. Then there's the acting! All the principals are terrific and what can you say about Brando? Kazan claimed this as the greatest acting performance ever in the history of films. While personally I prefer Pee Wee Herman in Big Top Pee Wee, it would be hard to argue against Brando here. There are no false notes in his entire portrayal.The same can be said for Eva Marie Saint (angelic like beauty , check out her range by seeing her as a femme fatal in Hitchcock's North by Northwest).",

He is told all they want to do is talk to the guy. Terry gets the guy up to the roof. only to see him fall to his death minutes later pushed by two union goons. This sets into a chain of events.

Rod Steiger plays a louse he's Terry's Brother and he was supposed to look out for him but he doesn't and in the end pays for that mistake. Lee J. Cobb such a incredible actor.

            "content": "\"On The Waterfront\" is one of the finest American films ever made. Kazan gives us a brash, hard-hitting view of blue-collar life on the loading docks, where big-money bosses (both seen and unseen) make up all the rules and day-to-day workers learn that the first law of protecting yourself is to keep your mouth shut and to look the other way. Anyone who threatens to expose the corruption of the union chiefs is ostracised as a stoolie and a fool, whose actions threaten to overturn the applecart onto the backs of his frightened fellow dockworkers.In my opinion Brando was even better here than in \"The Godfather.\" He always excelled at the role of anti-hero, and here, even in the end, one can't say whether there's any redemption for Terry, whether his actions are motivated by a sense of right and wrong or whether they are only animalistic reactions borne of humiliation and a thirst for vengeance.Kazan assembled a brilliant cast. Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint are both memorable as characters who evolve into stronger, more committed persons over the course of the film. Malden's tirade in the ship's hold is one of the great movie speeches of all time. Contrast Ms. Saint's role here to that of the cool and collected character in Hitchcock's \"North By Northwest\" and you can begin to appreciate what an underrated actress she was. Also, Rod Steiger stands out as Brando's older brother.Many of the other actors in the film are individuals whose names I'll probably never recognize. That works to the film's advantage, because it makes it easier to identify with them as their on screen characters and to become involved with their story. (Alright, I'll admit that I can't look at Fred Gwynne in ANYTHING without thinking of Herman Munster.)The film is certainly not understated or subtle. Even the rare moments of tenderness in this movie seem to have an awkwardness to them. Some of the effects are over the top, such as the cacophony of urban sounds that drowns out the spoken words of a pivotal confession. Now, I love when an actor or a filmmaker chooses to artfully understate a point instead of insulting our intelligence or over-manipulating a scene. But this movie is not about subtlety. It's a no-holds-barred look at human nature, at tough choices, and at aspects of our society, past or present, that most of us would rather overlook. It succeeds like few films, and is deserving of its top-20 AFI ranking.",

Cobb)then he becomes a decoy to draw fellow longshoreman Joey Doyle out of his apartment and onto the roof.When he turns out to be reason of the death of his fellow worker and he becomes romantically attached with his sister he starts to question his conscience all over again.The movie is a total satire on the total collective conscience of human beings.The gang's use of D*D (Deaf and Dumb) Strategy and the mob-approved silence displays that openly.

When I read something on the movie I learnt that \"...the movie was modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DiVincenzo, who testified before a real-life Waterfront Commission on the facts of life on the Hoboken docks...DiVincenzo sued & settled, many years after, with Columbia Pictures over the appropriation of what he considered his story...\" It sounds really corrupt in the name of this movie even if the allegations were not proved to be exactly true because this movie is supposed to be clear of any manipulation as it is precisely supposed to be done to fight for the basic human rights.And something about the acting in the movie.I have seen Lee J. Cobb in \"12 Angry Men\" as the ever-opposing juror. I do not know much about such old actors but he may have been type-casted as a bad guy.Marlon Brando's performance as the inarticulate former prizewinner is also great.I remember Marie Saint in North by Northwest but this is one of Hitchcock movies I disliked so I do not have much of an opinion of her acting skills.",

Eva Marie Saint playing Edie Doyle was Oscar-worthy for best supporting actress.Karl Malden's power speech on the waterfront for the dock workers as Father Barry is beyond brilliantly written and executed, and deeply touches on the central point of the film: that doing what's right should never be compromised.The screen legend of Brando may have never been outplayed on film, but if he ever was, it must have been by the amazing performance of Karl Malden in this picture with a great morale.Excellent!",

It is a captivating piece of filmography with deep psychological attention to the characters, a brilliant atmosphere, accurate settings, a perfect black and white photography, an outstanding script and a flawless cast.If Marlon Brando was noticed for his uncommon performance as \"The Wild One\", this picture made him a huge star playing Terry Malloy the frustrated former boxer that knows what dignity is but doesn't know how to live in it. Lee J. Cobb renders one of his usual splendid jobs as the reckless top man in the gang that lives out of the dock's workers efforts. Rod Steiger is very good too as Brando's educated brother who finds it easier and more profitable to work for the gangsters than to use his professional skills in a straight life. Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint also improve the movie as the priest that sees in Brando the man who can change things and the girl that makes him question where his life is heading.The final sequence is one of the most remembered and impressive in film's history and it sure deserves it.\"On the Waterfron\" is a brilliant film not matched yet in its kind.",

However, in \"On the waterfront\", Brando gives his beat performance of his career.  He simply read the script and immediately felt the feelings his character was going to have as well as his reactions.  In other words, he WAS Terry Malloy even when he wasn't shooting the movie.  Terry Malloy (Brando) works on the waterfront under the guidance of the union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) and of Friendly's right-hand man Charlie Malloy (Rod Steiger) who is also Terry's big brother.  But when a local priest (Karl Malden) decides that he has to put an end to the corruption that is held on the waterfront, things begin to go sour for Friendly and his gang.  Helped by Eva Marie Saint, the church soon has a pretty good chance at winning a case involving the murder of Saint's brother by Friendly' men.  Naturally, Brando falls for Saint, putting his life on the line.  The whole movie is tough and uncompromising and Brando's performance could be considered to be the movie performance that altered the whole acting world. Kazan's directing is excellent as well and he was rewarded for it with an Oscar.  \"On the waterfront\" is one of those rare movies that ranks way way up there with the best of all-time and grabs your attention from beginning to end.",

            "content": "As a man who is pushing 33, who was a confused child in the 80's and a tentative avatar of generation X throughout the 90's and up until now, my perspective of older films is going to be different than of those who lived during that time. Many period pieces have been made \"after the fact\", that require the audience to trust that the research has been done and that what they are watching is a plausible representation of that era. It takes a special kind of film to effortlessly appear legitimate to any generation that would be exposed to it, and any kind of social or political commentary it was trying to make can be easily swallowed. I insist that On The Waterfront exemplifies that analogy.Anyone who is new to Marlon Brando and is curious to know why he is universally considered a great American actor will benefit from starting with this film. Brando is \"coulda-been a contender\" prize fighter Terry Malloy, who is a product of his upbringing in the NY slums. Having flushed his career by taking a dive to satisfy the pockets of local gang figureheads - specifically a Johnny Friendly played seamlessly by an intimidating Lee J.Cobb - he has long since settled into a blue color job at the docks as provided by his benefactor.The well oiled machine of underground criminal activity motors along, until Terry is confronted by a moral dilemma. His conscious is awakened by the the naive and beautiful Edie Doyle, sister of a recently eliminated snitch, whom Terry unintentionally had a significant part in murdering. Her brother was a stand up kid who everybody liked, and Edie lingers around the crime scene desperate for someone to help her learn the truth. While the locals generally sympathize, no one is dumb enough to point in Johnny Friendly's direction lest they meet a similar fate.Terry doesn't care much about the gang or street politics; he is a simple man with a simple instinct for survival. Its unfortunate that these cats get away with extortion and murder, but what is he supposed to do about it, right? Terry tries to adhere to the unspoken code that keeps him alive and working. His empathy for this pretty little fish out of water wears away at him, as do the righteous, fiery speeches of catholic priest Father Barry (Karl Malden) who boldly dedicates himself to abolishing gang oppression in his part of town once and for all. The priest implores people to do the right thing and go to the authorities with any knowledge they have of this young man's unfortunate passing. Terry's dilemma is made all the more difficult because his own brother Charlie is bookkeeper to the devil.Terry has his own reasons for despising Johnny Friendly for the loss of his promising career as a boxer, but it takes the distress of a lovely blond girl to ignite the fire within him. In a fantastic, memorable third act, Terry takes a stand and a beating in front of his fellow co-workers. Though battered to a pulp, he gathers himself and limps his way to the warehouse to do his job, proving that Johnny Friendly is only as powerful as the people allow him to be.On the Waterfront is an uncomplicated film that truly captures the essence of post war late 1940s, where corrupt union officials ran rampant and the city streets were brimming with downtrodden, luckless civilians that lived to work and worked to live. We see very little of the politics, rather we live the side effects along with Terry.There are still many classic movies I have to catch up on; and certainly classics by the same director Elia Kazan such as \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"A Face In The Crowd\". I am more eager to do so knowing that this director, as proved in On The Waterfront, appreciates his subject matter, and elicits strong performances from his actors. Most importantly, when I watched this film it never made me consider how old I was, or how old the film was; it spoke to me the very same way it spoke to audiences in the 50's, and thus truly deserving of the label \"timeless classic\".",

A priest and a beautiful young woman convince him to testify against Cobb with conflicts and violence soon to ensue. Kazan is undeniably the right man to direct this because of his theatrical and intimate approach to working with actors. It is the acting that wins this film over among all things. Brando won a well-deserved Oscar for his groundbreaking performance. Brando's character is both likable and detestable, which allows Kazan to test our sentimentality's with loser characters.Yet Brando ends up as the best character in the story and pulls at our emotions because he refuses to give in to all the forceful persuasion. Marie Saint and Malden are as likable as ever in their roles and Cobb is an excellent tough guy villain. Kazan approaches his direction with actors in mind but nails the mannerisms of waterfront personalities in a gritty style few filmmakers dare to explore.What makes this film so beautiful is how Kazan uses the actors to tug at our heartstrings and keeps his usual realistic style on the picture. The grip of Hollywood refuses to stylize the characters and even the story to a certain extent. Kazan provokes tears, shutters, and laughter all within the same film by simply being honest with each of his characters and keeping his storytelling extremely fluid in every sense of the word.",

It was with this that I approached \"On the Waterfront\" with some trepidation - and my fears proved groundless. \"On the Waterfront\" won 8 Oscars and, having seen it, it's no great surprise. Marlon Brando won Best Actor for his role as Terry Malloy, a dockman who is warring with his guilt over the role he played in the death of a dockman who failed to agree with the policies of local crime lord Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). Brando is being pressed upon by Father Barry (Karl Malden) to testify in court against Johnny and he has to decide how much his soul matters to him. Brando is nothing short of superb - Malloy could have been played as a one-dimensional fellow but instead I was treated to one of the most lifelike characters I've witnessed in the movies. We see him express humility, hope, anger and a variety of other emotions and yet never are they *overly* expressed, never done in an exaggerated manner. They're entirely like-like and it is now that I can see why Brando is held in such esteem. However it's not just Brando - Malden and Cobb and Malloy's love interest played by Eva Marie Sant are all wonderful which is no doubt why there was Oscar nominations for Malden and Sant. The script is quite dark. People who speak out too loud against Johnny Friendly have a nasty habit of dying. There's a palpable sense of fear among the workers. The movie sees Malloy wrestle with his conscience in this atmosphere. There is a certain inevitably about the outcome but the exact nature cannot really be guessed. There's excellent lines and the film never preaches - which is quite surprising because one of the central characters is a priest. He transcends all priest stereotypes and manages to lend the film a soul because his meditations about the soul, and sacrifice, resound for once with actual meaning.Elia Kazan won the Best Director for the movie and again it's easy to see why. The film is shot moodily in black and white and looks just right - the sets have an authentic run-down feel to them. The sound editing is spot on with one particular nice use of a ship horn overlaying a heated conversation between Brandon and Sant. Indeed the whole package works out pretty well.\"On the Waterfront\" is still relevant for today with it's tale of determination set against corruption and the power of one man's will. It's extremely well acted and setup and - seeing as I still enjoyed it nearly fifty years on from it's inception - is deserved of being a classic. 8.5/10.",

The first is Boris Kaufman, the cinematographer of all four films by Jean Vigo, as well as of Lumet's masterpiece \"12 Angry Men\" (1958). Especially the crowd scenes at the waterfront and the wedding scene at the pub are brilliantly conceived pieces of movement, and the way he shoots interiors somewhat anticipates the tensity of the Lumet.Then there's Brando, of course. I could watch him forever, his amazing sense of expression, timing, body language, everything. His hesitations, his eyes, his hands, nervousness, his broken heart. But as for the film, I think it's so self-consciously serious (the music epitomizes this, as well) that it's impossible for me to relate to it as much as I would have liked.

Today's films don't use music as Kazan used it, in an attempt to force emotional reactions; the music is beautiful but overwrought. That's ironic because much of the film is about \"small\" emotions as Terry wrestles with his conscience. I'd love to see the movie again with no background music at all. Brando is memorable in a performance that has influenced film acting ever since, but great film acting now is more minimalist and subtle than Brando's performance, which is compelling but full of tics and winks. His eyes are immensely powerful, yet his face is rarely still. Lee J Cobb rivals him in his powerful, but exaggerated performance as the film's heavy.

It is so much more than a good guy v. bad guy movie, it portrays the importance of the truth and standing up for your beliefs - something we could all do more of.If you've not seen it I would hugely recommend it, get the DVD for the Kazan interview, worth the bit extra.. its opened my mind to the importance and value of historic Hollywood film.",

Its focus was on organized crime in New York City, but could have been a symbol for all organized crime. Marlon Brando played the roll of Terry Malloy, a young man trying to make something of himself the wrong ways. Malloy finally \"mans up\" by taking the responsibilities of righting the wrongs that have been done and in the end comes out a working class hero. Almost all aspects of the movie are \"realistic\". Examples are the characters written as \"regular\" people and the majority of the movie being shot on location in Hoboken NJ. Its not surprising this film received eight academy awards! I would recommend this to anyone interested in a great dramatic movie.",

But then to make things even more interesting, he falls for the victims sister. Throughout the movie Terry tries to protect her and do the right thing, while struggling with just what that is. Gatta love anything with Marlon Brando,he does a great job as Terry Mallory. a lot of action in this film too (ex. scene where the car is chasing them down the alley, accidents on the dock etc) but yet you also had the romantic elements too. the ending was very powerful, andat certain parts hard for me to watch. After Terry has done the right thing , and risked everything to set things right and try to disenpower the union bosses, he ends up in a fight with Mr. Friendly. He gets beaten up pretty bad. But he somehow manages to to get up and walk to show the bosses that they are no longer in charge. ITs a very powerful scene. just don't know how to put into words how superb Brando's acting was.

            "content": "We follow the trials and tribulations of an ex-prize fighter, Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), who has been caught up in a world of corruption, in part because of his brother Charlie (Rod Steiger). Charlie has worked for a crooked union boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), who gets a cut of all the nefarious items that come through the ports - but feeds little back to the workers. He keeps the men in line by drip feeding enough work to get them by, and controls them with a heavy hand and the ever present threat of violence if they talk.Tensions are high at the waterfront - men are increasingly more desperate for work. The supply of men is larger than the demand.Joey, a good natured longshoreman, is killed by Johnnies goons for talking to the Waterfront Crime Commission. After his death, his sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint), begins snooping around trying to find leads as to who killed her brother. A local priest, Father Barry (Karl Malden), attempts to appeal to the better nature of the men to come forward and testify, to stand up against the corruption - but the threat of violence is too much for them to come forward.Terry has had to live with being called a \"bum\" and being the punchline of jokes about losing fights - when the reality is he threw the fights he competed in to make money for Johnny.After things become personal for Terry, coupled with his feelings for Edie, and the mounting pressures of Johnnys wrath, Terry takes a leap and stands up to become the man that all the workers needed.The film openly plays with the theme of being \"strong\" and \"silent\". Ratting on someone is seen as a sign of weakness, not solidarity. It exposes the lengths men will go to keep their jobs, or not be seen as standing out from the crowd. The film worked hard at setting Terry up to be that one man who needed to stand up, to break the mould and to put his foot down against corruption.The end of the film is unconventional, more of a symbolic win, rather than an action win, and it feels somewhat underwhelmed due to the violence of the union bosses.The writing was a bit exposition heavy at the start, but did get better - with some very sophisticated lines throughout about the philosophy of good vs evil, and human conscience.There were some really clean shots, and some clear subtext to some of the imagery used - with the use of pigeons, when Terry spoke about hawks preying no pigeons etc.The film won 8 Oscars - Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Marlon Brando), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Eva Marie Saint), Best Director, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing.Definitely worth watching for Lee J Cobb and Marlon Brandos acting.

The film makes use of the waterfront location very well, incorporating vast rooftop shots, dark alleys, and crowded bars. Terry's pursuit of Edie leads him down a righteous path, and he sees, with new eyes, the wrong which is being done. I felt Terry's obsession with his pigeons was somewhat symbolic of the way Terry himself felt; contained and only let free to return again shortly. His birds being killed, followed by his brother, brought about his climactic and exciting rebellion against the dock mob. After He is beaten up, he stumbles to the dock, leading the inspired workers. While he does this the camera cuts to creative POV shots which wobble and blur, emphasizing his battered condition which was an interesting touch to a film filled with great moments.",

If you were in bad favor with the bosses' you were not able to work and then you did not get paid for that day. One man stood up to that when he realized it was wrong and when he fell in love with the sister of the man who died.

Terry Malloy is a sort of defeated man who finds a reason to fight again, and Brando's portrayal of the character was fantastic. My favorite scene is towards the end when Terry is talking to his brother in the back seat of the car. A lot of Terry's true thoughts and feelings about his life and details about his past are revealed in the scene. You learn about the situation with his brother and how he was forced to throw the fight that would have given him a shot at the title. It is an extremely gripping scene and it adds an extra layer of importance to everything that takes place later at the docks. In my opinion there is a kind of dual message in On the Waterfront. One side of the coin deals with Terry and his personal struggles, which has a great message about self-worth and perseverance. On the other hand you have the film's larger message about tyranny and oppression by those in power, which concerns all of the characters in the movie. The two messages kind of culminate together at the end when terry goes to the docks to confront Johnny. During the scene Terry is finally able overcome his issues while at the same time put down the oppressors, which in my opinion helps to give him a sense of importance and value. He becomes more than just some bum in the eyes of the people around him and he earns their respect. The movie is extremely impacting and I think it's one of the best we've seen in class.",

However, since the film was done a low budget, and it contains a lot of political and criminal context, this says something negative about society. The film was so realistic and raw.

In this outstanding Elia Kazan-directed work, Marlon Brando was very adept in acting the part of Terry Malloy, a deposed boxer who had nothing to live for and cared about no one at all, not even himself. He was referred to as a \"bum\", and so he was on the rough New York waterfront run by the union thugs. All he wanted to do was go to work, and sometimes he was even refused that. It was wonderful to see him positively influenced by Edie Doyle; Eva Marie Saint portrayed this part very well, especially in light of the fact that this was her first role. Rod Steiger, noted for playing thugs (or \"apes\")was as mean and as boisterous as ever as Malloy's crooked brother Charley the Gent. Karl Malden did not, I feel, receive enough acclaim as the completely brave priest who would not let anything, not even trash and bottles thrown on him, stop him from frankly telling the \"straight\" workers to stand up and fight. The burly Lee J. Cobb was nothing but mean and loud as the union boss Johnny Friendly. The acting was outstanding. Though the scenery was not at all pretty,...though, in turn, the situation on the waterfront was itself very ugly...the movie was realistic in manifesting the brutality found among the thugs. Yes, toward the end of the movie Brando proved that he was still a contender. The ugly waterfront situation and the character study..;.and the story was centered around both...rendered it a par excellence movie.

My father mentioned to me how good \"Waterloo\" was, a film about Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat which starred Rod Steiger\u2014and yes Rod Steiger! I didn't even notice him playing as Charley! Marlon Brando's older brother. Nevertheless the film was a real hit. The story is very substantiated, simple and good, and has its brilliant depths. Take for example the character of Marlon Brando. He's a kid, a confused kid, stupid, bum but he has guts, courage and will, and Brando had portrayed that very well. The film didn't only fascinated me with its story per se. The drama, crime, romance and wits are balanced. The characters were also simply structured. You kind of hate them like Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), kind of laugh at them like Father Barry (Karl Malden) and kind of confused like Terry and Charley (Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger).

It seems to me that a director with such high acclaim and so many wonderful films, must be a master craftsman. But I just don't see it at all. With On the Waterfront, in particular, his directing style seems awfully stagnant; there's really nothing to it. And really, the wonderful storyline must be extracted by the audience, we're not really treated to it, like in the works of other greats of the time.Obviously this film is best remembered for Marlon Brando's staggering performance (I coulda bin a contender), and this really is him at his very best. His performance is raw, human emotion, and it is undeniably one of the greatest acting jobs ever done. Eva Marie Saint never looked better than in this film and the supporting cast, including the great Rod Steiger and Karl Malden, does a fine job. And yet the movie never comes alive.I felt through both this film and East of Eden that Kazan has at his disposal some of the greatest stories ever told (the least being a Steinbeck) and some of the greatest acting talent of all time, and does nothing with it. On the Waterfront's story is slow and unemotional at times, and you never really get the impression of how the plot is moving along, where are the major developments or is this all just one stream of consciousness.

The film is bleak and gritty, a study of both human evil and human decency. It shows us the terrible mob dealings on a waterfront, that prevent anyone outside the mob's inner workings from getting the light work, or a decent days wage. The characters are brilliant and engrossing. Karl Malden plays a preacher who is very much beyond the simple, weak man f God. He is strong and just. Lee J. Cobb plays Mobster Johnny Friendly, who in one character spans all degrees of evil, from greed to murderous revenge. Eva Marie Saint is possibly the weakest of the main characters as the love interest, but considering this was her first film, she's remarkably well versed and played. Rod Steiger defies all logic in that, as the brother, he manages to further, and in some places better, the man I'm about to discuss. Brando gives not only the performance of his, but all our lifetimes. As Mob Muscle and Longshoreman Terry Malloy, Brando acts dumb, violent and ultimately, beautiful. His performance is frequently cited as cinema's best ever, and there's little to deny that. He is more realistic than most real people, and his performance almost eclipses the entire film. That it doesn't is simply because the film is so unbelievably good to begin with. And by the way, I cried when he said \"I Coulda Been A Contender.\"",

In the scene, Terry yells \"You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it.

In one scene, after Terry is beaten up the camera switches to Terry's point of view and actually copies Terry's wobbly moments as he's walking. The directing of the scene's really displays Terry's determination and struggle to get to where he needed to be. Kazan also uses great exuberant sound score that defines the scenes greatly. The plot itself is terrific and really makes a huge portion of the film so great. The intricate twist and turns make the film exciting but the dialogue and the actions of the characters control the film to where it has just the right amount of everything. The drama also incorporates great action and romance scenes. Con(s): One con that does somewhat hurt the film would be the long dragging moments. The beginning is definitely at first a tiny bit boring but thats understandable considering the beginning is like an introduction to the main characters. Overall the plot, acting, directing, and sound are all 10 out of 10 but the dragging moments makes this film an 8/10 instead of a perfect score. No matter what, it's still a great film that I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Meet Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando): ex-boxer, longshoreman, and witness to a murder. His local union is ruled with an iron fist by Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). He baited one of his fellow dock workers up to the roof of his building, where he was thrown to his death. He has no conscience, no morals, no guilt. He survives by doing what he is told to do and keeping his mouth shut.But he falls for the deceased's sister Edie (Eva Marie Saint), who transforms him into a human being capable of doing the right thing. She is the strongest character in the film, the first to be willing to take on the mobbed-up union boss. She turns to Father Barry (Karl Malden), who holds a meeting to try to encourage anyone with any knowledge of the crime to say something. Frequently referring to Christ, he asked, What would Jesus do? fifty years before it en vogue.The most memorable scene is, of course, the scene in the cab with Terry and his brother--and Johnny's right hand--Charley \"the Gent\" (Rod Steiger). Terry, talking about his shattered dream of boxing, laments, \"I coulda been a contender... instead of a bum.\" It is a line that is still quoted over 50 years later.Despite the terrific supporting performances (Cobb, Malden, and Steiger were all nominated for Oscars), Brando still had to carry the movie, and he did perfectly.Winner: Best picture, director (Elia Kazan), actor (Brando), supporting actress (Saint), screenplay, score.",

This film won best picture in 1954, which isn't surprising when you have Marlon Brando as the main star; he's best known decades later in The Godfather(1972). My only nitpicks with this film is that occasionally the music can be overly obnoxious and could be a struggle to hear what the people are saying. But, in a lot of cases the use of overly dramatic sounds can be in the movie's favor. This could be in the scene where Terry runs to see Edie; it's revealing something in the priest's point of view and you could hardly hear what they say at parts. That may be one of my favorite parts! Also, the end is well done and perfectly shot. Plus it has a lot of quotable lines like: \"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it.\" When this personally isn't one of my all time favorite classics, it still is a masterpiece. I give this movie a: 9.6/10=10/10 overall",

What I liked about this film, is that no one died at the end. Although Brando's character, Terry, walks \"with the cross\", in a Jesus style, he doesn't die, and become a mortar. And on the other side, the bad guy, Johnny Friendly, isn't killed for his crimes. He's just pushed away.This movie is a message movie, against organized crime and mobs. How a person should listen to his conscience. However, I think the Christian - \"Jesus is with you\" talk was way over the line.The most remembered scene is the scene in the car, where Terry's brother tries to convince Terry to work for the mob and not testify for the police. The acting there was truly touching.As an animal rights activist, I hope that the scenes with the dead pigeons were made with dummies and not real dead pigeons.8/10",

Working with a monster like Elia Kazan, one might expect nothing but excellence; yet Marlon Brando was above any direction on the set. A documentary of Kazan's splendid career shows him with Marlon. Advising, apparently, how the upcoming scene was to be played.A spoiler coming up: You can see the actor's eyes glaze over. Nobody instructed him. Talking to Brando was useless. The inner \"method\" just went on auto-pilot and it was faultless. When brought to bear on such a terrific script, he could only be pure dynamite. And Waterfront was the Brando script above all others.We must remember; he made a boatload of turkeys too. But here, and in Streetcar or Viva Zapata, he was in the ZONE.I'm not dazzled by his acting in The Godfather as much as in this role. The Godfather for me was Al Pacino's triumph.Recently I once more watched On The Waterfront. Brando is still exciting even after all these long years. Surprisingly, I had to realize that in this film, with all his mannerisms, he had so stolen the movie that Eva Marie Saint's remarkably skilled performance was almost buried under Brando's. At least for me, and I suspect many others. Her part got less direct attention despite being every bit as important in the story. Now I realized what a great actress she always was. I believe this was Eva Marie's greatest role too!It was the property, of course, which raised Marlon Brando to his career-best. He never made another film so deserving of honors. Not in Desiree as Napoleon, Guys And Dolls as Sky, nor the other lesser titles. Maybe closer in Zapata or Streetcar Named Desire. Yet they weren't real vehicles for him, nor was Vito Corleone. This was a marvelous story and gave him his best part: Terry Malloy, in On The Waterfront.",

Not only was the film itself great, but the cinematography was exceptional and so was Marlon Brando's performance. This film lived up to all my expectations and all the good things I have heard about it. Brando did an amazing job standing up for what he believed in to not \"rat\" on his friends and to stay neutral. As the audience, you could see his internal conflicts without him saying a word and just by the look on his face. To go along with Brando's exceptional performance, the cinematography added to how great this film really is.This was filmed on location on the docks and it really worked because it made this film more believable than it was filmed on a set. The establishing shot of the film to show the docks set the mood for the film. There were many memorable shots throughout the film. For instance, the one that stuck out in my mind was how powerful the ending shot was when Brando walked back up the docks to get to the warehouse and how people would only go back to work unless he did. There was not much conversation, but it did not need it because the shot was powerful enough. Like I had stated previously, I would love to see this film again so I can appreciate this film even more.",

Marlon Brando plays the main character Terry Malloy, a aspiring prize fighter, who's life turns upside down when he witnesses the murder of his best friend in the crime field, mob run waterfront docks. Adding to the mix a reverent and a best friends sister, terry has to choose whom his loyalties lie with, his brother and the mob, or the girl and justice. Simply by just watching just the scene I took the quote earlier from, with superb writing by Budd Shulberg and powerfully captivating, yet masterly controlled performance by Brando, you can see why the film ranks as the 8th greatest film by AFI and with 12 Oscar nominations trailing behind- I don't think anyone in the world would disagree with Elia Kazan's master piece, rightly so Oscar for best directors, especially in the backdrop of a series of political controversy.",

            "review_title": "No Film Has Influenced Me More Than This Kazan Masterpiece",
            "content": "This film follows the story of Terry Malloy, played by the excellent Marlon Brando in his prime. Terry is an ex-prizewinning boxer who now works as a longshoreman for the mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly. Terry's brother Charlie is Friendly's right hand man and because of this, Terry happens to accidentally get involved in the murder of his friend Joey Doyle. Terry begins to become conflicted about testifying against Friendly once he is given the chance and overall questioning the entire nature of the union, all while falling in love with Doyle's younger sister Edie, played by Eva Marie Saint.The great Elia Kazan directs the film beautifully. Kazan is very well known for his films that discuss many social and political issues; he did so with Gentleman's Agreement in 1947, and later did so to a lesser extent with films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and East of Eden. However in many ways, On the Waterfront shows itself to discuss an issue that appears much more personal to Kazan than any other film he has ever done. The film, in a broad sense, discusses various themes of social corruption among a community. While this is not a literal issue that Kazan had went through, it is very representative of an issue Kazan had went through with the House Committee of Un-American Activities in 1952. Kazan was a former communist and once he left the communist party, he began to feel shame and also a bit cheated after he realized the nature of the party. Afterwards he was a pretty strict anti-communist, and when the committee asked him to identify fellow former communists, he did so. Kazan was highly criticized for this and it caused him to lose many friends in the film industry. The reason he was so hated by some for this was because this was the time of the Cold War and the United States was incredibly anti-communist and they were starting to blacklist certain people who identified with the Communist party, this included filmmakers. So not only did Kazan cause many of these people to be discriminated against because of their political beliefs, but many careers were also ruined because of this. On the Waterfront is widely regarded as being Kazan's response to this criticism and his feelings towards the Communist party, and this is what causes the film to be one of Kazan's most personal films.Given knowledge of the back-story, some scenes in the film feel like Kazan is directly talking to the audience and confessing his opinions on what he did. Towards the end of the film and after Terry has testified against Johnny Friendly in court, nobody on the waterfront besides Edie and Father Barry will talk to him as they all view him as a traitor. Later as he tries to go back to the docks to work, he is denied it. He then goes over to Friendly's dock and yells for him to come outside. When Friendly comes outside, the two begin to yell at each other in argument and Terry says \"You think you're God almighty, but you know what you are? You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinkin' mug! And I'm glad what I done to you! Ya hear that? I'm glad what I done\". It is in these words that the viewer begins to get the feeling that Kazan is talking directly to the people who criticized him for his decision. Kazan directs the film with an incredible amount of passion for the subject matter, and this is very evident when you watch the piece itself.One of the strongest points of this film is one that is incredibly strong in all of Kazan's films, the performances by the actors. While it can be attached to being because of Kazan, the reason the performances in his films are so strong is because he actually does not give them an immense amount of directions and rather gives them freedom to do what they want. This is clear in many ways, from the way he casts his actor by not having a screen test but rather going out to dinner with them, getting to know them personally, and, what appears most in his films, the camera angles. Many directors will have a lot of complex camera angles during even the simplest dialogue scene, but Kazan does not do this, as doing too many angles leads to cutting too much and causing the actors to constantly break character. What Kazan does, and one scene in particular that stands out, is he simply places the camera in a certain spot and leaves it, giving the actors more freedom to control the scene. The one scene in the film that most stands out because of this is the scene where Terry and Edie are walking in the park after leaving the church. The camera is placed diagonally from them and simply pulls back as they walk. The scene goes on for many minutes and the camera does not break this entire time. Kazan does not control his actors or make them work by his standards, but he simply gives them the scene.The scenes between Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint are some of the most beautiful scenes between two characters in any film. The two appear to have very open and honest chemistry with each other. The way the two of them look at each other, talk to each other, and the mannerisms they have when talking, shows a sense of shyness towards the other in both of them that best communicates their feelings toward one another in a non verbal sense. The fact that Brando and Saint were in no way romantically involved during the making of this film just further demonstrates their incredible talents. These scenes are what show the true nature of their characters, and is an example of truly beautiful acting.",

This entire film gave me the same feeling that watching the wire season to give me. It gives a look into a world that somebody coming from the Midwest really doesn't understand especially somebody coming from our times. Mommy asleep familiar with blue-collar working worlds but not the sense that you show up to your work every day hoping to or not to Get a shift. And with this system is taken advantage of by the mob who forces the union workers to take out loans which in turn means they have to pay a vig, It creates a corrupt system. Overall definitely worth a watch makes me very happy to have a stable job or at least up until this point have had stable job throughout most of my life because this is certainly not a system I would like to compete in.

            "review_title": "A Contender...for the most powerful film ever made!",
            "content": "For years, I've been hearing what a great actor Marlon Brando is. And in my 29 years on this earth, I've only seen two of his movies: \"Superman The Movie\" and \"The Godfather\". But a few months ago, I finally decided to check out one of Brando's \"classic\" films. I bought, without having ever seen before, \"On The Waterfront\". And I can tell you, as a passionate film viewer, I was not disappointed. Now I know what the film critics, historians, actors, and movie fans have already known since forever: Marlon Brando is a GREAT actor and \"On the Waterfront\" is a great movie.The story is fairly simple and straightforward: Based off of a series of news exposes on the Mafia's control of New York's Longshoremans Union, the film tells the story of Terry Malloy (Brando), a once promising prize fighter reduced to working on the docks and occasionally working for the mob's front man on the docks, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb). It's while working as an enforcer for Friendly that Malloy inadvertently sets up a friend and fellow dock worker to be killed. Although Malloy is used to violence and death and generally dismisses such matters with a shrug, this time is different. Malloy wasn't told the guy was to be killed. And thus begins Malloy's rift with Friendly. That rift is further helped by his growing relationship to the dead guy's sister, Eve (Eva Marie Saint in her film debut) and the efforts of a crusading Catholic Priest Father Barry(Karl Malden). But Malloy is finding hard to quit Friendly's outfit...especially since his big brother Charlie (Rod Stieger) is one of Friendly's top men.While the story in and of itself is straightforward, the film is anything but that. All of the characters are layered with great depth. There are no cardboard cutouts in this film. Every character is well rounded with a sense of who they are, where they came from, and why they are the way they are. And although the film's setting lends to the notion of an \"epic\" film, it's intimacy in staging scenes, especially long dialog scenes, makes it feel like an \"Indie\" flick.Every lead actor has a chance to shine. Karl Malden's scene as Father Barry giving a sermon over the corpse of a dead dockworker and Lee J. Cobb's rant about how he worked his way up from the docks is just as powerful as the now legendary \"Contender\" scene between Brando and Stieger. (Go to the trivia section of this film. When you learn what went on while that scene was being shot...you'll be even more amazed) And Eva Marie Saint is no slouch, either. Unlike most leading ladies, she's not there for the scenery. She's just as compelling as Brando and the rest.Speaking of the \"Contender\" scene...It is a very powerful moment though it didn't effect me as it should have. It's not that I think the scene is over-rated, it's just that every time somebody does a piece on Marlon Brando on TV, they always show that scene. So although I've never seen the movie until now, I pretty well knew that scene by heart. If I do have a gripe about the film (Even 10 out of 10 star movies aren't TOTALLY perfect), it's a minor one. I felt the music score was a little too intrusive at times (particullarly in a scene between Brando and Saint). But that's my only gripe. And if that's it, that oughta tell you something...This IS a GREAT movie.Now...I'll have to go watch \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"The Wild One\" now that I'm discovering Brando's true greatness.",

            "content": "I have known about this film for decades, have always seen snippets and scenes. I only saw the whole thing recently. The acting, particularly by Brando, was amazing. Beyond that, I was underwhelmed and was surprised this film has so often been deemed the best in cinema.First, the whole background of the film leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Kazan reportedly made this film as a response to the Crucible by Arthur Miller, on literal and figurative witch hunts. This was Kazan's way of justifying naming names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). So, let's see now, we have the character of Terry reporting corrupt and criminal activity including murder compared to Kazan participating in the irrational hysteria that even implicated Lucille Ball. It makes his actions all the more absurd.And then we have the film itself: Yes, Brando gives a legendary performance. But everything is set up in such a predictable way. We are told 1001 times that there is to be a comparison with Christ. Hoisting priest Karl Maldon up towards the heavens is not heavy-handed enough. We also need to be told that crucifixions can happen everywhere! It gets to be pretty obvious and contrived.And then we have the plot, kind of silly in itself: So these smart yet evil mob bosses throw this guy off a roof because there was a risk he could talk - so, um, what do they do? Involve this inexperienced, naive worker in their latest murder plot. They have no problem sending someone up to kill the pigeons later in the movie, so why does Terry need to \"lure out\" this Joey guy anyway? As they show elsewhere in the film, they could just kill him anywhere or arrange an accident at work. Why involve this guy Terry when you have no idea how he will react?And it turns out that, even if its hard, you really should report corrupt people who create miserable working conditions and murder people, especially your brother and especially if you want to make time with the dead guy's hot sister. It's the right thing to do! Um, duh! And it's all set for the hero to get the instant affection of the pretty blonde. Meanwhile, all of the oppressed long shore men hardly utter a word of support for Terry until the bitter end - they are all so afraid. So for most of the film, it is the world vs. Terry + pretty blonde.So somehow, we meander to the big ending, where Terry is the Christ-like martyr who shows back up at the docks demanding work or rights of the workers or some such thing. It's not entirely clear what he really wants except to call out the evil union boss. (Conveniently, all the union bosses are a bit heavy, so easy-breasy stereotype). He takes his big walk from the docks, followed by all of the other workers, now willing to be fired or at least lose a days pay. And that's about it.Not to diminish the great acting in this film. It is worth a watch just for that. The famous taxi scene is amazing and worth seeing the film.But the story, the characters are quite predictable.And how strange that this movie has been adopted as the poster child of evil unions by conservatives. Yes, corrupt union leaders where the villains in this film. But guess what, the same story could happen with an evil government, or an evil corporation. You could do the same story at Apple Computer in China. What many conservatives don't get is that this film is more a condemnation of BAD unions and corrupt leaders. At the end of the film, one of the workers says, \"Maybe we can get the union back...\" See, they want a union, just not a corrupt one. And the other point is the power of all of the workers as a collective. It took one man to get things rolling but the group who had the ultimate power to demand change. A lot more pro-union than many realize.",

            "content": "Director Elia Kazan's harsh portrait of a monopolized Cleveland lake front and its beleaguered dock workers is just as good today as it was the first time I watched it, and as I'm sure it was when it was released in 1954. When ex prize fighter Terry, portrayed by the one and only Marlon Brando is given a cushy job inside the warehouse by corrupt Union boss Johnny Friendly, expertly portrayed by Lee J. Cobb. largely because his brother 'Charlie the Gent' Another outstanding performance by Rod Stieger, is in tight with Friendly and his gang of mob toughs. But Terry begins to have an attack of conscience after he unwittingly arranges the murder of acquaintance Joey Doyle at the the hands of Friendly's ruffians. His situation is further clouded when he runs into a sympathetic priest ( Reuniting Brando with his old friend Karl Malden ) and the sister of the murdered Joey, Edie ( Portrayed by Eve Marie Saint in her stunning screen debut ) Although there's plenty of action and Brando is usually remembered for his famous 'I could have been a contender' scene opposite Stieger, the most fascinating scenes to me occur between Brando as the unrefined Terry and Saint as the parochial Edie. The dialogue between the two, which starts out as sort of a teasing banter, and grows more serious at a pace perfectly commanded by master director Kazan. Is realistic and spaced nicely. At one point early in the film Terry says 'I bet you don't remember me do you?' Saint replies with the perfectly delivered line. 'I remember the first time I ever saw you.' At that exact second, a note from the musical score kicks in to enhance the scene. This is an exact imitation of the early moments of a love relationship. Although the story of the dock workers fighting for their rights at the risk of their very lives is compelling, This is one of the most dynamic love stories in the history of cinema, Their love seemingly appears out of nowhere and beats incredible odds to persevere. As Terry's character tries not to buckle under or succumb from the pressure of each conflicting side. There is plenty off other good work from the rest of the cast, Cobb has some comical lines as the overbearing and ruthless Johnny Friendly. And Malden is a stalwart as always as the workingman friendly clergymen. But the film belongs to Brando, who finally received the Oscar after incredulously being denied the prize for his amazing performance in 'Streetcar Named Desire' And of course director Kazan who's stark black and white scenes were managed flawlessly and coordinated seamlessly with both the actors and the tender musical score. There is not one frame out of place, or one thing I would have changed about this film. A timeless and touching American icon. As good as you've heard. 10 out of a possible 10 T.H.",

Other's might have been great and still more will be.. But there's just something ONLY about him..For me..Marlon Brando has always been the ultimate Male. Simply put, bruiting desire. Brando represents the very definition of method acting, even though he was said to have hated the phrase. Being able to reach inside yourself and pull something out that kicks everyone in the ass. He was truly ONE of a kind. They say sometimes..Beautiful people are born under a dark cloud..I think Brando was born under a rain of thunderbolts..He was Powerful..Beautiful..and tragic..On The Waterfront is basically a Showcase for Brando. Everything coming together..This film is truly one for the ages.And Marlon Brando..He Is KING OF ACTING..This amazing film DEFINITELY Should Be HIGHER in the Top 250 i think somewhere between #35 - #55 (I never get it..why \"Ranging Bull\" Rate Higher then this film)..really CAN'T UNDERSTAND!!!!! \"On The Waterfront\" deserved to win The Best Picture for 54' and Wins..And Marlon Brando took the Oscar..this Film Made A New Records..after all this film is so Truly Powerful and so DEEP..More Then The \"Rangin Bull\" That's FOR SURE..(I Think A Lot of people agree with me there)..that the RATING for This Classic It's Just WRONG..and little LOW..Really..Put it where he should and HAVE TO Be..on The Top of 8.3 Rate at least check this out and please.. Fix It..#83 It Isn't the Right Place for this Classic.Sorry about the English..i'm from Israel..this film is Awesome and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" Also..GREAT!! \"The Godfather\"..the most Impressing Marlon Brando or any actor performance EVER..

The theme to this movie is how sometimes you have to stand up for yourself and tell the truth, even if it means putting your life on the line. The acting on each characters part was great, and the movie had many different aspects of editing. For example, the dissolving effect was used many times to transition from scene to scene, and the use of ellipses were also used a couple of times during the movie.The level of realism is something that I question. Though in the movie Terry tells the truth about the corruption in his union, his \"friends\" get mad at him and start to ignore him, but when Terry fought the man in charge and walked away from it, everything seemed to be resolved because he proved he wasn't a bum. In real life, I don't think that someone like Terrry would be as lucky. Many people in real life that tell the truth who are in a gang or some other type of corruption, many times they get killed in the end. The movie itself, however, is still one of the best I've ever seen.",

Terry Malloy's brother, Charley, is the one that killed Edie's brother. Charley is the mob bosses right hand man and is hung to get back at Terry for going to the police. The priest in this story helps to get people together and organized to fight the mob. He takes his duty at the church and brings them to the streets. The moral of this movie is a very moving one and can related to many times in history such as WWII to always tell people what is going on instead of remaining silent. Elia Kazan had a free reign over the film, which otherwise could have gone wrong under someone else's direction.",

            "content": "This movie combines good performances with a very powerful mise-en-scene. Some scenes contain a certain amount of fog to give the viewer more of a sense that there is more area there than just what is in the framing. The sound is very quiet when needed and it is loud where it needs to be loud. The first half of the movie has almost no non diagetic sound, but the second half gradually increases the dramatic music as the situation gets more crazy. Sound effects are used to help tell very small parts of the story that happen off screen like someone throwing a piece of paper.The movie tells the story of a forbidden romance that is birthed from tragedy because of the protagonist's guilt concerning a crime that he helped commit unknowingly while working with organized crime. A good amount of characters in the movie are easy to empathize with and the people who can't be empathized with are interesting and well rounded to make up for it. The protagonist is a very realistic character with a lot of flaws, but not enough to annoy the viewer away from caring. Like Stallone in Rocky, Brando creates a simpleton character who isn't the brightest but knows what is right and tries to get past obstacles to make a good life for himself, but Brando's character is working towards a good life that is good because he doesn't have to worry about doing bad acts.Camera angles like one showing two people through what is clearly a window make the viewer feel like they are looking into someone else's life more than they would without the outside window view.The movie is very compelling and it should appeal to many adults. The end might draw tears. It's a good movie for anyone who like crime dramas or Marlon Brando's cute and manly looks.",

            "content": "From the first scene, it is easy to see that he is caught in the middle of a difficult situation. Terry Malloy has joined the corruption that plagues his workplace; the docks of New York. Each day as he stands in the group of men wanting to work that day on the waterfront, he is falling victim to the corrupt bosses running the docks. As his brother is a member of the head boss' inner circle, Terry is caught in this situation. He has helped in the murder of a man who knew too much, and he didn't want it to be this way. Unlike his brother, Terry's moral compass is better calibrated, and he soon decides that he needs to end the exploitation of the workers on the waterfront. While on his journey, he meets Edie; the sister of the man that Terry helped kill. From his first glance, he has loved her; however, Edie is unaware of his dark past at first, and once she finds out, she stands right alongside Terry. Finally mustering up the courage, Terry engages the bosses face-to-face.My Thoughts In almost every list or countdown of the best performances by an actor in a movie, the performance of Terry Malloy by Marlon Brando is at or near the top. Why is that? If you watch this film, you won't see any huge, overly-dramatic scenes. What you will see is professional actors that don't need huge shouting matches or dramatic soliloquies in order to make their character's emotions felt. Brando delivers a subtlety to his role that takes his performance to that stature that it's at. Even in the famous \"I could have been a contender\" scene, it's Brando's and Steiger's understated expressions and body language that take us deeper into the situation and emotions felt in the taxi. This film is a great representation of how it takes one courageous individual in order to topple corruption or injustice. Although he is relatively quiet, Terry is the one man brave enough to take a stand against Johnny Friendly and his bosses. Throughout the story, we see numerous people killed by prearranged \"accidents\" intended to shut up a witness willing to testify against the bosses, and Terry sees these events as well. Once the final straw is pulled, Terry can't take it anymore. In the supporting cast around Brando are some great performances. Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as the malevolent Johnny Friendly, Rod Steiger plays a small (yet important) role as Terry's brother Charlie, and Eva Marie Saint is magnificent as Edie. One \"fun fact\" that makes the actress' performance even more impressive is that this was her very first film appearance.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com",

Watching Brando portray the very complex and guilt ridden yet very in love Terry Malloy made me appreciate his acting skills even more so. You could just see that he was lost in the character and it made the movie very believable. Steiger's Charley Malloy and Saint's Edie also played their characters quite well. A viewer could get the idea that Charley was both loyal to his brother and Friendly, which put him in a big predicament, and ultimately set the tone for the rest of the movie. I really enjoyed the way that the movie was made to seem like it was very dark throughout, with the fog used a lot, and the darkness of the shots. Even something as ugly as docks looked beautifully haunting with the editing and cinematography. I also liked learning about what director Elia Kazan was going through during the time, having to stand trial and name names to HUAC (House of UnAmerican Activities Committee), which seemed to be put into the plot of the movie, when Terry needs to testify against Friendly in front of the Crime Commission. All in all, this is a wonderful mob classic, that everyone, Brando fan or not, should watch.",

With the possible exception of THE GODFATHER, no other film has inspired multitudes of people into becoming actors, screenwriters, and directors. Just the backseat taxicab scene alone with Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger served as a training ground in acting classes. And to further illustrate how much reverence the script has earned, in RAGING BULL, a washed up Jake La Motta stands before his dressing room mirror reciting dialogue from ON THE WATERFRONT.As with any great work of art, there is a dark side, and it involves Elia Kazan. A brilliant director on both stage and screen, Kazan's leftist politics eventually got him subpoenaed to testify before the House un-American Activities Committee that was rooting out communists real and imaginary. His naming of names made him a pariah in Hollywood's liberal community, and some actors -not enoughas far as I'm concerned- flat out refused to work with him again.Screenwriter Budd Schulberg was also a friendly witness to the committee, and many in the industry felt that ON THE WATERFRONT was Kazan's justification for being an informer, an act he eventually admitted to towards the end of his life. To his dying day, Kazan remained a polarizing figure in Hollywood.Kazan further damaged his credibility when it came to casting the male lead. Frank Sinatra originally agreed to play Terry Malloy, but when Marlon Brando found himself unexpectedly available, Kazan broke his verbal pact with Sinatra and gave Brando the part. The role of Edie Doyle was offered to Grace Kelly, who declined in order to work with Hitchcock on REAR WINDOW. Eva Marie Saint, an actress with background in stage and television, was hired to make her silver screen debut as Edie.",

            "content": "A superb movie, reflecting the reality of life without Love (and Law)!I watched this revealing story with my wife and children, and wondered how people survived in those days when law was hijacked by thugs - in this case, the \"union leaders\" motivated by greed. Watch this movie and you'll appreciate what courage is, and what real religious conviction can do in a society full of strife and corruption. Thugs can intimidate people with death, but if life on earth is only a passage then such intimidation will lose its hold on people. Father Barry (Karl Malden) played a key roll in this story, quite unlike modern flicks that put priests (or any religious character) in a comic (or despicable) light. Faced with ruthless blood shedding, only a person with true convictions, such as Father Barry, will have something meaningful to say to the bystanders.  Karl gave a very persuasive performance for his role as a priest. I enjoyed it very much.Another transforming power in this world is love.  Terry (Marlon Brando)was transformed in this story from being a thug to a brave testimony on the witness stand against the union leaders, under the guidance of Father Barry and influenced by the love of Edie (Eva Marie Saint, her first and award winning movie appearance) whose brother he had helped kill earlier.  What a picture that shows \"Love is stronger than Hate.\"  Edie threw away hate to embrace love for Terry is one truly beautiful image on silver screen that will linger in my memory for ever.  The whole movie can be summarized by Father Barry's words beside a fallen (murdered) dock worker that if we do not love our fellow citizens instead of killing them, we are crucifying Christ anew and are not worthy to be called Christians.  A world can only be built on love, laid out by the Golden Rule that Christ gave us - Love thy neighbors as thy self, and do unto others as thou wouldst others do unto you.  In the absence of such Love, Law needs to take its place, and in the absence of Law, mess or anarchy ensues.",

It is a display of two of the greatest performances ever committed to film. It is powerful and full of emotion and raw energy. The way it is shot by Kazan and by the exchange between two of the greatest method actors of their time. This scene is also the pivotal point in the picture, we find out so much about these two characters, their past and their future. Here Brando explains his frustration with his brother and his brother's line of work. It has cost him his future, and he is forced to realize the painful truth; he is a bum. Steiger is equally good in this scene, here he makes a desperate plea to his brother, a plea that if not headed could mean the end of both of their lives, near the end of the scene you can see Steiger has made peace with the fact that he has failed in persuading his brother and that he is now a dead man.Apart from that scene, this film is filled with memorable scenes and performances in one of the greatest crime dramas of all time. It is gritty, realistic, moody and vibrant. The movie moves at a good pace, never getting too far ahead of itself and allowing the viewer to enjoy the story and the development of the action and the characters. In short this film is about the redemption of one man, Terry Malloy (Brando). He has made some poor choices in his life. Most of them stem from his association with his brother, who is a member of the mafia that controls the longshoreman union. He cannot fault his brother though as he has been everything to him, and done everything for him. But soon he realizes that he could have been more, much more, \"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender\". But his brother has held him back, and now he is faced with the decision to side with his brother or do the right thing and ultimately sacrifice his life and his brother's life. Complicating his choice, is the feelings he has for a beautiful girl, Edie (Eva Marie Saint). She makes him second guess his misplaced and self imposed isolation. Not isolated from people, but from himself and the truth. It is a fascinating journey we are taken on, through the trials and tribulations of Terry Malloy. He is on a journey whether or not he knows it, a journey to become a respectable human being, and we have front row seats.Overall 10 out of 10, excellent film. Needless to say the performances are amazing. Kazan's direction is brilliant and the film still oozes with suspense, excitement, emotion and a very satisfying finale!",

Much of the films popularity may be due to the fact that Terry's yearning to break free of Johnny Friendly is something inherent in all of us. We all have Johnny Friendly's in our lives at some point and we suffer a lack of self respect if we do not stand tall and breaking free of him. I think the final scenes in this movie are so satisfying for that reason. Lee J Cobbs portrayal of this suffocating entity is a masterpiece.

The film was given little chance of success, critics claimed the story was of no real interest. Whilst  Kazan was himself not popular among directors in the industry after he informed on them for corrupt practises hence the conclusion many have reached in believing \"On the Waterfront\" was made to justify and defend Kazan's own actions. Despite this troubled pre-production period \"On the Waterfront\" went on to become one of the greatest and most critically aclaimed films ever made. The success was due to a combination of factors, brilliant acting, memorable scenes and emotional directing from Kazan.The film saw the third Kazan-Brando collaboration which had seen previous fruition in the 1951 production of Tennesse Williams play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" . Again the most lasting impression of \"On the Waterfront\" like Streetcar is Brando's performance. The film itself is about a longshoreman and ex-prize fighter who confronts the corrupt labour leaders who effectively run the dockers  lives, in an attempt to expose their criminal practises. The film was hard hitting and controvesial in the subjects it dealt with such as racketeering and socialism and was wrongly accused of promoting communism and being anti American by unionists at the time. The film was shot in New Jersey and in black and white giving the film an authentic oppressed look and adding to the intensity of its subject. In the end the film was a huge hit with audiences and won eight acadamy awards. If you have never seen this film I would highly recommend thet you do so. \"On the Waterfront\" is a masterpiece of film making and it also  contains possibly the best performance given by any actor ever in Marlon Brando's subtle and at the same time spectacular performance as Terry Maloy.

Instead this seems to be a lot more like Marty(1955) which is really just two awkward people having an awkward relationship that is inherently realistic. The black and white cinematography casts the poverty ridden waterfront in a documentary like style similar to that of Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Leonard Bernstein was kicking it into high gear when he decide to temporarily step down from orchestrating for symphonies and score On the Waterfront. Specifically his them titled 'Walk and End Title' is particularly beautiful. Combined with the brilliance of Elia Kazan's directing and you have one of the single greatest films ever made.",

Although there were a couple of scenes where the music didn't seem to fit with what one was seeing (and that's usually something very rare in any movie, no matter if it's good or really bad).L.J. Cobb and Karl Malden were brilliant, as usual, but the performance that the striking and young Marlon Brando awards us with overshadows anyone, and I mean anyone, because the overall acting was great.I mean... you could make a duck direct a movie and with Marlon Brando in it, it would be watchable.But looking at this film in a more general manner, it just isn't one of the \"great ones\", I really don't know how it managed to get 8 Oscars (not saying it didn't deserve a couple...), and I'm pretty sure it won't last for long in my memory.It's a not too memorable story burnished with some magnificent acting: watchable, sure; enjoyable, of course; more than an 8/10 and 8 Oscars? oh my no...",

He spoke of the crucification,talked about souls,and yet he did not quote God's 6th Commandment,Thou Shalt Not Kill.Even though this was not a religious film there was still a religious character in it.Who spoke of God and Christ,but never quoted God's 8th Commandment,Thou Shalt Not Steal,which the mob was doing from these union workers The movie could've been more powerful if it were mentioned some of God's Commandments.",

            "review_title": "A Triumph of the Human Spirit",
            "content": "Marlon Brando is one of the most recognized and appreciated screen legends in cinema history. Performances like his as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront earned him such a notable distinction. In his fine portrayal of a former prize fighter down on his luck and stuck under the wing of the mob, Brando takes his character through an intense range of emotions. He captures everything about the human condition perfectly. Brando guides the viewer through his internal predicament, and he makes the audience feel as if it is going through the same turmoil he faces during the film.On the Waterfront is as much about human choices, inner conflict, and individual bravery as any film I've ever seen. It truly displays the mindset of a person who faces a crucial and impossible choice. Terry Malloy faces the mob on one hand and his conscience on the other. The problem arises when Malloy is part of a set up that ends in the death of a respected young man in the community. Out of the aftermath comes his sister, Edie, who becomes a romantic interest of Terry. The two opposing interests weigh heavily on him during the film, but with the unyielding and harsh guidance of Fr. Barry, played wonderfully by Karl Malden, Terry convinces himself that he must stand up to the ruthless crime boss Johnny Friendly, as portrayed by the always outgoing Lee J. Cobb. His transformation from a loyal underling to a determined citizen set to right the wrong done in the beginning of the film is remarkable to say the least.As he is pulled in different directions during the film, Malloy is confronted with his religion, his conscience, and his code of honor. He is also faced with losing what little he has in the form of his mob connection through his brother. Coming clean will mean putting his brother in jeopardy and ostracizing himself from the entire waterfront community. Terry must summon all his courage in order to go before a court and publicly defame Johnny Friendly for killing the young man Doyle.With Fr. Barry and Edie in the background, Terry is pulled in the direction of testifying against Johnny. In the famous exchange with his brother in the car, Terry comes to grips with the fact that his brother is not necessarily the family he needed during his life. Understanding this, Terry comes to the conclusion that his brother is to blame for his losses as a boxer. The mob's influence cost him his shot at a title and the chance for him to make a name for himself. Terry decides he will go against his brother and against Johnny and testify the next day. However, the mob strikes first.Johnny gets Charley and kills him, putting Terry's brother on display for him to find. After escaping from a car racing towards them, Malloy and Edie find Charley. This enrages the embattled Terry and makes him even more determined to bring down the mighty mob boss. In the courtroom, Terry lets loose and puts everything in the open regarding Johnny and his role in Doyle's death.In the final chapter, Terry goes down to the waterfront one last time, refusing to back away from the conflict he has created. He calls out to Johnny and causes him to come out of his office, producing a ferocious fight between the two. Friendly's goons come to the rescue and beat down the former boxer. The community of workers suddenly understands, in the heat of the moment, the sacrifice Terry made in challenging the mob. They respond as one and stand behind Terry. Two of the workers tell Terry that if he gets up and walks over to the warehouse, then they can get their legitimate business back and get rid of Johnny once and for all.In one of the most powerful endings I've seen, Terry is helped up and faces his final task. He staggers past all the workers, struggling to make it to the warehouse. Barely conscious, he summons all of his power to make it, proving his dedication to the community and his enduring will.The power of this film is its emphasis on tough choices, moral responsibility, and the unparalleled screen presence of Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy, a human in every sense of the word. Great supporting players added to the overall quality of the film, and Elia Kazan directs a superb motion picture. All in all, On the Waterfront has been a long time coming for me, but finally seeing it has made me appreciate a true classic and a deserving Oscar winner. This humanistic drama inspired me and made me remember my moral role in choosing between right and wrong. When a film leaves you with such a feeling, you know its one that you will always remember and cherish.",

I once owned the VHS. I own the DVD. I even own the soundtrack CD, one of the greatest of all time. Yet when I run into it on AMC or TCM, whether at the scene where Terry's explanation to Edie is drowned out by ship horns, or where he is sliding her glove onto his own hand, I find myself glued to the screen. Perhaps the best definition of an all-time favorite is one that grabs you whenever you happen to stumble upon it while channel surfing. This movie does that to me each and every time I encounter it. A masterpiece of American film making.",

            "content": "Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen. This movie contained one of the most memorable and emotional conversations between brothers (Charlie and Terry) ever captured on film. Steiger and Brando's 5 minutes or so of dialogue in the cab make the whole movie worth watching. Malden and Cobb were amazing as well. Throw in to the mix one of the most principled and talented of any director that lived (Kazan) and a story that could NEVER be told today (corrupt Unions, this is not politically correct), and you have an incredible movie. I have always considered James Stewart or Cary Grant to be the greatest actors of all time, but after watching On The Waterfront (for the first time) last night, Brando is my choice.To all the whining \"useful idiots\" (as Lenin would called Communist sympathizers in the west) who would say that Kazan was a \"fink\", I say Joseph McCarthy had it right. Communism was an evil that had to be squelched in this country, and thank God for men like Kazan who were willing to let us know who the enemies among us were.As for On The Waterfront, the movie really has no weaknesses except for the music. Not that the music was bad, it was quite good (Bernstein is a legend). The problem I have is that it is far too intrusive. This may be an older technique in movie making, but I can't say that it added anything. To the contrary, it seemed to rob Brando of some very powerful moments and distracting the viewer from Brando's presence. That's my take anyway.I HIGHLY recommend this film to everyone. If you like romance, this is your movie. If you like action, this is your movie. If you like drama, this is your movie. And if you like mob flicks (like I do), this is DEFINITELY your movie. I rate this a STRONG 9 of 10.",

            "content": "Acting used to be very dependant on the script and improvisation was unheard of, the characters were usually boring and mechanical. This all changed in 1954 when Marlon Brando made his break through role in Elia Kazan's classic movie On the Waterfront. A story of corruption, conscience and courage and one average Joe's struggle to do what is right and fight for the common man.Marlon Brando plays Terry Malloy, a working class dock worker who was once a boxer and now has a roughed up and worn out mind from all of the fights he's been in. His brother Charley is a local mobster that gives Terry some money on the side for helping out his boss Johnny Friendly's crime organization. Many problems arise, the first being that Terry was tricked into arranging his good friend's death. Terry also has a problem supporting a crime organization that keeps him and his fellow dockworkers on the bottom.Terry decides to do what his conscience tells him to do and resist the mob. He receives some help from the local street-smart priest Father Barry, whose gritty morality and brilliant sermons got actor Karl Malden nominated for an Oscar. This clash has bloody results and leads to a famous and courageous ending. Scenes like that and the world famous \"I could have been somebody\" car dialogue between Terry and Charlie propel this movie onto a new level and it's no wonder this movie swept the 1955 Academy Awards bringing home Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Picture, Best Writing and many nominations.The movie is now a highly regarded classic, still worshipped for it's realistic acting and brilliant dialogue. Not only is this movie on countless \"Top 10 lists\" and studied by movie buffs but it's also the movie that made Marlon Brando one of the most famous actors to ever live. This movie is one of the best and is highly recommended to any movie lover and film student.",
